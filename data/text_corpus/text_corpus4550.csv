introduction hydrokinetic renewable energy devices like for example tidal turbines and wave energy converters represent an emerging renewable energy technology while all relevant aspects of this type of technology have been increasingly investigated which is particularly the case for tidal turbines reed 2013 some important issues are still not that well resolved one of the major open questions is a simultaneous wave and sea current load on tidal turbines which is crucial for the structural safety of these complex engineering structures it was recently estimated ellabban et al 2014 that the implementation of the hydrokinetic devices will experience an exponential growth until the year 2030 and reach 18000 mw of the global installed power in such a way the share of the hydrokinetic devices in the global energy market will become substantial this trend is due to the fact that the water density is approximately 830 times larger than the air density which makes possible to generate the same amount of energy using considerably smaller underwater tidal turbines in comparison with the wind turbines situated in the lower atmosphere an absence of visual pollution and high predictability of the sea current make tidal turbines even more attractive to use on the other hand non uniform velocity profile across the rotor disc of tidal turbines an interaction between sea

approach based on the momentum theory of the ideal actuator disc faudot and duhlhaug 2011 the former approach originates in the field of the marine propeller analysis while the latter one is typical for wind turbines due to a relatively complex modelling the cfd is not that optimally suited for the fast load and response analysis during the initial design stage in this case a more robust and time efficient momentum theory is usually applied the blade element momentum theory bemt is a well matured mathematical model that was originally developed for the purposes of aerodynamic analysis of the rotating lifting profile manwell et al 2009 as the first order approximation tool the bemt is usually employed to calculate tidal turbine loads one of the first applications of the bemt to determine tidal turbine loads was presented in baltrop et al 2007 which model was verified using parametric studies and experimental data this study actually provided a first evidence about the applicability of the bemt on underwater tidal turbine rotors operating near the sea surface a wave current interaction modelling and power output performance assuming irregular waves and turbulence was performed in mccann et al 2008 milne et al 2011 a comparison of the bemt and cfd approaches was presented in faudot and dahlhaug 2011 while the effects of the added mass and hydroelastic response were emphasized in faudot and dahlhaug 2012 a formulation of the modified blade element momentum theory mbemt was developed in hadžić et al 2014b and verified using the experimental data of sæterstad 2011 this model takes into account non uniform sea current velocity profiles across the rotor disc of a tidal turbine an extensive set of data quantifying the unsteady blade rotor bending moment acquired using a scaled model of a tidal turbine was elaborated in milne et al 2015 this brief literature survey of sea current loads on tidal turbines provides a strong evidence about a suitability of the bemt approach for calculation of hydrodynamic sea current loads on tidal turbines another important load factor for tidal turbines are the waves on the sea surface the wave theories generally range from the conventional linear wave theory to the extreme cases like tsunami or wave object interaction sarkar et al 2015 wei et al 2015 2016 a particularly important issue is the wave current interaction singh et al 2018 simultaneous wave current loads on tidal turbines were presented in tatum et al 2016 where cfd model of a three bladed turbine was developed an important experimental study on combined oblique waves and sea current loads was reported by martinez et al 2018 where a small scale tidal turbine model was subjected to regular waves in directions non colinear with respect to the sea current significant load peaks due to the waves were emphasized in guo et al 2018 in previous studies the analysis of the wave and sea current loads on tidal turbines was for the most part performed in the time domain assuming the uniform profile of the sea current velocity with superimposed velocities of wave particles this approach yielded unsteady wave and sea current loads on tidal turbines that was commonly analyzed as the rotor thrust force and the rolling moment however this type of analysis is usually based on simultaneous blade and wave motion which may not reflect the realistic envelope of wave and sea current loads as the worst case scenario of incident waves and blade positions it is therefore the purpose of the present study to develop a more realistic computational model for the analysis of the simultaneous wave and sea current loads on tidal turbines the tidal turbine loads are generally the lift and drag forces due to the flow velocity hydrostatic loads due to the blade buoyancy as well as the inertial and added mass forces due to the acceleration of the fluid and the blades a developed computational framework assumes a constant blade rotation velocity it is therefore accordingly focused on the lift drag and hydrostatic forces only whereas the inertial and added mass forces were not taken into account while the inertial and added mass forces are certainly relevant they are considered to have less influence on the results of the present model than the other load components that were taken into account e g maniaci and li 2011 faudot and dahlhaug 2012 murray et al 2018 they indicate that the inertial and added mass effects increase thrust forces for only 2 5 or even less the dynamic force due to the deformation of the blade cross section was not considered because the turbine blades were assumed to be infinitely stiff however this remains an important topic for the future the standard bemt approach was modified by imposing the wave velocity field onto a realistic nonuniform sea current velocity profile this simple and robust model enables accurately calculating the wave and sea current loads on the tidal turbine the output parameters are the forces and the moments in all three characteristic directions 2 computational model 2 1 the modified blade element momentum theory the mbemt was previously developed for a tidal turbine in a sea current characterized by a non uniform velocity profile whereas the wave effects were omitted hadžić et al 2014b a brief outline of that previous mbemt model is presented here for brevity important novelties of the mbemt model developed for the purposes of the present study with respect to the previous model reported in hadžić et al 2014b are a new formulation of the sea current velocity profile definition of regular waves and an application of the taylor expansion that yields coupled harmonic like wave and sea current loads on tidal turbines the basic assumptions of the computational model are flow field around the lifting profile is in equilibrium blades do not experience deflections there are no pressure gradients span wise flow is negligible forces are two dimensional influence of vortices shed from the blade tips is accounted for using the prandtl tip loss function total excitation forces are summed up across the 2d blade elements in a span wise direction given those assumptions a series expansion was performed to express the velocity field in cylindrical coordinates across the rotor disc in a harmonic form that yields a differential thrust force d f n and differential torque d q which are summed up to obtain the blade thrust and torque moment the blade thrust force and torque moment represent hydrodynamic loads only 2 2 wave and sea current interaction wave and sea current interaction was modeled assuming a simple superposition of the regular wave linear theory and the sea current that is non uniformly distributed along the vertical axis of the water column fig 1 to evaluate the relative sea current velocity the inertial coordinate system was used its origin o is on the undisturbed sea surface and the coordinate axes are i j and k fig 1 the sea depth is denoted by h and the tidal turbine hub centre is positioned at the vertical coordinate z h the rotation axis of the turbine is defined as i so the angular speed vector is ω i the ζ is the unit vector in the longitudinal direction of a blade and for some rotation angle ϑ it is defined as 1 ζ sin ϑ j cos ϑ k the rotation angle was calculated as 2 ϑ ω t ϑ 0 where ϑ 0 is the initial value of the rotation angle and t is time the unit vector η is positioned orthogonally on the blade as well as on the axis of the turbine rotation i e it is orthogonal to the vector i and it is defined as 3 η cos ϑ j sin ϑ k the position of the point p on the observed blade can be defined relatively to the hub centre as r ζ where r is the radius of the observed point the position of the point p is defined by the vector p with respect to the origin o fig 1 as 4 p z h k r ζ or simply by coordinates 5 x p 0 y p r sin ϑ z p z h r cos ϑ 2 2 1 sea current the definition of the sea current velocity profile c without waves is commonly given in the cartesian coordinate system as a power law function 6 c z v h z h α where v is the surface velocity of a sea current and α is the coefficient usually set to 1 7 it is assumed that the sea current flows along the x axis main flow direction fig 1 to obtain a more convenient form of the sea current profile the taylor expansion was applied 7 c z v n 0 1 n d n d z h n 1 z h α z h h z h z h h n the above equation is solved using eq 4 to obtain the sea current velocity for a given point p on the turbine blade 8

the basis of the linearized potential flow theory in this case the velocity vector at some point in the fluid domain is usually decomposed into horizontal w x and vertical component w z i e 13 w x z t a ω e cosh k h cosh k h z cos ω e t 14 w z z t a ω e cosh k h sinh k h z sin ω e t where a is the wave amplitude k is the effective wave number and ω e is the effective wave frequency it is assumed that the wave develops along the x axis the wave current interaction is simplified so the total velocity of water particles is obtained as a sum of the velocity due to the wave and the velocity due to the sea current in this approach the only interaction between the wave and the sea current is in the definition of the effective wave frequency as 15 ω e ω k v where ω denotes the wave frequency the taylor expansion was performed to obtain a more practical form of the presented velocity components 16 cosh k h 1 z h n 0 1 n d n d z h n cosh k h 1 z h z h h z h z h h n and 17 sinh k h 1 z h n 0 1 n

coupled wave and sea current loads can be determined using the velocity field across the rotor disc obtained as a linear superposition of eqs 11 21 and 22 fig 2 while assuming there is no spanwise flow 24 v x r ϑ t c r ϑ w x r ϑ t 1 a v z r ϑ t r ω w z r ϑ t sin ϑ 1 a where a and a are axial and angular induction factors respectively and ω is turbine blade angular speed relative flow angle φ can be determined using a ratio between the velocity components i e 25 φ r ϑ t arctan v x r ϑ t v z r ϑ t which according to fig 2 gives the relative velocity field as 26 u rel r ϑ t v x r ϑ t sin φ r ϑ t and the angle of attack as 27 α r ϑ t φ r ϑ t ψ where ψ is the twist angle differential hydrodynamic forces i e differential thrust d f n and differential torque d q acting on a turbine blade section can be determined as 28 d f n 1 2 ρ u rel r ϑ t 2 c l ϑ cos φ r ϑ t c d ϑ sin φ r ϑ t c d r d q 1 2 ρ u rel r ϑ t 2 c l ϑ sin φ r ϑ t c d ϑ cos φ r ϑ t c r d r where c l ϑ and c d ϑ are the lift and drag force coefficients respectively determined based on the flow incidence angle for each on the considered turbine blade sections c is the chord length a sum of the differential thrust and torque moments along the turbine blades yields the total blade level hydrodynamic load including an interaction of the waves and the sea current the rest of the procedure follows a standard algorithm that includes the analysis of the hydrostatic and centrifugal forces as well as a superposition of blade level harmonics using a phase angle equal to 2 π b where b is the number of blades 3 test case in order to validate a developed approach and to evaluate the load properties taking into account the sea current and wave interaction 1 mw horizontal axis tidal turbine was considered the main properties of the studied tidal turbine are presented in table 1 together with the blade layout in order to evaluate the element level thrust and torque each blade is divided into 100 elements loss of lift due to 3d effect near the blade tip and root were calculated using the prandtl tip loss function while the axial and angular induction factors a and a were determined iteratively using the local solidity ratio the obtained results were compared with previous relevant studies i e sæterstad 2011 faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the analysis was performed using the in house fortran based program tiden tidal energy in the time domain with step of 0 1 s by considering three different incident waves of periods 5 7 and 10 s with common steepness of 0 05 starting with the wave crest in accordance with faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the wave period t wave length λ wave amplitude a effective frequency ω e frequency of encounter effective wave number k and effective wave period are presented in table 2 the effective frequency frequency of encounter takes the wave sea current interaction into account so that in reality a fixed body is subjected to larger or smaller wave frequency depending on the direction of the wave propagation as well as the sea current faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the turbine rotor was rotated for 360 in each time step to evaluate all possible scenarios of the incident wave and the turbine blade position the maximum turbine load was a periodic function with the period equal to the wave effective period obtained as a ratio 2 π ω e therefore an evaluation of one wave effective period is considered sufficient to obtain the load envelope the obtained envelopes of the turbine load for three considered waves are presented in figs 3 5 for the axial force rolling moment pitch moment and yaw moment transversal force is equal to zero as the flow field is considered to be along the x axis while the total force in the vertical direction is constant and equal to the turbine rotor buoyancy of 36 41 kn the obtained maximum load values are presented in table 3 and compared to the case with the sea current only while the loading values worst case scenario in each time instant of the wave effective period are presented in figs 3 5 it can be noticed that due to periodic nature of the wave orbital velocity the overall wave loading effect during one effective period is small however its instant values are considerable particularly in cases of waves characterized by larger amplitudes the tidal turbine load was observed to increase due to the waves oriented perpendicularly to the turbine rotor the peak load increases with increasing the wave period particularly in case of the pitch and yaw moments experiencing the most significant increment due to differences in the velocity field at the top and the bottom of the rotor disk this difference is induced by the wave presence as a deviation of the steady state sea current velocity profile however some discrepancies between the present work and the approach of faudot and duhlhaug 2012 may be noticed in particular the results presented in faudot and duhlhaug 2012 were generated using the bemt model formulation from sæterstad 2011 while omitting the axial and angular induction factors determination using an iterative procedure based on the local solidity ratio on the other hand the results in the present study do not take into account blade section interpolations because such data is currently not available in addition the load analysis performed by faudot and duhlhaug 2012 is sensitive to the starting position of the blades and its orientation with respect to the incident wave those load conditions do not represent the worst possible scenario approach as they are influenced by the blade starting position with respect to the wave crest a comparison of the load envelopes figs 3 5 reveals that the loading amplitudes become more pronounced as the wave period increases the axial force and the yaw moment achieve peak values in the first half of the wave effective period the largest value of the rolling moment is obtained at the beginning and at the end of the period while the pitch moment curve indicates symmetry with respect to the one half of the effective wave period the loading envelopes presented in figs 3 5 demonstrate a complex interaction between the sea current propagating waves and rotating turbine blades influenced mainly by the constantly changing flow incidence angle and consequently the lift and drag force coefficients eq 24 in particular the vertical component of the wave particle velocity w z is a periodic function from perspective of the wave propagation as well as from perspective of the blade rotation therefore at some instants it is directed along the turbine blade while in another time step it is perpendicular to it a more detailed insight into tidal turbine load phenomena is provided in figs 6 11 where the relative velocity field u rel r ϑ differential thrust force d f n r ϑ differential torque d q r ϑ polar plots are presented for the longest wave t 10 s in time points corresponding to the largest realized rolling moment and the thrust force i e in time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s a comparison of figs 6 and 9 with the relative velocity field obtained in the case where only the sea current is present indicates that the relative velocity field is dominated by the velocity due to the rotation of the rotor blades with almost negligible influence of the waves this can be observed as a slight asymmetry in the time instant of 2 8 s fig 9 the maximum velocities of 17 1 m s and 17 7 m s are observed in the time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s while the maximum velocity of 16 9 m s is observed when there was only sea current without the waves a comparison of the elemental thrust distributions in the considered time instants figs 7 and 10 demonstrates that the initial symmetrical elemental thrust distribution changes to slightly asymmetrical thus yielding an increment in the pitch and yaw moments the obtained peak elemental thrust values in the time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s are 8 3 kn and 8 9 kn respectively in comparison with the peak value of 8 2 kn that was obtained with only the current present without the waves an effect of the tip loss function on the elemental thrust force can be noticed in a form of a ring like pattern of the smaller thrust an asymmetrical distribution of the elemental torque value becomes almost a symmetric distribution in the time instant of 2 8 s the obtained peak torque values of 13 2 knm and 5 5 knm in the time instant of 0 s and 2 8 s are compared to the current only peak value of 7 6 knm the obtained elemental torque values are bounded by the ring like pattern of lower torque values due to the tip loss function the asymmetry effects related to the elemental thrust and torque forces clearly demonstrate a complex nature of interaction between rotating blades sea current and wave loads possible combinations of the sea current velocity field with the wave velocity at a given water column depth are strongly influenced by the wave properties and the time instant of the wave propagation an additional asymmetry is due to the superposition of the blade rotation velocity with the transversal component of the wave velocity vector this pattern generally depends on the vector magnitude and direction that varied between the colinear and perpendicular direction and depends on the rotation angle major complex load effects are exhibited as the pitch and yaw moments of larger amplitudes from a design point of view it is important to investigate an influence of the hub height and blade number and their influence on the tidal turbine load envelope therefore the analysis of the forces and moments acting on a tidal turbine was performed for the hub heights of 15 m 17 5 m and 20 m including the turbine rotor with two and three blades placed within the flow fields composed of the sea current and the waves the obtained results for the peak load values are presented in table 4 if the shortest wave wave 1 is considered it can be asserted that an increase in the hub height tidal turbine situated closer to the sea surface enhances the power output of the tidal turbine as more kinetic energy is being harvested i e the kinetic energy is simultaneously extracted both from the sea current and the waves at the same time the maximum pitch and yaw moments of the tidal turbine slightly decrease the same trend was observed for the tidal turbine with two and three blades however the axial force increased substantially in comparison with the turbine equipped with two blades significant effects of the wave velocity water column penetration can be noticed for longer waves wave 2 and wave 3 in particular an increase in the rolling moment is accompanied by a substantial increase in the pitch and yaw moments such an effect can be noticed for both the two bladed and the three bladed rotor 4 conclusions the analysis of simultaneous wave and sea current loads on horizontal axis tidal turbines was performed using the modified blade element momentum theory mbemt the major novelties of this approach are the wave current interaction definition in the cylindrical coordinate system at the free surface and application of the taylor expansion yielding coupled harmonic like waves and sea current loads the tidal turbine loads were analyzed using the standard 1 mw horizontal axis tidal turbine with two and three blades this was performed in the time domain by considering three different waves the obtained results were presented in the form of the turbine load envelope representing the worst case scenario another insight into the tidal turbine load phenomena was presented using the relative velocity elemental thrust and elemental torque polar plots this procedure successfully captured an interaction between the non uniform sea current velocity profile and the incident waves thus yielding a realistic load envelope for tidal turbines while an increase in the hub height i e when the tidal turbine is situated closer to the sea surface enhances the power output of the tidal turbine the maximum pitch and yaw moments of the tidal turbine slightly decrease at the same time the axial force increases substantially the same trend was observed for the tidal turbine with two and three blades further work would need to address other physical phenomena that commonly appear in nature e g wave loads for various wave incident angles sea current

turbine the output parameters are the forces and the moments in all three characteristic directions 2 computational model 2 1 the modified blade element momentum theory the mbemt was previously developed for a tidal turbine in a sea current characterized by a non uniform velocity profile whereas the wave effects were omitted hadžić et al 2014b a brief outline of that previous mbemt model is presented here for brevity important novelties of the mbemt model developed for the purposes of the present study with respect to the previous model reported in hadžić et al 2014b are a new formulation of the sea current velocity profile definition of regular waves and an application of the taylor expansion that yields coupled harmonic like wave and sea current loads on tidal turbines the basic assumptions of the computational model are flow field around the lifting profile is in equilibrium blades do not experience deflections there are no pressure gradients span wise flow is negligible forces are two dimensional influence of vortices shed from the blade tips is accounted for using the prandtl tip loss function total excitation forces are summed up across the 2d blade elements in a span wise direction given those assumptions a series expansion was performed to express the velocity field in cylindrical coordinates across the rotor disc in a harmonic form that yields a differential thrust force d f n and differential torque d q which are summed up to obtain the blade thrust and torque moment the blade thrust force and torque moment represent hydrodynamic loads only 2 2 wave and sea current interaction wave and sea current interaction was modeled assuming a simple superposition of the regular wave linear theory and the sea current that is non uniformly distributed along the vertical axis of the water column fig 1 to evaluate the relative sea current velocity the inertial coordinate system was used its origin o is on the undisturbed sea surface and the coordinate axes are i j and k fig 1 the sea depth is denoted by h and the tidal turbine hub centre is positioned at the vertical coordinate z h the rotation axis of the turbine is defined as i so the angular speed vector is ω i the ζ is the unit vector in the longitudinal direction of a blade and for some rotation angle ϑ it is defined as 1 ζ sin ϑ j cos ϑ k the rotation angle was calculated as 2 ϑ ω t ϑ 0 where ϑ 0 is the initial value of the rotation angle and t is time the unit vector η is positioned orthogonally on the blade as well as on the axis of the turbine rotation i e it is orthogonal to the vector i and it is defined as 3 η cos ϑ j sin ϑ k the position of the point p on the observed blade can be defined relatively to the hub centre as r ζ where r is the radius of the observed point the position of the point p is defined by the vector p with respect to the origin o fig 1 as 4 p z h k r ζ or simply by coordinates 5 x p 0 y p r sin ϑ z p z h r cos ϑ 2 2 1 sea current the definition of the sea current velocity profile c without waves is commonly given in the cartesian coordinate system as a power law function 6 c z v h z h α where v is the surface velocity of a sea current and α is the coefficient usually set to 1 7 it is assumed that the sea current flows along the x axis main flow direction fig 1 to obtain a more convenient form of the sea current profile the taylor expansion was applied 7 c z v n 0 1 n d n d z h n 1 z h α z h h z h z h h n the above equation is solved using eq 4 to obtain the sea current velocity for a given point p on the turbine blade 8 c r ϑ n 0 a n r h cos ϑ n with substitution 9 a n v n 1 z h h α n m 0 n 1 α m by applying a set of standard trigonometric identities 10 cos n ϑ 2 2 n m 0 n 1 2 n m cos n 2 m ϑ for odd n cos n ϑ 1 2 n

the basis of the linearized potential flow theory in this case the velocity vector at some point in the fluid domain is usually decomposed into horizontal w x and vertical component w z i e 13 w x z t a ω e cosh k h cosh k h z cos ω e t 14 w z z t a ω e cosh k h sinh k h z sin ω e t where a is the wave amplitude k is the effective wave number and ω e is the effective wave frequency it is assumed that the wave develops along the x axis the wave current interaction is simplified so the total velocity of water particles is obtained as a sum of the velocity due to the wave and the velocity due to the sea current in this approach the only interaction between the wave and the sea current is in the definition of the effective wave frequency as 15 ω e ω k v where ω denotes the wave frequency the taylor expansion was performed to obtain a more practical form of the presented velocity components 16 cosh k h 1 z h n 0 1 n d n d z h n cosh k h 1 z h z h h z h z h h n and 17 sinh k h 1 z h n 0 1 n

coupled wave and sea current loads can be determined using the velocity field across the rotor disc obtained as a linear superposition of eqs 11 21 and 22 fig 2 while assuming there is no spanwise flow 24 v x r ϑ t c r ϑ w x r ϑ t 1 a v z r ϑ t r ω w z r ϑ t sin ϑ 1 a where a and a are axial and angular induction factors respectively and ω is turbine blade angular speed relative flow angle φ can be determined using a ratio between the velocity components i e 25 φ r ϑ t arctan v x r ϑ t v z r ϑ t which according to fig 2 gives the relative velocity field as 26 u rel r ϑ t v x r ϑ t sin φ r ϑ t and the angle of attack as 27 α r ϑ t φ r ϑ t ψ where ψ is the twist angle differential hydrodynamic forces i e differential thrust d f n and differential torque d q acting on a turbine blade section can be determined as 28 d f n 1 2 ρ u rel r ϑ t 2 c l ϑ cos φ r ϑ t c d ϑ sin φ r ϑ t c d r d q 1 2 ρ u rel r ϑ t 2 c l ϑ sin φ r ϑ t c d ϑ cos φ r ϑ t c r d r where c l ϑ and c d ϑ are the lift and drag force coefficients respectively determined based on the flow incidence angle for each on the considered turbine blade sections c is the chord length a sum of the differential thrust and torque moments along the turbine blades yields the total blade level hydrodynamic load including an interaction of the waves and the sea current the rest of the procedure follows a standard algorithm that includes the analysis of the hydrostatic and centrifugal forces as well as a superposition of blade level harmonics using a phase angle equal to 2 π b where b is the number of blades 3 test case in order to validate a developed approach and to evaluate the load properties taking into account the sea current and wave interaction 1 mw horizontal axis tidal turbine was considered the main properties of the studied tidal turbine are presented in table 1 together with the blade layout in order to evaluate the element level thrust and torque each blade is divided into 100 elements loss of lift due to 3d effect near the blade tip and root were calculated using the prandtl tip loss function while the axial and angular induction factors a and a were determined iteratively using the local solidity ratio the obtained results were compared with previous relevant studies i e sæterstad 2011 faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the analysis was performed using the in house fortran based program tiden tidal energy in the time domain with step of 0 1 s by considering three different incident waves of periods 5 7 and 10 s with common steepness of 0 05 starting with the wave crest in accordance with faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the wave period t wave length λ wave amplitude a effective frequency ω e frequency of encounter effective wave number k and effective wave period are presented in table 2 the effective frequency frequency of encounter takes the wave sea current interaction into account so that in reality a fixed body is subjected to larger or smaller wave frequency depending on the direction of the wave propagation as well as the sea current faudot and duhlhaug 2012 the turbine rotor was rotated for 360 in each time step to evaluate all possible scenarios of the incident wave and the turbine blade position the maximum turbine load was a periodic function with the period equal to the wave effective period obtained as a ratio 2 π ω e therefore an evaluation of one wave effective period is considered sufficient to obtain the load envelope the obtained envelopes of the turbine load for three considered waves are presented in figs 3 5 for the axial force rolling moment pitch moment and yaw moment transversal force is equal to zero as the flow field is considered to be along the x axis while the total force in the vertical direction is constant and equal to the turbine rotor buoyancy of 36 41 kn the obtained maximum load values are presented in table 3 and compared to the case with the sea current only while the loading values worst case scenario in each time instant of the wave effective period are presented in figs 3 5 it can be noticed that due to periodic nature of the wave orbital velocity the overall wave loading effect during one effective period is small however its instant values are considerable particularly in cases of waves characterized by larger amplitudes the tidal turbine load was observed to increase due to the waves oriented perpendicularly to the turbine rotor the peak load increases with increasing the wave period particularly in case of the pitch and yaw moments experiencing the most significant increment due to differences in the velocity field at the top and the bottom of the rotor disk this difference is induced by the wave presence as a deviation of the steady state sea current velocity profile however some discrepancies between the present work and the approach of faudot and duhlhaug 2012 may be noticed in particular the results presented in faudot and duhlhaug 2012 were generated using the bemt model formulation from sæterstad 2011 while omitting the axial and angular induction factors determination using an iterative procedure based on the local solidity ratio on the other hand the results in the present study do not take into account blade section interpolations because such data is currently not available in addition the load analysis performed by faudot and duhlhaug 2012 is sensitive to the starting position of the blades and its orientation with respect to the incident wave those load conditions do not represent the worst possible scenario approach as they are influenced by the blade starting position with respect to the wave crest a comparison of the load envelopes figs 3 5 reveals that the loading amplitudes become more pronounced as the wave period increases the axial force and the yaw moment achieve peak values in the first half of the wave effective period the largest value of the rolling moment is obtained at the beginning and at the end of the period while the pitch moment curve indicates symmetry with respect to the one half of the effective wave period the loading envelopes presented in figs 3 5 demonstrate a complex interaction between the sea current propagating waves and rotating turbine blades influenced mainly by the constantly changing flow incidence angle and consequently the lift and drag force coefficients eq 24 in particular the vertical component of the wave particle velocity w z is a periodic function from perspective of the wave propagation as well as from perspective of the blade rotation therefore at some instants it is directed along the turbine blade while in another time step it is perpendicular to it a more detailed insight into tidal turbine load phenomena is provided in figs 6 11 where the relative velocity field u rel r ϑ differential thrust force d f n r ϑ differential torque d q r ϑ polar plots are presented for the longest wave t 10 s in time points corresponding to the largest realized rolling moment and the thrust force i e in time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s a comparison of figs 6 and 9 with the relative velocity field obtained in the case where only the sea current is present indicates that the relative velocity field is dominated by the velocity due to the rotation of the rotor blades with almost negligible influence of the waves this can be observed as a slight asymmetry in the time instant of 2 8 s fig 9 the maximum velocities of 17 1 m s and 17 7 m s are observed in the time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s while the maximum velocity of 16 9 m s is observed when there was only sea current without the waves a comparison of the elemental thrust distributions in the considered time instants figs 7 and 10 demonstrates that the initial symmetrical elemental thrust distribution changes to slightly asymmetrical thus yielding an increment in the pitch and yaw moments the obtained peak elemental thrust values in the time instants of 0 s and 2 8 s are 8 3 kn and 8 9 kn respectively in comparison with the peak value of 8 2 kn that was obtained with only the current present without the waves an effect of the tip loss function on the elemental thrust force can be noticed in a form of a ring like pattern of the smaller thrust an asymmetrical distribution of the elemental torque value becomes almost a symmetric distribution in the time instant of 2 8 s the obtained peak torque values of 13 2 knm and 5 5 knm in the time instant of 0 s and 2 8 s are compared to the current only peak value of 7 6 knm the obtained elemental torque values are bounded by the ring like pattern of lower torque values due to the tip loss function the asymmetry effects related to the elemental thrust and torque forces clearly demonstrate a complex nature of interaction between rotating blades sea current and wave loads possible combinations of the sea current velocity field with the wave velocity at a given water column depth are strongly influenced by the wave properties and the time instant of the wave propagation an additional asymmetry is due to the superposition of the blade rotation velocity with the transversal component of the wave velocity vector this pattern generally depends on the vector magnitude and direction that varied between the colinear and perpendicular direction and depends on the rotation angle major complex load effects are exhibited as the pitch and yaw moments of larger amplitudes from a design point of view it is important to investigate an influence of the hub height and blade number and their influence on the tidal turbine load envelope therefore the analysis of the forces and moments acting on a tidal turbine was performed for the hub heights of 15 m 17 5 m and 20 m including the turbine rotor with two and three blades placed within the flow fields composed of the sea current and the waves the obtained results for the peak load values are presented in table 4 if the shortest wave wave 1 is considered it can be asserted that an increase in the hub height tidal turbine situated closer to the sea surface enhances the power output of the tidal turbine as more kinetic energy is being harvested i e the kinetic energy is simultaneously extracted both from the sea current and the waves at the same time the maximum pitch and yaw moments of the tidal turbine slightly decrease the same trend was observed for the tidal turbine with two and three blades however the axial force increased substantially in comparison with the turbine equipped with two blades significant effects of the wave velocity water column penetration can be noticed for longer waves wave 2 and wave 3 in particular an increase in the rolling moment is accompanied by a substantial increase in the pitch and yaw moments such an effect can be noticed for both the two bladed and the three bladed rotor 4 conclusions the analysis of simultaneous wave and sea current loads on horizontal axis tidal turbines was performed using the modified blade element momentum theory mbemt the major novelties of this approach are the wave current interaction definition in the cylindrical coordinate system at the free surface and application of the taylor expansion yielding coupled harmonic like waves and sea current loads the tidal turbine loads were analyzed using the standard 1 mw horizontal axis tidal turbine with two and three blades this was performed in the time domain by considering three different waves the obtained results were presented in the form of the turbine load envelope representing the worst case scenario another insight into the tidal turbine load phenomena was presented using the relative velocity elemental thrust and elemental torque polar plots this procedure successfully captured an interaction between the non uniform sea current velocity profile and the incident waves thus yielding a realistic load envelope for tidal turbines while an increase in the hub height i e when the tidal turbine is situated closer to the sea surface enhances the power output of the tidal turbine the maximum pitch and yaw moments of the tidal turbine slightly decrease at the same time the axial force increases substantially the same trend was observed for the tidal turbine with two and three blades further work would need to address other physical phenomena that commonly appear in nature e g wave loads for various wave incident angles sea current

torque of ships in wind and waves are crucial to understand the dynamics of a propeller and an engine that affects ship performance interactively in actual seas the propeller torque variation appears in two ways one is in its mean or the low frequency component the other is in the fluctuating or high frequency component the wave drift forces wind forces and the manoeuvring motion are the source of the low frequency variation the orbital motion of water particles due to waves the oscillatory ship motion in waves and their interaction induce the variation in high frequency that might affect the low frequency variation as well researches based on the full scale measurement such as by ogawara et al 1981 are informative to clarify the dynamics of propeller torque and engine torque however full scale measurements cannot avoid their interaction effects and often include unexpected environmental noises the numerical simulation could be an alternative taskar et al 2016 clarified how the propulsion performance decreased in waves by numerical simulations considering both wake variation and engine response in waves yum et al 2017 presented a mathematical model of a marine diesel engine and validated its response including transient performance under various wave conditions nakamura et al 1975 proposed an approximation formula to estimate the orbital motion of water particles due to waves at the propeller position of a container ship in head waves ueno et al 2013b extended it geometrically to that in oblique waves the applicability of the formula to various hull forms and wave directions however are not sufficient because of scarce experimental data this is one of remaining problems to be solved to make numerical simulations estimating the fluctuating full scale propeller torque more reliable model tests on the other hand are effective to investigate physically characteristics of fluctuating propeller torque in waves yamanouchi and ando 1966 and yoshino et al 1974 carried out free running model tests in waves and reported mean and fluctuating components of propeller torque sluijs 1972 carried out captive model tests in head and following waves and scaled up the measured fluctuating propeller torque in accordance with the froude s law of similarity nakamura et al 1975 carried out captive model tests and discussed the effect of the effective inflow velocity to propeller on the propeller torque these model tests data clarified the properties of model scale propeller torque fluctuating in waves however researches on scale effects on the propeller torque in waves are quite limited since the propeller torque depends on ship motion in waves the ship motion of a model must be similar to that of a full scale ship even in free running model tests tsukada et al 2013 2014 developed a duct fan auxiliary thruster dfat that can make it possible to control a propeller rate of revolution of a model independently of ship speed kitagawa et al 2015 carried out free running tests in head waves in which the model ran at a full scale self propulsion point fspp and took into consideration the scale effect only on the mean component of measured propeller torque but not on the fluctuating component ueno and tsukada 2015 proposed a method rudder effectiveness and speed correction rsc to make motion of a free running model similar to that of a full scale ship using dfat the rsc controls depending on time varying ship speed of a model the auxiliary thrust of dfat and the model propeller rate of revolution the resultant rate is neither at a model self propulsion point mspp nor at a fspp ueno and tsukada 2016 proposed a method to estimate full scale propeller torque and thrust including the low frequency and high frequency components using data of a free running model test making use of the rsc they presented a trial application of the proposed method to existing test data of a container ship model in head waves and discussed the differences of fluctuating propeller torque and thrust between the model and the full scale ship since the test data was of the model without the dfat it supposed a hypothetical head wind of which force canceled out hypothetical dfat force controlled by the rsc this paper presents free running model test data of a tanker equipped with the dfat running in head bow and quartering wind and waves application examples of the method to estimate full scale propeller torque and numerical simulations the contents cover the theoretical background of the method the model control procedure and the numerical method and data with discussion whereas limited test data were reported by ueno et al 2018a 2018b the waves are long crested and irregular while the wind is simulated by the wind loads simulator wils tsukada et al 2017 2018 the wils equipped on a model makes free running tests in wind possible not by generating environmental wind but by exerting equivalent wind forces controlled using time varying data of ship motion the test employed three model controls the model with no correction nc or running at mspp without dfat that with the skin friction correction sfc or running at fspp using dfat and that with rsc using dfat their comparison clarified the differences of ship motion and propeller torque of the model the numerical simulation confirmed that the rsc ensured the similarity of manoeuvring motion which should lead to the similar ship situations relative to wind and waves and therefore to the similar six degree of freedom 6dof oscillating motion these similarities should ensure the similarity of the model propeller situation relative to wind and waves the method estimated the full scale propeller torque using the data of the model with rsc which revealed how the mean values and the significant values of fluctuating components appear differently between the model and the full scale ship 2 outline of the estimation method in this paper prime stands for non dimensional values

a variable represents its low frequency component and that followed by δ represents its high frequency component in this section asterisk represents either m or s while variables without neither m nor s are assumed to have no scale effect 2 1 model control for the similarity of ship motion researchers and engineers on naval architecture usually apply the froude s law of similarity to ship speed however the difference of reynolds number r n between models and full scale ships at an identical froude number f n does not allow the ordinary free running model tests to hold the similarity of wake flow and of propeller rate of revolution these dissimilarities lead to the dissimilarities of rudder force and therefore the dissimilarities of manoeuvring motion this is the reason why the researchers have challenged to ensure the similarity of manoeuvring motion oltmann et al 1980 developed a computerized carriage to provide a model with the auxiliary thrust kobayashi et al 2000 developed an air jet type auxiliary thruster and son et al 2010 developed another computerized carriage to provide models with the auxiliary thrust both for making a free running model run at fspp however ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno et al 2017b revealed that neither mspp nor fspp but rsc can compensate for the scale effect on manoeuvring motion the rsc controls both the auxiliary thrust and the model propeller rate of revolution to ensure the similarity of rudder force and the similarity of longitudinal force acting on a ship the similarity of the longitudinal component of effective inflow velocity to rudder u r approximates the similarity of the rudder force between a model and a full scale ship the basic simultaneous equations for the rsc are as follows ueno and tsukada 2015 2 u r m u r s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s 1 t is the thrust deduction coefficient and t is the propeller thrust t sfc represents the force required for the sfc f ta is the auxiliary thrust factor that defines the auxiliary thrust t a for a model by the following equation 3 t a f t a t sfc a modular mathematical model kose et al 1981 calculates u r as follows 4 u r ε 1 w u η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1

the similarity of rudder force approximated by the first equation in eq 2 leads to the similarity of sway and yaw motion the second equation in eq 2 represents the equality of the right hand side or the external forces of the equation of longitudinal motion or u equation 2 is as the result the simultaneous equations for the similarity of manoeuvring motion ueno and tsukada 2015 ueno et al 2017b the given parameter is a full scale propeller rate of revolution n s and u while the unknows are the model control parameters n m and f ta n s could be a constant or vary arbitrarily in time as determined by for example an engine model ueno and tsukada 2016 on the other hand u follows the instantaneous model speed measured in free running tests u in free running model tests in waves consists in general of the low frequency and the high frequency components as follows 8 u u δ 1 2 u although δu should induce δn m and δf ta the authors use only u for the rsc to solve eq 1 the resultant control parameters n m and f ta have only the low frequency component respectively as follows 9 n m n m 10 f t a f t a one of the reasons why the rsc employs only u is the assumption that the effects of δn m and δf ta on u of a model are negligible this assumption is partly supported by the free running model test that simulated an engine response or δn m showing no significant effect on u kitagawa et al 2012 the other reason is to avoid the effect of δn m on the torque identity method mentioned in the following subsection to identify the effective inflow velocity to propeller u p in waves ueno and tsukada 2016 the rsc can incorporate the continuous operational limit of engine in which no fluctuation of engine response is considered suzuki et al 2019 researches on the engine dynamics affecting δn yum et al 2017 and on the methodology to simulate fluctuating engine response in model tests kitagawa et al 2015 however are crucial for further understandings of ship dynamics in waves 2 2 estimation of full scale propeller torque applying the torque identity method to test data in waves as in ueno et al 2013b the torque coefficient of a model propeller k qm and the measured model propeller torque q m tell j m using the following relation 11 q m k q m j m n m 2 d 5 j m tells the effective inflow velocity to model propeller u pm by the following equation 12 u p m

1 w 0 is the wake coefficient in calm water that should have the scale effect affecting both low frequency and high frequency components u w0 stands for the velocity originated in the orbital motion of water particles due to waves the authors assume no scale effect on u w0 u w 0 in u p appears in quartering and following waves of which encounter frequency is zero ueno et al 2013b modification of eq 13 leads to the following expression 14 u p 1 w 0 u w 0 u u δ u δ u w 0 u w 0 u δ u 1 w u δ u δ u w equation 14 adopts the definitions of 1 w and δu w as follows 15 1 w 1 w 0 u w 0 u 16 δ u w δ u w

free running model test data tell 1 w m by the following equation 17 1 w m u p m u the following equation therefore estimates δu w using free running model speed data u and the analyzed u pm and 1 w m

propeller system n s that represents the time derivative of n s allows to take into account of an arbitrarily variation of n s 3 model test program the free running model tests were of course keeping manoeuvres in wind and long crested irregular waves the model conditions are three nc sfc and rsc as noted in the introduction the tests suppose the full scale ship having the constant n s with which the ship runs in calm water at the designated ship speed v 0 or u 0 15 5kn in full scale 3 1 scale model the subject ship is the tanker kvlcc1 stern and agdrup 2008 fig 1 shows the body plan and the bow and stern profiles the principal particulars are in table 1 the hull form of kvlcc1 is open publicly and abundant model test data are available yoshimura et al 2008 suzuki et al 2019 though there is no full scale ship hydrodynamic coefficients on the resistance and propulsion are in table 2 tank tests by suzuki et al 2015 are the basis of the values of form factor 1 k wake coefficient 1 w and

is a function of r n saunders et al 1957 and δc f is a function of ship length ittc 1978 1 w k q and k t of the full scale ship are estimated in accordance with the ittc procedures ittc 1978 using the corresponding model scale values obtained by the tank tests l oa a f and a l in table 1 are the length overall the longitudinal projected area and the lateral projected area respectively of the above water structure the regression formula proposed by kitamura et al 2017 estimated the eight above water structural parameters including a f a l and l oa required for the empirical formula of fujiwara et al 2005 for estimating the wind loads coefficients solving eq 2 using the values in table 2 tells n m and f ta for rsc the second equation in eq 2 with f ta equal to 1 by its definition tells n m for sfc n m for nc is the constant mspp with f ta equal to 0 the free running model however does not necessarily attain a theoretical speed in the tank test with the solutions due to reasons including the change of model surface condition caused by aging the authors in such cases attenuated n m for attaining u 0 in calm water by applying the difference between theoretical and experimental n m as constants to the entire range of u u 0 the constants made the experimental n m of nc sfc and rsc larger than the theoretical values by 0 15 0 0 and 0 24 respectively fig 3 shows the resultant control parameters n m and f ta for nc sfc rsc and n s for comparison 3 2 test facilities the model test was at the actual sea model basin asmb tanizawa et al 2010 ueno et al 2013a in the national maritime research institute japan the basin dimensions are 80 m long 40 m wide and 4 5 m deep the carriage system tracked the free running model for measuring its position heading and speed in the horizontal plane a fiber optical gyro measured the oscillatory motion in 6dof a dynamometer between a driving motor and the propeller shaft measured the fluctuating propeller torque in waves the wave generator of asmb consisting of 382 flaps surrounding whole periphery of the basin generated long crested irregular waves the wave generator absorbs incoming waves including those reflected on and radiated from ship models during wave generation using data obtained by wave gauges placed in front of each flap which allows long time wave generation ota et al 2018 it is impossible in general to generate uniform wind field over a model basin for free running model tests the authors therefore used the wind loads simulator wils tsukada et al 2017 2018 in the test the wils makes it possible without generating environmental wind to realize wind effects on a model by exerting forces equivalent to wind loads using six duct fans mounted on the model the wils controls the fans forces using the measured ship motion data the supposed true wind speed and direction and wind loads coefficients estimated beforehand to calculate wind loads the generated wind loads therefore depend on instantaneous apparent wind speed and direction of a model although the control is for the longitudinal and lateral forces and yaw moment it also simulates the heel moment by the lateral forces of duct fans placed at a designated height the height for the subject ship divided by a l l oa is 1 730 tsukada et al 2017 the wind loads coefficients of the subject ship are shown in the later section fig 4 shows a photograph of the model in the testing two black circles drawn on the deck are the targets for the carriage system to track the model using a camera six duct fans for the wils are same type as the dfat one of the duct fans for longitudinal force at stern works also as the dfat for the rsc four load cells placed under the duct fans measures fore longitudinal aft longitudinal fore lateral and aft lateral forces generated by the duct fans respectively for the wils control the measured forces include not only the fan forces but also inertia forces of the mass on the load cells due to the oscillating ship motion the feedback control compensated the inertial forces which is important for tests in waves because the inertial forces could be larger than the wind forces to be generated tsukada et al 2017 2018 ueno et al 2013a presented data showing the high repeatability of a free running model test in waves and miyazaki et al 2013 reported the uncertainty analysis of a free running

beaufort scale 9 the spectrum type of the waves is of the international ship structure congress issc 1964 the significant wave height h 1 3 and the modal wave period t 01 were 7 0 m and 10 2s in full scale respectively which also correspond to beaufort scale 9 fig 6 compares the intended wave power spectrum with the measured power spectrum of which measurement duration was 180 s at a fixed point in the basin without the ship model table 3 showing the intended and measured values for h 1 3 and t 01 confirms that the wave generator successfully realized the intended wave field the designated wind and waves directions relative to the model χ d were 0 head wind and waves 60 bow wind and waves and 120 quartering wind and waves a proportional differential controller of the auto steering determined δ to direct the model heading to χ d the proportional gain k p was 2 0 the differential gain was 0 5s in model scale the following equation relates δ χ d and a measured or resultant encounter angle to wind and waves χ in steady equilibrium conditions 22 δ k p χ χ d the proportional gain should affect the ship motion mainly by affecting χ of which difference leads to differences in high frequency ship motion however ship responses represented not by a measured point but by functions of χ should not be affected the differential gain could affect high frequency ship motion directly because it affects damping forces of roll sway and yaw considering the ship inertia roll should be more vulnerable than sway and yaw 4 numerical simulation method the numerical simulation estimates the steady equilibrium conditions of the model with nc sfc and rsc in wind and waves for comparison with the tank test data the numerical simulation also estimates the full scale ship equilibrium conditions to compare with those of the model 4 1 mathematical model equations for the steady equilibrium condition for surge sway and yaw are as follows according to the modular

the givens for eqs 23 and 24 are n s and χ d n s and measured instantaneous u tell n m and t a for controlling the model since a steady equilibrium conditions in irregular waves are denoted by its low frequency components solved v β δ χ n m and t a for examples represent v β δ χ n m and t a respectively equations 11 and 21 give q m and q s respectively using u p based on eq 13 or 14 neglecting high frequency components the solutions also tell j and k q while 1 w is assumed equal to 1 w given in table 2 in the simulation the authors assume no scale effect on the hydrodynamic derivatives listed in table 4 c xw c yw and c nw in fig 7 and c xa c ya and c na in fig 8 the difference between model scale and full scale of c f0 δc f c t 1 w k q and k t shown in table 2 lead the difference of n j s and therefore f n these differences are the major sources of the scale effects on the manoeuvring motion including speed response note that the above mentioned numerical simulation is for steady equilibrium or low frequency values and does not tell the fluctuating or high frequency components of ship motion effective inflow velocity to propeller and propeller torque 5 test results this section presents the tank test results with those of the numerical simulation for comparison these comparisons are only for the low frequency components since the equilibrium equation does not tell the property of high frequency components the data length for the analysis in terms of t are 75 150 and 60 in the conditions of χ d equal to 0 60 and 120 respectively the durations correspond to the steady part of measured data though the total measured time depended on the ship courses in the basin 5 1 ship motion the test data analysis regards the mean values as the low frequency components fig 9 shows v v 0 β and δ comparing with the numerical simulation including those of the full scale ship note that the abscissa is χ not χ d the model test data shows the order of magnitude of speed decrease drift angle and rudder angle are nc rsc and sfc though the difference between rsc and sfc are not large this order is identical to that of the n m and the reversed order of f ta the characteristics of the numerical simulation agree qualitatively with those of the test data since the wils would simulate the wind loads well tsukada et al 2017 2018 possible estimation errors in the wave drift forces should be responsible to the quantitative difference between the tank test data and the numerical simulation of β and δ although v v 0 shows good agreement it must be noted that the wave drift forces estimated in the numerical simulation does not take into account the effect of drift angle that could not be negligible in short waves ueno et al 2000 2001 the numerical simulation confirms that the rsc compensates for the scale effect and tells directly the full scale ship motion in wind and waves with high accuracy though the further validation needs comparisons with full scale data for other ship forms the tank test data of rsc is more reliable as the estimates of full scale ship than the numerical simulation because the physical phenomena simulated rationally the wave drift forces including the effect of both ship speed and drift angle the slight difference between rsc and the full scale in the numerical simulation is attributed to v rp in eq 28 that depends on the propeller slip ratio fig 10 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components δv δβ and δδ the significant value is defined here by the quadruple of the standard deviations of measured data the model controls nc sfc and rsc result in different δv v 0 δβ and δδ especially in δβ fig 11 shows the amplitude response functions of oscillatory motion represented by σ ξ σ wave σ η σ wave and σ ζ σ wave for translational motion and 2k eq σ φ 2k eq σ θ and 2k eq σ ψ for rotational motion σ ξ σ η σ ζ σ φ σ θ σ ψ and σ wave stand for the standard deviations of surge sway heave roll pitch yaw and wave respectively k eq is an equivalent wave number in the irregular waves defined here by the following equation 33 k e q 4 π 2 t 01 2 g not only the horizontal response σ ξ σ wave σ η σ wave and 2k eq σ ψ of which tendencies are similar to δv v 0 δβ and δδ in fig 10 but also σ ζ σ wave 2k eq σ φ and 2k eq σ θ seem to depend on the model controls the difference of v v 0 β and δ among nc sfc and rsc should cause their differences in the fluctuating components 5 2 estimation of full scale propeller torque the estimation of full scale propeller torque uses the data of the free running model with rsc because the procedure needs the data of which ship motion is similar to the full sale ship the data of the free running model with nc and scf therefore are only for comparison 5 2 1 time histories fig 12 shows the time histories of measured u and q m analyzed u pm 1 w m u and δu w and estimated 1 w s u u ps and q s in the head wind and waves condition where χ d is equal to 0 1 w s shown later is estimated by multiplying the analyzed 1 w m with the ratio of 1 w s to 1 w m both shown in table 2 δu w is dominant in the fluctuating component comparing with the other fluctuating component 1 w u u ps and 1 w s u are larger than u pm and 1 w m u respectively because the estimated 1 w s is larger than 1 w m the resultant q s is smaller than q m because of the difference of u ps and n s from u pm and n m respectively on which the later section notes figs 13 and 14 show the time histories in the bow and quartering wind and waves conditions where χ d s are 60 and 120 respectively the fluctuation of δu w becomes smaller as χ grows because the direction of the effective inflow velocity to propeller deviates from the plane of the orbital motion of water particles due to waves on the other hand the fluctuating component of 1 w u becomes larger in the oblique wind and waves conditions since surge oscillating motion becomes larger as shown in fig 11 the magnitude of fluctuation of δu w however is still larger than that of 1 w u u on average grows as χ grows that is the same tendency of v shown in fig 9 this tendency and the nearly constant ratio of 1 w s to 1 w m shown later make the discrepancy between u ps and u pm 1 w s u and 1 w m u and q s and q m larger respectively as χ grows 5 2 2 low frequency components fig 15 shows u p n and 1 w comparing the tank test data of the model with nc sfc and rsc with the numerical simulation including the full scale ship u p m shows growing tendency as χ grows the difference of u p m characteristics among nc sfc and rsc observed in the tank test agree well with the numerical simulation the estimated u p s also agree with the numerical simulation the comparison of n m of nc sfc and src between the tank test and the numerical simulation confirms the well controlled free running model in the head and oblique wind and waves for the full scale ship with constant n s the analyzed 1 w m and the estimated 1 w s correspond well to those of the numerical simulation which implies the adequacy of the model controls and the estimation procedure the reason why the effect of pitch motion on the variation of 1 w faltinsen et al 1980 is not significant in the test data could be attributed partly to the phenomena in irregular waves fig 16 shows the differences of t a for nc sfc and rsc in the numerical simulation the increasing tendencies of t a for sfc and rsc as χ grows are qualitatively same as v in fig 9 note that t a in the tank test is not shown here because the measured duct fan force cannot distinguish t a from the simulated longitudinal wind force fig 17 shows j k q and q comparing the tank test data with the numerical simulation including the full scale ship the increasing tendencies of j m and j s and the decreasing tendencies of k q m and k q s in the numerical simulation explain well those observed in the tank test respectively the differences among the model with nc sfc and rsc and the full scale ship obtained by the tank test agree with those in the numerical simulation the numerical simulation of q m and q s also correspond well to those of the tank test data the reason why q m of the model with sfc is close to the estimated q s both in the numerical simulation and the tank test is as follows sfc is by its definition the model control in which the following equation defines f ta and n m 34 t m t s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s the solutions of eq 34 is as in fig 3 on the other hand the simultaneous equations replacing the first equation in eq 2 or eq 34 with that representing the similarity of propeller torque is as follows 35 q m q s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s ueno and tsukada 2014 reported the solutions n m and f ta of eq 35 are close to those for sfc or of eq 34 this fact indicates that the model with sfc could give the quasi similar propeller torque as the model with rsc only if the motion of the model with sfc is not different largely from that of the full scale which should not be ensured though there are quantitative differences between the full scale ship values estimated by the numerical simulation and those by the tank test as is mentioned in 5 1 the authors consider that the full scale estimates using the tank test data of rsc is more reliable than the numerical simulation because the wave drift forces simulated physically in the tank test including the effect of both ship speed and drift angle are more rational 5 2 3 high frequency components fig 18 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components δu p δu w and 1 w δ u represented by four times the standard deviation of the data for the model with nc sfc and rsc and the full scale ship since no scale effect is assumed in δu w the value of the model with rsc is the estimated full scale value the difference between δu pm of the model with rsc and δu ps is small on the other hand the differences of δu w among nc sfc and rsc should be caused by the differences of fluctuating ship motion shown in fig 11 where not only surge but also sway and other modes of motion might affect in bow and oblique wind and waves conditions the difference of 1 w s and 1 w m is the cause the difference of 1 w δ u between the model with rsc and the full scale ship fig 19 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components of δj δk q and δq both δj m and δj s decrease as χ grows mainly due to the decreasing tendency of δu p shown in fig 18 comparisons of δk qs and δq s with δk qm and δq m respectively tell that not only the low frequency component of propeller torque but also the high frequency or the fluctuating component has the scale effect fig 20 shows the ratios of δu p to u p 1 w δ u to δu w and δq to q δu p u p decreases rapidly as χ grows because δu p decreases and u p increases as shown in figs 18 and 15 respectively the tendency of 1 w δ u δu w the ratio of the two components in u p is larger in the bow wind and waves conditions than those in the quartering and the head wind and waves conditions these characteristics for δu p u p and 1 w δ u δu w are qualitatively same both in model scale and in full scale however δq s q s shows decreasing tendency as χ grows while δq m q m shows larger values in oblique wind and waves conditions than in head wind and waves conditions this fact indicates that δq q could have the scale effect not only quantitatively but also qualitatively 6 conclusions the authors carried out the free running model test to clarify the characteristics of full scale propeller torque in head and oblique wind and long crested irregular waves the wils mounted on the model simulated the wind loads effect on ship motion the rsc controlled the dfat on the model to ensure the similarity of ship motion to the full scale ship which ensures the similar mode propeller situation to the full scale the authors estimated the corresponding full scale propeller torque using measured model test data by applying the procedure that they had proposed the procedure employed the torque identity method in waves assumed no scale effect on the wave component in the effective inflow velocity to propeller the numerical simulation using the modular mathematical model estimated the equilibrium condition of the model with nc sfc and rsc in course keeping in wind and waves the empirical formula estimated the wind loads and the theoretical calculation neglecting the effect of drift angle approximated the wave drift forces and moment the simulation confirmed that the rsc ensured the similarity of the ship model motion to the full scale ship in wind and waves the test data and the numerical simulation clarified how ship speed drift angle and rudder angle depend on wave direction the test data of 6dof oscillating responses or high frequency components of ship motion also showed dependencies on the ship model controls nc sfc and rsc the estimation method analyzing the model test data revealed the time histories of propeller torque effective inflow velocity to propeller and its ship speed component and wave component of the model and the full scale ship the low frequency components of the propeller torque and other related properties for the model and the full scale ship obtained by the tank test agree with those estimated by the numerical simulation this fact indicates that the method to estimate the full scale propeller torque based on the free running model test works well the estimated full scale propeller torque clarified that not only the low frequency component but also the high frequency component has scale effects depending on the wind and waves direction the authors consider that the errors in the numerical simulation are mainly responsible for the quantitative differences between the tank test and the numerical simulation the incompleteness of the mathematical model the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives and the approximation in the calculation for the wave drift forces are among the error sources the free running model test ensuring similar ship model motion to the full scale ship is the physical simulation free from these error sources the authors therefore believe that the free running model test procedure together with the estimation method for the full scale inflow velocity to propeller and propeller torque in wind and waves shown here has potential for understanding the performance of ships in actual seas declarations of interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by jsps japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi

torque of ships in wind and waves are crucial to understand the dynamics of a propeller and an engine that affects ship performance interactively in actual seas the propeller torque variation appears in two ways one is in its mean or the low frequency component the other is in the fluctuating or high frequency component the wave drift forces wind forces and the manoeuvring motion are the source of the low frequency variation the orbital motion of water particles due to waves the oscillatory ship motion in waves and their interaction induce the variation in high frequency that might affect the low frequency variation as well researches based on the full scale measurement such as by ogawara et al 1981 are informative to clarify the dynamics of propeller torque and engine torque however full scale measurements cannot avoid their interaction effects and often include unexpected environmental noises the numerical simulation could be an alternative taskar et al 2016 clarified how the propulsion performance decreased in waves by numerical simulations considering both wake variation and engine response in waves yum et al 2017 presented a mathematical model of a marine diesel engine and validated its response including transient performance under various wave conditions nakamura et al 1975 proposed an approximation formula to estimate the orbital motion of water particles due to waves at the propeller position of a container ship in head waves ueno et al 2013b extended it geometrically to that in oblique waves the applicability of the formula to various hull forms and wave directions however are not sufficient because of scarce experimental data this is one of remaining problems to be solved to make numerical simulations estimating the fluctuating full scale propeller torque more reliable model tests on the other hand are effective to investigate physically characteristics of fluctuating propeller torque in waves yamanouchi and ando 1966 and yoshino et al 1974 carried out free running model tests in waves and reported mean and fluctuating components of propeller torque sluijs 1972 carried out captive model tests in head and following waves and scaled up the measured fluctuating propeller torque in accordance with the froude s law of similarity nakamura et al 1975 carried out captive model tests and discussed the effect of the effective inflow velocity to propeller on the propeller torque these model tests data clarified the properties of model scale propeller torque fluctuating in waves however researches on scale effects on the propeller torque in waves are quite limited since the propeller torque depends on ship motion in waves the ship motion of a model must be similar to that of a full scale ship even in free running model tests tsukada et al 2013 2014 developed a duct fan auxiliary thruster dfat that can make it possible to control a propeller rate of revolution of a model independently of ship speed kitagawa et al 2015 carried out free running tests in head waves in which the model ran at a full scale self propulsion point fspp and took into consideration the scale effect only on the mean component of measured propeller torque but not on the fluctuating component ueno and tsukada 2015 proposed a method rudder effectiveness and speed correction rsc to make motion of a free running model similar to that of a full scale ship using dfat the rsc controls depending on time varying ship speed of a model the auxiliary thrust of dfat and the model propeller rate of revolution the resultant rate is neither at a model self propulsion point mspp nor at a fspp ueno and tsukada 2016 proposed a method to estimate full scale propeller torque and thrust including the low frequency and high frequency components using data of a free running model test making use of the rsc they presented a trial application of the proposed method to existing test data of a container ship model in head waves and discussed the differences of fluctuating propeller torque and thrust between the model and the full scale ship since the test data was of the model without the dfat it supposed a hypothetical head wind of which force canceled out hypothetical dfat force controlled by the rsc this paper presents free running model test data of a tanker equipped with the dfat running in head bow and quartering wind and waves application examples of the method to estimate full scale propeller torque and numerical simulations the contents cover the theoretical background of the method the model control procedure and the numerical method and data with discussion whereas limited test data were reported by ueno et al 2018a 2018b the waves are long crested and irregular while the wind is simulated by the wind loads simulator wils tsukada et al 2017 2018 the wils equipped on a model makes free running tests in wind possible not by generating environmental wind but by exerting equivalent wind forces controlled using time varying data of ship motion the test employed three model controls the model with no correction nc or running at mspp without dfat that with the skin friction correction sfc or running at fspp using dfat and that with rsc using dfat their comparison clarified the differences of ship motion and propeller torque of the model the numerical simulation confirmed that the rsc ensured the similarity of manoeuvring motion which should lead to the similar ship situations relative to wind and waves and therefore to the similar six degree of freedom 6dof oscillating motion these similarities should ensure the similarity of the model propeller situation relative to wind and waves the method estimated the full scale propeller torque using the data of the model with rsc which revealed how the mean values and the significant values of fluctuating components appear differently between the model and the full scale ship 2 outline of the estimation method in this paper prime stands for non dimensional values defined by the following forms in which l ρ and g are the ship length between perpendiculars the density of water and the gravitational acceleration respectively 1 l e n g t h l m a s s ρ l 3 f o r c e ρ g l 3 m o m e n t ρ g l 4 t i m e l g t r a n s l a t i o n a l s p e e d l g a n g u l a r s p e e d g l subscripts m and s stand for model values and full scale ship values respectively tilde on a variable represents its low frequency component and that followed by δ represents its high frequency component in this section asterisk represents either m or s while variables without neither m nor s are assumed to have no scale effect 2 1 model control for the similarity of ship motion researchers and engineers on naval architecture usually apply the froude s law of similarity to ship speed however the difference of reynolds number r n between models and full scale ships at an identical froude number f n does not allow the ordinary free running model tests to hold the similarity of wake flow and of propeller rate of revolution these dissimilarities lead to the dissimilarities of rudder force and therefore the dissimilarities of manoeuvring motion this is the reason why the researchers have challenged to ensure the similarity of manoeuvring motion oltmann et al 1980 developed a computerized carriage to provide a model with the auxiliary thrust kobayashi et al 2000 developed an air jet type auxiliary thruster and son et al 2010 developed another computerized carriage to provide models with the auxiliary thrust both for making a free running model run at fspp however ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno et al 2017b revealed that neither mspp nor fspp but rsc can compensate for the scale effect on manoeuvring motion the rsc controls both the auxiliary thrust and the model propeller rate of revolution to ensure the similarity of rudder force and the similarity of longitudinal force acting on a ship the similarity of the longitudinal component of effective inflow velocity to rudder u r approximates the similarity of the rudder force between a model and a full scale ship the basic simultaneous equations for the rsc are as follows ueno and tsukada 2015 2 u r m u r s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s 1 t is the thrust deduction coefficient and t is the propeller thrust t sfc represents the force required for the sfc f ta is the auxiliary thrust factor that defines the auxiliary thrust t a for a model by the following equation 3 t a f t a t sfc a modular mathematical model kose et al 1981 calculates u r as follows 4 u r ε 1 w u η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1 2 1 η ε is the ratio of wake coefficient at rudder position to that at propeller position 1 w u is the longitudinal component of ship speed η is the ratio of propeller diameter d to rudder height κ is the coefficient concerning the speed increase ratio of propeller slipstream at rudder position k t is the thrust coefficient a function of j where j is the propeller advance ratio defined by the following equation 5 j 1 w u n d the following equations calculate t and t sfc respectively 6 t ρ n 2 d 4 k t 7 t s f c r m r s r is the resistance of a ship in calm water the difference of r m and r s at an identical f n originates in the difference of the total resistance coefficients that depend on r n or u and a scale ratio ueno et al 2014b ueno and tsukada 2015 saunders et al 1957 ittc 1978 the similarity of rudder force approximated by the first equation in eq 2 leads to the similarity of sway and yaw motion the second equation in eq 2 represents the equality of the right hand side or the external forces of the equation of longitudinal motion or u equation 2 is as the result the simultaneous equations for the similarity of manoeuvring motion ueno and tsukada 2015 ueno et al 2017b the given parameter is a full scale propeller rate of revolution n s and u while the unknows are the model control parameters n m and f ta n s could be a constant or vary arbitrarily in time as determined by for example an engine model ueno and tsukada 2016 on the other hand u follows the instantaneous model speed measured in free running tests u in free running model tests in waves consists in general of the low frequency and the high frequency components as follows 8 u u δ 1 2 u although δu should induce δn m and δf ta the authors use only u for the rsc to solve eq 1 the resultant control parameters n m and f ta have only the low frequency component respectively as follows 9 n m n m 10 f t a f t a one of the reasons why the rsc employs only u is the assumption that the effects of δn m and δf ta on u of a model are negligible this assumption is partly supported by the free running model test that simulated an engine response or δn m showing no significant effect on u kitagawa et al 2012 the other reason is to avoid the effect of δn m on the torque identity method mentioned in the following subsection to identify the effective inflow velocity to propeller u p in waves ueno and tsukada 2016 the rsc can incorporate the continuous operational limit of engine in which no fluctuation of engine response is considered suzuki et al 2019 researches on the engine dynamics affecting δn yum et al 2017 and on the methodology to simulate fluctuating engine response in model tests kitagawa et al 2015 however are crucial for further understandings of ship dynamics in waves 2 2 estimation of full scale propeller torque applying the torque identity method to test data in waves as in ueno et al 2013b the torque coefficient of a model propeller k qm and the measured model propeller torque q m tell j m using the following relation 11 q m k q m j m n m 2 d 5 j m tells the effective inflow velocity to model propeller u pm by the following equation 12 u p m j m n m d according to ueno et al 2013b u p consists of two components originated in ship speed and in waves as shown in the following equation 13 u p 1 w 0 u u w 0 1 w 0 u δ u u w 0 δ u w 0 in eq 13 1 w 0 is the wake coefficient in calm water that should have the scale effect affecting both low frequency and high frequency components u w0 stands for the velocity originated in the orbital motion of water particles due to waves the authors assume no scale effect on u w0 u w 0 in u p appears in quartering and following waves of which encounter frequency is zero ueno et al 2013b modification of eq 13 leads to the following expression 14 u p 1 w 0 u w 0 u u δ u δ u w 0 u w 0 u δ u 1 w u δ u δ u w equation 14 adopts the definitions of 1 w and δu w as follows 15 1 w 1 w 0 u w 0 u 16 δ u w δ u w 0 u w 0 u δ u equations 15 and 16 explain that 1 w and δu w are the wake coefficient and the wave component in u p respectively that include the interaction effect between the ship motion and waves free running model test data tell 1 w m by the following equation 17 1 w m u p m u the following equation therefore estimates δu w using free running model speed data u and the analyzed u pm and 1 w m by eq 12 and eq 17 respectively 18 δ u w u p m 1 w m u the potential follow calculation such as for a fixed ship jinnaka 1960 and for a ship free to pitch and heave taskar 2017 should tell the effect of hull form variation on δu w since no scale effect is assumed on the measured u and the estimated δu w the following equation estimates u ps using 1 w s estimated separately for a corresponding full scale ship 19 u p s 1 w s u δ u w 1 w s can be estimated for example in accordance with the ittc procedures ittc 1978 based on the analyzed 1 w m by eq 17 the estimated u ps and the supposed n s tell j s as follows 20 j s u p s n s d using k qs estimated separately the following equation estimates q s 21 q s 2 π i a n s k q s j s n s 2 d 5 i a stands for the added moment of inertia of the propeller system n s that represents the time derivative of n s allows to take into account of an arbitrarily variation of n s 3 model test program the free running model tests were of course keeping manoeuvres in wind and long crested irregular waves the model conditions are three nc sfc and rsc as noted in the introduction the tests suppose the full scale ship having the constant n s with which the ship runs in calm water at the designated ship speed v 0 or u 0 15 5kn in full scale 3 1 scale model the subject ship is the tanker kvlcc1 stern and agdrup 2008 fig 1 shows the body plan and the bow and stern profiles the principal particulars are in table 1 the hull form of kvlcc1 is open publicly and abundant model test data are available yoshimura et al 2008 suzuki et al 2019 though there is no full scale ship hydrodynamic coefficients on the resistance and propulsion are in table 2 tank tests by suzuki et al 2015 are the basis of the values of form factor 1 k wake coefficient 1 w and thrust deduction coefficient 1 t c f0 friction resistance coefficient of a corresponding plate is according to saunders et al 1957 and corresponding c t total resistance coefficient are for 10 c water c w f n curve coefficients for the wave making resistance are of the 4th order polynomial expression of froude number f n δc f according to the ittc formula ittc 1978 is only for the full scale ship ε and κ are from yoshimura et al 2008 the 2nd order polynomials of j characterize k q and k t obtained by the authors recent propeller open water test fig 2 compares the estimated full scale k q and k t with those of model scale the scale effect on k q is recognizable while that on k t is quite small c f0 δc f c t 1 w and coefficients of k q j and k t j curves take into account the scale effects c f0 is a function of r n saunders et al 1957 and δc f is a function of ship length ittc 1978 1 w k q and k t of the full scale ship are estimated in accordance with the ittc procedures ittc 1978 using the corresponding model scale values obtained by the tank tests l oa a f and a l in table 1 are the length overall the longitudinal projected area and the lateral projected area respectively of the above water structure the regression formula proposed by kitamura et al 2017 estimated the eight above water structural parameters including a f a l and l oa required for the empirical formula of fujiwara et al 2005 for estimating the wind loads coefficients solving eq 2 using the values in table 2 tells n m and f ta for rsc the second equation in eq 2 with f ta equal to 1 by its definition tells n m for sfc n m for nc is the constant mspp with f ta equal to 0 the free running model however does not necessarily attain a theoretical speed in the tank test with the solutions due to reasons including the change of model surface condition caused by aging the authors in such cases attenuated n m for attaining u 0 in calm water by applying the difference between theoretical and experimental n m as constants to the entire range of u u 0 the constants made the experimental n m of nc sfc and rsc larger than the theoretical values by 0 15 0 0 and 0 24 respectively fig 3 shows the resultant control parameters n m and f ta for nc sfc rsc and n s for comparison 3 2 test facilities the model test was at the actual sea model basin asmb tanizawa et al 2010 ueno et al 2013a in the national maritime research institute japan the basin dimensions are 80 m long 40 m wide and 4 5 m deep the carriage system tracked the free running model for measuring its position heading and speed in the horizontal plane a fiber optical gyro measured the oscillatory motion in 6dof a dynamometer between a driving motor and the propeller shaft measured the fluctuating propeller torque in waves the wave generator of asmb consisting of 382 flaps surrounding whole periphery of the basin generated long crested irregular waves the wave generator absorbs incoming waves including those reflected on and radiated from ship models during wave generation using data obtained by wave gauges placed in front of each flap which allows long time wave generation ota et al 2018 it is impossible in general to generate uniform wind field over a model basin for free running model tests the authors therefore used the wind loads simulator wils tsukada et al 2017 2018 in the test the wils makes it possible without generating environmental wind to realize wind effects on a model by exerting forces equivalent to wind loads using six duct fans mounted on the model the wils controls the fans forces using the measured ship motion data the supposed true wind speed and direction and wind loads coefficients estimated beforehand to calculate wind loads the generated wind loads therefore depend on instantaneous apparent wind speed and direction of a model although the control is for the longitudinal and lateral forces and yaw moment it also simulates the heel moment by the lateral forces of duct fans placed at a designated height the height for the subject ship divided by a l l oa is 1 730 tsukada et al 2017 the wind loads coefficients of the subject ship are shown in the later section fig 4 shows a photograph of the model in the testing two black circles drawn on the deck are the targets for the carriage system to track the model using a camera six duct fans for the wils are same type as the dfat one of the duct fans for longitudinal force at stern works also as the dfat for the rsc four load cells placed under the duct fans measures fore longitudinal aft longitudinal fore lateral and aft lateral forces generated by the duct fans respectively for the wils control the measured forces include not only the fan forces but also inertia forces of the mass on the load cells due to the oscillating ship motion the feedback control compensated the inertial forces which is important for tests in waves because the inertial forces could be larger than the wind forces to be generated tsukada et al 2017 2018 ueno et al 2013a presented data showing the high repeatability of a free running model test in waves and miyazaki et al 2013 reported the uncertainty analysis of a free running model test both at asmb 3 3 wind and waves and auto steering control fig 5 defines the coordinate system o xyz fixed to a ship of which origin is located at midship x y and n represent longitudinal

rudder angle and f n is the rudder normal force χ is the direction of the true wind and the long crested irregular waves which are aligned with each other u t is the true wind speed u a and χ a are the apparent wind speed and the apparent wind direction table 3 shows the wind and waves conditions the supposed true wind is steady of which speed was 22 7 m s in full scale that corresponds to beaufort scale 9 the spectrum type of the waves is of the international ship structure congress issc 1964 the significant wave height h 1 3 and the modal wave period t 01 were 7 0 m and 10 2s in full scale respectively which also correspond to beaufort scale 9 fig 6 compares the intended wave power spectrum with the measured power spectrum of which measurement duration was 180 s at a fixed point in the basin without the ship model table 3 showing the intended and measured values for h 1 3 and t 01 confirms that the wave generator successfully realized the intended wave field the designated wind and waves directions relative to the model χ d were 0 head wind and waves 60 bow wind and waves and 120 quartering wind and waves a proportional differential controller of the auto steering determined δ to direct the model heading to χ d the proportional gain k p was 2 0 the differential gain was 0 5s in model scale the following equation relates δ χ d and a measured or resultant encounter angle to wind and waves χ in steady equilibrium conditions 22 δ k p χ χ d the proportional gain should affect the ship motion mainly by affecting χ of which difference leads to differences in high frequency ship motion however ship responses represented not by a measured point but by functions of χ should not be affected the differential gain could affect high frequency ship motion directly because it affects damping forces of roll sway and yaw considering the ship inertia roll should be more vulnerable than sway and yaw 4 numerical simulation method the numerical simulation estimates the steady equilibrium conditions of the model with nc sfc and rsc in wind and waves for comparison with the tank test data the numerical simulation also estimates the full scale ship equilibrium conditions to compare with those of the model 4 1 mathematical model equations for the steady equilibrium condition for surge sway and yaw are as follows according to the modular

yaw rate effect on the lateral inflow velocity to rudder v rp stands for the component of the lateral inflow velocity to rudder induced by the propeller revolution in straight running the following

s y w ρglh 1 3 2 and n w ρgl 2 h 1 3 2 of the subject ship for the long crested irregular waves the numerical simulation used spline approximations to interpolate the estimated x w ρglh 1 3 2 at every

approximations in the numerical simulation 4 3 calculation procedure and scale effects equations 23 and 24 are to be solved for the unknowns v β δ and χ that represent a steady equilibrium condition the givens for eqs 23 and 24 are n s and χ d n s and measured instantaneous u tell n m and t a for controlling the model since a steady equilibrium conditions in irregular waves are denoted by its low frequency components solved v β δ χ n m and t a for examples represent v β δ χ n m and t a respectively equations 11 and 21 give q m and q s respectively using u p based on eq 13 or 14 neglecting high frequency components the solutions also tell j and k q while 1 w is assumed equal to 1 w given in table 2 in the simulation the authors assume no scale effect on the hydrodynamic derivatives listed in table 4 c xw c yw and c nw in fig 7 and c xa c ya and c na in fig 8 the difference between model scale and full scale of c f0 δc f c t 1 w k q and k t shown in table 2 lead the difference of n j s and therefore f n these differences are the major sources of the scale effects on the manoeuvring motion including speed response note that the above mentioned numerical simulation is for steady equilibrium or low frequency values and does not tell the fluctuating or high frequency components of ship motion effective inflow velocity to propeller and propeller torque 5 test results this section presents the tank test results with those of the numerical simulation for comparison these comparisons are only for the low frequency components since the equilibrium equation does not tell the property of high frequency components the data length for the analysis in terms of t are 75 150 and 60 in the conditions of χ d equal to 0 60 and 120 respectively the durations correspond to the steady part of measured data though the total measured time depended on the ship courses in the basin 5 1 ship motion the test data analysis regards the mean values as the low frequency components fig 9 shows v v 0 β and δ comparing with the numerical simulation including those of the full scale ship note that the abscissa is χ not χ d the model test data shows the order of magnitude of speed decrease drift angle and rudder angle are nc rsc and sfc though the difference between rsc and sfc are not large this order is identical to that of the n m and the reversed order of f ta the characteristics of the numerical simulation agree qualitatively with those of the test data since the wils would simulate the wind loads well tsukada et al 2017 2018 possible estimation errors in the wave drift forces should be responsible to the quantitative difference between the tank test data and the numerical simulation of β and δ although v v 0 shows good agreement it must be noted that the wave drift forces estimated in the numerical simulation does not take into account the effect of drift angle that could not be negligible in short waves ueno et al 2000 2001 the numerical simulation confirms that the rsc compensates for the scale effect and tells directly the full scale ship motion in wind and waves with high accuracy though the further validation needs comparisons with full scale data for other ship forms the tank test data of rsc is more reliable as the estimates of full scale ship than the numerical simulation because the physical phenomena simulated rationally the wave drift forces including the effect of both ship speed and drift angle the slight difference between rsc and the full scale in the numerical simulation is attributed to v rp in eq 28 that depends on the propeller slip ratio fig 10 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components δv δβ and δδ the significant value is defined here by the quadruple of the standard deviations of measured data the model controls nc sfc and rsc result in different δv v 0 δβ and δδ especially in δβ fig 11 shows the amplitude response functions of oscillatory motion represented by σ ξ σ wave σ η σ wave and σ ζ σ wave for translational motion and 2k eq σ φ 2k eq σ θ and 2k eq σ ψ for rotational motion σ ξ σ η σ ζ σ φ σ θ σ ψ and σ wave stand for the standard deviations of surge sway heave roll pitch yaw and wave respectively k eq is an equivalent wave number in the irregular waves defined here by the following equation 33 k e q 4 π 2 t 01 2 g not only the horizontal response σ ξ σ wave σ η σ wave and 2k eq σ ψ of which tendencies are similar to δv v 0 δβ and δδ in fig 10 but also σ ζ σ wave 2k eq σ φ and 2k eq σ θ seem to depend on the model controls the difference of v v 0 β and δ among nc sfc and rsc should cause their differences in the fluctuating components 5 2 estimation of full scale propeller torque the estimation of full scale propeller torque uses the data of the free running model with rsc because the procedure needs the data of which ship motion is similar to the full sale ship the data of the free running model with nc and scf therefore are only for comparison 5 2 1 time histories fig 12 shows the time histories of measured u and q m analyzed u pm 1 w m u and δu w and estimated 1 w s u u ps and q s in the head wind and waves condition where χ d is equal to 0 1 w s shown later is estimated by multiplying the analyzed 1 w m with the ratio of 1 w s to 1 w m both shown in table 2 δu w is dominant in the fluctuating component comparing with the other fluctuating component 1 w u u ps and 1 w s u are larger than u pm and 1 w m u respectively because the estimated 1 w s is larger than 1 w m the resultant q s is smaller than q m because of the difference of u ps and n s from u pm and n m respectively on which the later section notes figs 13 and 14 show the time histories in the bow and quartering wind and waves conditions where χ d s are 60 and 120 respectively the fluctuation of δu w becomes smaller as χ grows because the direction of the effective inflow velocity to propeller deviates from the plane of the orbital motion of water particles due to waves on the other hand the fluctuating component of 1 w u becomes larger in the oblique wind and waves conditions since surge oscillating motion becomes larger as shown in fig 11 the magnitude of fluctuation of δu w however is still larger than that of 1 w u u on average grows as χ grows that is the same tendency of v shown in fig 9 this tendency and the nearly constant ratio of 1 w s to 1 w m shown later make the discrepancy between u ps and u pm 1 w s u and 1 w m u and q s and q m larger respectively as χ grows 5 2 2 low frequency components fig 15 shows u p n and 1 w comparing the tank test data of the model with nc sfc and rsc with the numerical simulation including the full scale ship u p m shows growing tendency as χ grows the difference of u p m characteristics among nc sfc and rsc observed in the tank test agree well with the numerical simulation the estimated u p s also agree with the numerical simulation the comparison of n m of nc sfc and src between the tank test and the numerical simulation confirms the well controlled free running model in the head and oblique wind and waves for the full scale ship with constant n s the analyzed 1 w m and the estimated 1 w s correspond well to those of the numerical simulation which implies the adequacy of the model controls and the estimation procedure the reason why the effect of pitch motion on the variation of 1 w faltinsen et al 1980 is not significant in the test data could be attributed partly to the phenomena in irregular waves fig 16 shows the differences of t a for nc sfc and rsc in the numerical simulation the increasing tendencies of t a for sfc and rsc as χ grows are qualitatively same as v in fig 9 note that t a in the tank test is not shown here because the measured duct fan force cannot distinguish t a from the simulated longitudinal wind force fig 17 shows j k q and q comparing the tank test data with the numerical simulation including the full scale ship the increasing tendencies of j m and j s and the decreasing tendencies of k q m and k q s in the numerical simulation explain well those observed in the tank test respectively the differences among the model with nc sfc and rsc and the full scale ship obtained by the tank test agree with those in the numerical simulation the numerical simulation of q m and q s also correspond well to those of the tank test data the reason why q m of the model with sfc is close to the estimated q s both in the numerical simulation and the tank test is as follows sfc is by its definition the model control in which the following equation defines f ta and n m 34 t m t s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s the solutions of eq 34 is as in fig 3 on the other hand the simultaneous equations replacing the first equation in eq 2 or eq 34 with that representing the similarity of propeller torque is as follows 35 q m q s 1 t m t m 1 f t a t sfc 1 t s t s ueno and tsukada 2014 reported the solutions n m and f ta of eq 35 are close to those for sfc or of eq 34 this fact indicates that the model with sfc could give the quasi similar propeller torque as the model with rsc only if the motion of the model with sfc is not different largely from that of the full scale which should not be ensured though there are quantitative differences between the full scale ship values estimated by the numerical simulation and those by the tank test as is mentioned in 5 1 the authors consider that the full scale estimates using the tank test data of rsc is more reliable than the numerical simulation because the wave drift forces simulated physically in the tank test including the effect of both ship speed and drift angle are more rational 5 2 3 high frequency components fig 18 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components δu p δu w and 1 w δ u represented by four times the standard deviation of the data for the model with nc sfc and rsc and the full scale ship since no scale effect is assumed in δu w the value of the model with rsc is the estimated full scale value the difference between δu pm of the model with rsc and δu ps is small on the other hand the differences of δu w among nc sfc and rsc should be caused by the differences of fluctuating ship motion shown in fig 11 where not only surge but also sway and other modes of motion might affect in bow and oblique wind and waves conditions the difference of 1 w s and 1 w m is the cause the difference of 1 w δ u between the model with rsc and the full scale ship fig 19 shows the significant values of the fluctuating components of δj δk q and δq both δj m and δj s decrease as χ grows mainly due to the decreasing tendency of δu p shown in fig 18 comparisons of δk qs and δq s with δk qm and δq m respectively tell that not only the low frequency component of propeller torque but also the high frequency or the fluctuating component has the scale effect fig 20 shows the ratios of δu p to u p 1 w δ u to δu w and δq to q δu p u p decreases rapidly as χ grows because δu p decreases and u p increases as shown in figs 18 and 15 respectively the tendency of 1 w δ u δu w the ratio of the two components in u p is larger in the bow wind and waves conditions than those in the quartering and the head wind and waves conditions these characteristics for δu p u p and 1 w δ u δu w are qualitatively same both in model scale and in full scale however δq s q s shows decreasing tendency as χ grows while δq m q m shows larger values in oblique wind and waves conditions than in head wind and waves conditions this fact indicates that δq q could have the scale effect not only quantitatively but also qualitatively 6 conclusions the authors carried out the free running model test to clarify the characteristics of full scale propeller torque in head and oblique wind and long crested irregular waves the wils mounted on the model simulated the wind loads effect on ship motion the rsc controlled the dfat on the model to ensure the similarity of ship motion to the full scale ship which ensures the similar mode propeller situation to the full scale the authors estimated the corresponding full scale propeller torque using measured model test data by applying the procedure that they had proposed the procedure employed the torque identity method in waves assumed no scale effect on the wave component in the effective inflow velocity to propeller the numerical simulation using the modular mathematical model estimated the equilibrium condition of the model with nc sfc and rsc in course keeping in wind and waves the empirical formula estimated the wind loads and the theoretical calculation neglecting the effect of drift angle approximated the wave drift forces and moment the simulation confirmed that the rsc ensured the similarity of the ship model motion to the full scale ship in wind and waves the test data and the numerical simulation clarified how ship speed drift angle and rudder angle depend on wave direction the test data of 6dof oscillating responses or high frequency components of ship motion also showed dependencies on the ship model controls nc sfc and rsc the estimation method analyzing the model test data revealed the time histories of propeller torque effective inflow velocity to propeller and its ship speed component and wave component of the model and the full scale ship the low frequency components of the propeller torque and other related properties for the model and the full scale ship obtained by the tank test agree with those estimated by the numerical simulation this fact indicates that the method to estimate the full scale propeller torque based on the free running model test works well the estimated full scale propeller torque clarified that not only the low frequency component but also the high frequency component has scale effects depending on the wind and waves direction the authors consider that the errors in the numerical simulation are mainly responsible for the quantitative differences between the tank test and the numerical simulation the incompleteness of the mathematical model the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives and the approximation in the calculation for the wave drift forces are among the error sources the free running model test ensuring similar ship model motion to the full scale ship is the physical simulation free from these error sources the authors therefore believe that the free running model test procedure together with the estimation method for the full scale inflow velocity to propeller and propeller torque in wind and waves shown here has potential for understanding the performance of ships in actual seas declarations of interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by jsps japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi

22752,in this work the combined undulating motion pattern cump of the undulatory ribbon fin propulsion is numerically investigated inspired by the swimming of the large mouthed catfish silurus soldatovi meridionalis chen the swimming of a juvenile large mouthed catfish is observed and recorded to study the undulation of its elongated anal fin commonly known as the ribbon fin compared with the knifefish which undulates the ribbon fin to swim while maintaining a relatively rigid fish body the large mouthed catfish performs a cump propulsion which comprises the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin accordingly a fin body fish model is used to study the effect of the cump propulsion on the swimming performance simulation results show that the phase angle difference between the undulations of the fish body and the ribbon fin has a significant impact on the thrust and heave forces more specifically an in phase cump propulsion which is commonly found in the swimming of actual large mouthed catfish can dramatically improve the thrust in addition the effects of the angular amplitude of ribbon fin and the swimming frequency are considered as well finally the reasons for the thrust augmentation in the in phase cump propulsion are detailed and analyzed keywords ribbon fin propulsion combined undulating motion pattern thrust augmentation hydrodynamic forces biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction in the aquatic environment most fishes generate propulsion by bending the body and caudal fin into a backward moving wave to push the adjacent water downward these species of swimmers are commonly classified as the body and or caudal fin bcf locomotion swimmers in contrast the undulatory or oscillatory fins are often used as the main thrusters in certain other groups of swimmers which are commonly termed as the median and or paired fin mpf swimmers sfakiotakis et al 1999 an estimated 15 of the fish families belong to the non bcf modes whereas several bcf mode swimmers also employ the mpf modes for maneuvering and stabilization wardle and videler 1980 among them certain mpf mode swimmers undulate their elongated fins to generate thrust typically the rajiform amiiform and gymnotiform fishes achieve this undulatory elongated fin locomotion by undulating their paired pectoral fins long based dorsal fin and anal fin respectively low 2009 in the past decades researchers have been intrigued by the superb swimming performance and the high maneuverability of undulatory elongated fin locomotion for instance lighthill and blake 1990 first analyzed the locomotion of fish that have elongated median fins by using the elongated body theory bale et al 2014 proposed a drag thrust separation framework to analyze the forces on the undulatory elongated fin in terms of biomimetic research the undulatory elongated fin locomotion has been widely studied through experiments and numerical simulations using a stingray like fish as the natural counterpart rajiform prototypes of fish robots with a pair of undulatory elongated fins have been designed and tested azarsina et al 2016 di santo et al 2017 kim et al 2017 shang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 in contrast more prototypes of fish robots with a single undulatory elongated fin were inspired by the amiiform or the gymnotiform fish epstein et al 2006 hu et al 2009 liu et al 2008 meera and sudheer 2016a 2016b neveln et al 2014 taylor et al 2013 wang et al 2011 in addition several researchers emphasized on the locomotion control of biomimetic undulatory elongated fins chen et al 2010 hu et al 2011 low 2006 2007 sfakiotakis et al 2015 siahmansouri et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 despite the variety of detailed structures fish using this type of propulsion mode always create traveling waves along a ribbon like fin in fact this ribbon fin is commonly actuated by a series of highly flexible fin rays that are interconnected by an elastic membrane liu et al 2017 nguyen et al 2018 calculated the optimal number of fin rays in one wavelength of the undulatory ribbon fin liu et al 2017 studied

stability of ribbon fin propulsion liu and curet 2017 studied the propulsive performance of an under actuated ribbon fin by using a robotic device in addition to experimental research numerical simulations have also been conducted to study the ribbon fin propulsion li et al 2016 sprinkle et al 2017 xiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 although undulatory ribbon fin propulsion has been studied extensively as shown in fig 1 the actual undulations of ribbon fins in the existing accomplishments can be divided into two basic patterns 1 the undulation with a fixed baseline and 2 the undulation with a free baseline low 2009 most informed research works have been more focused on the knifefish which maintains a straight body and undulates the ribbon fin to swim in addition for the purpose of structural simplification the undulations of existing biomimetic ribbon fins can fall into the two aforementioned basic patterns e g fig 1 c and d in the fixed baseline pattern e g liu and curet 2018 2017 shirgaonkar et al 2008 the centers of rotation of all sequential fin rays are aligned and fixed fig 1 b in contrast in the free baseline pattern e g low 2007 meera and sudheer 2016a 2016b zhou and low 2014 both the top and bottom edges of the ribbon fins are undulatory and all fin rays remain parallel to one another during the undulation fig 1 a unlike the previous studies in this work we will investigate the swimming of a large mouthed catfish silurus soldatovi meridionalis chen that possesses an undulatory long based anal fin while it obviously undulates its body fig 2 based on this observation the large mouthed catfish performs a combined undulating motion pattern cump which comprises the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin inspired by this a combined fin body fish model is proposed to study the effect of the aforementioned cump propulsion on the swimming performance we have made efforts to obtain beneficial conclusions to understand this new type of swimming pattern and to develop biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles auvs by employing a numerical simulation method the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the proposed combined fin body fish model and the employed numerical method will be briefly introduced in section 3 we will first perform the validation calculations of our numerical simulation method then the effects of several key kinematics parameters of the cump propulsion on the propulsive performance will be investigated in section 4 a detailed discussion will be presented and the simulation results will be analyzed and compared with the swimming of a live large mouthed catfish in addition the reasons for thrust augmentation in the in phase cump propulsion will be detailed and analyzed finally we will summarize the conclusions of this work and will outline future research directions in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 fin body fish model based on the fin plate fish model used by lighthill and blake 1990 we propose a new fin body fish model that can simulate the undulations of both the fish body and the ribbon fin in this model the thickness of the fish body is considered small compared with its depth lighthill and blake 1990 consequently the catfish shown in fig 2 was modeled as an infinitesimally thin rectangular plate in this fin body fish model in exactly the same manner as in the prior simulations conducted by sprinkle et al 2017 fig 3 presents three undulating modes of the fin body fish model which comprise a red part indicating the fish body and a blue part indicating the ribbon fin the geometric parameters of this fish model include l the length of the fish s the height of the fish body h the height of the ribbon fin and h s h the total height of the fish in this work we will not perform a free swimming simulation meaning that the fish model is fixed in the computational domain and the undulations of both the fish body and the ribbon fin are prescribed as shown in fig 3 d the ribbon fin performs a sinusoidal swing around the point of intersection of the fish body and the ribbon fin in each cross sectional slice in this study the active undulation of the ribbon fin is given by sprinkle et al 2017 1 θ x t θ max sin 2 π f f i n t x λ f i n φ where θ x t is the angular displacement of the ribbon fin at location x and time t θ max is the peak amplitude f f i n is the undulating frequency of the ribbon fin λ f i n is the undulating wavelength of the ribbon fin and φ is the phase angle difference between the undulations of the fish body and the ribbon fin the undulation of the fish body can be expressed as a fourier series that is based on the experimental observations of an average mackerel videler and hess 1984 2 y b x t a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 sin 2 π f b o d y t x λ b o d y where y b x t is the lateral shift of the fish body at location x and time t f b o d y is the undulating frequency of the fish body and λ b o d y is the undulating wavelength of the fish body the undulating amplitude at location x is determined by three specific constants namely a 0 a 1 and a 2 the three undulation patterns of the fin body fish model shown in fig 3 will be considered in the first pattern fig 3 a the fish undulates the ribbon fin while maintaining the fish body rigid and flat i e y b x t 0 as shown in fig 3 b the active undulation of the ribbon fin is suppressed i e θ max 0 thus both the fish body and the ribbon fin perform a common parallel undulating motion pattern pump fig 3 c shows the aforementioned cump propulsion the top view of each undulation pattern is displayed in the lower part of fig 3 it may be observed that the third pattern can be regarded as a combination of the first two undulation patterns 2 2 numerical method the three dimensional 3d unsteady flow around the undulating fin body fish model was solved via numerical simulation all simulations were conducted using the commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd code of ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 the unstructured dynamic meshes based on spring and remeshing methods were applied to reduce the number of reconstructed meshes and minimize calculation time only few elements surrounding the fish model were changed a user defined function udf program was used to describe the undulation of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin as shown in fig 4 the computational domain is a hexahedron that ranges from 10 to 10 normalized by the length of the fish l along the stream wise direction the x direction and from 5 to 5 along the remaining two directions the size of the computational domain is sufficiently large to minimize the influence of the boundaries on the results obtained from numerical trials the left side was set as a velocity inlet boundary with a velocity value of u the x direction the right side was set as a pressure outlet boundary and the remaining four sides were stationary walls in addition the fin body fish model was an undulatory wall controlled by the udf it should be noted that because the thickness of the fish body was small compared with the size of the computational domain this infinitesimally thin fin body fish model was implemented by using a zero thickness and no slip wall directly in the fluent software the simple algorithm was applied for the pressure velocity coupling with the one equation spalart allmaras turbulence model strain vorticity based production absolute convergence criteria of 0 001 were adopted for all residuals the material was considered to be liquid water with a density of ρ 1 000 kg m 3 and a viscosity of μ 8 9 10 4 kg m s 3 results 3 1 validation of the simulation method to validate the reliability of the present simulation method in terms of the 3d unsteady flow problem an oscillating hydrofoil case kinsey and dumas 2012 at a high reynolds number re was considered more specifically a 3d naca0015 hydrofoil with an aspect ratio of a r 5 performed a combined pitch heave motion around its 1 3 chord point this combined pitch heave motion was characterized by θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ f f c u 0 14 and re 0 5 10 6 based on the chord length c h 0 c and θ 0 75 are the heaving and pitching amplitudes respectively f is the dimensionless reduced frequency f is the oscillation frequency u is the free stream velocity and ϕ 90 is the heaving phase with respect to the pitching motion the computational domain had a ratio of the same size as the one mentioned in the previous section the hydrofoil was discretized into 100 spanwise and 30 chordwise elements four continuous oscillating cycles were computed by performing 200 time steps per cycle fig 5 shows the comparison of the instantaneous force coefficients c x and c y on the hydrofoil between the present simulation results and the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 over an oscillating cycle the errors between both simulation results are also plotted in each sub graph as shown in fig 5 both errors are characterized by the alternatively positive and negative variations and the absolute values of both maximum errors are less than 0 4 more precisely to assess the coincidence degree of both results the root mean square error rmse values of 0 1726 and 0 2157 were calculated for force coefficients c x and c y respectively considering that the amplitudes of the variation of both force coefficients exceed the value of 4 in general both force coefficients of our present simulations agree well with the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 therefore the proposed simulation method is reliable for the unsteady flow problem the errors may be mainly attributed to the differences in the boundary conditions the mesh generation methods and the temporal resolutions as previously mentioned a zero thickness and no slip wall was used to implement the proposed fin body fish model owing to the small thickness of the fish body compared with the size of the computational domain the feasibility of this simplification was verified through a previous numerical case which was examined by moored 2018 the instant lift coefficients on an oscillating thin rectangular wing at a negative angle of attack namely α 5 were calculated under three different reduced frequencies i e k 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively unlike that of the above case the reduced frequency was defined as k π f c u where c 1 m is the chord length of the wing f is the heaving frequency and u 1 m s is the inflow velocity corresponding to re 0 68 10 5 the material is air the wing had an aspect ratio of a r 4 and a heaving amplitude of h 0 1 c in the numerical simulations of moored 2018 a 2 thick tear drop shaped airfoil was used to simulate the thin flat wing in contrast in the present numerical implementation a zero thickness rectangular wing was used directly for further comparison a non zero thickness 0 02 m thin flat wing was considered as well fig 6 a shows the comparison of the instant lift coefficients calculated via the present simulation method with that of moored 2018 over a time cycle in general both simulation results with zero and non zero thickness wings are compatible to the results of moored 2018 for all reduced frequencies the lift coefficient curves of the non zero thickness wing remain in the upward side compared with those of the other two wings for all three wings the magnitude of the lift coefficient may be seen to increase as the reduced frequency increases a negative phase shift in the lift oscillation may be observed as well furthermore an additional simulation was conducted using the liquid water material condition and the inflow velocity condition of u 0 4 m s corresponding to re 0 45 10 6 based on the chord length c as shown in fig 6 b similar variations in the instant lift coefficient may be noticed compared with fig 6 a the gaps between the resulting curves of zero and non zero thickness wings become wider as the magnitudes increases however they are still compatible it should be mentioned that the negative phase shift in the lift oscillation becomes more prominent fig 6 c and d present the flow streamlines around the zero and non zero thickness wings at the midspan cross section respectively both streamline figures are plotted for the case of k 0 5 at the final instant shown in fig 6 b although certain small differences exist in the detail of the flow field fundamentally the main flow field structure of these two wings is the same to summarize we may conclude that the zero thickness simplification is feasible for the unsteady flow problem around a thin body 3 2 effect of the phase angle difference φ we first examined the effect of the phase angle difference φ between the undulation of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin on the hydrodynamic forces the related geometric and kinematic parameters of the previously described fin body fish model will be specified in this subsection as shown in fig 3 a fin body fish model with l 1 m s 0 2 m and h 0 1 m is used in this study additionally the swimming of the fish model is described through eqs 1 and 2 with a 0 0 04 a 1 0 08 and a 2 0 16 λ f i n λ b o d y l and f f i n f b o d y f for ease of comparison five values of the phase angle difference namely φ 0 0 25 π 0 5 π 0 75 π and π in radians and four swimming frequencies namely f 0 5 hz 1 0 hz 1 5 hz and 2 0 hz will be considered in this subsection in addition a fixed angular amplitude of the ribbon fin of θ max 30 and an inflow velocity of u 0 4 m s will be applied corresponding to re 0 45 10 6 based on the fish length l prior to conducting a detailed computation a grid independence test for the pump propulsion with f 1 0 hz was conducted three different resolution meshes summarized in table 1 were selected the variations in the computed instant axial force f x and the lateral force f y for two swimming periods are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively a comparison of the results for the three different meshes indicates that the coarse mesh represents a lower thrust force compared with that of the remaining two meshes in contrast the results of the medium mesh and the fine mesh are in good agreement however certain small discrepancies in f x can be found in the peak positions the overall hydrodynamic performance of the fish model is not affected significantly in addition the time cost of the fine mesh simulation is nearly 2 5 times higher than that of the medium mesh case eventually the medium mesh was selected as the optimum computational mesh for the present study as shown in fig 8 three waveforms of the cump propulsion at the initial instant t 0 s are presented each waveform corresponds to a different value of phase angle difference it may be concluded that the phase angle difference has a great influence on the waveform of cump propulsion fig 9 shows the variations in the mean axial hydrodynamic force f x on the fin body fish model the abscissa stands for the phase angle difference and four different swimming frequencies are considered in our present simulations the fish is fixed in the middle of the computational domain and a constant inflow velocity is applied therefore f x indicates the mean value of the net axial force i e thrust drag a positive value of f x means that a net thrust is created and the fish has a tendency to swim forward in the x direction in each plot of fig 9 the horizontal gray dash line represents the mean net thrust value of the pump propulsion fig 3 b under the corresponding frequency condition in general a similar variation trend in f x may be observed for all frequencies except for the case where f 0 5 hz with the increase in φ from 0 to π f x decreases constantly for the three higher frequencies and it presents a minimum at φ 0 75 π for the 0 5 hz case furthermore the values of f x are greater than the corresponding values of the pump propulsion in the low φ value range for all frequencies meaning that an augmentation of thrust is achieved in the cump propulsion in contrast a thrust loss occurred in the high φ value range in addition owing to the flapping motion of the ribbon fin a heave force will be generated in the z direction fig 10 shows the mean heave forces f z on the fin body fish model for the swimming frequencies as expected the heave force of the pump propulsion has a value of zero owing to the suppression of the active undulation of the ribbon fin proportionately there is a similar variation trend in f z for the three higher frequencies more specifically a positive value of f z in the low φ value range means that an upward lift force is created whereas a negative value will cause a sinking in the high φ value range for the three higher frequencies on the contrary a positive f z is obtained in the high φ value range for the 0 5 hz case moreover the minimum value of f z occurs at approximately φ 0 75 π for the three higher frequencies and at approximately φ 0 25 π for the 0 5 hz case regarding the lateral force in the y direction the symmetry of undulation inevitably results in a zero mean value over a swimming cycle therefore the time histories of the instant lateral force f y over one period are shown in fig 11 for the four swimming frequencies in each plot of fig 11 three different φ cases are included and compared and the results of the pump propulsion the case of θ max 0 are provided for comparison as shown in fig 11 the pump propulsion has the maximal f y amplitude for all frequencies the minimum amplitude of f y approximately occurs when φ 0 5 π for the three higher frequencies in general compared with the thrust force and heave force the phase angle difference has a relatively smaller effect on the lateral force under the low frequency condition 3 3 effect of the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin θ max in this subsection the effect of the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin θ max on the hydrodynamic forces will be investigated the simulations were conducted with a fixed swimming frequency of f 1 0 hz and a range of θ max from 10 to 45 the remaining simulation conditions were consistent with the ones mentioned in the previous subsection fig 12 shows the contours of the mean hydrodynamic forces f x and f z in the low φ value range f x increases with the increase in θ max whereas there is an opposite variation trend in f x for the high φ value range the distribution of f z is similar to that of f x however the minimum value of f z approximately occurs when φ 0 75 π in general with the increase in θ max the effect of φ on the axial force and heave force becomes more remarkable in addition the time histories of the instantaneous lateral force over one period are shown in fig 13 for the cases where φ 0 and π as shown the amplitude of f y slightly decreases with the increase in θ max in both cases combined with the results of f y reported in the previous subsection it may be concluded that the active undulation of the ribbon fin results in a reduction in the lateral force 4 discussion in the previous section we studied the effects of the phase angle difference and the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin on the hydrodynamic forces of the fin body fish model the simulation results indicated that an in phase φ 0 cump propulsion would be seemingly helpful for swimming because a greater thrust was generated in this section a comparative analysis and discussion of the above simulation results will be presented based on the experimental observation of a live swimming large mouthed catfish as shown in fig 2 a juvenile large mouthed catfish almost 12 cm long is kept in an aquarium for observation and for the recording of its swimming pattern it should be noted that a similar swimming pattern has been observed in an adult large mouthed catfish which was approximately 1 m long however owing to the limitations of the experimental conditions ultimately a juvenile specimen was selected for the recording of its swimming gaits fig 14 shows the sequenced camera images from a through l of the swimming catfish almost covering a swimming cycle in these images the center line of the fish body and the lower edge of the ribbon fin are indicated with a red solid line and a green dash line respectively obviously both the fish body and the ribbon fin of the large mouthed catfish are undulating thus resulting in a cump propulsion an interesting phenomenon can be observed the waveforms of the center line of the fish body and the lower edge of the ribbon fin almost reach a crest or trough simultaneously compared with the simulation results presented in the previous section the swimming of the live large mouthed catfish can be regarded as an in phase cump propulsion consequently an important conclusion can be drawn namely that the large mouthed catfish can achieve greater thrust by means of the in phase cump propulsion attempting to identify the causes of thrust augmentation in the in phase cump propulsion the three aforementioned representative undulating motion cases will be further analyzed for comparison the first case is the pump propulsion and the remaining two are cump propulsion cases each of which has a different value of phase angle difference namely φ 0 and π in addition the two cump cases have a common angular amplitude for the ribbon fin θ max 30 and all three cases have a common swimming frequency f 2 0 hz fig 15 shows the pressure contours of a common side of the fin body fish model for these three cases during one half cycle stages a through f for comparison the contours of each stage are plotted for the same instant and all contours are plotted in the same pressure value range for each stage of swimming the corresponding top views of the fin body fish model are plotted on the upper left corner of each subfigure more specifically the waveforms of the fish body and those of the lower edge of the ribbon fin are depicted as a red solid line and a green solid line respectively as shown in fig 15 with the undulation of the fish model a high pressure zone propagates backward in all three cases from the point of the reactive force this high pressure zone is vital in terms of pushing the adjacent water downward thus affecting the generation of thrust for the pump propulsion case fig 15 a owing to the suppression of the active undulation of the ribbon fin the high pressure zone is vertically symmetrical at all stages for the in phase cump propulsion case fig 15 b there is a significant increase in the maximum pressure which presents a downward shift from the middle of the fish model to the ribbon fin compared with the pump case fig 15 b b through d on the contrary the maximum pressure presents a significant decrease for the remaining cump propulsion case fig 15 c furthermore fig 16 shows the waveforms of these three cases at instant c of fig 15 the black spot in each plot of fig 16 represents the center of the high pressure zone as the waveforms propagate backward from right to left in the x direction an assumed force f n that is perpendicular to the tangent line of the lower edge of the ribbon fin is used to assess the acting force of the ribbon fin on the adjacent water as shown in fig 16 there is a smallest angle of action β the angle between the x direction and the direction of f n in the in phase cump propulsion case compared with the remaining two cases according to the parallelogram law and newton s third law a small β is helpful in pushing the adjacent water downward thus producing a greater thrust for this moment in conclusion owing to the higher pressure area and the smaller angle of action a greater thrust can be achieved via the in phase cump propulsion see fig 9 5 conclusions in this work a novel swimming pattern of the ribbon fin propulsion in the swimming of a large mouthed catfish namely the cump propulsion has been preliminarily studied combining the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin a new fin body fish model was employed to numerically study the effect of this combined undulation pattern of the ribbon fin on the propulsive performance of fish more specifically the phase angle difference between the two undulations the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin and the swimming frequency were considered in general the phase angle difference and the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin have a significant impact on the thrust and heave forces of the fish model moreover the active undulation of the ribbon fin may result in a reduction in the lateral force in addition the swimming of a juvenile large mouthed catfish was observed and recorded experimentally it was then analyzed and compared with the simulation results as a result an important conclusion could be drawn the large mouthed catfish could obtain greater thrust by means of the in phase combined undulating motion a cause analysis of the thrust augmentation in the in phase combined undulating motion was conducted as well it was concluded that the changes in the high pressure area of the fish model and the force direction of the ribbon fin acting on water were important for the augmentation of thrust because of the experimental conditions and the lack of more detailed biomechanical data the present study was preliminary and had obvious limitations for example the proposed fin body fish model was simplified and the coupling effects of the surrounding water with the fish model were neglected in reality the swimming of fish is a complex problem of fluid structure interaction fsi thus the inherent flexibility of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin are important for its swimming performance however the present simulation method still cannot solve the fsi problem in addition the effects of the cump propulsion of the ribbon fin on the maneuverability and propulsive efficiency of fish need to be studied in future works

extensively as shown in fig 1 the actual undulations of ribbon fins in the existing accomplishments can be divided into two basic patterns 1 the undulation with a fixed baseline and 2 the undulation with a free baseline low 2009 most informed research works have been more focused on the knifefish which maintains a straight body and undulates the ribbon fin to swim in addition for the purpose of structural simplification the undulations of existing biomimetic ribbon fins can fall into the two aforementioned basic patterns e g fig 1 c and d in the fixed baseline pattern e g liu and curet 2018 2017 shirgaonkar et al 2008 the centers of rotation of all sequential fin rays are aligned and fixed fig 1 b in contrast in the free baseline pattern e g low 2007 meera and sudheer 2016a 2016b zhou and low 2014 both the top and bottom edges of the ribbon fins are undulatory and all fin rays remain parallel to one another during the undulation fig 1 a unlike the previous studies in this work we will investigate the swimming of a large mouthed catfish silurus soldatovi meridionalis chen that possesses an undulatory long based anal fin while it obviously undulates its body fig 2 based on this observation the large mouthed catfish performs a combined undulating motion pattern cump which comprises the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin inspired by this a combined fin body fish model is proposed to study the effect of the aforementioned cump propulsion on the swimming performance we have made efforts to obtain beneficial conclusions to understand this new type of swimming pattern and to develop biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles auvs by employing a numerical simulation method the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the proposed combined fin body fish model and the employed numerical method will be briefly introduced in section 3 we will first perform the validation calculations of our numerical simulation method then the effects of several key kinematics parameters of the cump propulsion on the propulsive performance will be investigated in section 4 a detailed discussion will be presented and the simulation results will be analyzed and compared with the swimming of a live large mouthed catfish in addition the reasons for thrust augmentation in the in phase cump propulsion will be detailed and analyzed finally we will summarize the conclusions of this work and will outline future research directions in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 fin body fish model based on the fin plate fish model used by lighthill and blake 1990 we propose a new fin body fish model that can simulate the undulations of both the fish body and the ribbon fin in this model the thickness of the fish body is considered small compared with its depth lighthill and blake 1990 consequently the catfish shown in fig 2 was modeled as an infinitesimally thin rectangular plate in this fin body fish model in exactly the same manner as in the prior simulations conducted by sprinkle et al 2017 fig 3 presents three undulating modes of the fin body fish model which comprise a red part indicating the fish body and a blue part indicating the ribbon fin the geometric parameters of this fish model include l the length of the fish s the height of the fish body h the height of the ribbon fin and h s h the total height of the fish in this work we will not perform a free swimming simulation meaning that the fish model is fixed in the computational domain and the undulations of both the fish body and the ribbon fin are prescribed as shown in fig 3 d the ribbon fin performs a sinusoidal swing around the point of intersection of the fish body and the ribbon fin in each cross sectional slice in this study the active undulation of the ribbon fin is given by sprinkle et al 2017 1 θ x t θ max sin 2 π f f i n t x λ f i n φ where θ x t is the angular displacement of the ribbon fin at location x and time t θ max is the peak amplitude f f i n is the undulating frequency of the ribbon fin λ f i n is the undulating wavelength of the ribbon fin and φ is the phase angle difference between the undulations of the fish body and the ribbon fin the undulation of the fish body can be expressed as a fourier series that is based on the experimental observations of an average mackerel videler and hess 1984 2 y b x t a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 sin 2 π f b o d y t x λ b o d y where y b x t is the lateral shift of the fish body at location x and time t f b o d y is the undulating frequency of the fish body and λ b o d y is the undulating wavelength of the fish body the undulating amplitude at location x is determined by three specific constants namely a 0 a 1 and a 2 the three undulation patterns of the fin body fish model shown in fig 3 will be considered in the first pattern fig 3 a the fish undulates the ribbon fin while maintaining the fish body rigid and flat i e y b x t 0 as shown in fig 3 b the active undulation of the ribbon fin is suppressed i e θ max 0 thus both the fish body and the ribbon fin perform a common parallel undulating motion pattern pump fig 3 c shows the aforementioned cump propulsion the top view of each undulation pattern is displayed in the lower part of fig 3 it may be observed that the third pattern can be regarded as a combination of the first two undulation patterns 2 2 numerical method the three dimensional 3d unsteady flow around the undulating fin body fish model was solved via numerical simulation all simulations were conducted using the commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd code of ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 the unstructured dynamic meshes based on spring and remeshing methods were applied to reduce the number of reconstructed meshes and minimize calculation time only few elements surrounding the fish model were changed a user defined function udf program was used to describe the undulation of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin as shown in fig 4 the computational domain is a hexahedron that ranges from 10 to 10 normalized by the length of the fish l along the stream wise direction the x direction and from 5 to 5 along the remaining two directions the size of the computational domain is sufficiently large to minimize the influence of the boundaries on the results obtained from numerical trials the left side was set as a velocity inlet boundary with a velocity value of u the x direction the right side was set as a pressure outlet boundary and the remaining four sides were stationary walls in addition the fin body fish model was an undulatory wall controlled by the udf it should be noted that because the thickness of the fish body was small compared with the size of the computational domain this infinitesimally thin fin body fish model was implemented by using a zero thickness and no slip wall directly in the fluent software the simple algorithm was applied for the pressure velocity coupling with the one equation spalart allmaras turbulence model strain vorticity based production absolute convergence criteria of 0 001 were adopted for all residuals the material was considered to be liquid water with a density of ρ 1 000 kg m 3 and a viscosity of μ 8 9 10 4 kg m s 3 results 3 1 validation of the simulation method to validate the reliability of the present simulation method in terms of the 3d unsteady flow problem an oscillating hydrofoil case kinsey and dumas 2012 at a high reynolds number re was considered more specifically a 3d naca0015 hydrofoil with an aspect ratio of a r 5 performed a combined pitch heave motion around its 1 3 chord point this combined pitch heave motion was characterized by θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ f f c u 0 14 and re 0 5 10 6 based on the chord length c h 0 c and θ 0 75 are the heaving and pitching amplitudes respectively f is the dimensionless reduced frequency f is the oscillation frequency u is the free stream velocity and ϕ 90 is the heaving phase with respect to the pitching motion the computational domain had a ratio of the same size as the one mentioned in the previous section the hydrofoil was discretized into 100 spanwise and 30 chordwise elements four continuous oscillating cycles were computed by performing 200 time steps per cycle fig 5 shows the comparison of the instantaneous force coefficients c x and c y on the hydrofoil between the present simulation results and the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 over an oscillating cycle the errors between both simulation results are also plotted in each sub graph as shown in fig 5 both errors are characterized by the alternatively positive and negative variations and the absolute values of both maximum errors are less than 0 4 more precisely to assess the coincidence degree of both results the root mean square error rmse values of 0 1726 and 0 2157 were calculated for force coefficients c x and c y respectively considering that the amplitudes of the variation of both force coefficients exceed the value of 4 in general both force coefficients of our present simulations agree well with the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 therefore the proposed simulation method is reliable for the unsteady flow problem the errors may be mainly attributed to the differences in the boundary conditions the mesh generation methods and the temporal resolutions as previously mentioned a zero thickness and no slip wall was used to implement the proposed fin body fish model owing to the small thickness of the fish body compared with the size of the computational domain the feasibility of this simplification was verified through a previous numerical case which was examined by moored 2018 the instant lift coefficients on an oscillating thin rectangular wing at a negative angle of attack namely α 5 were calculated under three different reduced frequencies i e k 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively unlike that of the above case the reduced frequency was defined as k π f c u where c 1 m is the chord length of the wing f is the heaving frequency and u 1 m s is the inflow velocity corresponding to re 0 68 10 5 the material is air the wing had an aspect ratio of a r 4 and a heaving amplitude of h 0 1 c in the numerical simulations of moored 2018 a 2 thick tear drop shaped airfoil was used to simulate the thin flat wing in contrast in the present numerical implementation a zero thickness rectangular wing was used directly for further comparison a non zero thickness 0 02 m thin flat wing was considered as well fig 6 a shows the comparison of the instant lift coefficients calculated via the present simulation method with that of moored 2018 over a time cycle in general both simulation results with zero and non zero thickness wings are compatible to the results of moored 2018 for all reduced frequencies the lift coefficient curves of the non zero thickness wing remain in the upward side compared with those of the other two wings for all three wings the magnitude of the lift coefficient may be seen to increase as the reduced frequency increases a negative phase shift in the lift oscillation may be observed as well furthermore an additional simulation was conducted using the liquid water material condition and the inflow velocity condition of u 0 4 m s corresponding to re 0 45 10 6 based on the chord length c as shown in fig 6 b similar variations in the instant lift coefficient may be noticed compared with fig 6 a the gaps between the resulting curves of zero and non zero thickness wings become wider as the magnitudes increases however they are still compatible it should be mentioned that the negative phase shift in the lift oscillation becomes more prominent fig 6 c and d present the flow streamlines around the zero and non zero thickness wings at the midspan cross section respectively both streamline figures are plotted for the case of k 0 5 at the final instant shown in fig 6 b although certain small differences exist in the detail of the flow field fundamentally the main flow field structure of these two wings is the same to summarize we may conclude that the zero thickness simplification is feasible for the unsteady flow problem around a thin body 3 2 effect of the phase angle difference φ we first examined the effect of the phase angle difference φ between the undulation of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin on the hydrodynamic forces the related geometric and kinematic parameters of the previously described fin body fish model will be specified in this subsection as shown in fig 3 a fin body fish model with l 1 m s 0 2 m and h 0 1 m is used in this study additionally the swimming of the fish model is described through eqs 1 and 2 with a 0 0 04 a 1 0 08 and a 2 0 16 λ f i n λ b o d y l and f f i n f b o d y f for ease of comparison five values of the phase angle difference namely φ 0 0 25 π 0 5 π 0 75 π and π in radians and four swimming frequencies namely f 0 5 hz 1 0 hz 1 5 hz and 2 0 hz will be considered in this subsection in addition a fixed angular amplitude of the ribbon fin of θ max 30 and an inflow velocity of u 0 4 m s will be applied corresponding to re 0 45 10 6 based on the fish length l prior to conducting a detailed computation a grid independence test for the pump propulsion with f 1 0 hz was conducted three different resolution meshes summarized in table 1 were selected the variations in the computed instant axial force f x and the lateral force f y for two swimming periods are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively a comparison of the results for the three different meshes indicates that the coarse mesh represents a lower thrust force compared with that of the remaining two meshes in contrast the results of the medium mesh and the fine mesh are in good agreement however certain small discrepancies in f x can be found in the peak positions the overall hydrodynamic performance of the fish model is not affected significantly in addition the time cost of the fine mesh simulation is nearly 2 5 times higher than that of the medium mesh case eventually the medium mesh was selected as the optimum computational mesh for the present study as shown in fig 8 three waveforms of the cump propulsion at the initial instant t 0 s are presented each waveform corresponds to a different value of phase angle difference it may be concluded that the phase angle difference has a great influence on the waveform of cump propulsion fig 9 shows the variations in the mean axial hydrodynamic force f x on the fin body fish model the abscissa stands for the phase angle difference and four different swimming frequencies are considered in our present simulations the fish is fixed in the middle of the computational domain and a constant inflow velocity is applied therefore f x indicates the mean value of the net axial force i e thrust drag a positive value of f x means that a net thrust is created and the fish has a tendency to swim forward in the x direction in each plot of fig 9 the horizontal gray dash line represents the mean net thrust value of the pump propulsion fig 3 b under the corresponding frequency condition in general a similar variation trend in f x may be observed for all frequencies except for the case where f 0 5 hz with the increase in φ from 0 to π f x decreases constantly for the three higher frequencies and it presents a minimum at φ 0 75 π for the 0 5 hz case furthermore the values of f x are greater than the corresponding values of the pump propulsion in the low φ value range for all frequencies meaning that an augmentation of thrust is achieved in the cump propulsion in contrast a thrust loss occurred in the high φ value range in addition owing to the flapping motion of the ribbon fin a heave force will be generated in the z direction fig 10 shows the mean heave forces f z on the fin body fish model for the swimming frequencies as expected the heave force of the pump propulsion has a value of zero owing to the suppression of the active undulation of the ribbon fin proportionately there is a similar variation trend in f z for the three higher frequencies more specifically a positive value of f z in the low φ value range means that an upward lift force is created whereas a negative value will cause a sinking in the high φ value range for the three higher frequencies on the contrary a positive f z is obtained in the high φ value range for the 0 5 hz case moreover the minimum value of f z occurs at approximately φ 0 75 π for the three higher frequencies and at approximately φ 0 25 π for the 0 5 hz case regarding the lateral force in the y direction the symmetry of undulation inevitably results in a zero mean value over a swimming cycle therefore the time histories of the instant lateral force f y over one period are shown in fig 11 for the four swimming frequencies in each plot of fig 11 three different φ cases are included and compared and the results of the pump propulsion the case of θ max 0 are provided for comparison as shown in fig 11 the pump propulsion has the maximal f y amplitude for all frequencies the minimum amplitude of f y approximately occurs when φ 0 5 π for the three higher frequencies in general compared with the thrust force and heave force the phase angle difference has a relatively smaller effect on the lateral force under the low frequency condition 3 3 effect of the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin θ max in this subsection the effect of the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin θ max on the hydrodynamic forces will be investigated the simulations were conducted with a fixed swimming frequency of f 1 0 hz and a range of θ max from 10 to 45 the remaining simulation conditions were consistent with the ones mentioned in the previous subsection fig 12 shows the contours of the mean hydrodynamic forces f x and f z in the low φ value range f x increases with the increase in θ max whereas there is an opposite variation trend in f x for the high φ value range the distribution of f z is similar to that of f x however the minimum value of f z approximately occurs when φ 0 75 π in general with the increase in θ max the effect of φ on the axial force and heave force becomes more remarkable in addition the time histories of the instantaneous lateral force over one period are shown in fig 13 for the cases where φ 0 and π as shown the amplitude of f y slightly decreases with the increase in θ max in both cases combined with the results of f y reported in the previous subsection it may be concluded that the active undulation of the ribbon fin results in a reduction in the lateral force 4 discussion in the previous section we studied the effects of the phase angle difference and the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin on the hydrodynamic forces of the fin body fish model the simulation results indicated that an in phase φ 0 cump propulsion would be seemingly helpful for swimming because a greater thrust was generated in this section a comparative analysis and discussion of the above simulation results will be presented based on the experimental observation of a live swimming large mouthed catfish as shown in fig 2 a juvenile large mouthed catfish almost 12 cm long is kept in an aquarium for observation and for the recording of its swimming pattern it should be noted that a similar swimming pattern has been observed in an adult large mouthed catfish which was approximately 1 m long however owing to the limitations of the experimental conditions ultimately a juvenile specimen was selected for the recording of its swimming gaits fig 14 shows the sequenced camera images from a through l of the swimming catfish almost covering a swimming cycle in these images the center line of the fish body and the lower edge of the ribbon fin are indicated with a red solid line and a green dash line respectively obviously both the fish body and the ribbon fin of the large mouthed catfish are undulating thus resulting in a cump propulsion an interesting phenomenon can be observed the waveforms of the center line of the fish body and the lower edge of the ribbon fin almost reach a crest or trough simultaneously compared with the simulation results presented in the previous section the swimming of the live large mouthed catfish can be regarded as an in phase cump propulsion consequently an important conclusion can be drawn namely that the large mouthed catfish can achieve greater thrust by means of the in phase cump propulsion attempting to identify the causes of thrust augmentation in the in phase cump propulsion the three aforementioned representative undulating motion cases will be further analyzed for comparison the first case is the pump propulsion and the remaining two are cump propulsion cases each of which has a different value of phase angle difference namely φ 0 and π in addition the two cump cases have a common angular amplitude for the ribbon fin θ max 30 and all three cases have a common swimming frequency f 2 0 hz fig 15 shows the pressure contours of a common side of the fin body fish model for these three cases during one half cycle stages a through f for comparison the contours of each stage are plotted for the same instant and all contours are plotted in the same pressure value range for each stage of swimming the corresponding top views of the fin body fish model are plotted on the upper left corner of each subfigure more specifically the waveforms of the fish body and those of the lower edge of the ribbon fin are depicted as a red solid line and a green solid line respectively as shown in fig 15 with the undulation of the fish model a high pressure zone propagates backward in all three cases from the point of the reactive force this high pressure zone is vital in terms of pushing the adjacent water downward thus affecting the generation of thrust for the pump propulsion case fig 15 a owing to the suppression of the active undulation of the ribbon fin the high pressure zone is vertically symmetrical at all stages for the in phase cump propulsion case fig 15 b there is a significant increase in the maximum pressure which presents a downward shift from the middle of the fish model to the ribbon fin compared with the pump case fig 15 b b through d on the contrary the maximum pressure presents a significant decrease for the remaining cump propulsion case fig 15 c furthermore fig 16 shows the waveforms of these three cases at instant c of fig 15 the black spot in each plot of fig 16 represents the center of the high pressure zone as the waveforms propagate backward from right to left in the x direction an assumed force f n that is perpendicular to the tangent line of the lower edge of the ribbon fin is used to assess the acting force of the ribbon fin on the adjacent water as shown in fig 16 there is a smallest angle of action β the angle between the x direction and the direction of f n in the in phase cump propulsion case compared with the remaining two cases according to the parallelogram law and newton s third law a small β is helpful in pushing the adjacent water downward thus producing a greater thrust for this moment in conclusion owing to the higher pressure area and the smaller angle of action a greater thrust can be achieved via the in phase cump propulsion see fig 9 5 conclusions in this work a novel swimming pattern of the ribbon fin propulsion in the swimming of a large mouthed catfish namely the cump propulsion has been preliminarily studied combining the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin a new fin body fish model was employed to numerically study the effect of this combined undulation pattern of the ribbon fin on the propulsive performance of fish more specifically the phase angle difference between the two undulations the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin and the swimming frequency were considered in general the phase angle difference and the angular amplitude of the ribbon fin have a significant impact on the thrust and heave forces of the fish model moreover the active undulation of the ribbon fin may result in a reduction in the lateral force in addition the swimming of a juvenile large mouthed catfish was observed and recorded experimentally it was then analyzed and compared with the simulation results as a result an important conclusion could be drawn the large mouthed catfish could obtain greater thrust by means of the in phase combined undulating motion a cause analysis of the thrust augmentation in the in phase combined undulating motion was conducted as well it was concluded that the changes in the high pressure area of the fish model and the force direction of the ribbon fin acting on water were important for the augmentation of thrust because of the experimental conditions and the lack of more detailed biomechanical data the present study was preliminary and had obvious limitations for example the proposed fin body fish model was simplified and the coupling effects of the surrounding water with the fish model were neglected in reality the swimming of fish is a complex problem of fluid structure interaction fsi thus the inherent flexibility of the fish body and that of the ribbon fin are important for its swimming performance however the present simulation method still cannot solve the fsi problem in addition the effects of the cump propulsion of the ribbon fin on the maneuverability and propulsive efficiency of fish need to be studied in future works

accordance with the proposed model an observer based model reference adaptive controller is developed leading to a convex optimization problem subject to matrix inequalities the reference heading angle is extracted from an adaptive line of sight los guidance algorithm based on waypoints finally the simulation results of tracking several maneuvering motion paths indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach is satisfactory and superior compared with pid controller keywords unnamed surface vessel adaptive observer based control sliding mode line of sight linear matrix inequality 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicle usv has been used intensively in recent years for scientific research and military applications yan et al 2010 yang et al 2011 pastore and djapic 2010 svec and gupta 2012 autonomous behaviors of these vehicles are highly related to the performances of their guidance navigation and control gnc system at the heart of which it demands a proper controller usvs are subjected to nonlinearities and unknown dynamics from both system and environmental aspects therefore designing a proper controller algorithm has motivated many studies as in conte et al 2016 an autopilot system for a small unmanned surface vehicle has been designed to track underwater targets jin 2016 proposed a novel control for under actuated usvs subject to uncertainties and time varying parameters based on los range and angle constraints in mcninch et al 2010 ashrafiuon et al 2008 a sliding mode control for 3 dof model of an under actuated surface vehicle in the presence of uncertainties was presented and experimentally implemented for trajectory tracking a robust neural network tracking controller for usvs in the presence of un modeled dynamics and environmental disturbances has been suggested by shojaei 2015 wang and er 2015 pan et al 2013 in lee et al 2010 velagic et al 2003 an experimental model of a small boat was controlled to track the path of target waypoints generated by the los guidance algorithm using pid based on the 2nd order nomoto model in most of the investigations a 3 dof model of usvs including the surge sway and yaw motions has been considered and the roll motion which may have noticeable effects on maneuvering behaviors especially in a small vessel has been ignored the control problem of usvs may become more complex when a 4 dof model is addressed so far not many research works have been carried out in the related field and there are still many unsolved problems nevertheless in ghorbani 2014 salarieh and ghorbani 2011 optimal path following problem for a high speed planning boat using gauss pseudo spectral method was presented to satisfy the constraints on the states and the input also in xi and sun 2006 a feedback stabilization of a high speed planning vessel using controllable transom flap was studied in this paper a novel controller for the surge and heading of a usv is presented based on a 4 dof model of the usv motions for control purposes the surge motion and steering motion of the usv is separated an adaptive sliding mode controller for surge motion based on lyapunov stability analysis is designed to estimate the unknown terms and reject the disturbance effects also an observer based model reference adaptive state feedback controller based on an augmented model including main states of the system and tracking error integral is proposed to control the steering motion and to estimate the state variables and controller gains design parameters in the presented method are deduced from solving a set of matrix inequalities using an iterative linearization based path following method in addition in order to follow waypoints the reference heading angle is computed by an adaptive los guidance algorithm the proposed method is applied on to numerical model of usv for track keeping missions with the desired velocity in several waypoint structures and its advantages are depicted in comparison with a conventional pid controller the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the kinematics and dynamics of the applied 4 dof model of usv section 3 is focused on designing separated surge and heading controller of the system section 4 is devoted to defining adaptive los guidance algorithm followed by numerical simulation results described in section 5 and finally conclusions are provided in section 6 2 system description an appropriate model description plays an important role in the design of motion control systems for marine vessels typically motions of a vessel as a rigid body in the space may be expressed in 6 dof which includes the surge sway and heave translational motions and the roll pitch and yaw rotational motions in the body fixed axes see table 1 and fig 1 nevertheless for the control purposes of a maneuvering surface vessel dynamic models based on 3 dof considering the surge sway yaw motions or 4 dof considering the surge sway yaw and roll motions have been adopted frequently mcninch et al 2010 svendsen et al 2012 son and nomoto 1982 to reduce the model complexities for a small surface vessel the rolling attitude is an important behavior due to its coupling effects on the other maneuvering motions and therefore a 4 dof dynamic model is considered here for the speed and steering control of the proposed usv the relations between the usv s position and orientation and its velocities are expressed by the following kinematic equations 1 η r η υ where η x y ϕ ψ t is the vector of position and orientation in the earth frame with e index in fig 1 and υ u v p r t is the vector of velocities in the body frame with b index in fig 1 and r η is a transformation matrix as follows perez 2006 2 r η c o s ψ s i n ψ c o s ϕ 0 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ c o s ϕ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 c o s ϕ in this formula ϕ and ψ are roll and yaw rotations about x e axis and z e axis respectively to complete the system description dynamical equations which are formulated using taylor s series expansion method based on the newton euler or lagrange laws must be considered in this regard the 4 dof equation of motions for the usv is described by eq 3 neglecting 3rd order and higher terms and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients svendsen et al 2012 fossen 2011 lewandowski 2004 we have to declare that dynamical model with lower order terms is only suitable for small rudder angle therefore a rudder system as will be presented in section 4 was used to limit the magnitude of the rudder angle variations 3 m x u u m y v v r m l g y r r 2 y p m h g p

total resistance of the vessel in calm water in straight moving which is related to the forward speed u as shown in fig 1 the usv considered in this paper is a small mono hull surface vessel with maximum speed of 15 k n o t froude number 1 overall length l o of 6 m maximum beam of 2 m average dead rise angle of 23 and its displacement equals to 1 7 metric ton in full load displacement for the proposed usv r u was estimated using the commercial software maxsurf 20 giving a maximum value of 3700 n in 15 k n o t s approx 8 m s the resistance data are used in a tabular form in the following simulations for the control algorithm nominal values of the physical and hydrodynamic parameters in si unit which describe the mathematical model of the usv are summarized according to table 2 the propulsion system of the considered usv is based on an outboard motor and provides main control inputs of the system which are thrust force f t and thrust angle δ r as depicted in fig 3 control inputs

nonlinear and directly related to factors such as properties of the hull form sea state vessel s direction and so on in this article the wind disturbance is considered according to fossen 2011 and the readers are referred to it for more details 3 motion control based on the dynamic model ref to eq 3 here for the control purposes of the proposed usv the surge motion and heading motion has been considered separately in this section as the main contribution of this manuscript an adaptive sliding mode controller and an augmented observer based adaptive state feedback controller are proposed to control velocity and steering of the usv respectively in the presence of disturbances 3 1 surge control as seen in the first relation of eq 3 the surge motion of the surface vessel is described by a

and b and other variables and parameters are previously defined if μ d 1 m a x where μ is design parameter and d 1 m a x is the maximum bound of b d 1 t in the surge direction then control input defined in eq 8 with sliding surface s u u d and the adaptation laws of eq 9 guarantees convergency of a desired surge velocity u d under uncertainties and disturbances 8 τ c u b ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 v r a ˆ 2 r

surface remains in a bound around zero on the other hand the parameter estimation error converges to a residual set which is of the order of the disturbance bound if reference input satisfies persistency excitations pe conditions otherwise the parameter estimation error may grow unbounded ioannou and sun 2012 remark 1 hwang and chen 1990 during the estimation process based on the adaption law of eq 9 if b ˆ tends to zero or very small values then the inverse of b ˆ used in eq 8 can leads to a singularity problem this problem generates very large control input which is not possible from the practical point of view therefore b as a lower bound of b ˆ is used to get rid of singularity problem by replacing following adaption law for b ˆ instead of eq 9 17 b ˆ max b γ 4 s τ c u r u d t 3 2 steering control regulation of usv s orientation to follow a reference heading angle is performed by the steering controller by considering x p v p r ϕ ψ t as a new state vector the following state

d 2 t τ d v τ d p τ d r 0 0 let u p τ c v for brevity so eq 18 can be rewritten as a common state space model 20 x p a p x p b p u p d p t y p c p x p with 21 a p m 1 a 1 b p m 1 b 1 d p t m 1 d 2 t where a p and b p are matrices with known and additive unknown terms eq 20 is used as a model to control heading angle in order to achieve appropriate turning motions since the hydrodynamic coefficients of the usv change during the operation mode and the system is under disturbances effects an adaptive robust state feedback controller based on the proposed method in lavretsky and wise 2013 can be a good choice to achieve the desired performance but the state feedback controller needs all the state variables of the system to be measured which may be an unreasonable assumption and impossible in some practical applications especially when the number of state variables increases therefore estimation of the unmeasurable state variables by an observer was considered to relax the mentioned assumption define the integrated output tracking error vector as 22 e y i y p y c m d c p x p y c m d where y c m d ℝ r p is a reference input let x x p e y i ℝ n p r p as an augmented

respectively we claim the state variables of following observer converge to the states of the system described in eq 23 with a proper selection of observer gain l 25 x ˆ a x ˆ b r y c m d b u p l y c

matching conditions such as there exists a k to a r a b k to estimate the main states by the observer and to track the reference input by the output of the system the state estimation error and the model reference tracking error have to be 27 x e o x x ˆ x ˆ e r x ˆ x r x r consider a control input as 28 u p k ˆ x ˆ where k ˆ is an estimated value of the controller gain define k k k ˆ as the estimation error of the controller gain and replace eqs 23 25 and 26 into dynamical errors and after some manipulations we get 29 e r a r e r l c e o b k x ˆ e o a l e o d t where a l a l c as a result we will have the following theorem theorem 2 consider uncertain system of eq 23 observer system of eq 25 and reference model of eq 26 with the set of matrices defined in eqs 19 21 and 24 let there exist the controller gain k the observer gain l and positive definite matrices p 1 and p 2 and a positive scalar λ such that matrix inequality 30 s y m p 1 a p 1 b k l t c t p 1 s y m p 2 a p 2

depicts v 2 is negative outside of the set ε 0 therefore if disturbance term is zero converging e r and e o are asymptotically stable on the other hand if disturbance term is persistent e r and e o converge to a bound around zero also as previously stated in subsection 3 1 while v 2 is negative outside of the set ε 0 and the input reference is pe the parameter estimation converges to a set of the order of the disturbance level around true value on the other hand in the cases that v 2 becomes positive the parameter estimation error may grow unbounded that is known as the parameter drift phenomenon generally there exist several methods such as dead zone and e modification to modify the precision of parameter estimation in the drift mode for more details the interested readers are referred to ioannou and sun 2012 lavretsky and wise 2013 remark 2 since eq 30 contains terms of the product of unknown parameters such as p 1 p 2 k and l so the problem is a bilinear matrix inequality bmi generally there is not any method to get the global solution of bmi problems in this paper in order to get local solutions of bmi firstly we apply a congruence transformation to reduce the number of bmi terms and then using an iterative linearization method proposed in chen et al 2016 chang et al 2015 the rest of bmis convert into lmis in this way by pre and post multiplying q 0 by d i a g p 1

variables are derived from luenberger observer based on steering model defined in eq 25 4 los guidance algorithm usvs perform a series of maneuvers based on the predefined points or the target points namely the so called waypoints there are several methods for generating an optimal continuous and smooth path based on the location of waypoints and output data of the navigation subsystem in the field of path planning tsourdos et al 2010 in this paper adaptive los as a popular guidance algorithm has been used to generate the desired heading angle in the presence of the environmental disturbances more details of this method presented in anastasios and fossen 2014 let x t y t describes the current position of a vessel that acquired from gps s data and x k y k is the location of kth waypoint as shown in fig 4 the path following objective in the surface motions satisfy if lim t 0 y e t 0 where y e t is the cross track error defines as 38 y e t x k x t s i n γ p y t y k c o s γ p where γ p is the path tangential 39 γ p a r c t a n 2 y k y t x k x t where a r c t a n 2 y x is similar to a r c t a n y x except that the signs of both arguments are used to determine the quadrant of the results the desired heading angle in the presence of disturbances can be calculated based on the following equation 40 ψ d γ p a r c t a n k p y e k i y i n t β y i n t u h y e δ h 2 y e κ y i n t 2 where k p 1 δ h and k i k p κ for κ 0 are proportional and integral gains respectively and u h u 2 v 2 is speed of the vessel and β as drift angle defines as follows 41 β a r c t a n 2 v u where u and v are the surge and sway velocity respectively in this equations δ h which can be constant or varying is look ahead distance between the projection of the vessel s position x t y t on to the path between two sequence waypoints and point x l o s y l o s which is located on the path tangential line according to the presented formula in anastasios and fossen 2014 the time varying look ahead distance can be deduced from 42 δ h δ m a x δ m i n e k δ y e 2 δ m i n where δ m i n δ m a x and k δ are the minimum maximum values and the convergence rate for δ h based on this equation if vessel is far from of the path δ h δ m i n and if vessel is close to the path δ h δ m a x the steering motion controller described by eq 28 is responsible to regulate the usv s direction toward ψ d extracted from eq 40 the distance between the current position of usv and target waypoint is calculated as follows 43 d y k y t 2 x k x t 2 define r 0 n l o where n typically is 2 as suggested by fossen 2011 and l o is the overall length of the usv if d r 0 then the usv is in the target zone with acceptance radius r 0 and next waypoint x k 1 y k 1 will be selected it should be noticed that the waypoint s location may cause high amplitude rudder movements and excessive rudder s rate fig 5 as a block diagram of rudder machinery can be used to limit the maximum amplitude of the rudder in this figure δ m a x and δ m a x are the maximum values for the rudder angle and its rate respectively although this is out of the field of this manuscript just as a proposal designing an anti windup compensator to modify control inputs in the presence of saturation in an actuator such as a rudder system can be considered for further investigations 5 results and discussions a block diagram of the proposed gnc system for the usv is shown in fig 6 in this gnc system the navigation subsystem measures and estimates the necessary variables required by the control blocks by using sensors and observer the guidance block determines a the desired heading angle based on an adaptive los algorithm by comparing the current position of the usv and the target waypoint the control subsystem includes an adaptive sliding mode to follow surge velocity and to estimate unknown parameters and observer based adaptive state feedback to control steering motions and to estimate unmeasurable states and controller gains under disturbances simultaneously although experimental results would allow a realistic performance evaluation of a control system in the presence of measurement errors thruster dynamics environmental disturbances and other effects however due to the tremendous challenges associated with the practical implementation of a gnc system on a usv including platform design and manufacturing algorithm development debugging and etc the authors typically focus on implementing control algorithms in simulation studies rather than in real environments nevertheless in order to take into account real effects we did our best to model most parts of the system and simulation details on the basis of reliable approach for the sake of avoiding tremendous challenges the numerical simulations were performed in matlab software version r2013b and the convex optimization problem was solved by yalmip sedumi packages lofberg 2004 sturm 1999 time step size was considered equal to 0 01 s in the numerical simulations for solving a set of differential equations in addition the position of the vessel was updated with 1 s steps in navigation subsystem which resembles a 1 h z frequency of position updates by a gps system for the design of a comprehensive robust adaptive control system the disturbances and uncertainties of the system which typically includes highly nonlinear terms have to be considered however the only applied environmental disturbances to the usv studied in this manuscript was the wind effects with mean speed 8 m s which was modeled in accordance with fossen 2011 the uncertainties of the plant matrices are supposed to change in a range of δ a p 0 4 m 1 a 1 and δ b p 0 4 m 1 b 1 these uncertainties are inserted to the system as additive terms such that a p and b p defined in eq 20 are a p 1 0 4 m 1 a 1 and b p 1 0 4 m 1 b 1 the desired surge velocity considered as a square pulse and the tuning parameters for the adaption laws of the sliding mode controller

the developed gnc system were simulated and examined in several structures of waypoints as it is previously stated the radius of the circle of acceptance r 0 is assumed to be two times of vessel length and the reference heading angle is computed by adaptive los algorithm according to the current position of the vessel and the location of target waypoints in addition in order to show the excellence of the proposed method compared with the conventional methods we implemented a pid controller to the surge and heading motions fig 7 shows a track keeping performance for 8 waypoints located on a straight line in which the distance between the sequential waypoints is supposed to be approximately equal for speed tracking objective the desired surge velocity has been considered to be a square pulse with a mean amplitude 7 m s the results of this simulation indicate a successful path following based on waypoints the proposed method and pid controller behave in a similar way except a partly deviation from the straight line in the first moments using the proposed method the surge velocity and heading angle tracking for maneuver in a zigzag path are presented in fig 8 from this figure it is evident that the pid controller has a series of oscillation due to the existence of uncertainty disturbance and nonlinear terms while sliding mode controller tracks desired surge velocity properly nevertheless the sliding mode controller has a slower rise time because of some restrictions on the selection of design parameters regarding remark 1 also the proposed method in heading tracking is robust against disturbances and uncertainties and has a faster rate of convergence and lower steady error in comparison with the pid controller fig 9 shows the result of trajectory tracking for 9 waypoints placed on a zigzag path based on two scenarios for n 2 and n 5 this figure also implies that the precision of waypoints following increases as smaller r 0 is adapted but from point of practical view it is difficult to access a turn in a limited area smaller r 0 in a very short time and sometimes it makes some deviations in the initial moments after passing the intended waypoint therefore choosing an appropriate r 0 is very critical in the precision of waypoints tracking especially when the path is a maze and includes obstacles time responses of the state variables and their estimations by the designed observer in zigzag track keeping for n 2 are shown in fig 10 for 50 s it can be seen that the estimations quickly tend to the main states time responses of control forces in the direction of surge τ c u sway τ c v and thrust f t and rudder s angle δ r are shown in fig 11 it is observed from these figures that both of the proposed controllers give control efforts with a smaller magnitude and lesser oscillations compared with pid controller in contrast the control efforts in pid controller especially τ c v and f t depict high frequency fluctuations that are unfavorable in the point of practical view variation of the predicted unknown parameters a i for i 1 2 3 b and η in the surge motion and estimation of the state feedback controller gains in the steering motion are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively it is worth noting that the precision and the rate of adaption are related to the sufficiently rich property of reference signals and selection of the design parameters for instance by appropriate selection of design parameters the estimated values of a i for i 1 2 3 converge to their real values and b ˆ converges to its lower bound b on the other hand adaptive gains of the heading controller are bounded and exhibit convergence to constant values that are not their ideal values our trials depict that the exact adaption of these controller gains will be achieved by tuning of γ but at the cost of increasing the magnitude and the oscillations of control efforts fig 14 displays the usv s motion trajectory when n 2 for 13 waypoints located in an infinity loop with the same start and final waypoint according to this figure both controllers can make the usv to follow the sequential waypoints but the proposed method shows a more straight line manner leading to a shorter travelling distance for the usv to complete the maneuver as can be seen there have been some circulations around the forth and tenth waypoints this phenomenon was also observed in the work of lee et al 2010 which may be related to the performance of the guidance algorithm and can be considered for future investigations 6 conclusion this manuscript presented a novel controller design method for an unmanned surface vessel a 4 dof dynamic maneuvering model considering the surge sway yaw and roll motions were developed for the control of the proposed unmanned surface vessel in the presence of environmental wind disturbances by separating the surge motion from other degrees of freedom in the mathematical model an adaptive sliding mode as a robust controller was proposed to estimate unknown parameters and control the desired surge velocity on the other hand a robust adaptive state feedback controller with an integral term of output tracking error as a new state variable was also proposed to track a reference heading angle the existence of feedback of tracking error integral leads to the proposed controller behaves like a state feedback controller with pi term that amends the performance of the controller in comparison with the conventional state feedback controller due to the partial measurement of the state variables a structure for observer was presented to get the unmeasurable states hence the stability analysis of the tracking error and estimation error was performed by considering a suitable lyapunov function the reference heading angle has been derived from an adaptive los guidance algorithm based on waypoints location the results of the proposed scheme in comparison with a pid controller to track

22753,the present study addresses the speed and steering controller design for the maneuvering motions of an unmanned surface vessel usv based on a 4 dof nonlinear mathematical model for the maneuvering motions of the proposed usv with multi inputs and multi outputs an adaptive sliding mode controller based on lyapunov analysis is designed to follow the desired velocity and to estimate unknown parameters for the separated surge motion in addition for the steering motion control an augmented model including the heading motion and output tracking error integral is presented in accordance with the proposed model an observer based model reference adaptive controller is developed leading to a convex optimization problem subject to matrix inequalities the reference heading angle is extracted from an adaptive line of sight los guidance algorithm based on waypoints finally the simulation results of tracking several maneuvering motion paths indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach is satisfactory and superior compared with pid controller keywords unnamed surface vessel adaptive observer based control sliding mode line of sight linear matrix inequality 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicle usv has been used intensively in recent years for scientific research and military applications yan et al 2010 yang et al 2011 pastore and djapic 2010 svec and gupta 2012 autonomous behaviors of these vehicles are highly related to the performances of their guidance navigation and control gnc system at the heart of which it demands a proper controller usvs are subjected to nonlinearities and unknown dynamics from both system and environmental aspects therefore designing a proper controller algorithm has motivated many studies as in conte et al 2016 an autopilot system for a small unmanned surface vehicle has been designed to track underwater targets jin 2016 proposed a novel control for under actuated usvs subject to uncertainties and time varying parameters based on los range and angle constraints in mcninch et al 2010 ashrafiuon et al 2008 a sliding mode control for 3 dof model of an under actuated surface vehicle in the presence of uncertainties was presented and experimentally implemented for trajectory tracking a robust neural network tracking controller for usvs in the presence of un modeled dynamics and environmental disturbances has been suggested by shojaei 2015 wang and er 2015 pan et al 2013 in lee et al 2010 velagic et al 2003 an experimental model of a small boat was controlled to track the path of target waypoints generated by the los guidance algorithm using pid based on the 2nd order nomoto model in most of the investigations a 3 dof model of usvs including the surge sway and yaw motions has been considered and the roll motion which may have noticeable effects on maneuvering behaviors especially in a small vessel has been ignored the control problem of usvs may become more complex when a 4 dof model is addressed so far not many research works have been carried out in the related field and there are still many unsolved problems nevertheless in ghorbani 2014 salarieh and ghorbani 2011 optimal path following problem for a high speed planning boat using gauss pseudo spectral method was presented to satisfy the constraints on the states and the input also in xi and sun 2006 a feedback stabilization of a high speed planning vessel using controllable transom flap was studied in this paper a novel controller for the surge and heading of a usv is presented based on a 4 dof model of the usv motions for control purposes the surge motion and steering motion of the usv is separated an adaptive sliding mode controller for surge motion based on lyapunov stability analysis is designed to estimate the unknown terms and reject the disturbance effects also an observer based model reference adaptive state feedback controller based on an augmented model including main states of the system and tracking error integral is proposed to control the steering motion and to estimate the state variables and controller gains design parameters in the presented method are deduced from solving a set of matrix inequalities using an iterative linearization based path following method in addition in order to follow waypoints the reference heading angle is computed by an adaptive los guidance algorithm the proposed method is applied on to numerical model of usv for track keeping missions with the desired velocity in several waypoint structures and its advantages are depicted in comparison with a conventional pid controller the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the kinematics and dynamics of the applied 4 dof model of usv section 3 is focused on designing separated surge and heading controller of the system section 4 is devoted to defining adaptive los guidance algorithm followed by numerical simulation results described in section 5 and finally conclusions are provided in section 6 2 system description an appropriate model description plays an important role in the design of motion control systems for marine vessels typically motions of a vessel as a rigid body in the space may be expressed in 6 dof which includes the surge sway and heave translational motions and the roll pitch and yaw rotational motions in the body fixed axes see table 1 and fig 1 nevertheless for the control purposes of a maneuvering surface vessel dynamic models based on 3 dof considering the surge sway yaw motions or 4 dof considering the surge sway yaw and roll motions have been adopted frequently mcninch et al 2010 svendsen et al 2012 son and nomoto 1982 to reduce the model complexities for a small surface vessel the rolling attitude is an important behavior due to its coupling effects on the other maneuvering motions and therefore a 4 dof dynamic model is considered here for the speed and steering control of the proposed usv the relations between the usv s position and orientation and its velocities are expressed by the following kinematic equations 1 η r η υ where η x y ϕ ψ t is the vector of position and orientation in the earth frame with e index in fig 1 and υ u v p r t is the vector of velocities in the body frame with b index in fig 1 and r η is a transformation matrix as follows perez 2006 2 r η c o s ψ s i n ψ c o s ϕ 0

which are formulated using taylor s series expansion method based on the newton euler or lagrange laws must be considered in this regard the 4 dof equation of motions for the usv is described by eq 3 neglecting 3rd order and higher terms and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients svendsen et al 2012 fossen 2011 lewandowski 2004 we have to declare that dynamical model with lower order terms is only suitable for small rudder angle therefore a rudder system as will be presented in section 4 was used to limit the magnitude of the rudder angle variations 3 m x u u m y v v r m l g y r r 2 y p m h g p

total resistance of the vessel in calm water in straight moving which is related to the forward speed u as shown in fig 1 the usv considered in this paper is a small mono hull surface vessel with maximum speed of 15 k n o t froude number 1 overall length l o of 6 m maximum beam of 2 m average dead rise angle of 23 and its displacement equals to 1 7 metric ton in full load displacement for the proposed usv r u was estimated using the commercial software maxsurf 20 giving a maximum value of 3700 n in 15 k n o t s approx 8 m s the resistance data are used in a tabular form in the following simulations for the control algorithm nominal values of the physical and hydrodynamic parameters in si unit which describe the mathematical model of the usv are summarized according to table 2 the propulsion system of the considered usv is based on an outboard motor and provides main control inputs of the system which are thrust force f t and thrust angle δ r as depicted in fig 3 control inputs

nonlinear and directly related to factors such as properties of the hull form sea state vessel s direction and so on in this article the wind disturbance is considered according to fossen 2011 and the readers are referred to it for more details 3 motion control based on the dynamic model ref to eq 3 here for the control purposes of the proposed usv the surge motion and heading motion has been considered separately in this section as the main contribution of this manuscript an adaptive sliding mode controller and an augmented observer based adaptive state feedback controller are proposed to control velocity and steering of the usv respectively in the presence of disturbances 3 1 surge control as seen in the first relation of eq 3 the surge motion of the surface vessel is described by a nonlinear differential equation a sliding mode controller has been chosen to follow the desired surge velocity and to estimate unknown parameters of the model by considering surge motion as a separated state variable the first part of eq 3 can be established as 6 u 1 m x u m y v v r m l g y r r 2 y p m h g p r r u τ c u d 1 t where d 1 t is the effects of environmental wind disturbances and interaction of unknown variables on the surge motion define b 1 m x u a 1 m y v b a 2 m l g y r b and a 3 y p m h g b as unknown parameters eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 u a 1 v r a 2 r 2 a 3 p r b r

and b and other variables and parameters are previously defined if μ d 1 m a x where μ is design parameter and d 1 m a x is the maximum bound of b d 1 t in the surge direction then control input defined in eq 8 with sliding surface s u u d and the adaptation laws of eq 9 guarantees convergency of a desired surge velocity u d under uncertainties and disturbances 8 τ c u b ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 v r a ˆ 2 r

surface remains in a bound around zero on the other hand the parameter estimation error converges to a residual set which is of the order of the disturbance bound if reference input satisfies persistency excitations pe conditions otherwise the parameter estimation error may grow unbounded ioannou and sun 2012 remark 1 hwang and chen 1990 during the estimation process based on the adaption law of eq 9 if b ˆ tends to zero or very small values then the inverse of b ˆ used in eq 8 can leads to a singularity problem this problem generates very large control input which is not possible from the practical point of view therefore b as a lower bound of b ˆ is used to get rid of singularity problem by replacing following adaption law for b ˆ instead of eq 9 17 b ˆ max b γ 4 s τ c u r u d t 3 2 steering control regulation of usv s orientation to follow a reference heading angle is performed by the steering controller by considering x p v p r ϕ ψ t as a new state vector the following state

d 2 t τ d v τ d p τ d r 0 0 let u p τ c v for brevity so eq 18 can be rewritten as a common state space model 20 x p a p x p b p u p d p t y p c p x p with 21 a p m 1 a 1 b p m 1 b 1 d p t m 1 d 2 t where a p and b p are matrices with known and additive unknown terms eq 20 is used as a model to control heading angle in order to achieve appropriate turning motions since the hydrodynamic coefficients of the usv change during the operation mode and the system is under disturbances effects an adaptive robust state feedback controller based on the proposed method in lavretsky and wise 2013 can be a good choice to achieve the desired performance but the state feedback controller needs all the state variables of the system to be measured which may be an unreasonable assumption and impossible in some practical applications especially when the number of state variables increases therefore estimation of the unmeasurable state variables by an observer was considered to relax the mentioned assumption define the integrated output tracking error vector as 22 e y i y p y c m d c p x p y c m d where y c m d ℝ r p is a reference input let x x p e y i ℝ n p r p as an augmented

respectively we claim the state variables of following observer converge to the states of the system described in eq 23 with a proper selection of observer gain l 25 x ˆ a x ˆ b r y c m d b u p l y c

matching conditions such as there exists a k to a r a b k to estimate the main states by the observer and to track the reference input by the output of the system the state estimation error and the model reference tracking error have to be 27 x e o x x ˆ x ˆ e r x ˆ x r x r consider a control input as 28 u p k ˆ x ˆ where k ˆ is an estimated value of the controller gain define k k k ˆ as the estimation error of the controller gain and replace eqs 23 25 and 26 into dynamical errors and after some manipulations we get 29 e r a r e r l c e o b k x ˆ e o a l e o d t where a l a l c as a result we will have the following theorem theorem 2 consider uncertain system of eq 23 observer system of eq 25 and reference model of eq 26 with the set of matrices defined in eqs 19 21 and 24 let there exist the controller gain k the observer gain l and positive definite matrices p 1 and p 2 and a positive scalar λ such that matrix inequality 30 s y m p 1 a p 1 b k l t c t p 1 s y m p 2 a p 2

depicts v 2 is negative outside of the set ε 0 therefore if disturbance term is zero converging e r and e o are asymptotically stable on the other hand if disturbance term is persistent e r and e o converge to a bound around zero also as previously stated in subsection 3 1 while v 2 is negative outside of the set ε 0 and the input reference is pe the parameter estimation converges to a set of the order of the disturbance level around true value on the other hand in the cases that v 2 becomes positive the parameter estimation error may grow unbounded that is known as the parameter drift phenomenon generally there exist several methods such as dead zone and e modification to modify the precision of parameter estimation in the drift mode for more details the interested readers are referred to ioannou and sun 2012 lavretsky and wise 2013 remark 2 since eq 30 contains terms of the product of unknown parameters such as p 1 p 2 k and l so the problem is a bilinear matrix inequality bmi generally there is not any method to get the global solution of bmi problems in this paper in order to get local solutions of bmi firstly we apply a congruence transformation to reduce the number of bmi terms and then using an iterative linearization method proposed in chen et al 2016 chang et al 2015 the rest of bmis convert into lmis in this way by pre and post multiplying q 0 by d i a g p 1

variables are derived from luenberger observer based on steering model defined in eq 25 4 los guidance algorithm usvs perform a series of maneuvers based on the predefined points or the target points namely the so called waypoints there are several methods for generating an optimal continuous and smooth path based on the location of waypoints and output data of the navigation subsystem in the field of path planning tsourdos et al 2010 in this paper adaptive los as a popular guidance algorithm has been used to generate the desired heading angle in the presence of the environmental disturbances more details of this method presented in anastasios and fossen 2014 let x t y t describes the current position of a vessel that acquired from gps s data and x k y k is the location of kth waypoint as shown in fig 4 the path following objective in the surface motions satisfy if lim t 0 y e t 0 where y e t is the cross track error defines as 38 y e t x k x t s i n γ p y t y k c o s γ p where γ p is the path tangential 39 γ p a r c t a n 2 y k y t x k x t where a r c t a n 2 y x is similar to a r c t a n y x except that the signs of both arguments are used to determine the quadrant of the results the desired heading angle in the presence of disturbances can be calculated based on the following equation 40 ψ d γ p a r c t a n k p y e k i y i n t β y i n t u h y e δ h 2 y e κ y i n t 2 where k p 1 δ h and k i k p κ for κ 0 are proportional and integral gains respectively and u h u 2 v 2 is speed of the vessel and β as drift angle defines as follows 41 β a r c t a n 2 v u where u and v are the surge and sway velocity respectively in this equations δ h which can be constant or varying is look ahead distance between the projection of the vessel s position x t y t on to the path between two sequence waypoints and point x l o s y l o s which is located on the path tangential line according to the presented formula in anastasios and fossen 2014 the time varying look ahead distance can be deduced from 42 δ h δ m a x δ m i n e k δ y e 2 δ m i n where δ m i n δ m a x and k δ are the minimum maximum values and the convergence rate for δ h based on this equation if vessel is far from of the path δ h δ m i n and if vessel is close to the path δ h δ m a x the steering motion controller described by eq 28 is responsible to regulate the usv s direction toward ψ d extracted from eq 40 the distance between the current position of usv and target waypoint is calculated as follows 43 d y k y t 2 x k x t 2 define r 0 n l o where n typically is 2 as suggested by fossen 2011 and l o is the overall length of the usv if d r 0 then the usv is in the target zone with acceptance radius r 0 and next waypoint x k 1 y k 1 will be selected it should be noticed that the waypoint s location may cause high amplitude rudder movements and excessive rudder s rate fig 5 as a block diagram of rudder machinery can be used to limit the maximum amplitude of the rudder in this figure δ m a x and δ m a x are the maximum values for the rudder angle and its rate respectively although this is out of the field of this manuscript just as a proposal designing an anti windup compensator to modify control inputs in the presence of saturation in an actuator such as a rudder system can be considered for further investigations 5 results and discussions a block diagram of the proposed gnc system for the usv is shown in fig 6 in this gnc system the navigation subsystem measures and estimates the necessary variables required by the control blocks by using sensors and observer the guidance block determines a the desired heading angle based on an adaptive los algorithm by comparing the current position of the usv and the target waypoint the control subsystem includes an adaptive sliding mode to follow surge velocity and to estimate unknown parameters and observer based adaptive state feedback to control steering motions and to estimate unmeasurable states and controller gains under disturbances simultaneously although experimental results would allow a realistic performance evaluation of a control system in the presence of measurement errors thruster dynamics environmental disturbances and other effects however due to the tremendous challenges associated with the practical implementation of a gnc system on a usv including platform design and manufacturing algorithm development debugging and etc the authors typically focus on implementing control algorithms in simulation studies rather than in real environments nevertheless in order to take into account real effects we did our best to model most parts of the system and simulation details on the basis of reliable approach for the sake of avoiding tremendous challenges the numerical simulations were performed in matlab software version r2013b and the convex optimization problem was solved by yalmip sedumi packages lofberg 2004 sturm 1999 time step size was considered equal to 0 01 s in the numerical simulations for solving a set of differential equations in addition the position of the vessel was updated with 1 s steps in navigation subsystem which resembles a 1 h z frequency of position updates by a gps system for the design of a comprehensive robust adaptive control system the disturbances and uncertainties of the system which typically includes highly nonlinear terms have to be considered however the only applied environmental disturbances to the usv studied in this manuscript was the wind effects with mean speed 8 m s which was modeled in accordance with fossen 2011 the uncertainties of the plant matrices are supposed to change in a range of δ a p 0 4 m 1 a 1 and δ b p 0 4 m 1 b 1 these uncertainties are inserted to the system as additive terms such that a p and b p defined in eq 20 are a p 1 0 4 m 1 a 1 and b p 1 0 4 m 1 b 1 the desired surge velocity considered as a square pulse and the tuning parameters for the adaption laws of the sliding mode controller

the developed gnc system were simulated and examined in several structures of waypoints as it is previously stated the radius of the circle of acceptance r 0 is assumed to be two times of vessel length and the reference heading angle is computed by adaptive los algorithm according to the current position of the vessel and the location of target waypoints in addition in order to show the excellence of the proposed method compared with the conventional methods we implemented a pid controller to the surge and heading motions fig 7 shows a track keeping performance for 8 waypoints located on a straight line in which the distance between the sequential waypoints is supposed to be approximately equal for speed tracking objective the desired surge velocity has been considered to be a square pulse with a mean amplitude 7 m s the results of this simulation indicate a successful path following based on waypoints the proposed method and pid controller behave in a similar way except a partly deviation from the straight line in the first moments using the proposed method the surge velocity and heading angle tracking for maneuver in a zigzag path are presented in fig 8 from this figure it is evident that the pid controller has a series of oscillation due to the existence of uncertainty disturbance and nonlinear terms while sliding mode controller tracks desired surge velocity properly nevertheless the sliding mode controller has a slower rise time because of some restrictions on the selection of design parameters regarding remark 1 also the proposed method in heading tracking is robust against disturbances and uncertainties and has a faster rate of convergence and lower steady error in comparison with the pid controller fig 9 shows the result of trajectory tracking for 9 waypoints placed on a zigzag path based on two scenarios for n 2 and n 5 this figure also implies that the precision of waypoints following increases as smaller r 0 is adapted but from point of practical view it is difficult to access a turn in a limited area smaller r 0 in a very short time and sometimes it makes some deviations in the initial moments after passing the intended waypoint therefore choosing an appropriate r 0 is very critical in the precision of waypoints tracking especially when the path is a maze and includes obstacles time responses of the state variables and their estimations by the designed observer in zigzag track keeping for n 2 are shown in fig 10 for 50 s it can be seen that the estimations quickly tend to the main states time responses of control forces in the direction of surge τ c u sway τ c v and thrust f t and rudder s angle δ r are shown in fig 11 it is observed from these figures that both of the proposed controllers give control efforts with a smaller magnitude and lesser oscillations compared with pid controller in contrast the control efforts in pid controller especially τ c v and f t depict high frequency fluctuations that are unfavorable in the point of practical view variation of the predicted unknown parameters a i for i 1 2 3 b and η in the surge motion and estimation of the state feedback controller gains in the steering motion are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively it is worth noting that the precision and the rate of adaption are related to the sufficiently rich property of reference signals and selection of the design parameters for instance by appropriate selection of design parameters the estimated values of a i for i 1 2 3 converge to their real values and b ˆ converges to its lower bound b on the other hand adaptive gains of the heading controller are bounded and exhibit convergence to constant values that are not their ideal values our trials depict that the exact adaption of these controller gains will be achieved by tuning of γ but at the cost of increasing the magnitude and the oscillations of control efforts fig 14 displays the usv s motion trajectory when n 2 for 13 waypoints located in an infinity loop with the same start and final waypoint according to this figure both controllers can make the usv to follow the sequential waypoints but the proposed method shows a more straight line manner leading to a shorter travelling distance for the usv to complete the maneuver as can be seen there have been some circulations around the forth and tenth waypoints this phenomenon was also observed in the work of lee et al 2010 which may be related to the performance of the guidance algorithm and can be considered for future investigations 6 conclusion this manuscript presented a novel controller design method for an unmanned surface vessel a 4 dof dynamic maneuvering model considering the surge sway yaw and roll motions were developed for the control of the proposed unmanned surface vessel in the presence of environmental wind disturbances by separating the surge motion from other degrees of freedom in the mathematical model an adaptive sliding mode as a robust controller was proposed to estimate unknown parameters and control the desired surge velocity on the other hand a robust adaptive state feedback controller with an integral term of output tracking error as a new state variable was also proposed to track a reference heading angle the existence of feedback of tracking error integral leads to the proposed controller behaves like a state feedback controller with pi term that amends the performance of the controller in comparison with the conventional state feedback controller due to the partial measurement of the state variables a structure for observer was presented to get the unmeasurable states hence the stability analysis of the tracking error and estimation error was performed by considering a suitable lyapunov function the reference heading angle has been derived from an adaptive los guidance algorithm based on waypoints location the results of the proposed scheme in comparison with a pid controller to track waypoints at appropriate surge velocity in several maneuvering motions such as straight line zigzag and infinity loop have been performed appendix lemma 1 gao and wang 2003 for constant matrix h 1 ℝ n

action of the sloshing fluid with floating tank motion were reported by chen and chiang 2000 an interaction effect between roll excited tank led to shifting of roll resonance peak towards lower frequencies and a secondary peak in the roll response amplitude operator rao was noticed at the natural sloshing frequency as reported by francescutto and contento 1994 a numerical study by lee et al 2007 on the interaction of barge type fpso subjected to random excitation showed similar results nasar et al 2010 also observed bimodal peaks in the roll response due to interaction between floating barge and sloshing in a rectangular tank nasar et al 2008 emphasized the necessity of the interaction study and also stated that as the excitation degrees of freedom increases the modal behaviour of free surface oscillations is chaotic as a result higher sloshing pressure on the side walls and top panel of rectangular containment was observed mitra et al discussed the sloshing oscillation and

observed that baffle edges induce turbulence in liquid flows leading to liquid slosh damping three dimensional liquid sloshing in baffled tanks was numerically simulated by liu and lin 2009 by solving spatially averaged navier stokes equation analytical modelling along with experimental work by goudarzi et al 2010 showed that the wall bounded horizontal baffles are effective in slender tanks whereas vertical baffles are preferable for broad tank with low fill levels a study on slat type screens by faltinsen and timokha 2011 reported that the analytical expression for natural sloshing frequencies is a complicated function depending on liquid depth number of submerged perforations position of perforations and solidity ratio for high solidity ratios s n 0 5 s n 1 of slat type screens secondary resonance phenomenon can happen at number of frequencies close to primary resonance and can cause higher natural sloshing modes faltinsen et al 2011 wu et al 2012 developed a numerical scheme to trace the viscous sloshing in 2 d tank and investigated the effect of multiple vertical baffles on resonant sloshing frequencies a vof based numerical studies by jung et al 2012 and akyildiz 2012 endeavoured to ascertain the critical baffle height between the range 0 h b h s 1 2 h b height of baffle for which minimal roof impact is expected due to liquid sloshing in a tank considering a single baffle ebrahimian et al 2013 emphasized the importance of location of baffles on the natural sloshing frequencies as against the size of the baffles by using boundary element method bem based numerical scheme xue et al 2013 investigated damping characteristics of perforated baffle in a sway excited sloshing tank experimentally as well as numerically jin et al 2014 conducted an experimental work to study the performance of perforated horizontal baffle in a sway excited tank and concluded that though the baffles reduce the sloshing amplitude there is limited influence of baffles on sloshing frequency nayak and biswal 2015 captures the damping ratio of centrally placed internal objects such as bottom mounted vertical baffles surface piercing vertical baffles and bottom mounted submerged blocks in a laterally excited sloshing tank a numerical study on upper mounted baffle by goudarzi and farshadmanesh 2015 discussed the worthiness of baffle on the reduction of maximum sloshing wave amplitude kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 proposed a finite element formulation for studying the performance of single slotted vertical baffle screen and discussed the damping characteristics of the baffles cho and kim 2016 carried out an experimental study to explore the damping characteristics of vertical dual porous baffle in a sway excited tank by considering their porosity submergence depth and position the study is extended cho et al 2017 to investigate the effectiveness of horizontally placed dual porous baffle experimental study by xue et al 2017 in a horizontally excited sloshing tank with various vertical baffle arrangements submerged bottom mounted baffle flushing with free surface surface piercing and perforated discussed the shift of first mode natural frequencies on comparison to a sloshing tank consisting without vertical baffle sung pill kim et al 2018 introduced a moving baffle concept by introducing a spring system just above the free surface to suppress the sloshing run up the foregoing literature discusses the sloshing dynamics in baffled tanks either for sway or roll excitations in maritime applications it is conventional practice to use solid baffle walls bottom stringers and side stringers at different elevations of tank as flow damping systems in cargo oil tanks kim 2001 carried out computational study to assess the effect of internal members in the ship tanks on the sloshing flows for various filling levels the liquid tank system was subjected to sway surge pitch roll combined sway surge with and without phase difference and combined pitch roll with and without phase difference mode of excitation akyildiz and ünal 2005 carried out the experimental studies to assess the sloshing pressure on tank walls by considering the solid baffles inside the tank bottom vertical and side stringers subjected to roll excitation from the literature it is leant that side stringers horizontal walls experience high slamming load at shallow filling levels at higher fill levels the internal members either vertical or horizontal are less effective in reducing occurrence of impact on tank ceilings and on corners the solid baffles experiences unexpected hydrodynamic loads which causes localised structural failure the sloshing flow was observed to be rapid above the location of vertical member and results in high impact on tank walls also it is understood that hydrodynamic damping is a function of position of baffle relative baffle height and relative liquid depth in view of dynamic stability of any floating structures equipped with free surface tanks compartmentalization is considered to be one of the remedial measures to reduce the sloshing flows free surface effects however the differential liquid pressure on the either side of the solid baffle wall hydrodynamic loads due to sloshing force and inertial loads altogether warrants higher thickness of baffles in order to avoid localised failure at this juncture porous wall would be an alternative baffle configuration by considering all possible filling conditions tank orientation number of external degrees of excitations avoidance of hydrodynamic impact damping of sloshing flows etc with optimal porosity conditions and proper placement of the baffle can be an efficient sloshing energy dissipater further the literature on interaction between floating vessel in the marine environment and the sloshing flows is rather limited by taking the above issues into consideration the present study aims to explore the effectiveness of the placement of porous baffle placed at l 2 and placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on comparison with submerged solid baffle placed at l 2 in a 75 liquid filled tank equipped in a freely floating barge a model scale of 1 43 has been selected for the width of barge based on the beam size of typical liquid oil carrier mentioned in lewis 1988 and sea going vessels reported in the literature in addition most of the literature reported that the model scale adoption of lng tank is varying between 40 and 45 the placement of baffle is decided based on the velocity profile of first three sloshing modes standing wave which can be derived from linear wave theory as reported in tait et al 2005 2 model details an acrylic sloshing tank of dimensions 1 0 m l x 0 4 m b x 0 65 m h and thickness of 12 mm is equipped inside fibre reinforced plastic barge with dimensions of breadth b 1 32 m 0 65 m d deep to receive the beam sea waves barge of length 1 95 m was kept along the flume width which is having dimension of 2 0 m the longitudinal axis of sloshing tank is aligned with transverse width of the barge the beam sea condition excites the liquid along the longitudinal axis of sloshing tank fig 1 represents the experimental setup of sloshing tank equipped inside the floating barge the porous baffles with different porosities 15 20 2 and 25 2 were made using acrylic sheet of 5 mm thickness and fig 2 exhibits the porous baffles used in the present study the porosity range 15 25 is selected based on the extensive studies carried out by vijayalakhsmi 2005 staggered arrangement of pores of size 15 mm diameter is adopted for all the porosities and the centre to centre distances are 45 mm 36 mm and 31 mm for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porosities respectively the various baffle arrangements tested in this experimental program are shown in fig 3 the liquid oscillation behaviour in the partially filled tank depends on the excitation frequency and amplitude size and geometry of the tank fill depth and internal baffle arrangements if any the complexity in the free surface behaviour escalates due to coupled translational and rotational movements ibrahim 2005 gave the linear approximation of resonant liquid sloshing frequencies in hz for the nth mode in a rectangular tank as 1 f n 1 2 π n π g l tanh n π h s l n 1 2 3 where l is the length of the tank h s is the static liquid depth and n is the surface mode number faltinsen and timokha 2009 proposed the modified equations of sloshing frequency rad s for centrally placed bottom mounted submerged vertical baffle in a 2 d sloshing tank is given in eqn 2 2 ω 1 2 ω 1 2 1 2 π 2 sin 2 n π 2 sinh 2 π h s l h b l 2 where h b is height of baffle the sloshing modal frequencies eqn 1 and modified frequencies eqn 2 for the liquid depth h s of 75 tank depth h are provided in table 1 the model parameters for the liquid filled condition and barge natural frequencies heave and roll for the corresponding equivalent dry weight conditions of the barge were calculated from the measured free response time histories in calm water condition are stated in table 2 the experimental frequencies are compared with numerical values predicted by using fem model sannasiraj et al 1995 3 flume facilities and experimental procedure the experimental investigations were carried out in a wave flume 50 m 2 m x 2 7 m at department of ocean engineering iit madras india the water depth d was maintained as 1 0 m and the wave maker was operated in the piston mode the model was placed at a distance of 34 m from the mean position of the wave paddle wave probes were placed at two appropriate locations in front of the structure to trace the wave field the position of barge model and the wave probe locations in the flume are shown in fig 4 three inductive single axis hbm accelerometers with a measuring range of up to 100 hz were used to trace the sway heave and roll response time histories due to the combined wave action and sloshing the liquid oscillations inside sloshing tank were recorded with the help of four resistive gauges rp1 rp4 on the walls and the schematic representation of sloshing tank is shown in fig 5 the sloshing tank equipped inside the barge was subjected to regular wave excitation with a prescribed incident wave height h i 0 10 m and different wave frequencies f w as given in table 3 for a wave climate selected the data is acquired by all the transducers simultaneously with a sampling frequency of 40 hz for the duration of 60 90 s from the moment that the wave generator was set into motion fig 6 compares the typical time histories of the wave barge responses and the sloshing oscillations excited by regular wave of frequency of 0 96 hz for baffle walls placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with 15 porosity and without baffle wall conditions the present experiment is 2 d in view of both barge interaction with waves and sloshing flow in the internal tank the wave characteristic doesn t change along the length of barge which is in beam sea condition further the breadth to length ratio b l of the sloshing tank is about 0 4 which means a narrow rectangular one in the present rectangular tank the flow is restricted in the length direction and hence the fluid particle characteristics are dominant in the length direction compare to lateral width direction of the tank 4 results and discussions 4 1 barge responses the steady state barge responses sway x heave z and roll ϕ is considered to analyse the characteristics of barge raos the partially liquid filled condition partially liquid filled with baffled conditions and equivalent dry weight conditions are compared the raos for dry weight condition is obtained by solving linear radiation and diffraction problem using the finite element method fem procedure of sannasiraj et al 1995 the characteristics of barge response amplitude operators rao for 75 liquid filled condition and the corresponding equivalent dry weigh conditions are detailed in nasar et al 2010 the influence of the baffled conditions on raos is reported in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 for baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with porosities of 15 20 and 25 2 respectively a detailed investigation reveals that an inconsequence of porous baffles is noted on the characteristics of heave and roll raos however the peak amplitude of roll rao is further reduced it is observed that the sway rao is influenced by the presence of porous baffles at certain excitation frequencies wherein sloshing oscillation is high and in turn affect the sway response also increase in sway response might be due to the synchronizing of phase between sway oscillation and sloshing flow these aspects are more evident at excitation ratio of 0 65 f w 0 55 hz 0 83 f w 0 7 hz and 1 83 f w f 3 hz wherein higher sloshing oscillation is observed when compared with unbaffled condition however sloshing is a resonance phenomena higher sway amplitude at certain frequencies is not helpful in increasing the sloshing runup 4 2 analysis of sloshing oscillations 4 2 1 sloshing run up and sloshing energy fig 10 a represents the variation of normalised maximum sloshing oscillation ζ max h i measured at side wall as a function of frequency ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 the unbaffled condition and baffled condition with porosities of 15 20 2 25 2 placed at l 3 and 2l 3 are compared the maximum sloshing run up ζ max h i is obtained at wave excitation frequency f w 0 96 hz f w f 1 1 14 for unbaffled condition on comparison with unbaffled condition the sloshing run up at f w f 1 1 f w f 1 0 94 and f w f 1 1 48 f w f 2 is found to be lesser for all the porosities considered on contrary there is an increase in sloshing run up for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porous conditions at the excitation frequency ratio of f w f 1 1 83 f w f 3 where the former two exhibit marginal increase in sloshing run up further to explore the effectiveness of baffles the percentage of attenuation in sloshing response is calculated as follows 3 a t t e n u a t i o n ζ max without baffle ζ max with baffle ζ max without baffle x 100 the variation in attenuation of sloshing run up as a function of frequency ratio f w f 1 is depicted in fig 9 b in the case of baffle walls with 15 porosity attenuation in sloshing run up is observed to be about 17 82 and 39 for wave excitation frequencies ratio f w f 1 of 1 f w f 1 1 14 f w 0 96 hz and 1 48 f w f 2 respectively for 20 2 porous baffles percentage of attenuation is in the order of 45 83 and 10 respectively the attenuation is about 47 at f w f 1 while it is meagre 10 at f w f 2 when 25 2 porosity baffles are used for the wave excitation f w at third mode sloshing frequency f 3 or at excitation ratio of 1 82 the attenuation by all porosities is undesirable with magnitudes of 3 2 and 140 for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porous baffles respectively herein the excitation ratio of 1 82 satisfies primary resonance of third mode f w fi 1 84 in submerged solid baffle condition refer table 1 and closer to primary resonance of third mode f w fi 1 73 in solid baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 which lead to higher participation of third mode than unbaffled condition refer table 4 and further the highest porosity of 25 2 is almost acting as an energy amplifier the variation of zeroth spectral moment m o with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for both baffled and unbaffled conditions is illustrated in fig 11 a it is observed that the porous baffles are considerably reducing the sloshing energy fig 11 a and there is negligible difference in the performance of baffles among the porosities considered fig 11 b depicts the percentage reduction of sloshing energy on comparison with unbaffled condition and confirms the aforementioned fact for wave excitation at first mode sloshing frequency f w f 1 it is observed that the baffles with 20 2 porosity is most effective and reduces the sloshing energy by 71 whilst 15 and 25 2 porosities reduce the energy by 55 and 69 respectively the average reduction in sloshing energy is about 97 when excitation frequency is f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing run up is observed in unbaffled condition the energy is reduced to half at f w f 2 irrespective of the porosity of the baffles however porous baffles are ineffective in reducing the energy at f w f 3 which amounts to be 33 17 and 550 for porosities of 15 20 2 and 25 2 respectively 4 2 2 modal behaviour and identification of harmonics the occurrences of natural modes in the system for porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 are stated in table 4 in order to substantiate the presence of the harmonics in the system the sloshing oscillations phase plots and spectra for sloshing oscillations in the tank with and without baffle conditions are projected in fig 12 in which fig 12 a c represent without baffle condition the projected results are for wave excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 98 which is very close to first mode sloshing frequency f 1 f w f 1 1 in baffled condition along with reduction in spectral energy introduction of baffles have also led to decline in occurrence of first mode and increase the occurrences of third mode in the system the presence of third mode excites the higher harmonics of 2f w and a dominant peak is observed at the same 2f w f 3 with secondary peaks at f w and 3f w fig 12 f i and l fig 13 a l represent sloshing elevations phase plots and spectra for h i d 0 1 and wave excitation frequency corresponding to second mode sloshing frequency f w f 2 f w f 1 1 48 by observing the spectral plot of without baffle condition fig 13 c and for baffled condition with 25 2 and 20 fig 13 f and i porosities bimodal peaks are witnessed at f w and f 3 due to presence of dominating first mode and third mode in the system the strong interaction between the modes is also reflected in the phase plots fig 13 b e and h which results a wide spectra however as the porosity is reduced to 15 a single dominating peak is observed at excitation harmonics f w even though the energy reduction by all the three porosities is same fig 13 b there is a redistribution of energy for the 15 porous condition resulting in higher peak at f w when compared with other porosities the sloshing response phase plots and sloshing spectra at third mode resonant sloshing frequency f w f 3 are shown in fig 14 a l a dominant single peak fig 14 c is observed in the energy spectra due to third mode contribution on the usage of porous baffles fig 14 f i and l it is noticed that spectral peaks are observed at f w f 3 similar to without baffle condition porous baffles of 25 2 porosity fig 14 d leads to a gradual increase in sloshing oscillation and exhibits unstable behaviour resulting a massive spectral peak fig 14 f however it is noticed that 15 and 20 2 porous conditions gives more conservative output on comparison with 25 2 the maximum sloshing response and it s corresponding phase plot and energy spectra are reported in fig 15 a i for frequency ratio f w f 1 of 1 14 a dominant energy peak is observed at f w due to the first mode contribution in addition to the higher harmonics obtained at 2f w and 3f w it is observed fig 15 f and i that there is tremendous energy reduction on utilization of porous baffles and the energy peaks are observed at harmonics similar to without baffled condition the sloshing oscillations at wave excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 73 f w 0 62 for without baffle condition and with three different porosities are given in fig 16 a l the spectral plot fig 16 c exhibits energy peaks at f w contribution of first mode 2f w parametric resonance of second mode and at 3f w the presence of harmonics is due to the availability of lowest three natural modes and among the entire first mode having maximum occurrences table 4 resulting in highest peak at f w the higher harmonic is available up to 4f w for all the porosities considered fig 17 a l depict the surface elevation phase plot and sloshing oscillation spectra at excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 54 for both baffled and unbaffled conditions by considering without baffle condition fig 17 c a major peak is observed at 2f w due to the contribution of first mode 2f w f 1 and accompanied by harmonics at f w and 3f w it can be seen that the energy level of first mode is suppressed at 2f w by all the porous conditions which is evident from the spectral plots fig 17 f i and l hence it can be concluded that porous baffles are extremely efficient in suppressing the energy of lowest mode 5 comparison of different baffle arrangements in this section porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 are compared with unbaffled condition for a given porosity to substantiate the effectiveness of placement of baffles porous baffle at l 2 and solid submerged baffle at l 2 is also taken into consideration 5 1 porous baffles with 15 porosity fig 18 a represents the variation of ζ max h i with frequencies ratio f w f 1 for different baffle arrangements with 15 porosity subjected to normalised incident wave height h i d 0 1 it can be seen that porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 performs better than baffles single porous and submerged solid at l 2 for all the frequencies ratio considered except at f w f 1 of 1 single porous baffle at l 2 is efficient at resonance frequency ratio of 1 0 for which standing wave of first mode is observed in an unbafffled condition however at excitation frequency of 0 96 hz f w f 1 1 14 baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 outperforms baffle placed at l 2 by suppressing the violent sloshing oscillation with travelling wave information which is obtained for without baffle condition an undesirable performance is exhibited by all the baffles considered in the present study it is to be noted that single porous and solid baffle at l 2 exhibit their inefficiency at f 2 and f 3 also it is to be mentioned that solid baffle exhibits undesirable performance between frequency ratio of 0 65 and 0 81 porous baffle at l 3 and 2l 3 fails to prove their efficiency at f w f 1 0 78 and 0 81 as well percentage of attenuation for different frequencies ratio is presented in fig 18 b and it is learnt that porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 is preferable as it gives positive attenuation over wider excitation ratio the undesirable performances are noticed and attenuation by single porous baffle at wave excitations f w f 2 and f w f 3 are about 55 and 180 respectively at f w f 3 solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of about 210 variation of zeroth spectral moment m o is illustrated in fig 19 a it shows that both porous baffle arrangements performs better than solid baffle at l 2 especially the porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 which contains lowest energy within the steady state response of the system except at excitation frequency ratio of 1 0 wherein single porous baffle has superior performance fig 19 b depicts the percentage reduction in m o for different frequencies ratio f w f 1 it can be seen that porous baffle at l 2 has better energy reduction for excitation ratio of 1 0 and 1 83 but a careful examination tells that baffle arrangement with porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 accomplishes the desired objective over a wider frequency range with better efficiency the performance by single porous at f w f 2 is about 310 whereas solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of 25 at f w f 2 it has also been noticed that porous baffles out performs solid baffle in reducing steady state sloshing energy m o at all the frequencies tested 5 2 porous baffles with 20 2 porosity fig 20 a explains the variation of ζ max h i with frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 h s l 0 488 and different baffle arrangements with 20 2 porosity on comparison of performance of the baffles in reducing the sloshing run up a trend similar to 15 porous condition is observed porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 out perform other baffle configurations over the wide range of frequencies considered single porous at l 2 performs better than solid baffle at l 2 except undesirable performances observed at f w f 2 and f w f 1 0 83 the inefficiency of solid baffle at l 2 is noticeable at f w f 1 ratio of 0 65 0 78 0 83 and at f w f 3 the percentage attenuation by different baffles is illustrated in fig 20 b and helps to corroborate the aforesaid observation solid baffle at l 2 exhibit undesirable performances at f w f 3 and f w f 1 0 78 f w 0 55 hz and it amounts to be about 210 and 95 respectively for wave excitation at f w f 2 the performance by porous baffle placed at l 2 is about 95 fig 21 a depicts the variation of zeroth spectral moment m o for wider range of frequencies ratio f w f 1 0 54 1 83 porous baffle arrangement at l 3 and 2l 3 performs better than single porous baffle at l 2 it is also seen that solid baffle at l 2 exhibits poor performance amongst the three baffle arrangements percentage reduction in m o is demonstrated in fig 21 b and it is observed that solid baffle is able to attain almost similar performance as that of porous baffle arrangements subjected to excitation ratio f w f 1 of 1 14 the porous baffle at l 3 and 2l 3 arrangements has the best average of 65 in spectral energy reduction among the three baffle arrangements over the wide range of excitation frequencies considered the said average reduction is about 45 for the arrangement of porous baffle at l 2 except an undesirable performance of 250 at wave excitation of f w f 2 the reduction in spectral energy is about 25 at excitation frequencies of f w f 2 and f w f 3 the reduction due to solid baffle is as competitive as exhibited by porous baffle placements and it about 75 at excitation of f w 0 96 hz however the undesirable performance is observed to be about 900 at excitation of f w f 3 the same performance is exhibited for the excitation frequencies ratio of f w f 1 0 66 0 73 and 0 83 and the reductions are observed to be about 200 88 and 48 respectively 5 3 porous baffles with 25 2 porosity the variation of ζmax h i and percentage of attenuation with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 h s l 0 488 are given in fig 22 a and fig 22 b respectively a mixed performance is observed for the different baffle arrangements it can be seen that the performance of single porous baffle at l 2 continues to dominate other two baffle arrangements at excitation frequency ratio of 1 83 f w f 3 and the attenuation is about 50 however the porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 outperforms single porous baffle at f w f 2 and the reduction is meagre say about 10 a subtle variation in performances is observed at the excitation frequency ratio of 0 98 f w f 1 and the superior performance by porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 is about 50 single solid baffle exhibits undesirable performances between 0 55 hz and 0 70 hz and at f w f 3 also porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 shows it s undesirables at 0 70 hz and at f w f 3 and are observed to be about 85 and 140 respectively fig 23 a represents variation of spectral energy m o with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 whereas fig 23 b represents percentage reduction in m o for the same single porous baffle continues to perform best at excitation frequency ratio of 1 83 while porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 gives superior results for other frequencies the percentage reductions in m o within the steady state at f w f 3 are about 900 33 and 550 for the baffles configurations of single solid submerged baffle single porous baffle and double porous baffles respectively the said reductions in m o at f w f 2 are about 25 150 and 50 respectively porous baffle configurations give an average reduction of 65 at wave excitation f w f 1 and solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of about 25 at f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing oscillation is occurred single porous baffle and solid baffle exhibit an average reduction of 85 6 concluding remarks sloshing dynamics and harmonics identification for the porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with porosities of 15 20 2 and 25 are explored inline with the studies of nasar et al 2008 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 the effectivness performance among the baffle configurations such as submerged solid baffle at l 2 single porous baffle at l 2 and porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 is presented interms of reduction in sloshing runup ζ max and spectral energy m o on comparison with unbaffled condition the effect of porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on barge raos are discussed on comparison with nasar et al 2010 the conclusions from the present experimental investigation are as follows the effect of porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on heave rao is absent peak ampitude of roll rao is further reduced which is a positive aspect the sway rao is found to be increased at certain frequencies due to increased sloshing flow or phase synchronization between sloshing flow and sway response since sloshing is a resonance phenomena the higher sway amplitude at certain frequencies is found to be ineffective in increasing the sloshing oscillation by analysing the percenatege reduction in ζ max and m o it can be generalised that porous baffle placed at l 2 and porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 configurations are acting as better dampening system than solid submerged baffle placed at l 2 over the wide range of frequencies ratio of 0 4 1 85 among porosities 25 2 outperforms 15 and 20 2 porous conditions the performance of porous baffles with different porosities is up to the expectation for the wave excitations at lowest natural sloshing frequencies f w f 1 1 f w f 1 f w f 1 1 48 f w f 2 f w f 1 1 82 f w f 3 and at f w f 1 1 14 f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing oscillation is observed however undesirable performances higher sloshing run up compared to unbaffled condition are observed at certain frequencies for all the porosities considered this happens whilst the particular excitation ratio fulfils the resonance condition of sloshing in solid baffle condition submerged baffle solid placed at l 2 and solid baffle placed at l 3 and 2l 3 and hence the porous baffle tends to behave as solid baffle to conclude that the porous baffle can an alternate measure for typical internal members present in the ship tanks in view of dynamic stability reduction of sloshing energy and avoidance of roof impact appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia

action of the sloshing fluid with floating tank motion were reported by chen and chiang 2000 an interaction effect between roll excited tank led to shifting of roll resonance peak towards lower frequencies and a secondary peak in the roll response amplitude operator rao was noticed at the natural sloshing frequency as reported by francescutto and contento 1994 a numerical study by lee et al 2007 on the interaction of barge type fpso subjected to random excitation showed similar results nasar et al 2010 also observed bimodal peaks in the roll response due to interaction between floating barge and sloshing in a rectangular tank nasar et al 2008 emphasized the necessity of the interaction study and also stated that as the excitation degrees of freedom increases the modal behaviour of free surface oscillations is chaotic as a result higher sloshing pressure on the side walls and top panel of rectangular containment was observed mitra et al discussed the sloshing oscillation and

observed that baffle edges induce turbulence in liquid flows leading to liquid slosh damping three dimensional liquid sloshing in baffled tanks was numerically simulated by liu and lin 2009 by solving spatially averaged navier stokes equation analytical modelling along with experimental work by goudarzi et al 2010 showed that the wall bounded horizontal baffles are effective in slender tanks whereas vertical baffles are preferable for broad tank with low fill levels a study on slat type screens by faltinsen and timokha 2011 reported that the analytical expression for natural sloshing frequencies is a complicated function depending on liquid depth number of submerged perforations position of perforations and solidity ratio for high solidity ratios s n 0 5 s n 1 of slat type screens secondary resonance phenomenon can happen at number of frequencies close to primary resonance and can cause higher natural sloshing modes faltinsen et al 2011 wu et al 2012 developed a numerical scheme to trace the viscous sloshing in 2 d tank and investigated the effect of multiple vertical baffles on resonant sloshing frequencies a vof based numerical studies by jung et al 2012 and akyildiz 2012 endeavoured to ascertain the critical baffle height between the range 0 h b h s 1 2 h b height of baffle for which minimal roof impact is expected due to liquid sloshing in a tank considering a single baffle ebrahimian et al 2013 emphasized the importance of location of baffles on the natural sloshing frequencies as against the size of the baffles by using boundary element method bem based numerical scheme xue et al 2013 investigated damping characteristics of perforated baffle in a sway excited sloshing tank experimentally as well as numerically jin et al 2014 conducted an experimental work to study the performance of perforated horizontal baffle in a sway excited tank and concluded that though the baffles reduce the sloshing amplitude there is limited influence of baffles on sloshing frequency nayak and biswal 2015 captures the damping ratio of centrally placed internal objects such as bottom mounted vertical baffles surface piercing vertical baffles and bottom mounted submerged blocks in a laterally excited sloshing tank a numerical study on upper mounted baffle by goudarzi and farshadmanesh 2015 discussed the worthiness of baffle on the reduction of maximum sloshing wave amplitude kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 proposed a finite element formulation for studying the performance of single slotted vertical baffle screen and discussed the damping characteristics of the baffles cho and kim 2016 carried out an experimental study to explore the damping characteristics of vertical dual porous baffle in a sway excited tank by considering their porosity submergence depth and position the study is extended cho et al 2017 to investigate the effectiveness of horizontally placed dual porous baffle experimental study by xue et al 2017 in a horizontally excited sloshing tank with various vertical baffle arrangements submerged bottom mounted baffle flushing with free surface surface piercing and perforated discussed the shift of first mode natural frequencies on comparison to a sloshing tank consisting without vertical baffle sung pill kim et al 2018 introduced a moving baffle concept by introducing a spring system just above the free surface to suppress the sloshing run up the foregoing literature discusses the sloshing dynamics in baffled tanks either for sway or roll excitations in maritime applications it is conventional practice to use solid baffle walls bottom stringers and side stringers at different elevations of tank as flow damping systems in cargo oil tanks kim 2001 carried out computational study to assess the effect of internal members in the ship tanks on the sloshing flows for various filling levels the liquid tank system was subjected to sway surge pitch roll combined sway surge with and without phase difference and combined pitch roll with and without phase difference mode of excitation akyildiz and ünal 2005 carried out the experimental studies to assess the sloshing pressure on tank walls by considering the solid baffles inside the tank bottom vertical and side stringers subjected to roll excitation from the literature it is leant that side stringers horizontal walls experience high slamming load at shallow filling levels at higher fill levels the internal members either vertical or horizontal are less effective in reducing occurrence of impact on tank ceilings and on corners the solid baffles experiences unexpected hydrodynamic loads which causes localised structural failure the sloshing flow was observed to be rapid above the location of vertical member and results in high impact on tank walls also it is understood that hydrodynamic damping is a function of position of baffle relative baffle height and relative liquid depth in view of dynamic stability of any floating structures equipped with free surface tanks compartmentalization is considered to be one of the remedial measures to reduce the sloshing flows free surface effects however the differential liquid pressure on the either side of the solid baffle wall hydrodynamic loads due to sloshing force and inertial loads altogether warrants higher thickness of baffles in order to avoid localised failure at this juncture porous wall would be an alternative baffle configuration by considering all possible filling conditions tank orientation number of external degrees of excitations avoidance of hydrodynamic impact damping of sloshing flows etc with optimal porosity conditions and proper placement of the baffle can be an efficient sloshing energy dissipater further the literature on interaction between floating vessel in the marine environment and the sloshing flows is rather limited by taking the above issues into consideration the present study aims to explore the effectiveness of the placement of porous baffle placed at l 2 and placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on comparison with submerged solid baffle placed at l 2 in a 75 liquid filled tank equipped in a freely floating barge a model scale of 1 43 has been selected for the width of barge based on the beam size of typical liquid oil carrier mentioned in lewis 1988 and sea going vessels reported in the literature in addition most of the literature reported that the model scale adoption of lng tank is varying between 40 and 45 the placement of baffle is decided based on the velocity profile of first three sloshing modes standing wave which can be derived from linear wave theory as reported in tait et al 2005 2 model details an acrylic sloshing tank of dimensions 1 0 m l x 0 4 m b x 0 65 m h and thickness of 12 mm is equipped inside fibre reinforced plastic barge with dimensions of breadth b 1 32 m 0 65 m d deep to receive the beam sea waves barge of length 1 95 m was kept along the flume width which is having dimension of 2 0 m the longitudinal axis of sloshing tank is aligned with transverse width of the barge the beam sea condition excites the liquid along the longitudinal axis of sloshing tank fig 1 represents the experimental setup of sloshing tank equipped inside the floating barge the porous baffles with different porosities 15 20 2 and 25 2 were made using acrylic sheet of 5 mm thickness and fig 2 exhibits the porous baffles used in the present study the porosity range 15 25 is selected based on the extensive studies carried out by vijayalakhsmi 2005 staggered arrangement of pores of size 15 mm diameter is adopted for all the porosities and the centre to centre distances are 45 mm 36 mm and 31 mm for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porosities respectively the various baffle arrangements tested in this experimental program are shown in fig 3 the liquid oscillation behaviour in the partially filled tank depends on the excitation frequency and amplitude size and geometry of the tank fill depth and internal baffle arrangements if any the complexity in the free surface behaviour escalates due to coupled translational and rotational movements ibrahim 2005 gave the linear approximation of resonant liquid sloshing frequencies in hz for the nth mode in a rectangular tank as 1 f n 1 2 π n π g l tanh n π h s l n 1 2 3 where l is the length of the tank h s is the static liquid depth and n is the surface mode number faltinsen and timokha 2009 proposed the modified equations of sloshing frequency rad s for centrally placed bottom mounted submerged vertical baffle in a 2 d sloshing tank is given in eqn 2 2 ω 1 2 ω 1 2 1 2 π 2 sin 2 n π 2 sinh 2 π h s l h b l 2 where h b is height of baffle the sloshing modal frequencies eqn 1 and modified frequencies eqn 2 for the liquid depth h s of 75 tank depth h are provided in table 1 the model parameters for the liquid filled condition and barge natural frequencies heave and roll for the corresponding equivalent dry weight conditions of the barge were calculated from the measured free response time histories in calm water condition are stated in table 2 the experimental frequencies are compared with numerical values predicted by using fem model sannasiraj et al 1995 3 flume facilities and experimental procedure the experimental investigations were carried out in a wave flume 50 m 2 m x 2 7 m at department of ocean engineering iit madras india the water depth d was maintained as 1 0 m and the wave maker was operated in the piston mode the model was placed at a distance of 34 m from the mean position of the wave paddle wave probes were placed at two appropriate locations in front of the structure to trace the wave field the position of barge model and the wave probe locations in the flume are shown in fig 4 three inductive single axis hbm accelerometers with a measuring range of up to 100 hz were used to trace the sway heave and roll response time histories due to the combined wave action and sloshing the liquid oscillations inside sloshing tank were recorded with the help of four resistive gauges rp1 rp4 on the walls and the schematic representation of sloshing tank is shown in fig 5 the sloshing tank equipped inside the barge was subjected to regular wave excitation with a prescribed incident wave height h i 0 10 m and different wave frequencies f w as given in table 3 for a wave climate selected the data is acquired by all the transducers simultaneously with a sampling frequency of 40 hz for the duration of 60 90 s from the moment that the wave generator was set into motion fig 6 compares the typical time histories of the wave barge responses and the sloshing oscillations excited by regular wave of frequency of 0 96 hz for baffle walls placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with 15 porosity and without baffle wall conditions the present experiment is 2 d in view of both barge interaction with waves and sloshing flow in the internal tank the wave characteristic doesn t change along the length of barge which is in beam sea condition further the breadth to length ratio b l of the sloshing tank is about 0 4 which means a narrow rectangular one in the present rectangular tank the flow is restricted in the length direction and hence the fluid particle characteristics are dominant in the length direction compare to lateral width direction of the tank 4 results and discussions 4 1 barge responses the steady state barge responses sway x heave z and roll ϕ is considered to analyse the characteristics of barge raos the partially liquid filled condition partially liquid filled with baffled conditions and equivalent dry weight conditions are compared the raos for dry weight condition is obtained by solving linear radiation and diffraction problem using the finite element method fem procedure of sannasiraj et al 1995 the characteristics of barge response amplitude operators rao for 75 liquid filled condition and the corresponding equivalent dry weigh conditions are detailed in nasar et al 2010 the influence of the baffled conditions on raos is reported in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 for baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with porosities of 15 20 and 25 2 respectively a detailed investigation reveals that an inconsequence of porous baffles is noted on the characteristics of heave and roll raos however the peak amplitude of roll rao is further reduced it is observed that the sway rao is influenced by the presence of porous baffles at certain excitation frequencies wherein sloshing oscillation is high and in turn affect the sway response also increase in sway response might be due to the synchronizing of phase between sway oscillation and sloshing flow these aspects are more evident at excitation ratio of 0 65 f w 0 55 hz 0 83 f w 0 7 hz and 1 83 f w f 3 hz wherein higher sloshing oscillation is observed when compared with unbaffled condition however sloshing is a resonance phenomena higher sway amplitude at certain frequencies is not helpful in increasing the sloshing runup 4 2 analysis of sloshing oscillations 4 2 1 sloshing run up and sloshing energy fig 10 a represents the variation of normalised maximum sloshing oscillation ζ max h i measured at side wall as a function of frequency ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 the unbaffled condition and baffled condition with porosities of 15 20 2 25 2 placed at l 3 and 2l 3 are compared the maximum sloshing run up ζ max h i is obtained at wave excitation frequency f w 0 96 hz f w f 1 1 14 for unbaffled condition on comparison with unbaffled condition the sloshing run up at f w f 1 1 f w f 1 0 94 and f w f 1 1 48 f w f 2 is found to be lesser for all the porosities considered on contrary there is an increase in sloshing run up for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porous conditions at the excitation frequency ratio of f w f 1 1 83 f w f 3 where the former two exhibit marginal increase in sloshing run up further to explore the effectiveness of baffles the percentage of attenuation in sloshing response is calculated as follows 3 a t t e n u a t i o n ζ max without baffle ζ max with baffle ζ max without baffle x 100 the variation in attenuation of sloshing run up as a function of frequency ratio f w f 1 is depicted in fig 9 b in the case of baffle walls with 15 porosity attenuation in sloshing run up is observed to be about 17 82 and 39 for wave excitation frequencies ratio f w f 1 of 1 f w f 1 1 14 f w 0 96 hz and 1 48 f w f 2 respectively for 20 2 porous baffles percentage of attenuation is in the order of 45 83 and 10 respectively the attenuation is about 47 at f w f 1 while it is meagre 10 at f w f 2 when 25 2 porosity baffles are used for the wave excitation f w at third mode sloshing frequency f 3 or at excitation ratio of 1 82 the attenuation by all porosities is undesirable with magnitudes of 3 2 and 140 for 15 20 2 and 25 2 porous baffles respectively herein the excitation ratio of 1 82 satisfies primary resonance of third mode f w fi 1 84 in submerged solid baffle condition refer table 1 and closer to primary resonance of third mode f w fi 1 73 in solid baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 which lead to higher participation of third mode than unbaffled condition refer table 4 and further the highest porosity of 25 2 is almost acting as an energy amplifier the variation of zeroth spectral moment m o with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for both baffled and unbaffled conditions is illustrated in fig 11 a it is observed that the porous baffles are considerably reducing the sloshing energy fig 11 a and there is negligible difference in the performance of baffles among the porosities considered fig 11 b depicts the percentage reduction of sloshing energy on comparison with unbaffled condition and confirms the aforementioned fact for wave excitation at first mode sloshing frequency f w f 1 it is observed that the baffles with 20 2 porosity is most effective and reduces the sloshing energy by 71 whilst 15 and 25 2 porosities reduce the energy by 55 and 69 respectively the average reduction in sloshing energy is about 97 when excitation frequency is f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing run up is observed in unbaffled condition the energy is reduced to half at f w f 2 irrespective of the porosity of the baffles however porous baffles are ineffective in reducing the energy at f w f 3 which amounts to be 33 17 and 550 for porosities of 15 20 2 and 25 2 respectively 4 2 2 modal behaviour and identification of harmonics the occurrences of natural modes in the system for porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 are stated in table 4 in order to substantiate the presence of the harmonics in the system the sloshing oscillations phase plots and spectra for sloshing oscillations in the tank with and without baffle conditions are projected in fig 12 in which fig 12 a c represent without baffle condition the projected results are for wave excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 98 which is very close to first mode sloshing frequency f 1 f w f 1 1 in baffled condition along with reduction in spectral energy introduction of baffles have also led to decline in occurrence of first mode and increase the occurrences of third mode in the system the presence of third mode excites the higher harmonics of 2f w and a dominant peak is observed at the same 2f w f 3 with secondary peaks at f w and 3f w fig 12 f i and l fig 13 a l represent sloshing elevations phase plots and spectra for h i d 0 1 and wave excitation frequency corresponding to second mode sloshing frequency f w f 2 f w f 1 1 48 by observing the spectral plot of without baffle condition fig 13 c and for baffled condition with 25 2 and 20 fig 13 f and i porosities bimodal peaks are witnessed at f w and f 3 due to presence of dominating first mode and third mode in the system the strong interaction between the modes is also reflected in the phase plots fig 13 b e and h which results a wide spectra however as the porosity is reduced to 15 a single dominating peak is observed at excitation harmonics f w even though the energy reduction by all the three porosities is same fig 13 b there is a redistribution of energy for the 15 porous condition resulting in higher peak at f w when compared with other porosities the sloshing response phase plots and sloshing spectra at third mode resonant sloshing frequency f w f 3 are shown in fig 14 a l a dominant single peak fig 14 c is observed in the energy spectra due to third mode contribution on the usage of porous baffles fig 14 f i and l it is noticed that spectral peaks are observed at f w f 3 similar to without baffle condition porous baffles of 25 2 porosity fig 14 d leads to a gradual increase in sloshing oscillation and exhibits unstable behaviour resulting a massive spectral peak fig 14 f however it is noticed that 15 and 20 2 porous conditions gives more conservative output on comparison with 25 2 the maximum sloshing response and it s corresponding phase plot and energy spectra are reported in fig 15 a i for frequency ratio f w f 1 of 1 14 a dominant energy peak is observed at f w due to the first mode contribution in addition to the higher harmonics obtained at 2f w and 3f w it is observed fig 15 f and i that there is tremendous energy reduction on utilization of porous baffles and the energy peaks are observed at harmonics similar to without baffled condition the sloshing oscillations at wave excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 73 f w 0 62 for without baffle condition and with three different porosities are given in fig 16 a l the spectral plot fig 16 c exhibits energy peaks at f w contribution of first mode 2f w parametric resonance of second mode and at 3f w the presence of harmonics is due to the availability of lowest three natural modes and among the entire first mode having maximum occurrences table 4 resulting in highest peak at f w the higher harmonic is available up to 4f w for all the porosities considered fig 17 a l depict the surface elevation phase plot and sloshing oscillation spectra at excitation frequency ratio f w f 1 of 0 54 for both baffled and unbaffled conditions by considering without baffle condition fig 17 c a major peak is observed at 2f w due to the contribution of first mode 2f w f 1 and accompanied by harmonics at f w and 3f w it can be seen that the energy level of first mode is suppressed at 2f w by all the porous conditions which is evident from the spectral plots fig 17 f i and l hence it can be concluded that porous baffles are extremely efficient in suppressing the energy of lowest mode 5 comparison of different baffle arrangements in this section porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 are compared with unbaffled condition for a given porosity to substantiate the effectiveness of placement of baffles porous baffle at l 2 and solid submerged baffle at l 2 is also taken into consideration 5 1 porous baffles with 15 porosity fig 18 a represents the variation of ζ max h i with frequencies ratio f w f 1 for different baffle arrangements with 15 porosity subjected to normalised incident wave height h i d 0 1 it can be seen that porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 performs better than baffles single porous and submerged solid at l 2 for all the frequencies ratio considered except at f w f 1 of 1 single porous baffle at l 2 is efficient at resonance frequency ratio of 1 0 for which standing wave of first mode is observed in an unbafffled condition however at excitation frequency of 0 96 hz f w f 1 1 14 baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 outperforms baffle placed at l 2 by suppressing the violent sloshing oscillation with travelling wave information which is obtained for without baffle condition an undesirable performance is exhibited by all the baffles considered in the present study it is to be noted that single porous and solid baffle at l 2 exhibit their inefficiency at f 2 and f 3 also it is to be mentioned that solid baffle exhibits undesirable performance between frequency ratio of 0 65 and 0 81 porous baffle at l 3 and 2l 3 fails to prove their efficiency at f w f 1 0 78 and 0 81 as well percentage of attenuation for different frequencies ratio is presented in fig 18 b and it is learnt that porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 is preferable as it gives positive attenuation over wider excitation ratio the undesirable performances are noticed and attenuation by single porous baffle at wave excitations f w f 2 and f w f 3 are about 55 and 180 respectively at f w f 3 solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of about 210 variation of zeroth spectral moment m o is illustrated in fig 19 a it shows that both porous baffle arrangements performs better than solid baffle at l 2 especially the porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 which contains lowest energy within the steady state response of the system except at excitation frequency ratio of 1 0 wherein single porous baffle has superior performance fig 19 b depicts the percentage reduction in m o for different frequencies ratio f w f 1 it can be seen that porous baffle at l 2 has better energy reduction for excitation ratio of 1 0 and 1 83 but a careful examination tells that baffle arrangement with porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 accomplishes the desired objective over a wider frequency range with better efficiency the performance by single porous at f w f 2 is about 310 whereas solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of 25 at f w f 2 it has also been noticed that porous baffles out performs solid baffle in reducing steady state sloshing energy m o at all the frequencies tested 5 2 porous baffles with 20 2 porosity fig 20 a explains the variation of ζ max h i with frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 h s l 0 488 and different baffle arrangements with 20 2 porosity on comparison of performance of the baffles in reducing the sloshing run up a trend similar to 15 porous condition is observed porous baffles at l 3 and 2l 3 out perform other baffle configurations over the wide range of frequencies considered single porous at l 2 performs better than solid baffle at l 2 except undesirable performances observed at f w f 2 and f w f 1 0 83 the inefficiency of solid baffle at l 2 is noticeable at f w f 1 ratio of 0 65 0 78 0 83 and at f w f 3 the percentage attenuation by different baffles is illustrated in fig 20 b and helps to corroborate the aforesaid observation solid baffle at l 2 exhibit undesirable performances at f w f 3 and f w f 1 0 78 f w 0 55 hz and it amounts to be about 210 and 95 respectively for wave excitation at f w f 2 the performance by porous baffle placed at l 2 is about 95 fig 21 a depicts the variation of zeroth spectral moment m o for wider range of frequencies ratio f w f 1 0 54 1 83 porous baffle arrangement at l 3 and 2l 3 performs better than single porous baffle at l 2 it is also seen that solid baffle at l 2 exhibits poor performance amongst the three baffle arrangements percentage reduction in m o is demonstrated in fig 21 b and it is observed that solid baffle is able to attain almost similar performance as that of porous baffle arrangements subjected to excitation ratio f w f 1 of 1 14 the porous baffle at l 3 and 2l 3 arrangements has the best average of 65 in spectral energy reduction among the three baffle arrangements over the wide range of excitation frequencies considered the said average reduction is about 45 for the arrangement of porous baffle at l 2 except an undesirable performance of 250 at wave excitation of f w f 2 the reduction in spectral energy is about 25 at excitation frequencies of f w f 2 and f w f 3 the reduction due to solid baffle is as competitive as exhibited by porous baffle placements and it about 75 at excitation of f w 0 96 hz however the undesirable performance is observed to be about 900 at excitation of f w f 3 the same performance is exhibited for the excitation frequencies ratio of f w f 1 0 66 0 73 and 0 83 and the reductions are observed to be about 200 88 and 48 respectively 5 3 porous baffles with 25 2 porosity the variation of ζmax h i and percentage of attenuation with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 h s l 0 488 are given in fig 22 a and fig 22 b respectively a mixed performance is observed for the different baffle arrangements it can be seen that the performance of single porous baffle at l 2 continues to dominate other two baffle arrangements at excitation frequency ratio of 1 83 f w f 3 and the attenuation is about 50 however the porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 outperforms single porous baffle at f w f 2 and the reduction is meagre say about 10 a subtle variation in performances is observed at the excitation frequency ratio of 0 98 f w f 1 and the superior performance by porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 is about 50 single solid baffle exhibits undesirable performances between 0 55 hz and 0 70 hz and at f w f 3 also porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 shows it s undesirables at 0 70 hz and at f w f 3 and are observed to be about 85 and 140 respectively fig 23 a represents variation of spectral energy m o with different frequencies ratio f w f 1 for h i d 0 1 whereas fig 23 b represents percentage reduction in m o for the same single porous baffle continues to perform best at excitation frequency ratio of 1 83 while porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 gives superior results for other frequencies the percentage reductions in m o within the steady state at f w f 3 are about 900 33 and 550 for the baffles configurations of single solid submerged baffle single porous baffle and double porous baffles respectively the said reductions in m o at f w f 2 are about 25 150 and 50 respectively porous baffle configurations give an average reduction of 65 at wave excitation f w f 1 and solid baffle exhibits an attenuation of about 25 at f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing oscillation is occurred single porous baffle and solid baffle exhibit an average reduction of 85 6 concluding remarks sloshing dynamics and harmonics identification for the porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 with porosities of 15 20 2 and 25 are explored inline with the studies of nasar et al 2008 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 the effectivness performance among the baffle configurations such as submerged solid baffle at l 2 single porous baffle at l 2 and porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 is presented interms of reduction in sloshing runup ζ max and spectral energy m o on comparison with unbaffled condition the effect of porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on barge raos are discussed on comparison with nasar et al 2010 the conclusions from the present experimental investigation are as follows the effect of porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 on heave rao is absent peak ampitude of roll rao is further reduced which is a positive aspect the sway rao is found to be increased at certain frequencies due to increased sloshing flow or phase synchronization between sloshing flow and sway response since sloshing is a resonance phenomena the higher sway amplitude at certain frequencies is found to be ineffective in increasing the sloshing oscillation by analysing the percenatege reduction in ζ max and m o it can be generalised that porous baffle placed at l 2 and porous baffles placed at l 3 and 2l 3 configurations are acting as better dampening system than solid submerged baffle placed at l 2 over the wide range of frequencies ratio of 0 4 1 85 among porosities 25 2 outperforms 15 and 20 2 porous conditions the performance of porous baffles with different porosities is up to the expectation for the wave excitations at lowest natural sloshing frequencies f w f 1 1 f w f 1 f w f 1 1 48 f w f 2 f w f 1 1 82 f w f 3 and at f w f 1 1 14 f w 0 96 hz for which maximum sloshing oscillation is observed however undesirable performances higher sloshing run up compared to unbaffled condition are observed at certain frequencies for all the porosities considered this happens whilst the particular excitation ratio fulfils the resonance condition of sloshing in solid baffle condition submerged baffle solid placed at l 2 and solid baffle placed at l 3 and 2l 3 and hence the porous baffle tends to behave as solid baffle to conclude that the porous baffle can an alternate measure for typical internal members present in the ship tanks in view of
