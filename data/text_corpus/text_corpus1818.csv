9090,pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l is a staple food crop for rural households in senegal however yields remain low due to reduced precipitation and low adoption of agricultural technologies this study aims to i calibrate and evaluate the performance of the agricultural production system simulator apsim millet model to simulate crop phenology and grain yield and ii develop regional specific recommendations based on management scenarios for pearl millet in senegal the apsim millet model was adjusted for early and late flowering landraces with field data from 351 locations during 2016 2021 independent datasets were used to evaluate the agreement of crop model outcomes with i crop phenology with a root mean square error rmse of 2 4 days for early flowering and 3 7 days for late flowering landraces and ii grain yield with average rmse of 439 kg ha 1 across locations for all senegal millet producing districts crop management scenarios were simulated by combining six levels of nitrogen n fertilization three plant densities and three planting dates these scenarios were compared against a literature reported standard management the implementation of the recommended management practices can increase farmer yields by two fold in senegal mainly by increasing plant density n fertility and by adjusting planting date to better match precipitation with the period of greater crop water

in sub saharan africa vulnerable economies with low productivity levels are especially susceptible to food insecurity and malnutrition schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 this is the result of a combination of factors such as climate variability intensive exploitation of natural resources environmental degradation and poor soil fertility sultan and gaetani 2016 stewart et al 2020 furthermore the overgrowing human population and food demand highlight the need to optimize the use of environmental resources diack et al 2017 more specifically in senegal the current cereal demand is barely met by matching the national production 4 million tons direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 pearl millet is the most cultivated cereal occupying more than 58 of the area destined for cereal cultivation which corresponds to around 31 1 14 million tons of total national cereal production direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 furthermore future projections showed an increase in the demand up to 15 million tons while the national production is expected to increase by only 2 6 million tons by 2100 international fund for agricultural development fida 2020 hence substantial efforts towards the adoption of modern technologies improving productivity expanding areas in productive land and mainly developing more resource use efficient farming systems will be needed to meet the forecasted demand araya et al 2022 countries from sub saharan africa such as senegal are especially vulnerable to high climate variability sultan and gaetani 2016 in the regions with shorter rainy seasons on farm pearl millet yields present low values and high variability within a field and across seasons waddington et al 2010 the reliance on rainfed agriculture economic limitations and lack of institutional strategies to cope with climate variability contribute to increase production uncertainties and food insecurity ganyo et al 2019 in this context pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l r br has the potential to be used to diminish these fluctuations yadav et al 2019 this crop is adapted to grow in areas with marginal soils and low precipitation 350 mm where other cereals have no success to grow ullah et al 2017 and is relatively more tolerant to high temperatures prasad et al 2017 furthermore its grains have an important nutritional value due to their essential micronutrients content e g iron and zinc and gluten free condition debieu et al 2018 gowda et al 2022 for these reasons pearl millet is considered one of the main crops to ensure food security vadez et al 2012 particularly in senegal where it is the most common staple crop cultivated primarily for human consumption direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 the current yield gap for rainfed systems in senegal is near to 2200 kg ha 1 affholder et al 2013 mainly driven by the lack of access to management information inputs and financial resources mountakha et al 2020 optimizing the pearl millet systems is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of production for senegal under water limited conditions bastos et al 2022 however overall information on management practices land use and characterization of farming systems is restricted or not available across regions therond et al 2011 in this context crop models have been extensively used to understand different management strategies such as planting windows beah et al 2021 yield responses to nutrient rates akponikpè et al 2010 akinseye et al 2020 adaptation practices to climate variability seyoum et al 2018 tofa et al 2020 and climate change impacts araya et al 2021a b 2022 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 is one of the available tools capable of generating management scenarios to diminish the yield gap akponikpè et al 2010 beah et al 2021 the main limitation of this kind of approach is the lack of studies that provide model calibration and validation bussel et al 2016 liben et al 2018 developing adaptation strategies adjusted to the current environment is needed to aid smallholders to attain food stability resilient agriculture and improved productivity wajid et al 2021 these strategies encompass the definition of planting window to match rainfall with crop demand plant densities and n fertilization that maximizes yields and promotes the most efficient use of resources therefore this study focused on synthesizing previous efforts describing management crop phenology and productivity to evaluate the apsim millet model to later test management practices in distinct locations across senegal based on that its objectives are to i calibrate and evaluate the performance of agricultural production system simulator apsim millet model to simulate crop phenology and grain yield and ii develop regional specific recommendations for improving yield to water use ratio based on multiple crop management scenarios for rainfed pearl millet systems in senegal 2 material and methods briefly the developed approach consisted of the following four steps first a literature review to characterize the production systems defining the most cultivated landrace types and their geospatial distribution second apsim millet model was calibrated and the model performance was evaluated employing crop phenology and grain yield collected for all the pearl millet producing districts in senegal 12 districts 351 locations third for each location 54 management scenarios were simulated from 1990 to 2021 by combining six levels of nitrogen n fertilization three plant densities and three planting dates based on the initial literature review the most common practices adopted by farmers were defined standard management and used as a comparison for management scenarios simulated lastly the fourth step consisted of developing regional specific recommendations based on the outputs of simulations grain yield and water use attending to achieving the highest productivity with the lowest input of resources such as n fertilization and plant density fig 1 data description application and source are presented in table 1 2 1 characterization of pearl millet systems in senegal the cultivated areas of pearl millet in senegal can be distinguished by farmers into two main types of landraces based on different growth cycles the landraces of type souna are sensitive to photoperiod and adapted to regions with low precipitation 350 600 mm it is characterized by a short cycle between 65 and 90 days hereafter called early flowering while the landraces of type sanio are less sensitive to photoperiod and are recommended for regions with higher precipitation 900 1200 mm due to a longer cycle length between 120 and 150 days hereafter called late flowering diack et al 2017 a nationwide database collection extracted from sy et al 2015 and diack et al 2017 during the period 1992 2014 was used to define the geospatial distribution of each landrace type early and late flowering in senegal fig 2 among the 316 villages the early flowering landrace was reported in 278 locations and late flowering by 73 locations fig 1 these 351 points reported cover all producing areas of pearl millet in senegal 12 districts reported data on days to flowering was based on farmer interviews for all locations table 1 2 2 model calibration and evaluation the version 7 10 of the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software platform was used in this study holzworth et al 2014 the apsim millet model van oosterom et al 2001a b 2002 was adjusted to simulate the pearl millet phenology and grain yield at the district level of senegal one generic cultivar was built for each landrace early and late flowering aiming to represent the characteristic of the most adopted pearl millet varieties by farmers in senegal fig 1 the calibration process was carried out first for crop phenology and after for grain yield to our knowledge no previous pearl millet cultivar calibrations were available for the senegal region the genetic parameters developed by akponikpè et al 2010 in niger were defined as a baseline to start the calibration iterations the crop phenology parameters supplementary table s1 were calibrated using field observations from kouakou et al 2013 for 3 experimental sites in 2012 senegal for landraces of early and late cycle length table 1 this database was selected for calibration based on the detailed measurements the parameters that rule the pearl millet phenological development duration from emergence to end of juvenile tt emerg to endjuv duration from flag leaf to flowering tt flag to flower and duration from flowering to maturity tt flower to maturity were adjusted to simulate the pearl millet phenology the parameters related to photoperiod sensitivity pp endjuv to init and critical photoperiod photoperiod crit and photoperiod base were obtained from literature sanon et al 2014 following the methodology from beah et al 2021 the cultivar parameters duration from flowering to start of grain filling tt flower to start grain and grain maximum number per head head grain no max were adjusted employing the data at the district level obtained from the directorate of agricultural statistical analysis and projections which is the ministry of agriculture and rural equipment dapsa maer for 2016 randomly choose to characterize each district the same sites from diack et al 2017 were employed obtaining 351 sites which were averaged according to the district in which each site was located table 1 several iterations of adjustments were performed and calibration was completed when each generic cultivar early and late flowering reproduced satisfactorily the observed data the performance calibrated generic cultivars early and late flowering to simulate crop phenology days to flowering were evaluated using an independent dataset diack et al 2017 of in 351 locations distributed in the 12 pearl millet producing districts in senegal table 1 grain yield was evaluated using the district level reports from dapsa maer between 2017 and 2020 fig 1 following the same step as in the calibration for the grain yield evaluation to characterize each district the same sites from diack et al 2017 were employed obtaining 351 sites which were averaged according to the district in which each site was located fig 2 the initial conditions and crop management supplementary table s2 were defined as described by sy et al 2015 and akponikpè et al 2010 the weather data was retrieved from national aeronautics and space administration prediction of world energy resources nasa power sparks 2018 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 the soil data was collected from soil grids hengl et al 2014 and soil parameters supplementary table s3 were defined using the apsimx package fernando miguez 2022 in r software r core team 2021 the performance of the model to simulate the days to flowering days and grain yield kg ha 1 was assessed using the following set of statistical indices the root mean square error rmse eq s1 expresses the error of the model in the same unit as the variable the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq s2 by the average of observed data the model simulations can be considered excellent good fair and poor based on the respective nrmse values

performance negative values of pbias indicate underestimation by the model while positive values imply overestimation loague and green 1991 the index of agreement d eq s4 represents the degree that simulated values are approached by the measured values this index ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement between the observed and simulated values willmott et al 1985 2 3 management scenarios employing the apsim millet model the response of the studied landraces to different management strategies was assessed for all pearl millet producing districts 12 total of senegal crop management scenarios were simulated by combining i six different levels of nitrogen n fertilization 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 kg n ha 1 as urea ii three plant density 1 1 3 3 and 6 6 plants m 2 and iii three planting dates early medium and late in order to optimize yield relative to water use fig 1 the first planting date early was set at the first precipitation greater than 20 mm after may 30 a widespread practice adopted by farmers in senegal sultan and gaetani 2016 the following planting dates were defined 20 medium and 40 late days after the initial criterion precipitation greater than 20 mm fig s1 the simulated interval of n fertilization was defined according to previous studies that delineated rates for pearl millet under sub saharan conditions akponikpè et al 2010 bastos et al 2022 regarding planting densities the most adopted practice was defined as a starting point 1 1 plant m 2 kanfany 2017 mountakha et al 2020 then two intensification alternatives were tested 3 3 and 6 6 plant m 2 based on plant densities reported in the literature mountakha et al 2020 bastos et al 2022 the simulations were performed over a time series of 32 years from 1990 to 2021 for 351 locations resulting in 606 528 gxexm genotype x environment x management combinations of scenario year the initial conditions for soil water and n were set by initializing the model in january of each year simulated table 1 2 4 standard management baseline aiming to define a baseline to compare with the management scenarios the most common farming practices adopted by the smallholders cultivating the pearl millet crop in senegal were retrieved from the literature fig 1 the search was defined focusing on the most recent surveys last 10 years and data reported directly from farmers available in google scholar supplementary data s1 the planting date was set at the first precipitation higher than 20 mm and after may 30 considered as an early planting date in this study sultan and gaetani 2016 the plant density was defined as 1 1 plants m 2 kanfany 2017 mountakha et al 2020 the n fertilization was defined as 30 kg n ha 1 of urea kanfany 2017 okuyama et al 2017 mountakha et al 2020 dapsa 2021 applied at two dates 21 and 45 days after sowing direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 fertilizer and seed recommendations for west africa map feserwam https feserwam org 2 5 data analysis data analysis and visualization were conducted in r version 4 2 1 software r core team 2021 firstly an analysis of variance anova was performed for each district with simulated grain yield kg ha 1 as the response variable planting dates plant densities n fertilizer rates and its interactions were considered as fixed effects while site year was considered as repetitions the coefficient of variation was estimated to quantify the contribution of management practices and their interactions in the variation of grain yield in addition a relative sensitivity index si was calculated hamby 1994 to assess the contribution of genotype g environment e management m and their interactions gxexm on the variation of grain yield simulated for pearl millet systems in senegal eq 1 1 si d max d min d max in which the d min and d max refer to the minimum and maximum simulated grain yields respectively then the average values of grain yield simulated for management scenarios were compared for each district using the tukey test at the 5 significance level a management strategy combinations of planting date fertilizer and plant density was recommended for each district based on the highest yield average and lowest n fertilizer and plant density less use of inputs the districts were grouped by strategy and the yield probability of exceedance was calculated eq 2 the historical average was calculated for the grain yield reported for senegal from 2016 to 2020 direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 the probability of surpassing the historical average was calculated in order to evaluate the different management scenarios 2 p m n 1 where p is the probability of exceedance m is the ranking from highest to lowest of all annual mean grain yield between the simulated period and n is the total number of years simulated to compare the yield production per unit of water use between the standard and recommended management the relationship between the simulated grain yield and the amount of precipitation reported during the crop season was calculated eq 3 yield precipitation ratio kg m 3 the yield precipitation ratio was averaged for all years simulated for each district 3 yield precipitation ratio grain yield kg m 2 rain m in addition the ratio of water supply to demand was retrieved as a model output this ratio has previously been employed in the literature to characterize the water availability distribution in the crop season for several crops chapman et al 2000 sadras et al 2012 chenu 2015 palmero et al 2022 the ratio of water supply to demand varies from 0 to 1 with 0 representing a full water stress scenario and 1 as a no water stress condition 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the evaluation of the apsim millet model for the two groups of landraces showed adequate performance in simulating crop phenology mainly days to flowering time satisfactory agreement between the observed and simulated values of the days to flowering was verified for early flowering d 0 51 fig 2a the maximum difference between observed and simulated values was 5 days which corresponded to a low rmse 2 4 days fig 3a the nrmse of 4 16 indicates an excellent performance in simulating days to flowering for this landrace fig 3a the model underestimates the time to flowering with a pbias of 0 5 fig 3a similar performance was observed for the late flowering landrace with a higher index of agreement d 0 64 fig 3b the rmse obtained was 3 7 days and the highest difference between the observed and simulated flowering values was 7 days also with an excellent performance in simulating days to flowering the nrmse obtained was 4 53 fig 3b for both landraces the pbias indicated an underestimation of the time to flowering with a larger effect for the late flowering cultivar 1 1 vs 0 5 fig 3a b the simulated grain yield ranged approximately from 500 to 1900 kg ha 1 representing the environmental range of the observed data there was strong agreement between observed and simulated d 0 75 fig 2c and acceptable values of rmse 439 kg ha 1 fig 3c and pbias 25 fig 3c at the district level for the evaluation period from 2016 to 2020 fig 3c according to the nrmse the performance of the model in simulating the pearl millet grain yield at the district level is considered fair fig 3c 3 2 genotype environment and management gxexm interactions the grain yield varied significantly across planting dates p 0 001 plant densities p 0 001 n fertilizer rates p 0 001 and all the interactions of second and third order between these variables were significant p 0 001 as well for all districts simulated the analyzed management variables presented great variability in grain yield fig 4 with planting date being the practice with the highest coefficient of variation fig 4a 51 and n fertilization presented the lowest fig 4a 15 this was corroborated with the sensitivity index fig 4b the coefficient of variation observed for the n fertilization and plant density varied into lower ranges 0 63 and 0 76 and suggests that the model could simulate the systems consistently the interactions double or triple accounted for lower values for the coefficient of variation between 38 and 45 and higher values for the sensitivity index around 0 90 this can be explained by a high influence of the management interactions on the grain yield simulated with the variability in the outputs obtained attributed to the changing in the management scenarios the planting date x planting density x n fertilization presented the greatest value of sensitivity index 0 93 fig 4b implying that the interaction of these variables had the highest influence on the grain yield 3 3 management adaptations for water limited pearl millet systems the recommended management was based on achieving the highest productivity levels with least input use thus management practices were proposed for each district by matching the highest average grain yield attained with the lowest requirement of input n fertilization and planting density supplementary table s4 to s15 these recommended managements were grouped into four strategies table 2 strategies 1 2 and 4 were similar and proposed increment of n fertilizer and plant density yet different planting dates the amount of n fertilizer increased from 30 to 100 kg ha 1 and the plant density from 1 1 to 6 6 plants m 2 compared to standard management for strategy 2 kolda and tambacounda fig 2 no changes in the planting window were recommended the optimal planting window was defined between the first and second weeks of june after the first precipitation greater than 20 mm then the increment obtained in the grain yield 1080 kg ha 1 was driven by the increase in the use of inputs n fertilizer and plant density for strategy 1 located in the center of senegal diourbel fatick kaffrine kaolack sedhiou thies fig 2 yield improvement can be obtained with a delay on planting dates relative to the standard management the simulations suggested that delaying planting dates 20 days after the first precipitation medium represented the best planting window from the two last weeks of july to the end of august across all districts for strategy 1 the average grain yield increased by 1466 kg ha 1 table 2 strategy 4 included only 2 districts with contrasting geographical positions within the country saint louis ziguinchor fig 2 maximizing yields with an average delay of planting time by 40 days after the optimal recommended for strategy 2 the average grain yield increased by 1367 kg ha 1 but also presented the largest standard deviation among strategies 350 kg ha 1 strategy 3 recommendation reflected minor input use for n fertilizer 40 kg ha 1 and plant density 3 3 plants m 2 pointing out a lower dependency on these management factors to increase attainable yields supplementary table s4 to s15 the districts which maximize yields with strategy 3 were located towards the north of senegal louga matam fig 2 and presented low precipitation and high temperatures during the growing season supplementary fig s2 as well as strategy 4 strategy 3 maximized grain yields when planting date was delayed by 40 days after the first precipitation defined as late planting date for this strategy the average grain yield difference between the recommended and standard management was 1583 kg ha 1 showing the largest yield increase table 2 the probability of exceedance was used to further assess the grain yield variability over the years for the proposed strategies across all site and years the simulations for the recommended management presented greater grain yields 880 kg ha 1 compared to the historical average fig 5 for all districts the standard management and the historical average showed yield values close to the lowest yielding management scenario fig 5 indicating a satisfactory representation of the current practices adopted by the smallholders strategy 4 showed the least yield difference between the current and the lowest yielding management scenarios exceeding the last one only for 56 kg ha 1 fig 5 for all the districts the lowest yielding scenario was characterized by 0 kg n ha 1 and the lowest plant density 1 1 plants m 2 highlighting the relevance of increasing the use of inputs to attain greater yields the districts grouped under strategy 3 presented the largest yield gap between the standard and the recommended management 1664 kg ha 1 fig 5 pointing out the districts where this strategy is recommended as potential sites to boost the pearl millet production in senegal to assess the effect of changes in planting dates on crop water availability the relationship between simulated grain yield and the amount of precipitation was calculated fig 6a the simulations showed an increment in the grain yield for the recommended management even without a significant increase in the amount of precipitation during the growing season for all the strategies fig 6a furthermore the ratio of water supply to demand was calculated to depict the water availability distribution over the growing season fig 6b the change of the planting window in strategies 1 3 and 4 positioned the whole growing season in a period of less stress the recommended management presented higher values of water supply to demand and lower standard deviation for all strategies fig 6b for strategy 2 neither changes to the water distribution nor availability were found as no changes in planting date were recommended furthermore episodes of complete stress at least one day with water supply to demand equal to 0 occurred with more frequency when employing the standard management over the years fig 6c the recommended management promoted an increase of 2 6 fold in the average yield precipitation ratio relative to the standard management across all strategies greater efficiency was observed in the north and center regions of the country varying from 1 0 to 1 9 kg m 3 fig 7 this range corresponded to an increase close to 2 5 fold in the yield precipitation ratio for the recommended regarding the standard management simulations differently the yield precipitation ratio obtained by the recommended management was lower towards the south varying from 0 1 to 0 7 kg m 3 fig 7 however these values represented a greater increase 3 fold in yield precipitation ratio when compared to standard management strategy 3 showed the best performance with an increase of 2 8 fold while strategy 2 was the least efficient presenting an increment of 2 2 fold when compared to the yield precipitation ratio for standard management fig 7 4 discussion drought is the main limiting factor of pearl millet production debieu et al 2018 and increasing the synchrony between available water and crop demand can improve the effective use of water blum 2009 in order to raise yields across districts of senegal this study provides a novel contribution utilizing an in silico approach with crop phenology data to calibrate the apsim millet crop growth model for more than 300 locations across senegal synthesizing the most common management by region and providing scenarios to improve crop productivity per unit of water use previous efforts had described potential farming strategies bastos et al 2022 araya et al 2022 tounkara et al 2020 but covering only a few sites across senegal enabling partial corroborations of the proposed strategies bastos et al 2022 reported an optimum n fertilization rate of 91 kg n ha 1 and plant density of 7 4 plants m 2 obtaining grain yields around 2500 kg ha 1 this recommendation matched the proposed management strategy 1 100 n ha 1 6 6 plants m 2 2400 kg ha 1 for a similar geographical region in agreement with our results recent efforts araya et al 2022 evaluating sowing dates and fertilization scenarios across 13 sites in senegal presented similar recommendation using a different crop growth model more specifically matching recommendations were found for sites located where strategy 3 was recommended no significant increase in grain yield as a response to higher n fertilization rates and for the sites within strategy 2 optimum planting date on june 1 fertilization of 115 kg n ha 1 and plant density of 7 plants m 2 area as well contrastingly the delay of 40 days recommended in the planting dates for strategy 4 ziguinchor august saint lous september differed from the planting dates recommended by araya et al 2022 for corresponding sites june nevertheless this study tested earlier planting dates in a fixed interval without considering the dynamics of precipitation patterns lastly tounkara et al 2020 explored years without water limitation in 19 fields in the fatick district recommended strategy 1 and the effect of the n fertilizer depended mainly on bulk density the exploration of historical weather data permitted to decouple the outcomes from the effect of sampling only a few years besides that the employing of a well calibrated crop model across the whole pearl millet producing region in senegal allowed the recommendation of management adaptations for rainfed systems that can improve food security and increase resource use efficiency the yield precipitation ratio was higher in the recommended management regardless of the strategy proposed or the region of the country comparable results were observed by rostamza et al 2011 who reported an increase in water use efficiency due to better water availability with high n fertilization rates the more efficient use of water resources is important to tackle future increasing drought frequency during the rainy season sultan and gaetani 2016 the current management adopted by farmers in senegal showed higher water use and more frequent yield lower than the historical average the recommended management overcomes these limitations close to 3 folding the water use for the area of study the proposed adaptation strategies imply matching high n fertilizer rates to high plant densities this has shown the potential to increase the pearl millet grain yield 12 in sub saharan africa iliasso et al 2022 higher plant densities are more efficient in using water due to reduced loss of water by evaporation when compared to lower plant densities payne 1997 2000 however lower plant densities are commonly adopted by senegalese farmers intending to minimize water competition and reduce yield losses during drought periods bastos et al 2022 nevertheless the higher densities simulated in the present study presented higher productivity as the low plant densities adopted by smallholders are not able to fully exploit the available resources ajeigbe et al 2019 the use of modeling to simulate different management scenarios for pearl millet systems in senegal aided to propose regional specific adaptations for rainfed systems the recommendations developed can guide next future research on interventions for the sustainable intensification of pearl millet systems in senegal and other countries of africa some limitations of this study were i other management aspects of the systems were not considered such as other sources of fertilization e g manure effects of rotation and intercropping and integrated systems with livestock ii the assessment of different initial soil water content for the simulation scenarios were not accounted for iii poor access and availability of previously published data and outcomes on the literature for this region in addition future studies could consider economic environmental human and social indicators stewart et al 2018 to evaluate the impacts of the utilization of inputs proposed by the recommended strategies it is critical to emphasize that the adoption of these practices may be restricted by a lack of financial resources land tenure policies access to inputs cultural barriers extension services and fertilizer costs therefore support from governmental agencies and policymakers is essential to implement the proposed innovation and more sustainably achieve greater productivity levels for this subsistence agriculture basically cultivated in rainfed systems ganyo et al 2019 in senegal and the region in summary it is crucial to develop agricultural support systems to promote the adoption of practices that can establish more productive and resources efficient systems mountakha et al 2020 5 conclusions the adaptation strategies proposed in this study were efficient on improving the efficiency of water use and increasing the yield levels in all producing districts of senegal by adjusting planting time to better match precipitation with the period of higher water demand the number of days with crop under water stress was reduced the adaptation practices promoted an increase of the grain yield around 2 folds and the yield precipitation ratio close to 3 folds the recommended management provided grain yield greater than the historical average for all years simulated with an average increment of 1400 kg ha 1 for senegal this can help improve the food security of rural communities and promote the rational use of resources of pearl millet systems in senegal the capability demonstrated by the approach presented in this study in employing the apsim millet model to simulate pearl millet systems at the district level can be useful in next studies aiming to evaluate impact of climate change intercropping systems and other strategies to optimize agricultural production systems in senegal furthermore the obtained data from the simulations can be implemented on platforms and be a valuable tool to aid researchers producers extensionists

in sub saharan africa vulnerable economies with low productivity levels are especially susceptible to food insecurity and malnutrition schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 this is the result of a combination of factors such as climate variability intensive exploitation of natural resources environmental degradation and poor soil fertility sultan and gaetani 2016 stewart et al 2020 furthermore the

seasons on farm pearl millet yields present low values and high variability within a field and across seasons waddington et al 2010 the reliance on rainfed agriculture economic limitations and lack of institutional strategies to cope with climate variability contribute to increase production uncertainties and food insecurity ganyo et al 2019 in this context pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l r br has the potential to be used to diminish these fluctuations yadav et al 2019 this crop is adapted to grow in areas with marginal soils and low precipitation 350 mm where other cereals have no success to grow ullah et al 2017 and is relatively more tolerant to high temperatures prasad et al 2017 furthermore its grains have an important nutritional value due to their essential micronutrients content e g iron and zinc and gluten free condition debieu et al 2018 gowda et al 2022 for these reasons pearl millet is considered one of the main crops to ensure food security vadez et al 2012 particularly in senegal where it is the most common staple crop cultivated primarily for human consumption direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 the current yield gap for rainfed systems in senegal is near to 2200 kg ha 1 affholder et al 2013 mainly driven by the lack of access to management information inputs and financial resources mountakha et al 2020 optimizing the pearl millet systems is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of production for senegal under water limited conditions bastos et al 2022 however overall information on management practices land use and characterization of farming systems is restricted or not available across regions therond et al 2011 in this context crop models have been extensively used to understand different management strategies such as planting windows beah et al 2021 yield responses to nutrient rates akponikpè et al 2010 akinseye et al 2020 adaptation practices to climate variability seyoum et al 2018 tofa et al 2020 and climate change impacts araya et al 2021a b 2022 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 is one of the available tools capable of generating management scenarios to diminish the yield gap akponikpè et al 2010 beah et al 2021 the main limitation of this kind of approach is the lack of studies that provide model calibration and validation bussel et al 2016 liben et al 2018 developing adaptation strategies adjusted to the current environment is needed to aid smallholders to attain food stability resilient agriculture and improved productivity wajid et al 2021 these strategies encompass the definition of planting window to match rainfall with crop demand plant densities and n fertilization that maximizes yields and promotes the most efficient use of resources therefore this study focused on synthesizing previous efforts describing management crop phenology and productivity to evaluate the apsim millet model to later test management practices in distinct locations across senegal based on that its objectives are to i calibrate and evaluate the performance of agricultural production system simulator apsim millet model to simulate crop phenology and grain yield and ii develop regional specific recommendations for improving yield to water use ratio based on multiple crop management scenarios for rainfed pearl millet systems in senegal 2 material and methods briefly the developed approach consisted of the following four steps first a literature review to characterize the production systems defining the most cultivated landrace types and their geospatial distribution second apsim millet model was calibrated and the model performance was evaluated employing crop phenology and grain yield collected for all the pearl millet producing districts in senegal 12 districts 351 locations third for each location 54 management scenarios were simulated from 1990 to 2021 by combining six levels of nitrogen n fertilization three plant densities and three planting dates based on the initial literature review the most common practices adopted by farmers were defined standard management and used as a comparison for management scenarios simulated lastly the fourth step consisted of developing regional specific recommendations based on the outputs of simulations grain yield and water use attending to achieving the highest productivity with the lowest input of resources such as n fertilization and plant density fig 1 data description application and source are presented in table 1 2 1 characterization of pearl millet systems in senegal the cultivated areas of pearl millet in senegal can be distinguished by farmers into two main types of landraces based on different growth cycles the landraces of type souna are sensitive to photoperiod and adapted to regions with low precipitation 350 600 mm it is characterized by a short cycle between 65 and 90 days hereafter called early flowering while the landraces of type sanio are less sensitive to photoperiod and are recommended for regions with higher precipitation 900 1200 mm due to a longer cycle length between 120 and 150 days hereafter called late flowering diack et al 2017 a nationwide database collection extracted from sy et al 2015 and diack et al 2017 during the period 1992 2014 was used to define the geospatial distribution of each landrace type early and late flowering in senegal fig 2 among the 316 villages the early flowering landrace was reported in 278 locations and late flowering by 73 locations fig 1 these 351 points reported cover all producing areas of pearl millet in senegal 12 districts reported data on days to flowering was based on farmer interviews for all locations table 1 2 2 model calibration and evaluation the version 7 10 of the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software platform was used in this study holzworth et al 2014 the apsim millet model van oosterom et al 2001a b 2002 was adjusted to simulate the pearl millet phenology and grain yield at the district level of senegal one generic cultivar was built for each landrace early and late flowering aiming to represent the characteristic of the most adopted pearl millet varieties by farmers in senegal fig 1 the calibration process was carried out first for crop phenology and after for grain yield to our knowledge no previous pearl millet cultivar calibrations were available for the senegal region the genetic parameters developed by akponikpè et al 2010 in niger were defined as a baseline to start the calibration iterations the crop phenology parameters supplementary table s1 were calibrated using field observations from kouakou et al 2013 for 3 experimental sites in 2012 senegal for landraces of early and late cycle length table 1 this database was selected for calibration based on the detailed measurements the parameters that rule the pearl millet phenological development duration from emergence to end of juvenile tt emerg to endjuv duration from flag leaf to flowering tt flag to flower and duration from flowering to maturity tt flower to maturity were adjusted to simulate the pearl millet phenology the parameters related to photoperiod sensitivity pp endjuv to init and critical photoperiod photoperiod crit and photoperiod base were obtained from literature sanon et al 2014 following the methodology from beah et al 2021 the cultivar parameters duration from flowering to start of grain filling tt flower to start grain and grain maximum number per head head grain no max were adjusted employing the data at the district level obtained from the directorate of agricultural statistical analysis and projections which is the ministry of agriculture and rural equipment dapsa maer for 2016 randomly choose to characterize each district the same sites from diack et al 2017 were employed obtaining 351 sites which were averaged according to the district in which each site was located table 1 several iterations of adjustments were performed and calibration was completed when each generic cultivar early and late flowering reproduced satisfactorily the observed data the performance calibrated generic cultivars early and late flowering to simulate crop phenology days to flowering were evaluated using an independent dataset diack et al 2017 of in 351 locations distributed in the 12 pearl millet producing districts in senegal table 1 grain yield was evaluated using the district level reports from dapsa maer between 2017 and 2020 fig 1 following the same step as in the calibration for the grain yield evaluation to characterize each district the same sites from diack et al 2017 were employed obtaining 351 sites which were averaged according to the district in which each site was located fig 2 the initial conditions and crop management supplementary table s2 were defined as described by sy et al 2015 and akponikpè et al 2010 the weather data was retrieved from national aeronautics and space administration prediction of world energy resources nasa power sparks 2018 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 the soil data was collected from soil grids hengl et al 2014 and soil parameters supplementary table s3 were defined using the apsimx package fernando miguez 2022 in r software r core team 2021 the performance of the model to simulate the days to flowering days and grain yield kg ha 1 was assessed using the following set of statistical indices the root mean square error rmse eq s1 expresses the error of the model in the same unit as the variable the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq s2 by the average of observed data the model simulations can be considered excellent good fair and poor based on the respective nrmse values

simulated values are approached by the measured values this index ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement between the observed and simulated values willmott et al 1985 2 3 management scenarios employing the apsim millet model the response of the studied landraces to different management strategies was assessed for all pearl millet producing districts 12 total of senegal crop management scenarios were simulated by combining i six different levels of nitrogen n fertilization 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 kg n ha 1 as urea ii three plant density 1 1 3 3 and 6 6 plants m 2 and iii three planting dates early medium and late in order to optimize yield relative to water use fig 1 the first planting date early was set at the first precipitation greater than 20 mm after may 30 a widespread practice adopted by farmers in senegal sultan and gaetani 2016 the following planting dates were defined 20 medium and 40 late days after the initial criterion precipitation greater than 20 mm fig s1 the simulated interval of n fertilization was defined according to previous studies that delineated rates for pearl millet under sub saharan conditions akponikpè et al 2010 bastos et al 2022 regarding planting densities the most adopted practice was defined as a starting point 1 1 plant m 2 kanfany 2017 mountakha et al 2020 then two intensification alternatives were tested 3 3 and 6 6 plant m 2 based on plant densities reported in the literature mountakha et al 2020 bastos et al 2022 the simulations were performed over a time series of 32 years from 1990 to 2021 for 351 locations resulting in 606 528 gxexm genotype x environment x management combinations of scenario year the initial conditions for soil water and n were set by initializing the model in january of each year simulated table 1 2 4 standard management baseline aiming to define a baseline to compare with the management scenarios the most common farming practices adopted by the smallholders cultivating the pearl millet crop in senegal were retrieved from the literature fig 1 the search was defined focusing on the most recent surveys last 10 years and data reported directly from farmers available in google scholar supplementary data s1 the planting date was set at the first precipitation higher than 20 mm and after may 30 considered as an early

2017 okuyama et al 2017 mountakha et al 2020 dapsa 2021 applied at two dates 21 and 45 days after sowing direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 fertilizer and seed recommendations for west africa map feserwam https feserwam org 2 5 data analysis data analysis and visualization were conducted in r version 4 2 1 software r core team 2021 firstly an analysis of variance anova was performed for each district with simulated grain yield kg ha 1 as the response variable planting dates plant densities n fertilizer rates and its interactions were considered as fixed effects while site year was considered as repetitions the coefficient of variation was estimated to quantify the contribution of management practices and their interactions in the variation of grain yield in addition a relative sensitivity index si was calculated hamby 1994 to assess the contribution of genotype g environment e management m and their interactions gxexm on the variation of grain yield simulated for pearl millet systems in senegal eq 1 1 si d max d min d max in which the d min and d max refer to the minimum and maximum simulated grain yields respectively then the average values of grain yield simulated for management scenarios were compared for each district using the tukey test at the 5 significance level a management strategy combinations of planting date fertilizer and plant density was recommended for each district based on the highest yield average and lowest n fertilizer and plant density less use of inputs the districts were grouped by strategy and the yield probability of exceedance was calculated eq 2 the historical average was calculated for the grain yield reported for senegal from 2016 to 2020 direction de l analyse de la p et des s a dapsa 2021 the probability of surpassing the historical average was calculated in order to evaluate the different management scenarios 2 p m n 1 where p is the probability of exceedance m is the ranking from highest to lowest of all annual mean grain yield between the simulated period and n is the total number of years simulated to compare the yield production per unit of water use between the standard and recommended management the relationship between the simulated grain yield and the amount of precipitation reported during the crop season was calculated eq 3 yield precipitation ratio kg m 3 the yield precipitation ratio was averaged for all years simulated for each district 3 yield precipitation ratio grain yield kg m 2 rain m in addition the ratio of water supply to demand was retrieved as a model output this ratio has previously been employed in the literature to characterize the water availability distribution in the crop season for several crops chapman et al 2000 sadras et al 2012 chenu 2015 palmero et al 2022 the ratio of water supply to demand varies from 0 to 1 with 0 representing a full water stress scenario and 1 as a no water stress condition 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the evaluation of the apsim millet model for the two groups of landraces showed adequate performance in simulating crop phenology mainly days to flowering time satisfactory agreement between the observed and simulated values of the days to flowering was verified for early flowering d 0 51 fig 2a the maximum difference between observed and simulated values was 5 days which corresponded to a low rmse 2 4 days fig 3a the nrmse of 4 16 indicates an excellent performance in simulating days to flowering for this landrace fig 3a the model underestimates the time to flowering with a pbias of 0 5 fig 3a similar performance was observed for the late flowering landrace with a higher index of agreement d 0 64 fig 3b the rmse obtained was 3 7 days and the highest difference between the observed and simulated flowering values was 7 days also with an excellent performance in simulating days to flowering the nrmse obtained was 4 53 fig 3b for both landraces the pbias indicated an underestimation of the time to flowering with a larger effect for the late flowering cultivar 1 1 vs 0 5 fig 3a b the simulated grain yield ranged approximately from 500 to 1900 kg ha 1 representing the environmental range of the observed data there was strong agreement between observed and simulated d 0 75 fig 2c and acceptable values of rmse 439 kg ha 1 fig 3c and pbias 25 fig 3c at the district level for the evaluation period from 2016 to 2020 fig 3c according to the nrmse the performance of the model in simulating the pearl millet grain yield at the district level is considered fair fig 3c 3 2 genotype environment and management gxexm interactions the grain yield varied significantly across planting dates p 0 001 plant densities p 0 001 n fertilizer rates p 0 001 and all the interactions of second and third order between these variables were significant p 0 001 as well for all districts simulated the analyzed management variables presented great variability in grain yield fig 4 with planting date being the practice with the highest coefficient of variation fig 4a 51 and n fertilization presented the lowest fig 4a 15 this was corroborated with the sensitivity index fig 4b the coefficient of variation observed for the n fertilization and plant density varied into lower ranges 0 63 and 0 76 and suggests that the model could simulate the systems consistently the interactions double or triple accounted for lower values for the coefficient of variation between 38 and 45 and higher values for the sensitivity index around 0 90 this can be explained by a high influence of the management interactions on the grain yield simulated with the variability in the outputs obtained attributed to the changing in the management scenarios the planting date x planting density x n fertilization presented the greatest value of sensitivity index 0 93 fig 4b implying that the interaction of these variables had the highest influence on the grain yield 3 3 management adaptations for water limited pearl millet systems the recommended management was based on achieving the highest productivity levels with least input use thus management practices were proposed for each district by matching the highest average grain yield attained with the lowest requirement of input n fertilization and planting density supplementary table s4 to s15 these recommended managements were grouped into four strategies table 2 strategies 1 2 and 4 were similar and proposed increment of n fertilizer and plant density yet different planting dates the amount of n fertilizer increased from 30 to 100 kg ha 1 and the plant density from 1 1 to 6 6 plants m 2 compared to standard management for strategy 2 kolda and tambacounda fig 2 no changes in the planting window were recommended the optimal planting window was defined between the first and second weeks of june after the first precipitation greater than 20 mm then the increment obtained in the grain yield 1080 kg ha 1 was driven by the increase in the use of inputs n fertilizer and plant density for strategy 1 located in the center of senegal diourbel fatick kaffrine kaolack sedhiou thies fig 2 yield improvement can be obtained with a delay on planting dates relative to the standard management the simulations suggested that delaying planting dates 20 days after the first precipitation medium represented the best planting window from the two last weeks of july to the end of august across all districts for strategy 1 the average grain yield increased by 1466 kg ha 1 table 2 strategy 4 included only 2 districts with contrasting geographical positions within the country saint louis ziguinchor fig 2 maximizing yields with an average delay of planting time by 40 days after the optimal recommended for strategy 2 the average grain yield increased by 1367 kg ha 1 but also presented the largest standard deviation among strategies 350 kg ha 1 strategy 3 recommendation reflected minor input use for n fertilizer 40 kg ha 1 and plant density 3 3 plants m 2 pointing out a lower dependency on these management factors to increase attainable yields supplementary table s4 to s15 the districts which maximize yields with strategy 3 were located towards the north of senegal louga matam fig 2 and presented low precipitation and high temperatures during the growing season supplementary fig s2 as well as strategy 4 strategy 3 maximized grain yields when planting date was delayed by 40 days after the first precipitation defined as late planting date for this strategy the average grain yield difference between the recommended and standard management was 1583 kg ha 1 showing the largest yield increase table 2 the probability of exceedance was used to further assess the grain yield variability over the years for the proposed strategies across all site and years the simulations for the recommended management presented greater grain yields 880 kg ha 1 compared to the historical average fig 5 for all districts the standard management and the historical average showed yield values close to the lowest yielding management scenario fig 5 indicating a satisfactory representation of the current practices adopted by the smallholders strategy 4 showed the least yield difference between the current and the lowest yielding management scenarios exceeding the last one only for 56 kg ha 1 fig 5 for all the districts the lowest yielding scenario was characterized by 0 kg n ha 1 and the lowest plant density 1 1 plants m 2 highlighting the relevance of increasing the use of inputs to attain greater yields the districts grouped under strategy 3 presented the largest yield gap between the standard and the recommended management 1664 kg ha 1 fig 5 pointing out the districts where this strategy is recommended as potential sites to boost the pearl millet production in senegal to assess the effect of changes in planting dates on crop water availability the relationship between simulated grain yield and the amount of precipitation was calculated fig 6a the simulations showed an increment in the grain yield for the recommended management even without a significant increase in the amount of precipitation during the growing season for all the strategies fig 6a furthermore the ratio of water supply to demand was calculated to depict the water availability distribution over the growing season fig 6b the change of the planting window in strategies 1 3 and 4 positioned the whole growing season in a period of less stress the recommended management presented higher values of water supply to demand and lower standard deviation for all strategies fig 6b for strategy 2 neither changes to the water distribution nor availability were found as no changes in planting date were recommended furthermore episodes of complete stress at least one day with water supply to demand equal to 0 occurred with more frequency when employing the standard management over the years fig 6c the recommended management promoted an increase of 2 6 fold in the average yield precipitation ratio relative to the standard management across all strategies greater efficiency was observed in the north and center regions of the country varying from 1 0 to 1 9 kg m 3 fig 7 this range corresponded to an increase close to 2 5 fold in the yield precipitation ratio for the recommended regarding the standard management simulations differently the yield precipitation ratio obtained by the recommended management was lower towards the south varying from 0 1 to 0 7 kg m 3 fig 7 however these values represented a greater increase 3 fold in yield precipitation ratio when compared to standard management strategy 3 showed the best performance with an increase of 2 8 fold while strategy 2 was the least efficient presenting an increment of 2 2 fold when compared to the yield precipitation ratio for standard management fig 7 4 discussion drought is the main limiting factor of pearl millet production debieu et al 2018 and increasing the synchrony between available water and crop demand can improve the effective use of water blum 2009 in order to raise yields across districts of senegal this study provides a novel contribution utilizing an in silico approach with crop phenology data to calibrate the apsim millet crop growth model for more than 300 locations across senegal synthesizing the most common management by region and providing scenarios to improve crop productivity per unit of water use previous efforts had described potential farming strategies bastos et al 2022 araya et al 2022 tounkara et al 2020 but covering only a few sites across senegal enabling partial corroborations of the proposed strategies bastos et al 2022 reported an optimum n fertilization rate of 91 kg n ha 1 and plant density of 7 4 plants m 2 obtaining grain yields around 2500 kg ha 1 this recommendation matched the proposed management strategy 1 100 n ha 1 6 6 plants m 2 2400 kg ha 1 for a similar geographical region in agreement with our results recent efforts araya et al 2022 evaluating sowing dates and fertilization scenarios across 13 sites in senegal presented similar recommendation using a different crop growth model more specifically matching recommendations were found for sites located where strategy 3 was recommended no significant increase in grain yield as a response to higher n fertilization rates and for the sites within strategy 2 optimum planting date on june 1 fertilization of 115 kg n ha 1 and plant density of 7 plants m 2 area as well contrastingly the delay of 40 days recommended in the planting dates for strategy 4 ziguinchor august saint lous september differed from the planting dates recommended by araya et al 2022 for corresponding sites june nevertheless this study tested earlier planting dates in a fixed interval without considering the dynamics of precipitation patterns lastly tounkara et al 2020 explored years without water limitation in 19 fields in the fatick district recommended strategy 1 and the effect of the n fertilizer depended mainly on bulk density the exploration of historical weather data permitted to decouple the outcomes from the effect of sampling only a few years besides that the employing of a well calibrated crop model across the whole pearl millet producing region in senegal allowed the recommendation of management adaptations for rainfed systems that can improve food security and increase resource use efficiency the yield precipitation ratio was higher in the recommended management regardless of the strategy proposed or the region of the country comparable results were observed by rostamza et al 2011 who reported an increase in water use efficiency due to better water availability with high n fertilization rates the more efficient use of water resources is important to tackle future increasing drought frequency during the rainy season sultan and gaetani 2016 the current management adopted by farmers in senegal showed higher water use and more frequent yield lower than the historical average the recommended management overcomes these limitations close to 3 folding the water use for the area of study the proposed adaptation strategies imply matching high n fertilizer rates to high plant densities this has shown the potential to increase the pearl millet grain yield 12 in sub saharan africa iliasso et al 2022 higher plant densities are more efficient in using water due to reduced loss of water by evaporation when compared to lower plant densities payne 1997 2000 however lower plant densities are commonly adopted by senegalese farmers intending to minimize water competition and reduce yield losses during drought periods bastos et al 2022 nevertheless the higher densities simulated in the present study presented higher productivity as the low plant densities adopted by smallholders are not able to fully exploit the available resources ajeigbe et al 2019 the use of modeling to simulate different management scenarios for pearl millet systems in senegal aided to propose regional specific adaptations for rainfed systems the recommendations developed can guide next future research on interventions for the sustainable intensification of pearl millet systems in senegal and other countries of africa some limitations of this study were i other management aspects of the systems were not considered such as other sources of fertilization e g manure effects of rotation and intercropping and integrated systems with livestock ii the assessment of different initial soil water content for the simulation scenarios were not accounted for iii poor access and availability of previously published data and outcomes on the literature for this region in addition future studies could consider economic environmental human and social indicators stewart et al 2018 to evaluate the impacts of the utilization of inputs proposed by the recommended strategies it is critical to emphasize that the adoption of these practices may be restricted by a lack of financial resources land tenure policies access to inputs cultural barriers extension services and fertilizer costs therefore support from governmental agencies and policymakers is essential to implement the proposed innovation and more sustainably achieve greater productivity levels for this subsistence agriculture basically cultivated in rainfed systems ganyo et al 2019 in senegal and the region in summary it is crucial to develop agricultural support systems to promote the adoption of practices that can establish more productive and resources efficient systems mountakha et al 2020 5 conclusions the adaptation strategies proposed in this study were efficient on improving the efficiency of water use and increasing the yield levels in all producing districts of senegal by adjusting planting time to better match precipitation with the period of higher water demand the number of days with crop under water stress was reduced the adaptation practices promoted an increase of the grain yield around 2 folds and the yield precipitation ratio close to 3 folds the recommended management provided grain yield greater than the historical average for all years simulated with an average increment of 1400 kg ha 1 for senegal this can help improve the food security of rural communities and promote the rational use of resources of pearl millet systems in senegal the capability demonstrated by the approach presented in this study in employing the apsim millet model to simulate pearl millet systems at the district level can be useful in next studies aiming to evaluate impact of climate change intercropping systems and other strategies to optimize agricultural production systems in senegal furthermore the obtained data from the simulations can be implemented on platforms and be a valuable tool to aid researchers producers extensionists

forage crops account for 50 86 of the total blue water dedicated to milk production sultana et al 2014 the water consumption of a single cow is between 68 and 155 liters per day see drastig et al 2021 equivalent to 20 50 times the liquid demand of a typical human thus dairy production exerts pressure on stocks of freshwater even in regions where water is relatively abundant such as latin america

factors chiriboga 2015 lloret 2009 we conducted a discrete choice experiment dce to explore whether mejia s farmers are willing to adopt cost saving conservation practices for both the quantity and the quality of their water resources we have examined the literature to identify research strategies and lessons regarding the economic value of water and bmps we concluded that few or no dce studies have been performed to assess water conservation practices within the context of livestock or dairy production in latin america see olum et al 2020 3 3 we mainly looked for published stated preference literature describing livestock or dairy farmers wtp wta for water conservation practices our dce explores preferences for four attributes the first attribute refers to water efficient irrigation practices micro sprinklers and solid rain the second attribute involves composting as a manure management the third attribute refers to the private or municipal management of plastics waste the fourth attribute describes the availability of training in water conflict resolution and cooperation finally the monetary attribute has been described as the percentage of costs that a respondent would pay him herself in november 2020 our dce presented 98 dairy farmers i e 3 08 of meija s dairy units with water conservation practices in terms of the above five attributed our research contributes to the literature by documenting dairy farmers preferences decision making processes and potential transitions toward incentivized water preservation practices with an eye towards achieving sustainable development goals to the best of our knowledge the academic literature has largely overlooked preferences of dairy farmers in latin america we estimate the economic value ecuadorian dairy farmers assign to production practices that preserve water also we illustrate how dce can be used to gather policy relevant information when designing incentive based interventions to encourage movement toward a cleaner production regime in latin american countries 2 context data and methods 2 1 study zone description mejia is a canton in the southeastern part of the province of pichincha ecuador see fig 1 mejia is surrounded by natural elevations such as atacazo la viudita el corazón los ilinizas pasochoa ninahilca sincholagua rumiñahui and cotopaxi gad municipio de mejía 2015 this is why this canton is called the valley of the nine volcanoes as this andean zone enjoys a unique biodiversity within their montane rain forests and paramos it has a protected natural reserve with more than 30 000 ha where los ilinizas mountain is the biggest protected area 63 of total protected area see gad municipio de mejía 2020 also there exist 14 different types of terrestrial ecosystems in mejia where the most prevailing is herbazal del paramo which is usually located between 2900 3900 m a s l consists of dense vegetal formation and faces high variability of humidity and temperature 4 4 see terán et al 2019 for more details of the definition of these forest ecosystems in ecuador in terms of climate conditions mejia shows a great variability across its territory with an annual precipitation between 500 and 2000 mm in some places and more than 2000 mm in others gad municipio de mejía 2020 also it presents an annual average temperature between 10 c and 24 c although this canton has low probability of drought events agriculture is the land use more exposed to this occurrence 5 5 in ecuador average annual precipitation is 2159 33 mm and mean temperature depends on the months where from december to may is rainy season with temperature between 25 c and 26 c and from june to november is dry season with temperature between 21 c and 22 c see world bank group 2021 mejia benefits from the two main sub basins in pichincha the guayallabamba and blanco rivers which generate approximately 384 rivers and streams san pedro and pita rivers are also important water bodies gad municipio de mejía 2020 supplying water for both human consumption and agricultural irrigation despite these abundant water resources mejia suffers from water deficits particularly during the summer gad provincia de pichincha 2015 thus mejia is suitable for agricultural activities it has a total area of 1410 82 km2 of which 36 078 91 ha are used for livestock production gad municipio de mejía 2020 around 21 of its labor force participates in agricultural activities specifically in dairy production pichincha is the leading milk province in ecuador with 15 9 of the national milk output mejia supplies 34 of pichincha s production with an average productivity of 13 5 liters per day per cow banco central del ecuador 2020 gad municipio de mejía 2020 this productivity is above the national and pichincha average of 6 and 11 27 liters respectively dataset inec 2022 2 2 data collection and discrete choice experiment our study was conducted primarily within the communities of machachi tambillo aloasi and uyumbicho sampled dairy farms were located along the san pedro river although dairy production is the main farm activity in our study area farmers also grow crops such as potatoes maize broad beans etc in november 2020 we implemented a face to face survey 6 6 approval from human research ethics committee at the universidad san francisco de quito on 98 dairy farmers while this sample represents 3 08 of mejia s dairy units gad municipio de mejía 2015 7 7 data collection by perspectiva consultores estrategicos cia ltd management consulting services our budget was for 100 surveys initially where two of them were incomplete and excluded from our analysis we do not have the number of farmers who did not want to participate in this in person survey it falls short of 187 the sample size according to orme 2010 s rule of thumb 8 8 orme 2010 s rule of thumb states that n 500 c ta where n is the number of respondents t is the number of choice tasks per respondent a is the number of alternatives in each choice set excluding the status quo alternative and c is the largest number of levels for any one attribute when considering only main effects which is the case here in our case t is 4 a is 2 and c is 3 due to covid 19 related challenges we have not been able to gather data from a larger sample size in this respect we would like to highlight that previous dce studies have analyzed samples of similar size e g ngoc et al 2016 sauthoff et al 2016 schreiner and latacz lohmann 2015 vassalos et al 2015 two filter questions ensured that respondents were milk producers and made decisions about their farms at the farms experienced enumerators carefully described the experiment the practices and the average implementation cost of us 1144 to respondents details on how these costs are in appendix d of ortiz 2021 and in domínguez 2020 the survey comprised eight sections see appendix a section 1 identifies the respondents section 2 collects agricultural production information section 3 asks financial literacy questions section 4 introduces our dce section 5 collected demographic data section 6 asks intrahousehold decision making questions for married respondents section 7 obtains respondents family information including pre marriage information finally section 8 asks about respondent s household composition dce is one of the foremost stated preferences methods johnston et al 2017 petrolia et al 2021 dce allows to estimate wtp for different hypothetical alternatives this is an advantage over contingent valuation cv which only gives the economic value of a particular scenario perman et al 2003 in addition dce infers wtp to each attribute level or characteristic of a prospective scenario while cv method estimates a global value dce welfare estimates also have smaller variance than those from cv adamowicz et al 1998 finally dce is preferred over conjoint analysis because it is based on the random utility theory rut that is more consistent with the demand theory louviere et al 2010 one disadvantage of dce is that it imposes a tedious mental exercise to respondents who are asked to select different alternatives from different choice sets this opens the doors for choosing with no careful consideration perman et al 2003 to reduce this fatigue of respondents we employ a blocking strategy on a fractional factorial design with a d efficiency of 1 9 9 our design was implemented with r packages idefix and radiant see ortiz 2021 our design contained 12 choice sets divided into three blocks each respondent answered one block of four choice sets each set included two plans and the status quo see appendix b we conducted interviews with local experts agronomists veterinarians and biologists and dairy farmers and identified twenty water conservation practices based on economic feasibility we chose four attributes related to improved irrigation systems appropriate animal manure and solid waste management and strong water governance in table 1 we describe the attributes and levels of our dce precision irrigation is an alternative to the widespread use of inefficient flood irrigation brar et al 2022 thus our first attribute has two irrigation technology levels micro sprinkler systems and the superabsorbent polymers known as solid rain micro sprinkler systems distribute water to cultivated plants via a low pressure piping system resulting in greater water efficiency decreased irrigation time and deterrence of soil erosion chen et al 2002 el hafez et al 2020 fao 2008 in 2020 the estimated implementation cost for this irrigation system is us 1200 ha 1 which includes the suction pump sprinklers valves and couplings for installation see riego ecuador 2020 solid rain is a polymer that retains water it can be applied to the soil to moisturize plant roots once the water held by the polymer is totally absorbed the polymer can be charged again for up to 10 years polymer application has resulted in increases in crop production absorption of agrochemicals avoiding leaching and runoff and prevention of soil erosion ai et al 2021 chang et al 2021 cisneros et al 2020 shock and iida 2009 studies in ecuador have experimented with this practice in potato broccoli and lettuce production caizapasto 2019 toctaguano 2019 valera 2018 and the return per dollar invested increased in all cases solid rain technology incurs in an initial cost of us 650 ha 1 considering recommended amount per hectare along with the cost of labor for the installation process cosecha de lluvia sólida 2015 the second one level attribute manure composting can help to prevent water pollution caused by untreated manure and agrochemicals bekchanov and mirzabaev 2018 lim et al 2016 animal manure is a valuable resource that when properly managed can i increase income from livestock ii improve animal nutrition and iii minimize financial risk integrated manure management entails the storage processing and subsequent application of the excreta on crops hristov et al 2013 jiménez trujillo 2007 its estimated initial cost is us 438 which implies the building of the concrete block the metal structure and the plastic cover this cost also includes the necessary piping to ensure proper functioning see paredes 2018 the third attribute has two levels related to the management of plastic solid waste generated by dairy production in accordance with guidelines on container disposal fao and who 2008 the first level is private management where farmers themselves collect plastic waste and transport it to private collection centers various reverse logistics programs for the management of plastic containers exist in countries such as australia brazil canada and chile fao and who 2008 the second level is a public waste management system where municipal dumpsters visit accessible areas farmers would not incur any implementation cost other than a monthly payment of 2 of the electricity bill for two collections a month as in gualichicomín 2018 10 10 mejia s government charges 10 of electricity bills kwh month for garbage collection services where the average cost per kwh is us 0 1031 and us 0 1041 for residential and commercial areas respectively the fourth attribute aims to capture preferences for features that strengthen water governance through conflict resolution and water user cooperative training courses these can be seen as instruments for the promotion of cooperation and self governance aiming to decrease in conflicts over water resources amirova et al 2019 bardhan 1993 cardenas et al 2011 cox et al 2010 mcginnis and ostrom 1992 mirzaei et al 2019 ostrom and gardner 1993 the fondo para la protección del agua fonag develops similar initiatives in the northeastern part of quito fonag 2020 11 11 fonag is a water conservation fund financed by public and private organizations to protect the water resources in ecuador the idea of this attribute is to have a constant community engagement between academic institutions and water users last year students e g from law schools can provide these training sessions as part of their final examination i e internships working with the irrigation board in each community this training may be a requirement for farmers to be irrigation beneficiaries the producer will incur no costs every training session will provide communication strategies negotiation skills cooperation initiatives and free counsel to resolve problems related to water management the fifth attribute is the farmers implementation cost share payments for irrigation systems and manure management the other practices have no initial cost we present three cost share levels 30 60 and 70 selected from a review of assistance and subsidies available from various government agencies table 2 provides an example of one of our choice sets 2 3 conceptual framework the empirical design of discrete choice experiments relies on the idea that utility is derived from the attributes of a good lancaster 1966 also dce is based on rut in which conceptual and empirical probabilistic models intersect based on the assumption of a utility function containing deterministic and stochastic factors marschak 1974 mcfadden 1986 thus assume the following utility u ij of agent i for alternative j 1 u ij v ij ε ij β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij ε ij where v ij and ε ij are the deterministic and random elements respectively x ijs is an observable attribute s with its preference parameter β s c ij is a cost attribute with its coefficient β c lastly β j is the alternative specific utility we excluded agent s characteristics for simplicity using eq 1 we calculate wtp for attribute s i e the marginal rate of substitution or the respondent s subjective value of attribute s in terms of the cost attribute as follows 2 wtp s u ij x ijs u ij c ij β s β c 2 4 econometric strategy based on eq 1 an agent i will choose among all possible alternatives j 1 2 j the alternative j over k using the following criteria 3 u ij u ik ε v ik v ij j k where ε ε ij ε ik as utility levels are not observable the probability of choosing an alternative is computed as follows 4 prob chosej prob ε v ik v ij j k then assuming ε is independent and identically distributed iid as a gumbel a type 1 extreme value eq 4 is mathematically specified as follows see greene 2008 5 prob chosej e v ij j 1 j e σ s v ij e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij j 1 j e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij eq 5 is the conditional logit cl model which holds two important assumptions i independence of irrelevant alternative iia and ii preference homogeneity we relax these restrictive assumptions by employing the random parameter logit rpl model see train 2009 thus the probability of choosing j is 6 prob chosej e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij j 1 j e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij f β θ ω d β where f β θ ω is a density function for a vector of the attribute s coefficients with expected value θ and variance covariance matrix ω this model abandons the iia assumption and incorporates unobserved preference heterogeneity boxall and adamowicz 2002 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 3 compares the descriptive statistics of our sample and official data for pichincha in 2021 12 12 encuesta de superficie y produccion agropercuaria continua dataset inec 2022 official data are representative at province level only farm size head of cattle ha 1 milk price and milk production are specific to dairy farms based on this comparison we believe that our sample closely approximates a representative sample of dairy farmers in mejia regarding the sampled respondents socioeconomic characteristics most farmers are male 74 with an average age of 55 3 years which is statistically similar to official statistics our respondents however seem to be less educated than individuals from the official data while the official data report 68 of respondents holding no higher qualification than a high school diploma this number is 91 in our sample our sampled farmers hold 7 36 ha on average statistically equal to official numbers 11 17 ha our respondents on average own 5 50 head of cattle ha 1 produce 101 37 liters of milk per day and sell that milk for a price of us 0 35 l 1 these numbers are statistically equal to their equivalents in the official data only 23 of our respondents reported a decrease in sales due to covid 19 conditions which is lower than the official number 39 of the sampled respondents 35 do not irrigate whereas 39 of participants in the official data do not irrigate within irrigators 97 utilize sprinkler surface system in our sample similar to the official rate of 98 while only 2 employ micro sprinkler systems statistically different from the official rate of 0 3 in our sample 86 of farmers use chemical fertilizers for grassland cultivation and 50 use organic fertilizers this latter number is equal to the official statistic concerning manure management most farmers practice manure dispersion 94 in our sample and 86 in the official data while only a few practice composting 7 in our sample and 12 in the official data finally 88 of our respondents burn bury or dump their solid waste alongside common trash there are no official data on solid waste disposal methods 3 2 econometric models table 4 reports estimates from four rpl and one cl specifications 13 13 find our dataset in ortiz et al 2022 we used stata statistical software to estimate our models panel a reports the mean point estimates of coefficients the first and second columns report rpl assuming normally distributed parameters including the price parameter but show uncorrelated rpl1 and correlated rpl rpl2 respectively the third and fourth columns report rpl assuming fixed price parameter and normal distribution of the rest of the parameters uncorrelated rpl3 and correlated rpl4 rpl respectively the fifth column displays cl estimate regarding sign direction and the statistical significance of mean estimates table 4 shows that the utility parameter associated with the status quo is negative in all four rpls but statistically significant for rpl1 and rpl2 the cl specification yields a positive but insignificant estimate for the status quo in addition all four rpls and the cl yield positive and statistically significant preferences for solid rain and training preferences for manure composting are negative in all five models but statistically significant only in rpl2 and a similar pattern is evident for municipal management consistent with economic theory the price coefficient is negative and statistically significant at 99 confidence across all models in table 4 panel b reports the standard deviation of utility parameters for rlp1 and rpl3 the statistical significance and the magnitude of the standard deviation coefficients of status quo solid rain and manure composting indicate the presence of high levels of unobserved preference heterogeneity table 5 reports the elements of the lower triangular covariance matrix of utility parameters for rpl2 and rpl4 the significance of these cholesky elements confirms unobserved preference heterogeneity we do not compute correlations directly but the signs of these elements indicate the direction of these correlations for instance using rpl2 specification we observe that status quo has a negative correlation with solid rain training and cost share payment while solid rain is positively correlated with manure composting and municipal plastic waste management finally we also see that cost share payment has a negative correlation with manure composting municipal and training given the magnitude and statistical significance of variance and cholesky parameters documenting unobserved heterogeneity in preferences it is not surprising that all four rpls outperform cl as reflected by both aic and bic see panel c in table 4 among the four rpls rpl1 has the highest performance concerning aic and bic of the two empirical models that align with economic theory by keeping the price parameter fixed i e rpl3 and rpl4 rpl3 outperforms rpl4 regarding bic and performs only slightly worse than rpl4 in terms of aic comparison of the statistical fitness of the rpls thus suggests that a lack of correlation among the parameters is empirically preferred in our data as assumed in rpl1 and rpl3 3 3 willingness to pay estimates table 6 displays estimates of wtp arising from the five specifications reported in table 4 we mostly focus on wtp arising from rpl1 and rpl3 statistically significant and positive wtps for solid rain adoption and training for conflict resolution and cooperation are consistent across models for instance findings from rpl3 indicate that farmers are willing to pay us 170 ha 1 for the adoption of solid rain which represents 26 15 of its implementation cost or 14 86 of average implementation cost and us 244 ha 1 for training table 7 reports wtp by subsamples based on heads of cattle 10 and 10 and farm size 4 ha and 4 ha that reflect the size of each production unit we chose rpl1 following goodness of fit tests see ghosh et al 2013 the findings are consistent across both subsamples while smaller farmers have an insignificant negative wtp for the status quo larger farmers have a significantly negative wtp for the status quo ranging from us 230 to us 224 ha 1 this finding reflects a greater disutility among the larger farmers similarly while a positive wtp for solid rain exits for all subsamples it is only among bigger farmers that this wtp is statistically significant ranging from us 98 to us 137 ha 1 in contrast the results demonstrate a significant and positive wtp for training in all subsamples finally farmers have provided their preferences for which financial institutions should share the cost of implementation public financial institutions such as banecuador 57 14 and cfn 12 25 are the most preferred followed by private banks 14 29 and other entities such as saving and credit cooperative 19 39 14 14 shares of agricultural loans are 49 36 for public institutions and 50 64 for private banks mag 2020 4 discussion our findings illustrate that the status quo low adoption rate of water conservation practices does not necessarily imply disutility particularly among smaller farmers we offer two reasons for this finding 1 given financial barriers and uncertainties exacerbated by the current pandemic producers may be avoiding the addition of new practices and costs to their production process and 2 some of the practices are not well known and farmers may not have completely understood our explanation of these hypothetical alternatives in this case the status quo would become the best option this second reason will lead to forthcoming research in which we will attempt to empirically measure the relationship between farmers choices and financial literacy we use financial literacy as a proxy of farmers understanding of complex scenarios our findings strongly suggest that farmers are interested in two practices solid rain and training courses for water governance improvement first given the inefficient use of water in mejia farmers demand improved irrigation systems although solid rain is not yet well known in our study area farmers especially larger farmers showed strong interest in experimenting with this technique in fact the literature discusses how farmers assign intrinsic values to water that exceed irrigation water prices alcon et al 2014 mu et al 2019 rigby et al 2010 salman and al karablieh 2004 providing insights into the potential for incentive based mechanisms to increase farmers adoption of efficient irrigation technologies 15 15 prior research also reports preferences for improved irrigation technologies such as drip gravity soil moisture monitoring drainage management among others abebe et al 2020 aydogdu and bilgic 2016 houessionon et al 2017 khachatryan et al 2019 ogonna olive and kingsley david 2021 second water governance is weak in our study area which opens the door to water conflicts thus our producers seem to be interested in strategies that would help them establish rules and form cooperation initiatives the existing literature supports preferences over cooperative behavior among farmers for example this behavior occurs in a collaborative insurance scheme in central mexico colin castillo et al 2022 in collective participation in an agri environmental scheme in spain villanueva et al 2015 or in the local management of an irrigation system in south africa saldías et al 2016 in addition local communities are willing to associate with external agencies to improve governance for instance in the implementation of climate change adaptation schemes nthambi et al 2021 this also supports our proposal that external agencies could offer training courses in this context i e given that our respondents are interested in efficient irrigation technologies and open to improve their water governance we see an opportunity to build a water governance that prevents the undesirable rebound effect this effect refers to the potential that adoption of efficient technologies does not necessarily bring lower use of resources because adopters may end up using such efficient technologies at higher rates to the point that efficiency is overcompensated and resources en up used at higher rates than before adoption of efficient technologies in this respect sainz santamaria and martinez cruz 2019 document that experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that widespread adoption of efficient irrigation sprinkler or drip technologies would substantially reduce aquifer overdraft in aguascalientes mexico the authors point out that these expectations are coherent with previous economic studies documenting that adopters increase irrigated area after technology adoption and switch to crops that use water more intensively thus findings in this paper open the possibility of further researcher aiming to take advantage of dairy farmers interest on improvement of water governance to foresee mechanisms preventing rebound effects from adoption of efficient technologies this topic deserves further exploration both for academic purposes and for public policy relevance two practices were not preferred and farmers would even demand payment for their adoption the first manure composting implies additional costs and the construction of a composting site which reduces space for other farming activities some of these farms cover less than 1 ha potential increases in labor cost and low prices for fertilizers such as urea and diammonium phosphate in previous years baffes and chian koh 2019 may provoke farmers unwillingness to adopt manure composting even when it yields monthly savings our finding differs from the conclusion drawn by tur cardona et al 2018 that livestock producers in seven eu countries are willing to pay prices for manure composting of up to 41 3 more than the cost of chemical fertilization the second non preferred practice municipal management does not involve an implementation cost but mejia s municipality would charge an additional fee for managing solid waste one reason for a negative preference is that as bigger electricity consumers larger farmers might observe a higher increase in their bill than smaller farmers another reason is an option not explored in our dce the public private management for instance study cases show farmers willingness to pay for a public private management between us 1 68 and us 4 22 per month see omotesho et al 2016 rahji and oloruntoba 2009 thus our sampled farmers did not see this option as an attribute level and then status quo became their desired alternative indeed we may need more research on other levels of this attribute differences between our findings and previous findings may reflect context specific preferences e g preferences of farmers in developed countries versus preferences of farmers in a developing country however we cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of attribute s statistical significance that we are interpreting as lack of farmers preferences is due to the size of our sample orme 2010 s rule of thumb has suggested a sample size of 187 but we have collected data from 98 respondents due to covid 19 related challenges thus it is plausible that an increase in data yields statistically significant parameters for the attributes that we are documented as of no interest for our respondents indeed wtp estimates in this paper have been obtained amid the covid 19 pandemic whether and by how much these estimates may differ from those obtained in post pandemic times become relevant research questions relevant from a public policy perspective but also from a purely scientific perspective in this respect we plan to explore potential differences in the near future in addition we wish to direct the reader s attention to previous evidence suggesting that estimates of stated wtp remain stable in context of economic recessions which is how the pandemic can be translated into a macroeconomic event krugman 2020 keeping in mind that goods under valuation and contexts are different in comparison to our study martínez cruz and núñez 2021 have reported that stated wtp for renewable energies have change only slightly once an economic recession has occurred in developed countries research on this issue has yet to be carried out in developing countries 5 conclusions our findings are relevant for policymakers and researchers interested in promoting water conservation practices among dairy farmers in ecuador and other developing countries particularly in latin america the first finding that we highlight is the disutility that mejia s larger farmers report for the status quo this result implies that a change in current management practices would deliver an increase in utility among larger farmers in this sense solid rain and training courses for conflict resolution and cooperation would deliver an improvement in the welfare of larger producers it is also consistent in our case study that manure composting is not in demand among our farmers the story is less straightforward in the case of solid rain and municipal waste management while smaller farmers seem to have zero wtp for municipal management larger farmers report disutility a result which holds across all sizes of production units overall wtp for solid rain is positive and significant across model specifications but smaller farmers are not interested in this irrigation technique while larger farmers report positive preferences thus field experimentation is required for the adoption of this improved irrigation system such heterogeneity in preference is intuitive larger farmers would likely benefit more from solid rain than smaller farmers which translates into a higher wtp simultaneously the relatively homogeneous preferences for the status quo and training on conflict resolution and cooperation are informative farmers of all farm sizes demanding a change in status quo conditions is consistent with their demand for assistance in handling likely conflicts in the current context these results are expected given the inefficient water use in our study area and the risk of water conflict due to weak water administration local universities or ngos through community engagement programs can play an essential role in helping water users develop cooperative behaviors and resolve conflicts handayani et al 2022 mckinney and thorson 2015 wingfield et al 2021 in fact ecuadorian universities require internships in some of their academic programs for instance last year law school students supervised by their professors can impart training courses or legal advice on cooperation and conflict resolution strategies for this policy action we can learn from fonag s projects that address legal framework technical assistances governance conflict resolution and son on fonag 2020 2007 finally environmental law clinics would allow students to offer counsel to facilitate the resolution of problems between water users our results show that farmers are interested in solid rain however their wtp only covers a portion of its implementation cost consequently cost sharing schemes could facilitate the adoption of this technology or other conservation practices that satisfy the ecuadorian government s guidelines for livestock bmps agrocalidad 2012 in fact there are different cases of cost sharing programs in ecuador such as 30 subsidy within the cattle repopulation and genetic improvement program mag 2016 the 80 subsidy for certified seeds and fertilizers among other commodities eltelegrafo 2017 or the 50 70 or 90 subsidy for operating costs in forest conservation mae 2013 farmers with financial aid could overcome implementation risks and current financial barriers and where cost sharing schemes can have long lasting effects on farmers livelihood hossain et al 2022 policymakers should devise cost sharing plans based primarily on the farmers profiles and needs to reduce high implementation costs dce is a tool that can provide ex ante information about farmers preferences for different sustainable practices and thus help agricultural authorities make informed decisions when implementing agricultural adoption programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9091,worldwide farming practices directly impact the quality and quantity of both underground and surface water resources in mejia the leading milk producing region of ecuador the adoption rate of conservation practices among farmers is low despite price incentives established by the agricultural ministry our discrete choice experiment documents stated preferences for water conservation practices of mejia s dairy farmers by facing respondents to alternatives described in terms of water efficient technologies management of manure and solid waste and training to resolve conflicts over water use estimates derived from our preferred random parameter logit specification imply that the average willingness to pay wtp for a solid rain irrigation system is us 147 ha 1 and us 212 ha 1 for training to resolve conflicts in addition we report heterogeneity in wtp estimates these findings can assist in the resolution of current issues in mejia including inefficient water irrigation and weak water governance system based on our results and the context of our study area we suggest first the adoption of a cost sharing scheme given that the wtp for these practices does not cover their implementation cost and second the participation of academic institutions to help these water users resolve conflicts establish their own rules and improve water governance keywords water conservation

water is an essential component of global animal production e g for feeding and drinking which requires 2422 gm3 on an annual basis 1 1 to put this number into perspective a typical latin american family e g four members has a water endowment of 112 000 m3 per year united nations 2021 which is equivalent to 1 12e 22 gm3 of this volume 19 is used for dairy production mekonnen and hoekstra 2012

equivalent to 20 50 times the liquid demand of a typical human thus dairy production exerts pressure on stocks of freshwater even in regions where water is relatively abundant such as latin america

best management practices bmps magap 2013 however adoption rate of conservation practices among farmers is low despite such price incentives only 29 livestock farms in the province of pichincha hold a bmp certification mag 2020 the milk price including the premium can at most be 0 44 in comparison the average production cost is 0 43 per liter cevallos polanco et al 2021 thus the premium from adopting bmps seems insufficient as in other cases of agricultural conservation program in ecuador see barrowclough et al 2016 raes et al 2016 the canton of mejia is our case study because in addition to being the leading ecuadorian milk producing region it suffers from inefficient water management cachipuendo et al 2017 gad provincia de pichincha 2015 nieto et al 2018 water pollution by solid and animal waste andrango and sandoval 2021 bonifaz 2018 vinueza et al 2021 and conflicts among water users gad provincia de pichincha 2015 for instance the primary irrigation systems in pichincha are overhead sprinkler systems or flood irrigation techniques resulting in only 60 of the water being purposively used gad provincia de pichincha 2015 case studies have also identified excess levels of e coli in various dairy farms drainage systems in mejia andrango and sandoval 2021 bonifaz 2018 similarly livestock production produces solid contaminants e g vaccine syringes or chemical containers mejia s per capita plastic waste is 33 22 kg a year 14 of total solid rubbish and only 0 73 of this waste is recovered for recycling 2 2 data obtained from dataset inec 2020 to infer these numbers finally water conflicts result from appropriation and provision issues due to growing water demand from urban and rural areas inefficient administration of water lack of farmer organization and other factors chiriboga 2015 lloret 2009 we conducted a discrete choice experiment dce to explore whether mejia s farmers are willing to adopt cost saving conservation practices for both the quantity and the quality of their water resources we have examined the literature to identify research strategies and lessons regarding the economic value of water and bmps we concluded that few or no dce studies have been performed to assess water conservation practices within the context of livestock or dairy production in latin america see olum et al 2020 3 3 we mainly looked for published stated preference literature describing livestock or dairy farmers wtp wta for water conservation practices our dce explores preferences for four attributes the first attribute refers to water efficient irrigation practices micro sprinklers and solid rain the second attribute involves composting as a manure management the third attribute refers to the private or municipal management of plastics waste the fourth attribute describes the availability of training in water conflict resolution and cooperation finally the monetary attribute has been described as the percentage of costs that a respondent would pay him herself in november 2020 our dce presented 98 dairy farmers i e 3 08 of meija s dairy units with water conservation practices in terms of the above five attributed our research contributes to the literature by documenting dairy farmers preferences decision making processes and potential transitions toward incentivized water preservation practices with an eye towards achieving sustainable development goals to the best of our knowledge the academic literature has largely overlooked preferences of dairy farmers in latin america we estimate the economic value ecuadorian dairy farmers assign to production practices that preserve water also we illustrate how dce can be used to gather policy relevant information when designing incentive based interventions to encourage movement toward a cleaner production regime in latin american countries 2 context data and methods 2 1 study zone description mejia is a canton in the southeastern part of the province of pichincha ecuador see fig 1 mejia is surrounded by natural elevations such as atacazo la viudita el corazón los ilinizas pasochoa ninahilca sincholagua rumiñahui and cotopaxi gad municipio de mejía 2015 this is why this canton is called the valley of the nine volcanoes as this andean zone enjoys a unique biodiversity within their montane rain forests and paramos it has a protected natural reserve with more than 30 000 ha where los ilinizas mountain is the biggest protected area 63 of total protected area see gad municipio de mejía 2020 also there exist 14 different types of terrestrial ecosystems in mejia where the most prevailing is herbazal del paramo which is usually located between 2900 3900 m a s l consists of dense vegetal formation and faces high variability of humidity and temperature 4 4 see terán et al 2019 for more details of the definition of these forest ecosystems in ecuador in terms of climate conditions mejia shows a great variability across its territory with an annual precipitation between 500 and 2000 mm in some places and more than 2000 mm in others gad municipio de mejía 2020 also it presents an annual average temperature between 10 c and 24 c although this canton has low probability of drought events agriculture is the land use more exposed to this occurrence 5 5 in ecuador average annual precipitation is 2159 33 mm and mean temperature depends on the months where from december to may is rainy season with temperature between 25 c and 26 c and from june to november is dry season with temperature between 21 c and 22 c see world bank group 2021 mejia benefits from the two main sub basins in pichincha the guayallabamba and blanco rivers which generate approximately 384 rivers and streams san pedro and pita rivers are also important water bodies gad municipio de mejía 2020 supplying water for both human consumption and agricultural irrigation despite these abundant water resources mejia suffers from water deficits particularly during the summer gad provincia de pichincha 2015 thus mejia is suitable for agricultural activities it has a total area of 1410 82 km2 of which 36 078 91 ha are used for livestock production gad municipio de mejía 2020 around 21 of its labor force participates in agricultural activities specifically in dairy production pichincha is the leading milk province in ecuador with 15 9 of the national milk output mejia supplies 34 of pichincha s production with an average productivity of 13 5 liters per day per cow banco central del ecuador 2020 gad municipio de mejía 2020 this productivity is above the national and pichincha average of 6 and 11 27 liters respectively dataset inec 2022 2 2 data collection and discrete choice experiment our study was conducted primarily within the communities of machachi tambillo aloasi and uyumbicho sampled dairy farms were located along the san pedro river although dairy production is the main farm activity in our study area farmers also grow crops such as potatoes maize broad beans etc in november 2020 we implemented a face to face survey 6 6 approval from human research ethics committee at the universidad san francisco de quito on 98 dairy farmers while this sample represents 3 08 of mejia s dairy units gad municipio de mejía 2015 7 7 data collection by perspectiva consultores estrategicos cia ltd management consulting services our budget was for 100 surveys initially where two of them were incomplete and excluded from our analysis we do not have the number of farmers who did not want to participate in this in person survey it falls short of 187 the sample size according to orme 2010 s rule of thumb 8 8 orme 2010 s rule of thumb states that n 500 c ta where n is the number of respondents t is the number of choice tasks per respondent a is the number of alternatives in each choice set excluding the status quo alternative and c is the largest number of levels for any one attribute when considering only main effects which is the case here in our case t is 4 a is 2 and c is 3 due to covid 19 related challenges we have not been able to gather data from a larger sample size in this respect we would like to highlight that previous dce studies have analyzed samples of similar size e g ngoc et al 2016 sauthoff et al 2016 schreiner and latacz lohmann 2015 vassalos et al 2015 two filter questions ensured that respondents were milk producers and made decisions about their farms at the farms experienced enumerators carefully described the experiment the practices and the average implementation cost of us 1144 to respondents details on how these costs are in appendix d of ortiz 2021 and in domínguez 2020 the survey comprised eight sections see appendix a section 1 identifies the respondents section 2 collects agricultural production information section 3 asks financial literacy questions section 4 introduces our dce section 5 collected demographic data section 6 asks intrahousehold decision making questions for married respondents section 7 obtains respondents family information including pre marriage information finally section 8 asks about respondent s household composition dce is one of the foremost stated preferences methods johnston et al 2017 petrolia et al 2021 dce allows to estimate wtp for different hypothetical alternatives this is an advantage over contingent valuation cv which only gives the economic value of a particular scenario perman et al 2003 in addition dce infers wtp to each attribute level or characteristic of a prospective scenario while cv method estimates a global value dce welfare estimates also have smaller variance than those from cv adamowicz et al 1998 finally dce is preferred over conjoint analysis because it is based on the random utility theory rut that is more consistent with the demand theory louviere et al 2010 one disadvantage of dce is that it imposes a tedious mental exercise to respondents who are asked to select different alternatives from different choice sets this opens the doors for choosing with no careful consideration perman et al 2003 to reduce this fatigue of respondents we employ a blocking strategy on a fractional factorial design with a d efficiency of 1 9 9 our design was implemented with r packages idefix and radiant see ortiz 2021 our design contained 12 choice sets divided into three blocks each respondent answered one block of four choice sets each set included two plans and the status quo see appendix b we conducted interviews with local experts agronomists veterinarians and biologists and dairy farmers and identified twenty water conservation practices based on economic feasibility we chose four attributes related to improved irrigation systems appropriate animal manure and solid waste management and strong water governance in table 1 we describe the attributes and levels of our dce precision irrigation is an alternative to the widespread use of inefficient flood irrigation brar et al 2022 thus our first attribute has two irrigation technology levels micro sprinkler systems and the superabsorbent polymers known as solid rain micro sprinkler systems distribute water to cultivated plants via a low pressure piping system resulting in greater water efficiency decreased irrigation time and deterrence of soil erosion chen et al 2002 el hafez et al 2020 fao 2008 in 2020 the estimated implementation cost for this irrigation system is us 1200 ha 1 which includes the suction pump sprinklers valves and couplings for installation see riego ecuador 2020 solid rain is a polymer that retains water it can be applied to the soil to moisturize plant roots once the water held by the polymer is totally absorbed the polymer can be charged again for up to 10 years polymer application has resulted in increases in crop production absorption of agrochemicals avoiding leaching and runoff and prevention of soil erosion ai et al 2021 chang et al 2021 cisneros et al 2020 shock and iida 2009 studies in ecuador have experimented with this practice in potato broccoli and lettuce production caizapasto 2019 toctaguano 2019 valera 2018 and the return per dollar invested increased in all cases solid rain technology incurs in an initial cost of us 650 ha 1 considering recommended amount per hectare along with the cost of labor for the installation process cosecha de lluvia sólida 2015 the second one level attribute manure composting can help to prevent water pollution caused by untreated manure and agrochemicals bekchanov and mirzabaev 2018 lim et al 2016 animal manure is a valuable resource that when properly managed can i increase income from livestock ii improve animal nutrition and iii minimize financial risk integrated manure management entails the storage processing and subsequent application of the excreta on crops hristov et al 2013 jiménez trujillo 2007 its estimated initial cost is us 438 which implies the building of the concrete block the metal structure and the plastic cover this cost also includes the necessary piping to ensure proper functioning see paredes 2018 the third attribute has two levels related to the management of plastic solid waste generated by dairy production in accordance with guidelines on container disposal fao and who 2008 the first level is private management where farmers themselves collect plastic waste and transport it to private collection centers various reverse logistics programs for the management of plastic containers exist in countries such as australia brazil canada and chile fao and who 2008 the second level is a public waste management system where municipal dumpsters visit accessible areas farmers would not incur any implementation cost other than a monthly payment of 2 of the electricity bill for two collections a month as in gualichicomín 2018 10 10 mejia s government charges 10 of electricity bills kwh month for garbage collection services where the average cost per kwh is us 0 1031 and us 0 1041 for residential and commercial areas respectively the fourth attribute aims to capture preferences for features that strengthen water governance through conflict resolution and water user cooperative training courses these can be seen as instruments for the promotion of cooperation and self governance aiming to decrease in conflicts over water resources amirova et al 2019 bardhan 1993 cardenas et al 2011 cox et al 2010 mcginnis and ostrom 1992 mirzaei et al 2019 ostrom and gardner 1993 the fondo para la protección del agua fonag develops similar initiatives in the northeastern part of quito fonag 2020 11 11 fonag is a water conservation fund financed by public and private organizations to protect the water resources in ecuador the idea of this attribute is to have a constant community engagement between academic institutions and water users last year students e g from law schools can provide these training sessions as part of their final examination i e internships working with the irrigation board in each community this training may be a requirement for farmers to be irrigation beneficiaries the producer will incur no costs every training session will provide communication strategies negotiation skills cooperation initiatives and free counsel to resolve problems related to water management the fifth attribute is the farmers implementation cost share payments for irrigation systems and manure management the other practices have no initial cost we present three cost share levels 30 60 and 70 selected from a review of assistance and subsidies available from various government agencies table 2 provides an example of one of our choice sets 2 3 conceptual framework the empirical design of discrete choice experiments relies on the idea that utility is derived from the attributes of a good lancaster 1966 also dce is based on rut in which conceptual and empirical probabilistic models intersect based on the assumption of a utility function containing deterministic and stochastic factors marschak 1974 mcfadden 1986 thus assume the following utility u ij of agent i for alternative j 1 u ij v ij ε ij β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij ε ij where v ij and ε ij are the deterministic and random elements respectively x ijs is an observable attribute s with its preference parameter β s c ij is a cost attribute with its coefficient β c lastly β j is the alternative specific utility we excluded agent s characteristics for simplicity using eq 1 we calculate wtp for attribute s i e the marginal rate of substitution or the respondent s subjective value of attribute s in terms of the cost attribute as follows 2 wtp s u ij x ijs u ij c ij β s β c 2 4 econometric strategy based on eq 1 an agent i will choose among all possible alternatives j 1 2 j the alternative j over k using the following criteria 3 u ij u ik ε v ik v ij j k where ε ε ij ε ik as utility levels are not observable the probability of choosing an alternative is computed as follows 4 prob chosej prob ε v ik v ij j k then assuming ε is independent and identically distributed iid as a gumbel a type 1 extreme value eq 4 is mathematically specified as follows see greene 2008 5 prob chosej e v ij j 1 j e σ s v ij e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij j 1 j e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij eq 5 is the conditional logit cl model which holds two important assumptions i independence of irrelevant alternative iia and ii preference homogeneity we relax these restrictive assumptions by employing the random parameter logit rpl model see train 2009 thus the probability of choosing j is 6 prob chosej e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij j 1 j e β j σ s β s x ijs β c c ij f β θ ω d β where f β θ ω is a density function for a vector of the attribute s coefficients with expected value θ and variance covariance matrix ω this model abandons the iia assumption and incorporates unobserved preference heterogeneity boxall and adamowicz 2002 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 3 compares the descriptive statistics of our sample and official data for pichincha in 2021 12 12 encuesta de superficie y produccion agropercuaria continua dataset inec 2022 official data are representative at province level only farm size head of cattle ha 1 milk price and milk production are specific to dairy farms based on this comparison we believe that our sample closely approximates a representative sample of dairy farmers in mejia regarding the sampled respondents socioeconomic characteristics most farmers are male 74 with an average age of 55 3 years which is statistically similar to official statistics our respondents however seem to be less educated than individuals from the official data while the official data report 68 of respondents holding no higher qualification than a high school diploma this number is 91 in our sample our sampled farmers hold 7 36 ha on average statistically equal to official numbers 11 17 ha our respondents on average own 5 50 head of cattle ha 1 produce 101 37 liters of milk per day and sell that milk for a price of us 0 35 l 1 these numbers are statistically equal to their equivalents in the official data only 23 of our respondents reported a decrease in sales due to covid 19 conditions which is lower than the official number 39 of the sampled respondents 35 do not irrigate whereas 39 of participants in the official data do not irrigate within irrigators 97 utilize sprinkler surface system in our sample similar to the official rate of 98 while only 2 employ micro sprinkler systems statistically different from the official rate of 0 3 in our sample 86 of farmers use chemical fertilizers for grassland cultivation and 50 use organic fertilizers this latter number is equal to the official statistic concerning manure management most farmers practice manure dispersion 94 in our sample and 86 in the official data while only a few practice composting 7 in our sample and 12 in the official data finally 88 of our respondents burn bury or dump their solid waste alongside common trash there are no official data on solid waste disposal methods 3 2 econometric models table 4 reports estimates from four rpl and one cl specifications 13 13 find our dataset in ortiz et al 2022 we used stata statistical software to estimate our models panel a reports the mean point estimates of coefficients the first and second columns report rpl assuming normally distributed parameters including the price parameter but show uncorrelated rpl1 and correlated rpl rpl2 respectively the third and fourth columns report rpl assuming fixed price parameter and normal distribution of the rest of the parameters uncorrelated rpl3 and correlated rpl4 rpl respectively the fifth column displays cl estimate regarding sign direction and the statistical significance of mean estimates table 4 shows that the utility parameter associated with the status quo is negative in all four rpls but statistically significant for rpl1 and rpl2 the cl specification yields a positive but insignificant estimate for the status quo in addition all four rpls and the cl yield positive and statistically significant preferences for solid rain and training preferences for manure composting are negative in all five models but statistically significant only in rpl2 and a similar pattern is evident for municipal management consistent with economic theory the price coefficient is negative and statistically significant at 99 confidence across all models in table 4 panel b reports the standard deviation of utility parameters for rlp1 and rpl3 the statistical significance and the magnitude of the standard deviation coefficients of status quo solid rain and manure composting indicate the presence of high levels of unobserved preference heterogeneity table 5 reports the elements of the lower triangular covariance matrix of utility parameters for rpl2 and rpl4 the significance of these cholesky elements confirms unobserved preference heterogeneity we do not compute correlations directly but the signs of these elements indicate the direction of these correlations for instance using rpl2 specification we observe that status quo has a negative correlation with solid rain training and cost share payment while solid rain is positively correlated with manure composting and municipal plastic waste management finally we also see that cost share payment has a negative correlation with manure composting municipal and training given the magnitude and statistical significance of variance and cholesky parameters documenting unobserved heterogeneity in preferences it is not surprising that all four rpls outperform cl as reflected by both aic and bic see panel c in table 4 among the four rpls rpl1 has the highest performance concerning aic and bic of the two empirical models that align with economic theory by keeping the price parameter fixed i e rpl3 and rpl4 rpl3 outperforms rpl4 regarding bic and performs only slightly worse than rpl4 in terms of aic comparison of the statistical fitness of the rpls thus suggests that a lack of correlation among the parameters is empirically preferred in our data as assumed in rpl1 and rpl3 3 3 willingness to pay estimates table 6 displays estimates of wtp arising from the five specifications reported in table 4 we mostly focus on wtp arising from rpl1 and rpl3 statistically significant and positive wtps for solid rain adoption and training for conflict resolution and cooperation are consistent across models for instance findings from rpl3 indicate that farmers are willing to pay us 170 ha 1 for the adoption of solid rain which represents 26 15 of its implementation cost or 14 86 of average implementation cost and us 244 ha 1 for training table 7 reports wtp by subsamples based on heads of cattle 10 and 10 and farm size 4 ha and 4 ha that reflect the size of each production unit we chose rpl1 following goodness of fit tests see ghosh et al 2013 the findings are consistent across both subsamples while smaller farmers have an insignificant negative wtp for the status quo larger farmers have a significantly negative wtp for the status quo ranging from us 230 to us 224 ha 1 this finding reflects a greater disutility among the larger farmers similarly while a positive wtp for solid rain exits for all subsamples it is only among bigger farmers that this wtp is statistically significant ranging from us 98 to us 137 ha 1 in contrast the results demonstrate a significant and positive wtp for training in all subsamples finally farmers have provided their preferences for which financial institutions should share the cost of implementation public financial institutions such as banecuador 57 14 and cfn 12 25 are the most preferred followed by private banks 14 29 and other entities such as saving and credit cooperative 19 39 14 14 shares of agricultural loans are 49 36 for public institutions and 50 64 for private banks mag 2020 4 discussion our findings illustrate that the status quo low adoption rate of water conservation practices does not necessarily imply disutility particularly among smaller farmers we offer two reasons for this finding 1 given financial barriers and uncertainties exacerbated by the current pandemic producers may be avoiding the addition of new practices and costs to their production process and 2 some of the practices are not well known and farmers may not have completely understood our explanation of these hypothetical alternatives in this case the status quo would become the best option this second reason will lead to forthcoming research in which we will attempt to empirically measure the relationship between farmers choices and financial literacy we use financial literacy as a proxy of farmers understanding of complex scenarios our findings strongly suggest that farmers are interested in two practices solid rain and training courses for water governance improvement first given the inefficient use of water in mejia farmers demand improved irrigation systems although solid rain is not yet well known in our study area farmers especially larger farmers showed strong interest in experimenting with this technique in fact the literature discusses how farmers assign intrinsic values to water that exceed irrigation water prices alcon et al 2014 mu et al 2019 rigby et al 2010 salman and al karablieh 2004 providing insights into the potential for incentive based mechanisms to increase farmers adoption of efficient irrigation technologies 15 15 prior research also reports preferences for improved irrigation technologies such as drip gravity soil moisture monitoring drainage management among others abebe et al 2020 aydogdu and bilgic 2016 houessionon et al 2017 khachatryan et al 2019 ogonna olive and kingsley david 2021 second water governance is weak in our study area which opens the door to water conflicts thus our producers seem to be interested in strategies that would help them establish rules and form cooperation initiatives the existing literature supports preferences over cooperative behavior among farmers for example this behavior occurs in a collaborative insurance scheme in central mexico colin castillo et al 2022 in collective participation in an agri environmental scheme in spain villanueva et al 2015 or in the local management of an irrigation system in south africa saldías et al 2016 in addition local communities are willing to associate with external agencies to improve governance for instance in the implementation of climate change adaptation schemes nthambi et al 2021 this also supports our proposal that external agencies could offer training courses in this context i e given that our respondents are interested in efficient irrigation technologies and open to improve their water governance we see an opportunity to build a water governance that prevents the undesirable rebound effect this effect refers to the potential that adoption of efficient technologies does not necessarily bring lower use of resources because adopters may end up using such efficient technologies at higher rates to the point that efficiency is overcompensated and resources en up used at higher rates than before adoption of efficient technologies in this respect sainz santamaria and martinez cruz 2019 document that experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that widespread adoption of efficient irrigation sprinkler or drip technologies would substantially reduce aquifer overdraft in aguascalientes mexico the authors point out that these expectations are coherent with previous economic studies documenting that adopters increase irrigated area after technology adoption and switch to crops that use water more intensively thus findings in this paper open the possibility of further researcher aiming to take advantage of dairy farmers interest on improvement of water governance to foresee mechanisms preventing rebound effects from adoption of efficient technologies this topic deserves further exploration both for academic purposes and for public policy relevance two practices were not preferred and farmers would even demand payment for their adoption the first manure composting implies additional costs and the construction of a composting site which reduces space for other farming activities some of these farms cover less than 1 ha potential increases in labor cost and low prices for fertilizers such as urea and diammonium phosphate in previous years baffes and chian koh 2019 may provoke farmers unwillingness to adopt manure composting even when it yields monthly savings our finding differs from the conclusion drawn by tur cardona et al 2018 that livestock producers in seven eu countries are willing to pay prices for manure composting of up to 41 3 more than the cost of chemical fertilization the second non preferred practice municipal management does not involve an implementation cost but mejia s municipality would charge an additional fee for managing solid waste one reason for a negative preference is that as bigger electricity consumers larger farmers might observe a higher increase in their bill than smaller farmers another reason is an option not explored in our dce the public private management for instance study cases show farmers willingness to pay for a public private management between us 1 68 and us 4 22 per month see omotesho et al 2016 rahji and oloruntoba 2009 thus our sampled farmers did not see this option as an attribute level and then status quo became their desired alternative indeed we may need more research on other levels of this attribute differences between our findings and previous findings may reflect context specific preferences e g preferences of farmers in developed countries versus preferences of farmers in a developing country however we cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of attribute s statistical significance that we are interpreting as lack of farmers preferences is due to the size of our sample orme 2010 s rule of thumb has suggested a sample size of 187 but we have collected data from 98 respondents due to covid 19 related challenges thus it is plausible that an increase in data yields statistically significant parameters for the attributes that we are documented as of no interest for our respondents indeed wtp estimates in this paper have been obtained amid the covid 19 pandemic whether and by how much these estimates may differ from those obtained in post pandemic times become relevant research questions relevant from a public policy perspective but also from a purely scientific perspective in this respect we plan to explore potential differences in the near future in addition we wish to direct the reader s attention to previous evidence suggesting that estimates of stated wtp remain stable in context of economic recessions which is how the pandemic can be translated into a macroeconomic event krugman 2020 keeping in mind that goods under valuation and contexts are different in comparison to our study martínez cruz and núñez 2021 have reported that stated wtp for renewable energies have change only slightly once an economic recession has occurred in developed countries research on this issue has yet to be carried out in developing countries 5 conclusions our findings are relevant for policymakers and researchers interested in promoting water conservation practices among dairy farmers in ecuador and other developing countries particularly in latin america the first finding that we highlight is the disutility that mejia s larger farmers report for the status quo this result implies that a change in current management practices would deliver an increase in utility among larger farmers in this sense solid rain and training courses for conflict resolution and cooperation would deliver an improvement in the welfare of larger producers it is also consistent in our case study that manure composting is not in demand among our farmers the story is less straightforward in the case of solid rain and municipal waste management while smaller farmers seem to have zero wtp for municipal management larger farmers report disutility a result which holds across all sizes of production units overall wtp for solid rain is positive and significant across model specifications but smaller farmers are not interested in this irrigation technique while larger farmers report positive preferences thus field experimentation is required for the adoption of this improved irrigation system such heterogeneity in preference is intuitive larger farmers would likely benefit more from solid rain than smaller farmers which translates into a higher wtp simultaneously the relatively homogeneous preferences for the status quo and training on conflict resolution and cooperation are informative farmers of all farm sizes demanding a change in status quo conditions is consistent with their demand for assistance in handling likely conflicts in the current context these results are expected given the inefficient water use in our study area and the risk of water conflict due to weak water administration local universities or ngos through community engagement programs can play an essential role in helping water users develop cooperative behaviors and resolve conflicts handayani et al 2022 mckinney and thorson 2015 wingfield et al 2021 in fact ecuadorian universities require internships in some of their academic programs for instance last year law school students supervised by their professors can impart training courses or legal advice on cooperation and conflict resolution strategies for this policy action we can learn from fonag s projects that address legal framework technical assistances governance conflict resolution and son on fonag 2020 2007 finally environmental law clinics would allow students to offer counsel to facilitate the resolution of problems between water users our results show that farmers are interested in solid rain however their wtp only covers a portion of its implementation cost consequently cost sharing schemes could facilitate the adoption of this technology or other conservation practices that satisfy the ecuadorian government s guidelines for livestock bmps agrocalidad 2012 in fact there are different cases of cost sharing programs in ecuador such as 30 subsidy within the cattle repopulation and genetic improvement program mag 2016 the 80 subsidy for certified seeds and fertilizers among other commodities eltelegrafo 2017 or the 50 70 or 90 subsidy for operating costs in forest conservation mae 2013 farmers with financial aid could overcome implementation risks and current financial barriers and where cost sharing schemes can have long lasting effects on farmers livelihood hossain et al 2022 policymakers should devise cost sharing plans based primarily on the farmers profiles and needs to reduce high implementation costs dce is a tool that can provide ex ante information about farmers preferences for different sustainable practices and thus help agricultural authorities make informed decisions when implementing agricultural adoption programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9092,drought is one of the most harmful abiotic stresses for plants future drought episodes are expected to increase negatively affecting globally cultivated crops as wheat triticum aestivum together with the crop dependency future global food security is at risk thus finding alternative crops for wheat capable of resisting drought episodes is essential to ensure food supply spelt triticum spelta and buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum are two underutilized alternative crops whose drought resistance mechanisms remain unknown we hypothesize that both species will have drought avoidance characteristics and will have a better drought response than wheat we grew wheat spelt and buckwheat in a greenhouse drought treatment started 28 days after sowing when wheat and spelt reached 40 field capacity fc drought was kept for 1 week while in buckwheat the drought was kept for 4 weeks at 20 fc even if partially inhibited by drought buckwheat showed an extremely higher total biomass as well as an extremely higher water use efficiency wue than wheat and spelt photosynthetic parameters were extremely reduced in spelt whereas those were less affected in wheat the reduction in osmotic potential and the use of osmotic adjustment of spelt in combination with the increases in the antioxidant metabolism indicate the prevalence of drought tolerance mechanisms the lack of effect on antioxidant metabolism in wheat along with the reductions in stomatal conductance and water potential indicate the use of drought avoidance mechanisms buckwheat showed drought avoidance mechanisms and its physiological parameters were almost not affected by extreme drought overall spelt showed strong damages under mild drought whereas buckwheat managed to cope with extreme drought by reducing its water requirements and increasing wue in order to ensure its photosynthetic activity thus buckwheat appears to be a potential alternative to wheat for extreme drought conditions while spelt is not

nutritional value cereals are the main source of food for both humans and livestock faostat 2019 in fact approximately 40 of the daily calories consumed worldwide come from rice wheat and maize with wheat triticum aestivum accounting for the 20 of global consumption faostat 2019 nevertheless the global dependency on such a small number of crops has put global food security at risk since future drought episodes will negatively impact the production of these cereals knox et al 2012 not only that but under the future climatic scenarios drought episodes are expected to increase not only in number but also in intensity ipcc 2014 therefore it is crucial to find alternative crops to reduce dependency and ensure food supply under the future drought episodes drought is one of the most detrimental and limiting abiotic stresses for crops which causes decreases in photosynthesis vegetative growth number of flowers and pollen germination barnabás et al 2007 gray and brady 2016 in addition drought stress contributes to an overproduction and accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros which eventually results in damages to the cell membrane inhibition of photochemical reactions and damages to the photosynthetic apparatus li et al 2014 main drought resistance mechanisms are known to be drought avoidance and drought tolerance fang and xiong 2015 drought avoidance is defined as the ability of plants to maintain tissue water content regardless of water scarcity delfin et al 2021 among them water saver plants are the ones that avoid drought damage by reducing water loss via stomatal closure increasing water use efficiency wue inhibiting shoot growth and or increasing water uptake by increasing root growth gilbert et al 2011 kooyers 2015 on the contrary water spender varieties use the available water to maximize productivity without protecting leaf turgor while they could also increase root depth and efficiency to maintain high water status delfin et al 2021 on the other hand drought tolerance is primarily based on the use of osmotic adjustment oa and ros scavenging systems to reduce oxidative damage fang and xiong 2015 kooyers 2015 a recent meta analysis published by li et al 2021 showed that wild and old cultivated wheat varieties use drought avoidance mechanisms while modern wheat varieties improved during the last decades mostly rely on drought tolerance strategies not only that but under severe drought stress modern wheat varieties showed lower yields than older varieties li et al 2021 thus finding alternative crops for wheat with improved drought avoidance mechanisms seems to have the potential to increase food supply and reduce crop dependency alternative crops could be defined as crops whose cultivation is not widespread through the world or crops that are widely cultivated in a specific region of the planet spelt triticum spelta is considered to be a good nourishment source as well as an ancestral relative of wheat whose cultivation was especially high during the roman empire campbell 1997 salamon et al 2020 during the last years spelt has regained interest among the consumers farmers and breeders due to its high nutritional value and number of ancestral genes alvarez 2021 on the other hand buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum is an underutilized pseudo cereal with a high nutritional content whose cultivation is mainly focused on some areas of asia and eastern europe farooq et al 2016 despite the considerable interest they have been attracting in the recent years very little is known about the response of spelt and buckwheat to drought stress in fact some preliminary work was carried out in the early 1990s analysing drought response and recovery of spelt but it was focused primarily on tiller production cabeza et al 1993 similarly few research have studied in detail the physiological response to drought of buckwheat delpérée et al 2003 germ et al 2013 aubert et al 2020 therefore a huge lack of knowledge exists regarding the drought resistance mechanisms of these alternative crops under future climatic conditions we will be facing increases in drought intensity and episodes which will reduce crop production using alternative crops with an improved drought avoidance mechanisms as an alternative to wheat one of the main consumed crops could have the potential to reduce global crop dependency and ensure food production therefore the aim of this research was to characterize the drought response of the alternative crops spelt and buckwheat to drought and determine whether they could be a suitable alternative to wheat since these species have not been used as much as wheat in breeding programs we believe that they will conserve drought avoidance mechanisms and will preserve a higher plasticity to cope with drought thus we hypothesize that 1 spelt will have drought avoidance characteristics 2 buckwheat will show drought avoidance characteristics and 3 spelt and buckwheat will have a better drought response than wheat and thus they will be suitable alternatives to wheat in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions seeds of t aestivum var florence aurora wheat t spelta var franckenkorn spelt and f esculentum var kora buckwheat were obtained from the basque institute for agricultural research and development neiker basque country spain a total of 32 plants per species were grown in 16 pots of 3 l with a 3 1 mixture of perlite vermiculite the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse located at 43 19 46 9 n 2 58 07 6 w under an average temperature of 24 6 21 c and a relative humidity of 68 77 for day night natural light was supplemented with 2 vanq lamps vq gltw030 of 30 w each pots were watered three times per week to keep field capacity fc with hoagland s solution hoagland and arnon 1938 well watered treatment ww as well as rotated three times per week to avoid intra greenhouse environmental gradients 28 days after sowing das drought was imposed by withholding irrigation in half of the pots plant health was monitored measuring chlorophyll content with a minolta spad 502 plus konica minolta optics japan and chlorophyll fluorescence using a fluorpen fp 110 photon systems instruments the czech republic when wheat and spelt reached 40 5 fc this stress was kept for 1 week mild drought treatment md however unlike in wheat and spelt when buckwheat reached 40 fc we observed little or no effect of drought on the measured parameters as well as a lack of damages in the aerial tissues of the drought treatment plants therefore we decided to increase drought intensity in buckwheat fc was reduced to 20 5 and kept for 4 weeks extreme drought treatment ed all the in vivo measurements and plant material harvesting were performed at the end of the drought treatment 59 das in wheat and spelt 31 days of drought and 68 das in buckwheat 40 days of drought 2 2 soil and leaf water parameters cumulative transpiration of eight pots per species and treatment was calculated by weighing pots three times per week before and after watering relative soil water content rswc was determined as rswc 100 sfw sdw sfwi sdw where sfw sdw and sfwi were the soil fresh weight soil dry weight and the initial soil fresh weight respectively leaf water potential ψ w of four leaves per species and treatment was measured using the scholander pressure equilibration technique scholander et al 1965 six h after dawn due to its high ψ w value it was not possible to quantify the ψ w using pressure chambers method in buckwheat as previously reported by delpérée et al 2003 leaf osmotic potential ψ o of the same four leaves was measured by analysing the freezing point of sap of leaf segments using an osmomat 030 cryoscopic osmometer gonotec gmbh berlin germany and calculated as ψ o m t r where m was the concentration osmol kg 1 t was the temperature of the sample 298 k and r was the molar gas constant 0 00832 l mpa k 1 mol 1 the osmotic potential at full turgor ψ o 100 was measured similar to ψ o full turgor of leaves was obtained by cutting four leaves per species and treatments and incubating them in deionized water at 4 c in dark for 24 h pressure potential ψ p was calculated as the difference between ψ w and ψ o cell wall elasticity ε was calculated as ε ψ p 100 ψ p 100 rlwc 100 relative leaf water content rlwc was calculated as the rlwc fw dw tw fw 100 where fw dw and tw were the leaf fresh weight dry weight and turgid weight respectively four leaves per species and treatment were used in wheat and spelt and eight leaves per treatment in buckwheat dehydration dh of plants under drought treatments was calculated as the difference of ψ o and ψ o 100 between treatments osmotic adjustment oa was calculated as the difference of ψ o 100 of plants under drought and control conditions 2 3 gas exchange and photochemical parameters gas exchange parameters of six fully developed leaves per species and treatment were measured using a li cor 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa measurements for wheat and spelt were made on the leaf preceding the flag leaf while in buckwheat the measurement was made on the fifth fully developed leaf counting from the top the temperature of the cuvette was held at 24 c at a relative humidity of 60 measurements were made three h after dawn under a

adapted fluorescence schindler and lichtenthaler 1996 electron transport rate etr was determined as etr φ psii ppfd 0 85 0 5 where ppfd refers to the photosynthetic photon flux density and the ratio of electron transport rate to net photosynthetic co2 assimilation etr a was calculated as the ratio between etr and a 2 4 antioxidant parameters leaves of two plants per pot were pooled as one biological replicate for antioxidant enzyme activity measurements four replicates per species and treatment were used activities of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione reductase gr and ascorbate peroxidase apx were measured as described in pérez lópez et al 2009 with little modifications briefly sod cat and gr were extracted in a buffer composed by 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 0 2 triton x 100 0 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pmsf and 2 mm dithiotreitol supernatant from samples were filtered over shepadex g 25 columns equilibrated

method 2 5 growth parameters and informatics measurements leaves stems and roots of four plants per species and treatment were harvested in wheat and spelt and eight plants per treatment in buckwheat plant organs were oven dried for 72 h for dry weight dw measurements wue was calculated by dividing plant dw and cumulative transpiration photos of the harvested leaves were taken for measuring leaf area la with the open source software fiji fiji is just imagej schindelin et al 2012 prior to oven drying them stomatal density sd was measured by obtaining leaf imprints from adaxial and abaxial surfaces as explained by casado garcía et al 2020 photos of stomata were taken using a nikon eclipse 50i fluorescence microscope nikon corporation japan with a leica dfc 420 c camera leica microsystems germany three photos of the adaxial and three photos of the abaxial surfaces of four plants per species and treatment were used measurements were made with labelstoma tool casado garcía et al 2020 briefly explained photos were loaded into labelstoma and the scale and area to be analysed were established automatic stomata detection was performed using the default parameters each photo was reviewed individually and if necessary undetected stomata were added manually 2 6 statistical analysis and figures all figures were performed using graphpad prism version 8 2 1 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa www graphpad com statistical analysis was done using spss version 27 0 for windows ibm corp armonk ny the effect of water treatment ww md and ed species wheat spelt and buckwheat and their interaction were determined by two way anova afterwards data was compared using duncan s post hoc test p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 growth parameters buckwheat showed increased growth under ww especially for aboveground organs which were 12 times bigger than in wheat and spelt fig 1a d likewise the biomass accumulation of buckwheat under ed was significantly reduced by approximately 45 for all organs while among wheat and spelt we only found leaf dw to be significantly reduced in spelt fig 1a as occurred with the growth buckwheat showed significantly higher shoot root ratio and la fig 1e f which were significantly reduced under ed on the contrary among wheat and spelt we only found la to be significantly reduced by drought in spelt fig 1f buckwheat had a wue of 4 3 g dw kg 1 h2o under control conditions while for wheat and spelt these values were of 1 76 and 1 64 g dw kg 1 h2o significantly smaller fig 2 neither wheat nor spelt wue was affected by md whereas buckwheat showed a significantly higher wue with values 24 higher than under ww and 2 7 times bigger than in wheat and spelt fig 2 3 2 water relations we observed a progressive decrease in rswc for wheat and spelt reaching 40 5 after 47 49 das while this value was reached at 35 36 das in buckwheat fig 3 similarly 20 5 rswc was reached in buckwheat at 39 40 das spelt showed a significantly higher cumulative transpiration under control conditions fig 4 which was significantly reduced in a 41 after the md treatment buckwheat had the lowest value of cumulative transpiration and was significantly reduced by 17 under 20 fc buckwheat managed to keep extremely lower cumulative transpiration rates per week showing a 50 60 reduction from start to end of the drought treatment both wheat and spelt showed significantly lower ψ w under md treatment table 1 not only that but spelt showed a significant reduction in ψ o reaching a value of 2 607 mpa while ψ o was not affected in wheat nor in buckwheat ε showed an opposite trend in wheat and spelt when exposed to drought it increased from 8 667 mpa to 14 705 mpa in wheat whereas it decreased from 37 520 mpa to 5 348 mpa in spelt the rlwc was significantly reduced by 10 5 in spelt while it remained similar to control conditions in wheat and buckwheat also spelt showed a dh level of 0 937 mpa which was significantly higher than the dh values of wheat 0 491 mpa and buckwheat 0 mpa in the same way spelt showed an oa three times higher than the rest of the species thus it appears that the water parameters of buckwheat were not affected by ed while under md the same parameters for spelt and wheat were highly and slightly affected respectively 3 3 gas exchange parameters spelt showed significantly higher values of gs and e under control conditions than wheat and buckwheat fig 5a b and thus was the most affected by the drought treatment md induced an extreme reduction of 75 gs in spelt which was turned into a 72 reduction of e in wheat drought significantly reduced gs and e by 58 and 56 on the contrary although significant the reductions in buckwheat were only of 39 and 36 also although the values of φ psii were similar for the three species spelt was the only species to have it significantly reduced fig 5c drought significantly reduced a by half in wheat and by 92 in spelt while it had not significant effect on buckwheat fig 5d ci was not affected in wheat by the drought treatment while in spelt it was significantly increased fig 5e nevertheless despite the lack of effect in ci in wheat and its accumulation in spelt a ci was significantly reduced in both species with this reduction being caused by a fig 5d f in buckwheat although ci was slightly decreased a ci remained unchanged under the ed treatment fig 5e f even though the three species had similar values of etr under control conditions etr of spelt was significantly reduced by 73 and etr a was significantly increased by 254 under md fig 5g similarly etr a values were significantly increased in wheat by 110 mainly driven by a decrease fig 5g h on the contrary ed showed no influence on etr nor etr a in buckwheat overall it seems that the photosynthetic parameters of spelt are extremely damaged by md while the same parameters are less affected in wheat and not affected at all in buckwheat under ed buckwheat showed significantly higher abaxial sd than wheat and spelt under ww while this value was significantly lower for the adaxial sd fig 6 however the sum of the abaxial and the adaxial sd did not differ among the three species under control conditions on the contrary under the drought treatments wheat and spelt showed no differences neither in the sd of both sides of the leaves nor in the total sd while in buckwheat there was a significant increase in the adaxial abaxial and total sd fig 6 3 4 antioxidant metabolism we found no effect of drought treatments on the antioxidant metabolism enzymes in wheat nor buckwheat fig 7a d apx activity was significantly increased 160 in spelt under md while we did not find any remarkable effect on sod cat and gr fig 7a d 4 discussion the global dependency to a few number of crops along with the increases in number and intensity of the drought episodes threatens global food security ipcc 2014 modern wheat varieties have shown decreases in production when exposed to severe drought stress li et al 2021 and thus it is essential to find alternative crops to wheat with the ability to resist drought stress here we have characterized the drought response of wheat and two alternative species spelt and buckwheat our research provides data which demonstrates that 1 spelt activates drought tolerance mechanisms in the presence of a mild intensity drought even though these mechanisms are not enough to withstand a mild drought treatment 2 buckwheat activates drought avoidance mechanisms and manages to cope with an extreme drought treatment better than wheat does with a mild drought and 3 buckwheat may have the potential to be used as an alternative crop to wheat under extreme drought conditions among all the crops buckwheat stood out in terms of growth since under control conditions it showed an average biomass accumulation 7 and 12 times higher than spelt and wheat respectively fig 1a f in order to test whether the differences in total biomass among species were explained due to the differences in growth days we analysed the relative growth rate rgr sup fig 1 which showed that there were barely any differences given the exceptionally higher biomass accumulation of buckwheat the reported growth reduction for this species under extreme drought was not particularly surprising even though the overall growth of buckwheat was inhibited we observed a decrease in the shoot root ratio when exposed to drought supporting previous hypothesis on buckwheat growth response to drought aubert et al 2020 in spite of everything buckwheat was the species with higher biomass under both water treatments suggesting an improved use of water resources as a matter of fact we found buckwheat to have higher levels of wue under well watered conditions as well as maintaining higher levels of wue under drought this is a highly valued trait in crop breeding programs richards et al 2002 condon et al 2004 and thus exploitation of the high wue of buckwheat to get improved drought resistant crops could be worthwhile in addition to having a lower wue wheat and spelt showed no variation in this parameter when exposed to drought stress which indicates the ability of buckwheat to control water resources more efficiently than wheat and spelt the better use of water resources in buckwheat could be explained by increases in water uptake and or reductions in water loss which are two adaptive strategies that mitigate drought impact blum 2005 in this case it was essentially explained by a strict regulation of cumulative transpiration since buckwheat managed to restrict transpiration over time when exposed to extreme drought the higher proportion of abaxial stomata in relation to adaxial stomata in buckwheat could be restricting cumulative transpiration reducing the evaporative demand and thus causing reductions in total transpiration besides buckwheat showed a significant decrease in shoot root ratio which contributes to the better use of water resources by increasing water uptake under drought the decrease of ψ w under water scarcity is also a mechanism that plants activate to increase water uptake and thus it has been associated with an improved drought response robredo et al 2007 even though we were unable to quantify ψ w of buckwheat see 2 materials and methods we found that wheat and spelt had similar reductions in ψ w under mild drought although dehydration passive mechanism was the main driving force in response to drought in wheat and spelt the degree of dehydration in spelt was double than in wheat on the contrary buckwheat showed no signs of dehydration which together with the rlwc results indicate that it was capable of maintaining an optimal water status inside the plant even if it was under an extreme drought treatment water scarcity promotes water flow outside the cells and thus dehydration commonly causes decreases in ψ p chen et al 2020 as occurred in wheat the accumulation of different osmolytes inside the cells oa could also promote decreases in ψ w which increases the turgor of the cells nemeskéri and helyes 2019 this would explain the observed reductions in ψ o and increases in ψ p for spelt nevertheless the activation of these mechanisms were not enough for spelt to maintain rlwc and overcome the impact of mild drought stress on the photosynthetic parameters actually the photosynthetic processes of spelt were the most damaged ones by the drought treatment mild drought induced an extreme stomatal closure and transpiration decrease on this species while in wheat these reductions were more conservative stomatal closure is a short term strategy to prevent water loss in most plant species but could result in limitations of photosynthesis under water scarcity if it is maintained for long periods diaz espejo et al 2007 silim et al 2009 however in buckwheat we only found a slight closure of stomata and decrease in transpiration under extreme drought with no significant effect on a these results are in contradiction with previous results which reported reductions higher than 80 in e gs and or a under water stress delpérée et al 2003 germ et al 2013 aubert et al 2020 nevertheless it should be noted that as well as using distinct varieties and drought intensities the drought treatments were combined with different levels of light delpérée et al 2003 or uv b radiation germ et al 2013 which could explain the reported differences masojídek et al 1991 itam et al 2020 wasaya et al 2021 despite the reduction in gs neither wheat nor spelt showed variations in sd in response to drought while buckwheat increased it in both sides of the leaves however the increase in sd could be the result of a concentrating effect of stomata due to the reduction in la unlike in buckwheat photosynthesis in spelt and wheat was inhibited when exposed to drought this inhibition of a induced decreases in a ci in wheat and spelt suggesting non stomatal limitations miranda apodaca et al 2018 however while we found spelt to have an extremely reduced φ psii indicating a down regulation or structural alteration of the photosynthetic apparatus foyer et al 2017 we did not observe the same trend in wheat this different photochemical sensitivity between both triticum species under drought could explain the better behaviour of a in wheat in addition the decreases in a induced etr a to be significantly increased in wheat and spelt suggesting a deviation of electrons to other processes that are not the photosynthesis in the present study we found spelt to significantly increase the activity of the apx antioxidant enzyme indicating a deviation of electrons from photosynthesis to mehler reaction cruz de carvalho 2008 on the contrary we found no effect of drought treatments on antioxidant metabolism of wheat and buckwheat upregulation of antioxidant metabolism along with the use of oa are two key mechanisms used by the drought tolerant species to cope with drought stress kooyers 2015 on the contrary drought avoidance species mainly focus on maintaining normal physiological processes by increasing wue and or modifying growth rates to avoid the harmful effects caused by drought fang and xiong 2015 delfin et al 2021 wild wheat and old cultivars have been reported to use primarily drought avoidance mechanisms while modern varieties mainly rely on drought tolerance mechanisms li et al 2021 because of the few breeding programs conducted with spelt and its close relation with wheat we initially hypothesized that it would mainly use drought avoidance strategies unexpectedly spelt significantly increased oa and the ros scavenging enzyme apx indicating the prevalence of drought tolerance mechanisms kooyers 2015 on the contrary our results showed that wheat based its response to mild drought on drought avoidance mechanisms these contradictory results are not necessarily incompatible considering that drought resistance strategies are not mutually exclusive and could alternately occur in the same species depending on the intensity of the drought shavrukov et al 2017 in fact wheat has been reported to use drought avoidance drought tolerance and even drought escape mechanisms izanloo et al 2008 dolferus 2014 fang et al 2017 shavrukov et al 2017 concerning buckwheat although we found its growth to be inhibited by extreme drought most of the analysed parameters were little or not affected buckwheat showed low values of gs and e under control conditions which were slightly reduced under extreme drought low gs and e values have been related with less water loss during drought and are interesting traits to be taken into consideration when searching drought resistant crops medrano et al 2002 this would explain the observed reductions in cumulative transpiration over time and consequent increases in wue by the end of the extreme drought treatment thus buckwheat appears to be a drought avoiding species as previous research have also suggested aubert et al 2020 and more specifically a water saving species overall buckwheat showed a higher biomass production as well as increased levels of wue under control conditions in addition it managed to cope with the imposed extreme drought treatment by increasing even more its wue and maintaining its photosynthetic parameters given the perspective of the increases in the number of drought events high wue is considered to be a desirable trait for crops in order to reduce the use of water resources likewise although we found the growth of wheat and spelt to be little or no affected by the mild drought its negative impact on the rest of the analysed parameters makes us believe that a drought treatment as extreme as the one applied to buckwheat would have resulted in a higher reduction of growth or even death therefore our results show the clear potential of buckwheat over spelt to be an alternative crop for wheat under the future climatic conditions however it should be noted that this research has analysed the effect of drought on the vegetative growth whose effects do not necessarily have to be similar through the reproductive period it has previously been reported that drought has a significant impact on grain yield when imposed at vegetative stage of wheat although this impact could be greater at reproductive stage tatar et al 2015 abid et al 2017 li et al 2019 ulfat et al 2021 therefore future research should also focus on the analysis of the reproductive period to verify whether the potential of buckwheat to be an alternative crop to wheat is not limited to the better response at vegetative growth but also to an improved grain yield 5 conclusions increases in drought episodes and their intensity will be one of the main factors to cause a reduction in the production of conventional crops including wheat triticum aestivum therefore it is essential to find alternative crops that are capable of withstanding future drought episodes in order to ensure food supply in this research we have grown wheat spelt and buckwheat in a greenhouse and evaluated the response of wheat and spelt triticum spelta to mild drought md and of buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum to extreme drought ed under well watered conditions we found no significant differences among wheat and spelt although buckwheat showed significantly higher biomass accumulation and water use efficiency wue under md we found spelt to rely on drought tolerant mechanisms increasing antioxidant metabolism and osmotic adjustment while wheat relied on drought avoidance mechanisms nevertheless spelt was not able to overcome the md showing extreme reductions on the quantum yield of psii φ psii and net photosynthetic assimilation a thus it showed damages on its photosynthetic machinery on the contrary even though the stomatal conductance gs transpiration e and a were reduced in wheat this reduction was not as extreme as in spelt and it showed no damage to the photosynthetic machinery nor increases in the antioxidant metabolism on the other hand although its dry weight dw was reduced buckwheat was capable of coping with the ed by increasing even more its wue and maintaining its photosynthetic parameters taking into consideration that buckwheat was able to withstand ed while under md wheat was slightly damaged and spelt was extremely damaged our results show that buckwheat may have the potential to be an alternative crop to wheat in the future

9092,drought is one of the most harmful abiotic stresses for plants future drought episodes are expected to increase negatively affecting globally cultivated crops as wheat triticum aestivum together with the crop dependency future global food security is at risk thus finding alternative crops for wheat capable of resisting drought episodes is essential to ensure food supply spelt triticum spelta and buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum are two underutilized alternative crops whose drought resistance mechanisms remain unknown we hypothesize that both species will have drought avoidance characteristics and will have a better drought response than wheat we grew wheat spelt and buckwheat in a greenhouse drought treatment started 28 days after sowing when wheat and spelt reached 40 field capacity fc drought was kept for 1 week while in buckwheat the drought was kept for 4 weeks at 20 fc even if partially inhibited by drought buckwheat showed an extremely higher total biomass as well as an extremely higher water use efficiency wue than wheat and spelt photosynthetic parameters were extremely reduced in spelt whereas those were less affected in wheat the reduction in osmotic potential and the use of osmotic adjustment of spelt in combination with the increases in the antioxidant metabolism indicate the prevalence of drought tolerance mechanisms the lack of effect on antioxidant metabolism in wheat along with the reductions in stomatal conductance and water potential indicate the use of drought avoidance mechanisms buckwheat showed drought avoidance mechanisms and its physiological parameters were almost not affected by extreme drought overall spelt showed strong damages under mild drought whereas buckwheat managed to cope with extreme drought by reducing its water requirements and increasing wue in order to ensure its photosynthetic activity thus buckwheat appears to be a potential alternative to wheat for extreme drought conditions while spelt is not

nutritional value cereals are the main source of food for both humans and livestock faostat 2019 in fact approximately 40 of the daily calories consumed worldwide come from rice wheat and maize with wheat triticum aestivum accounting for the 20 of global consumption faostat 2019 nevertheless the global dependency on such a small number of crops has put global food security at risk since future drought episodes will negatively impact the production of these cereals knox et al 2012 not only that but under the future climatic scenarios drought episodes are expected to increase not only in number but also in intensity ipcc 2014 therefore it is crucial to find alternative crops to reduce dependency and ensure food supply under the future drought episodes drought is one of the most detrimental and limiting abiotic stresses for crops which causes decreases in photosynthesis vegetative growth number of flowers and pollen germination barnabás et al 2007 gray and brady 2016 in addition drought stress contributes to an overproduction and accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros which eventually results in damages to the cell membrane inhibition of photochemical reactions and damages to the photosynthetic apparatus li et al 2014 main drought resistance mechanisms are known to be drought avoidance and drought tolerance fang and xiong 2015 drought avoidance is defined as the ability of plants to maintain tissue water content regardless of water scarcity delfin et al 2021 among them water saver plants are the ones that avoid drought damage by reducing water loss via stomatal closure increasing water use efficiency wue inhibiting shoot growth and or increasing water uptake by increasing root growth gilbert et al 2011 kooyers 2015 on the contrary water spender varieties use the available water to maximize productivity without protecting leaf turgor while they could also increase root depth and efficiency to maintain high water status delfin et al 2021 on the other hand drought tolerance is primarily based on the use of osmotic adjustment oa and ros scavenging systems to reduce oxidative damage fang and xiong 2015 kooyers 2015 a recent meta analysis published by li et al 2021 showed that wild and old cultivated wheat varieties use drought avoidance mechanisms while modern wheat varieties improved during the last decades mostly rely on drought tolerance strategies not only that but under severe drought stress modern wheat varieties showed lower yields than older varieties li et al 2021 thus finding alternative crops for wheat with improved drought avoidance mechanisms seems to have the potential to increase food supply and reduce crop dependency alternative crops could be defined as crops whose cultivation is not widespread through the world or crops that are widely cultivated in a specific region of the planet spelt triticum spelta is considered to be a good nourishment source as well as an ancestral relative of wheat whose cultivation was especially high during the roman empire campbell 1997 salamon et al 2020 during the last years spelt has regained interest among the consumers farmers and breeders due to its high nutritional value and number of ancestral genes alvarez 2021 on the other hand buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum is an underutilized pseudo cereal with a high nutritional content whose cultivation is mainly focused on some areas of asia and eastern europe farooq et al 2016 despite the considerable interest they have been attracting in the recent years very little is known about the response of spelt and buckwheat to drought stress in fact some preliminary work was carried out in the early 1990s analysing drought response and recovery of spelt but it was focused primarily on tiller production cabeza et al 1993 similarly few research have studied in detail the physiological response to drought of buckwheat delpérée et al 2003 germ et al 2013 aubert et al 2020 therefore a huge lack of knowledge exists regarding the drought resistance mechanisms of these alternative crops under future climatic conditions we will be facing increases in drought intensity and episodes which will reduce crop production using alternative crops with an improved drought avoidance mechanisms as an alternative to wheat one of the main consumed crops could have the potential to reduce global crop dependency and ensure food production therefore the aim of this research was to characterize the drought response of the alternative crops spelt and buckwheat to drought and determine whether they could be a suitable alternative to wheat since these species have not been used as much as wheat in breeding programs we believe that they will conserve drought avoidance mechanisms and will preserve a higher plasticity to cope with drought thus we hypothesize that 1 spelt will have drought avoidance characteristics 2 buckwheat will show drought avoidance characteristics and 3 spelt and buckwheat will have a better drought response than wheat and thus they will be suitable alternatives to wheat in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions seeds of t aestivum var florence aurora wheat t spelta var franckenkorn spelt and f esculentum var kora buckwheat were obtained from the basque institute for agricultural research and development neiker basque country spain a total of 32 plants per species were grown in 16 pots of 3 l with a 3 1 mixture of perlite vermiculite the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse located at 43 19 46 9 n 2 58 07 6 w under an average temperature of 24 6 21 c and a relative humidity of 68 77 for day night natural light was supplemented with 2 vanq lamps vq gltw030 of 30 w each pots were watered three times per week to keep field capacity fc with hoagland s solution hoagland and arnon 1938 well watered treatment ww as well as rotated three times per week to avoid intra greenhouse environmental gradients 28 days after sowing das drought was imposed by withholding irrigation in half of the pots plant health was monitored measuring chlorophyll content with a minolta spad 502 plus konica minolta optics japan and chlorophyll fluorescence using a fluorpen fp 110 photon systems instruments the czech republic when wheat and spelt reached 40 5 fc this stress was kept for 1 week mild drought treatment md however unlike in wheat and spelt when buckwheat reached 40 fc we observed little or no effect of drought on the measured parameters as well as a lack of damages in the aerial tissues of the drought treatment plants therefore we decided to increase drought intensity in buckwheat fc was reduced to 20 5 and kept for 4 weeks extreme drought treatment ed all the in vivo measurements and plant material harvesting were performed at the end of the drought treatment 59 das in wheat and spelt 31 days of drought and 68 das in buckwheat 40 days of drought 2 2 soil and leaf water parameters cumulative transpiration of eight pots per species and treatment was calculated by weighing pots three times per week before and after watering relative soil water content rswc was determined as rswc 100 sfw sdw sfwi sdw where sfw sdw and sfwi were the soil fresh weight soil dry weight and the initial soil fresh weight respectively leaf water potential ψ w of four leaves per species and treatment was measured using the scholander pressure equilibration technique scholander et al 1965 six h after dawn due to its high ψ w value it was not possible to quantify the ψ w using pressure chambers method in buckwheat as previously reported by delpérée et al 2003 leaf osmotic potential ψ o of the same four leaves was measured by analysing the freezing point of sap of leaf segments using an osmomat 030 cryoscopic osmometer gonotec gmbh berlin germany and calculated as ψ o m t r where m was the concentration osmol kg 1 t was the temperature of the sample 298 k and r was the molar gas constant 0 00832 l mpa k 1 mol 1 the osmotic potential at full turgor ψ o 100 was measured similar to ψ o full turgor of leaves was obtained by cutting four leaves per species and treatments and incubating them in deionized water at 4 c in dark for 24 h pressure potential ψ p was calculated as the difference between ψ w and ψ o cell wall elasticity ε was calculated as ε ψ p 100 ψ p 100 rlwc 100 relative leaf water content rlwc was calculated as the rlwc fw dw tw fw 100 where fw dw and tw were the leaf fresh weight dry weight and turgid weight respectively four leaves per species and treatment were used in wheat and spelt and eight leaves per treatment in buckwheat dehydration dh of plants under drought treatments was calculated as the difference of ψ o and ψ o 100 between treatments osmotic adjustment oa was calculated as the difference of ψ o 100 of plants under drought and control conditions 2 3 gas exchange and photochemical parameters gas exchange parameters of six fully developed leaves per species and treatment were measured using a li cor 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa measurements for wheat and spelt were made on the leaf preceding the flag leaf while in buckwheat the measurement was made on the fifth fully developed leaf counting from the top the temperature of the cuvette was held at 24 c at a relative humidity of 60 measurements were made three h after dawn under a photosynthetic flux density of 400 µmol m 2 s 1 provided by a red blue led light source model li 6400 40 li cor inc intercellular co2 concentration ci stomatal conductance gs net photosynthetic co2

adapted fluorescence schindler and lichtenthaler 1996 electron transport rate etr was determined as etr φ psii ppfd 0 85 0 5 where ppfd refers to the photosynthetic photon flux density and the ratio of electron transport rate to net photosynthetic co2 assimilation etr a was calculated as the ratio between etr and a 2 4 antioxidant parameters leaves of two plants per pot were pooled as one biological replicate for antioxidant enzyme activity measurements four replicates per species and treatment were used activities of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione reductase gr and ascorbate peroxidase apx were measured as described in pérez lópez et al 2009 with little modifications briefly sod cat and gr were extracted in a buffer composed by 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 0 2 triton x 100 0 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pmsf and 2 mm dithiotreitol supernatant from samples were filtered over shepadex g 25 columns equilibrated with 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm edta and 0 2 triton x 100 cat was measured at 240 nm as described by aebi 1984 gr activity was measured at 340 nm according to edwards et al 1990 activity of sod was measured at 550 nm as described by mccord and fridovich 1969 apx was extracted in a mixture of 50 mm kh2po4 and k2hpo4 ph 7 8 containing 0 1 mm edta 0 2 triton x 100 5 mm cysteine 2 mm ascorbate asa and 0 1 mm pmsf apx activity was measured at 290 nm in accordance with hossain and asada 1984 all enzyme activities were expressed on a protein basis which was measured according to the bradford 1976 method 2 5 growth parameters and informatics measurements leaves stems and roots of four plants per species and treatment were harvested in wheat and spelt and eight plants per treatment in buckwheat plant organs were oven dried for 72 h for dry weight dw measurements wue was calculated by dividing plant dw and cumulative transpiration photos of the harvested leaves were taken for measuring leaf area la with the open source software fiji fiji is just imagej schindelin et al 2012 prior to oven drying them stomatal density sd was measured by obtaining leaf imprints from adaxial and abaxial surfaces as explained by casado garcía et al 2020 photos of stomata were taken using a nikon eclipse 50i fluorescence microscope nikon corporation japan with a leica dfc 420 c camera leica microsystems germany three photos of the adaxial and three photos of the abaxial surfaces of four plants per species and treatment were used measurements were made with labelstoma tool casado garcía et al 2020 briefly explained photos were loaded into labelstoma and the scale and area to be analysed were established automatic stomata detection was performed using the default parameters each photo was reviewed individually and if necessary undetected stomata were added manually 2 6 statistical analysis and figures all figures were performed using graphpad prism version 8 2 1 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa www graphpad com statistical analysis was done using spss version 27 0 for windows ibm corp armonk ny the effect of water treatment ww md and ed species wheat spelt and buckwheat and their interaction were determined by two way anova afterwards data was compared using duncan s post hoc test p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 growth parameters buckwheat showed increased growth under ww especially for aboveground organs which were 12 times bigger than in wheat and spelt fig 1a d likewise the biomass accumulation of buckwheat under ed was significantly reduced by approximately 45 for all organs while among wheat and spelt we only found leaf dw to be significantly reduced in spelt fig 1a as occurred with the growth buckwheat showed significantly higher shoot root ratio and la fig 1e f which were significantly reduced under ed on the contrary among wheat and spelt we only found la to be significantly reduced by drought in spelt fig 1f buckwheat had a wue of 4 3 g dw kg 1 h2o under control conditions while for wheat and spelt these values were of 1 76 and 1 64 g dw kg 1 h2o significantly smaller fig 2 neither wheat nor spelt wue was affected by md whereas buckwheat showed a significantly higher wue with values 24 higher than under ww and 2 7 times bigger than in wheat and spelt fig 2 3 2 water relations we observed a progressive decrease in rswc for wheat and spelt reaching 40 5 after 47 49 das while this value was reached at 35 36 das in buckwheat fig 3 similarly 20 5 rswc was reached in buckwheat at 39 40 das spelt showed a significantly higher cumulative transpiration under control conditions fig 4 which was significantly reduced in a 41 after the md treatment buckwheat had the lowest value of cumulative transpiration and was significantly reduced by 17 under 20 fc buckwheat managed to keep extremely lower cumulative transpiration rates per week showing a 50 60 reduction from start to end of the drought treatment both wheat and spelt showed significantly lower ψ w under md treatment table 1 not only that but spelt showed a significant reduction in ψ o reaching a value of 2 607 mpa while ψ o was not affected in wheat nor in buckwheat ε showed an opposite trend in wheat and spelt when exposed to drought it increased from 8 667 mpa to 14 705 mpa in wheat whereas it decreased from 37 520 mpa to 5 348 mpa in spelt the rlwc was significantly reduced by 10 5 in spelt while it remained similar to control conditions in wheat and buckwheat also spelt showed a dh level of 0 937 mpa which was significantly higher than the dh values of wheat 0 491 mpa and buckwheat 0 mpa in the same way spelt showed an oa three times higher than the rest of the species thus it appears that the water parameters of buckwheat were not affected by ed while under md the same parameters for spelt and wheat were highly and slightly affected respectively 3 3 gas exchange parameters spelt showed significantly higher values of gs and e under control conditions than wheat and buckwheat fig 5a b and thus was the most affected by the drought treatment md induced an extreme reduction of 75 gs in spelt which was turned into a 72 reduction of e in wheat drought significantly reduced gs and e by 58 and 56 on the contrary although significant the reductions in buckwheat were only of 39 and 36 also although the values of φ psii were similar for the three species spelt was the only species to have it significantly reduced fig 5c drought significantly reduced a by half in wheat and by 92 in spelt while it had not significant effect on buckwheat fig 5d ci was not affected in wheat by the drought treatment while in spelt it was significantly increased fig 5e nevertheless despite the lack of effect in ci in wheat and its accumulation in spelt a ci was significantly reduced in both species with this reduction being caused by a fig 5d f in buckwheat although ci was slightly decreased a ci remained unchanged under the ed treatment fig 5e f even though the three species had similar values of etr under control conditions etr of spelt was significantly reduced by 73 and etr a was significantly increased by 254 under md fig 5g similarly etr a values were significantly increased in wheat by 110 mainly driven by a decrease fig 5g h on the contrary ed showed no influence on etr nor etr a in buckwheat overall it seems that the photosynthetic parameters of spelt are extremely damaged by md while the same parameters are less affected in wheat and not affected at all in buckwheat under ed buckwheat showed significantly higher abaxial sd than wheat and spelt under ww while this value was significantly lower for the adaxial sd fig 6 however the sum of the abaxial and the adaxial sd did not differ among the three species under control conditions on the contrary under the drought treatments wheat and spelt showed no differences neither in the sd of both sides of the leaves nor in the total sd while in buckwheat there was a significant increase in the adaxial abaxial and total sd fig 6 3 4 antioxidant metabolism we found no effect of drought treatments on the antioxidant metabolism enzymes in wheat nor buckwheat fig 7a d apx activity was significantly increased 160 in spelt under md while we did not find any remarkable effect on sod cat and gr fig 7a d 4 discussion the global dependency to a few number of crops along with the increases in number and intensity of the drought episodes threatens global food security ipcc 2014 modern wheat varieties have shown decreases in production when exposed to severe drought stress li et al 2021 and thus it is essential to find alternative crops to wheat with the ability to resist drought stress here we have characterized the drought response of wheat and two alternative species spelt and buckwheat our research provides data which demonstrates that 1 spelt activates drought tolerance mechanisms in the presence of a mild intensity drought even though these mechanisms are not enough to withstand a mild drought treatment 2 buckwheat activates drought avoidance mechanisms and manages to cope with an extreme drought treatment better than wheat does with a mild drought and 3 buckwheat may have the potential to be used as an alternative crop to wheat under extreme drought conditions among all the crops buckwheat stood out in terms of growth since under control conditions it showed an average biomass accumulation 7 and 12 times higher than spelt and wheat respectively fig 1a f in order to test whether the differences in total biomass among species were explained due to the differences in growth days we analysed the relative growth rate rgr sup fig 1 which showed that there were barely any differences given the exceptionally higher biomass accumulation of buckwheat the reported growth reduction for this species under extreme drought was not particularly surprising even though the overall growth of buckwheat was inhibited we observed a decrease in the shoot root ratio when exposed to drought supporting previous hypothesis on buckwheat growth response to drought aubert et al 2020 in spite of everything buckwheat was the species with higher biomass under both water treatments suggesting an improved use of water resources as a matter of fact we found buckwheat to have higher levels of wue under well watered conditions as well as maintaining higher levels of wue under drought this is a highly valued trait in crop breeding programs richards et al 2002 condon et al 2004 and thus exploitation of the high wue of buckwheat to get improved drought resistant crops could be worthwhile in addition to having a lower wue wheat and spelt showed no variation in this parameter when exposed to drought stress which indicates the ability of buckwheat to control water resources more efficiently than wheat and spelt the better use of water resources in buckwheat could be explained by increases in water uptake and or reductions in water loss which are two adaptive strategies that mitigate drought impact blum 2005 in this case it was essentially explained by a strict regulation of cumulative transpiration since buckwheat managed to restrict transpiration over time when exposed to extreme drought the higher proportion of abaxial stomata in relation to adaxial stomata in buckwheat could be restricting cumulative transpiration reducing the evaporative demand and thus causing reductions in total transpiration besides buckwheat showed a significant decrease in shoot root ratio which contributes to the better use of water resources by increasing water uptake under drought the decrease of ψ w under water scarcity is also a mechanism that plants activate to increase water uptake and thus it has been associated with an improved drought response robredo et al 2007 even though we were unable to quantify ψ w of buckwheat see 2 materials and methods we found that wheat and spelt had similar reductions in ψ w under mild drought although dehydration passive mechanism was the main driving force in response to drought in wheat and spelt the degree of dehydration in spelt was double than in wheat on the contrary buckwheat showed no signs of dehydration which together with the rlwc results indicate that it was capable of maintaining an optimal water status inside the plant even if it was under an extreme drought treatment water scarcity promotes water flow outside the cells and thus dehydration commonly causes decreases in ψ p chen et al 2020 as occurred in wheat the accumulation of different osmolytes inside the cells oa could also promote decreases in ψ w which increases the turgor of the cells nemeskéri and helyes 2019 this would explain the observed reductions in ψ o and increases in ψ p for spelt nevertheless the activation of these mechanisms were not enough for spelt to maintain rlwc and overcome the impact of mild drought stress on the photosynthetic parameters actually the photosynthetic processes of spelt were the most damaged ones by the drought treatment mild drought induced an extreme stomatal closure and transpiration decrease on this species while in wheat these reductions were more conservative stomatal closure is a short term strategy to prevent water loss in most plant species but could result in limitations of photosynthesis under water scarcity if it is maintained for long periods diaz espejo et al 2007 silim et al 2009 however in buckwheat we only found a slight closure of stomata and decrease in transpiration under extreme drought with no significant effect on a these results are in contradiction with previous results which reported reductions higher than 80 in e gs and or a under water stress delpérée et al 2003 germ et al 2013 aubert et al 2020 nevertheless it should be noted that as well as using distinct varieties and drought intensities the drought treatments were combined with different levels of light delpérée et al 2003 or uv b radiation germ et al 2013 which could explain the reported differences masojídek et al 1991 itam et al 2020 wasaya et al 2021 despite the reduction in gs neither wheat nor spelt showed variations in sd in response to drought while buckwheat increased it in both sides of the leaves however the increase in sd could be the result of a concentrating effect of stomata due to the reduction in la unlike in buckwheat photosynthesis in spelt and wheat was inhibited when exposed to drought this inhibition of a induced decreases in a ci in wheat and spelt suggesting non stomatal limitations miranda apodaca et al 2018 however while we found spelt to have an extremely reduced φ psii indicating a down regulation or structural alteration of the photosynthetic apparatus foyer et al 2017 we did not observe the same trend in wheat this different photochemical sensitivity between both triticum species under drought could explain the better behaviour of a in wheat in addition the decreases in a induced etr a to be significantly increased in wheat and spelt suggesting a deviation of electrons to other processes that are not the photosynthesis in the present study we found spelt to significantly increase the activity of the apx antioxidant enzyme indicating a deviation of electrons from photosynthesis to mehler reaction cruz de carvalho 2008 on the contrary we found no effect of drought treatments on antioxidant metabolism of wheat and buckwheat upregulation of antioxidant metabolism along with the use of oa are two key mechanisms used by the drought tolerant species to cope with drought stress kooyers 2015 on the contrary drought avoidance species mainly focus on maintaining normal physiological processes by increasing wue and or modifying growth rates to avoid the harmful effects caused by drought fang and xiong 2015 delfin et al 2021 wild wheat and old cultivars have been reported to use primarily drought avoidance mechanisms while modern varieties mainly rely on drought tolerance mechanisms li et al 2021 because of the few breeding programs conducted with spelt and its close relation with wheat we initially hypothesized that it would mainly use drought avoidance strategies unexpectedly spelt significantly increased oa and the ros scavenging enzyme apx indicating the prevalence of drought tolerance mechanisms kooyers 2015 on the contrary our results showed that wheat based its response to mild drought on drought avoidance mechanisms these contradictory results are not necessarily incompatible considering that drought resistance strategies are not mutually exclusive and could alternately occur in the same species depending on the intensity of the drought shavrukov et al 2017 in fact wheat has been reported to use drought avoidance drought tolerance and even drought escape mechanisms izanloo et al 2008 dolferus 2014 fang et al 2017 shavrukov et al 2017 concerning buckwheat although we found its growth to be inhibited by extreme drought most of the analysed parameters were little or not affected buckwheat showed low values of gs and e under control conditions which were slightly reduced under extreme drought low gs and e values have been related with less water loss during drought and are interesting traits to be taken into consideration when searching drought resistant crops medrano et al 2002 this would explain the observed reductions in cumulative transpiration over time and consequent increases in wue by the end of the extreme drought treatment thus buckwheat appears to be a drought avoiding species as previous research have also suggested aubert et al 2020 and more specifically a water saving species overall buckwheat showed a higher biomass production as well as increased levels of wue under control conditions in addition it managed to cope with the imposed extreme drought treatment by increasing even more its wue and maintaining its photosynthetic parameters given the perspective of the increases in the number of drought events high wue is considered to be a desirable trait for crops in order to reduce the use of water resources likewise although we found the growth of wheat and spelt to be little or no affected by the mild drought its negative impact on the rest of the analysed parameters makes us believe that a drought treatment as extreme as the one applied to buckwheat would have resulted in a higher reduction of growth or even death therefore our results show the clear potential of buckwheat over spelt to be an alternative crop for wheat under the future climatic conditions however it should be noted that this research has analysed the effect of drought on the vegetative growth whose effects do not necessarily have to be similar through the reproductive period it has previously been reported that drought has a significant impact on grain yield when imposed at vegetative stage of wheat although this impact could be greater at reproductive stage tatar et al 2015 abid et al 2017 li et al 2019 ulfat et al 2021 therefore future research should also focus on the analysis of the reproductive period to verify whether the potential of buckwheat to be an alternative crop to wheat is not limited to the better response at vegetative growth but also to an improved grain yield 5 conclusions increases in drought episodes and their intensity will be one of the main factors to cause a reduction in the production of conventional crops including wheat triticum aestivum therefore it is essential to find alternative crops that are capable of withstanding future drought episodes in order to ensure food supply in this research we have grown wheat spelt and buckwheat in a greenhouse and evaluated the response of wheat and spelt triticum spelta to mild drought md and of buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum to extreme drought ed under well watered conditions we found no significant differences among wheat and spelt although buckwheat showed significantly higher biomass accumulation and water use efficiency wue under md we found spelt to rely on drought tolerant mechanisms increasing antioxidant metabolism and osmotic adjustment while wheat relied on drought avoidance mechanisms nevertheless spelt was not able to overcome the md showing extreme reductions on the quantum yield of psii φ psii and net photosynthetic assimilation a thus it showed damages on its photosynthetic machinery on the contrary even though the stomatal conductance gs transpiration e and a were reduced in wheat this reduction was not as extreme as in spelt and it showed no damage to the photosynthetic machinery nor increases in the antioxidant metabolism on the other hand although its dry weight dw was reduced buckwheat was capable of coping with the ed by increasing even more its wue and maintaining its photosynthetic parameters taking into consideration that buckwheat was able to withstand ed while under md wheat was slightly damaged and spelt was extremely damaged our results show that buckwheat may have the potential to be an alternative crop to wheat in the future

9093,prediction of crop yield under water and salt stress is essential for guiding deficit irrigation in saline soil the responses of tomato plants to water and salt stress and their interactions have profound effect on yield traditional crop water salt production functions do not fully account for the physiological response of plants to all stresses especially the response to the interaction of soil salinity and water deficit we developed a static crop water and salt production function based on the traditional water and salt production function combined with the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity and the specific effects of soil salinity based on a statistical model this research involves measurement of plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s osmotic potential ψ π leaf turgor ψ p relative leaf water content rwc net photosynthesis p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration t r and the responses of these physiological parameters to four water deficit treatments or four salt salinity treatments as well as combined water deficit and soil salinity the correlation analysis of physiological parameters showed that the pre dawn stem water potential of plant was closely correlated with ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s and t r the variations of physiological parameters with plant stem water potential were different under different soil salinity levels we used the pre dawn plant stem water potential as a unified indicator to characterize water deficit soil salinity and combined water deficit and soil salinity when predicting yield by stem water potential we quantified the difference between the responses of the physiological parameters to the reduction of pre dawn stem water potential under salt stress combined water deficit and soil salinity and that under water stress to improve the applicability of the function we established quantitative relationships between soil volumetric water content conductivity of saturated extract and predawn stem water potential finally we established a new crop water salt production function that takes the rhizosphere soil water content and electrical conductivity as the input and considers the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity and the effect of ion accumulation compared with other crop water salt production function models the new model has higher simulation accuracy and easier data acquisition which is conducive to application in greenhouse crop water and salt management keywords water deficit soil salinity pre dawn stem water potential physiological response crop water salt production function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the implementation of water savings in arid and semi arid areas is of great significance to alleviate water shortage for sustainable agricultural development huang et al 2020 arid and semi arid regions often have soil salinization problems water deficit may not lead to further yield reductions of crops grown in salinized soils maggio et al 2004 the yield of crops is mainly related to the physiological response of plants to abiotic stresses therefore research of crop yield simulation based on physiological responses under the combined water deficit and soil salinity has important practical significance for establishing a reasonable water saving irrigation regime in salinized soils traditional water and salt production functions are mainly done by correcting evapotranspiration or increasing the salt stress coefficient based on the water production function allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2007 wang and kang 2004 physiological and metabolic responses of crops to combined stress are not a simple superposition of only two effects but involve complex interactions schafer and piggott 2018 zandalinas et al 2021 the crop water salt production function established by the two methods is insufficient because the interaction of the two stresses as well as ion toxicity are not considered to develop the crop water salt production function based on available studies the simulation process has to take more into account the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity as well as the effect of ion accumulation it has been suggested that both water stress and salt stress mainly cause osmotic stress by reducing soil water potential maathuis 2014 borawska jarmulowicz 2017 chaves et al 2009 reported that the initial response of plants to water stress and salt stress were both triggered by osmotic stress signals the most direct effect of osmotic stress on the plant is to prevent water uptake by the plant leading to a reduction in plant water potential borawska jarmulowicz et al 2017 maathuis 2014 the interaction of water deficit and soil salinity has been implied by the changes in plant stem water potential under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity plant pre dawn stem water potential can be used as a unified indicator to characterize water stress salt stress and combined stress in addition the change in plant stem water potential is also a reflection of the change in soil water potential ameglio et al 1999 plant stem water potential is an important medium for linking soil water content soil salinity and plant physiological response photosynthesis is one of the most important physiological processes in plants and 90 of the plant biomass comes from photosynthesis steduto et al 2000 taïbi et al 2016 the decrease of net photosynthetic rate under mild osmotic stress is mainly due to stomatal restriction chaves et al 2009 lawlor and tezara 2009 and stomatal conductance is significantly affected by leaf relative water content rwc and water potential evans 2013 xue et al 2021 in addition to photosynthetic rate leaf area is also an important indicator to determine the total photosynthetic products of plants during leaf growth cell expansion plays a decisive role in the final leaf area renaudin et al 2017 cell turgor pressure is the main driving force of cell expansion and leaf cell expansion is very sensitive to turgor pressure bouchabke et al 2006 haas et al 2020 water stress and salt stress can reduce the cell turgor of plant arif et al 2020 mitchell et al 2008 navada et al 2020 moreover cell turgor pressure greatly affects the physiological and biochemical processes of leaves katerji et al 2011 katuwal et al 2020 patade et al 2012 rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 reported most stomatal closure in woody species under moderate drought could be explained by stomatal responses to changes in leaf cell turgor caused by changes in either soil water potential hydraulic conductance or osmotic pressure in addition to osmotic stress the effects of ion accumulation on plants under soil salinity cannot be ignored patade et al 2012 shabala and munns 2017 with the increase of soil salinity the non stomatal restriction gradually increased pan et al 2021 the progressive accumulation of ions in photosynthetically active mesophyll tissues leads to further inhibition of co2 assimilation borbely et al 2020 mehta et al 2010 munns et al 2006 the accumulation of large amounts of ions in the plant can lead to ion toxicity zhu 2016 in addition the enhancement of osmotic adjustment by ion accumulation would have a beneficial effect on plant resistance to osmotic stress under osmotic stress conditions plants osmotic adjustment is an important mechanism for plants to resist water stress and salt stress blum 2017 chen and jiang 2010 hessini et al 2009 osmotic adjustment can help plants maintain water uptake and cell turgor pressure by accumulating inorganic ions and compatible solutes hessini et al 2009 puniran hartley et al 2014 mejri et al 2016 showed that wild barley tolerated drought better than cultivated barley due to stronger osmotic adjustment katuwal et al 2020 showed that osmotic adjustment of plants under iso osmotic salt stress was stronger compared to that under osmotic stress the accumulation of dry matter can reflect the final effect of water stress salt stress as well as combined water stress and salt stress on plants which already includes the resistance of plants to stress the effects of osmotic stress and ion accumulation on plant physiological parameters respectively have been recognized however the role of ion accumulation in the effect of osmotic stress on plant physiological parameters under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity needs to be further determined tomato is a moderately salt tolerant plant that can withstand moderate salt stress and yield decreased with the increasing stress after exceeding the tolerance threshold value yang et al 2019 borbely et al 2020 the effect of water deficit on tomato yield is related to stress intensity stress duration and stress occurrence period and mild water stress does not result in reduced yields chen et al 2014 negrao et al 2017 the response of tomato yield and physiological parameters to different degrees of combined water stress and salt stress is still not well understood the main purposes of this study were to 1 explore the interaction of water deficit and soil salinity on physiological parameters of tomato and the relationship between stem water potential and other physiological parameters related to yield formation under combined water deficit and soil salinity 2 establishment of quantitative relationship between soil volumetric water content electrical conductivity and plant pre dawn stem water potential 3 propose a novel crop water salt production

soil dry bulk density was 1 47 g cm3 and the field capacity θ f were 0 27 cm3 cm3 within the planned depth of wetted soil layer 40 cm field capacity is traditionally measured through a grab sample of known volume that is fully wetted and then allowed to sit under free drainage for two to three days after free drainage has ceased the water content of the sample is computed bajwa et al 2017 embrapa

start time of irrigation was the same for all treatments irrigation was initiated for all treatments once average volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer 0 40 cm of full irrigation treatment dropped to around 75 2 ofθ f the amount of irrigation for each treatment was determined by the difference between the soil water content at the start of irrigation and the set upper limit water content two growing plots were randomly selected for each treatment and each growing plot contained 12 tomato plants for a total of 24 tomato plants per treatment physiological parameters and yield were measured at the individual plant scale the entire growth period of tomato was divided into three stages i e seedling stage i from planting to flowering reproductive stage ii from flowering to first fruit maturity and mature stage iii from first fruit maturity to all fruits harvested water deficits occurred during reproductive growth stage and mature stage in 2018 2018 19 and 2019 seasons respectively and only occurred during the reproductive growth period in 2020 treatments of water deficit at stage ii was fully irrigated at stage iii details of growth periods and water treatments are shown in table 2 the amount of irrigation and the number of irrigation times at different growth stages are listed in table 3 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture content and electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract in rhizosphere most of the tomato roots were distributed in 0 40 cm soil layer machado and oliveira 2003 wang et al 2021 volumetric soil water content θ was continuously monitored using 5te sensors meter inc usa buried in the root zone at 10 20 30 40 cm below the soil surface the soil water content monitored continuously was mainly used to determine the irrigation time the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ec e was measured by a conductivity meter fg30 fivego mettler toledo inc soil samples collected at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the soil surface using soil auger before and after irrigation were used to determine water content and ec e of the root zone our previous results showed that irrigation kept the average soil saturated leachate electrical conductivity of the root zone soil layer in a stable dynamic variation zhang et al 2022 we characterized the salinity of the soil as the mean of the measured values of all irrigation cycles after the average soil saturated leachate conductivity of the root zone soil layer was in a stable dynamic variation 2 3 2 plant physiological parameters pre dawn stem water potential ψ s was measured by a skpm 1400 pressure chamber skye instruments ltd uk between 4 a m and 6 a m leaves close to the tomato trusses were wrapped with aluminum bags for 10 min before each measurement thomas et al 2006 the leaves were frozen with liquid nitrogen after water potential determination the osmotic potential of sap expressed from freeze thawed leaf was determined using a vapor pressure osmometer vapro5600 wescor inc pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential were measured in three irrigation cycles at reproductive and mature stage respectively and each irrigation cycle was measured 3 times at 1 day 3 days and 5 days after irrigation turgor potential was calculated as the difference between pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential hsiao 1973 photosynthesis rate p n µmol m 2 s 1 transpiration rate t r mmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance g s mol m 2 s 1 were determined on fully expanded upper leaves with three replications in each treatment using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor corporation usa p n t r and g s were measured on the same date as the pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential each measurement was made between 9 am and 11 am five samples were measured for each treatment the relative water content of leaf was obtained by 1 rwc fw l dw l tw l dw l where fw l is leaf fresh weight dw l is leaf dry weight tw l is leaf turgid weight obtained by placing the leaf samples in vials filled with distilled water for 24 h and then removing surface water from the leaf and weighing them 2 3 3 evapotranspiration dry matter accumulation and yield the actual evapotranspiration et for each treatment was calculated according to the water balance equation as follows 2 et p i w d r sw where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm w is groundwater recharge mm d is deep percolation mm r is surface runoff mm sw is the change in soil water storage mm p is zero inside greenhouse the growing plot is separated from the surrounding soil by polyethylene film so w d and r are zero in summary eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 et i sw the dry matter was determined at the end of seedling reproductive and maturity and dry matter accumulation dma during reproductive and fruit ripening was calculated three samples were selected for each treatment for dry matter determination for the determination of yield we selected a total of 5 tomato samples from the two planting plots of each treatment fresh weight of fruit was recorded by electronic balance me2002e mettler toledo usa with accuracy of 0 01 g 2 4 traditional crop water salt production function the commonly used crop water salt production function models were mainly based on jensen 1968 and stewart model stewart et al 1977 this section mainly introduces two commonly used models the model i was developed on the basis of jensen model wang and kang 2004 4 y a y m ec emax ec e ec emax ec emin β i 1 n et ai et mi λ i where y m is the crop yield of no stress treatments y a is the crop yield under stress et mi is e t at the growth stage i of no stress treatment et ai is actual et at the growth stage i under water stress λ i is jensen s water deficit sensitivity parameter of crop yield for the growth stage i n is the number of growth stages ec emax is the limiting value of plant salt tolerance when the ec e is greater than this value the crop yield is zero ec e min is critical value of plant salt tolerance if the ec e is less than the threshold value crop yields will not be affected by salinity ec e is actual ec of soil saturation extract β is salt sensitivity parameter of crop yield λ i and β were estimated by the least squares method it is difficult to obtain exact values of ec emax and ec e min ec emax and ec e min were set as 3 80 ds m 1 and 0 85 ds m 1 respectively based on the measured data the model ii was developed on the basis of stewart model allen et al 1998 5 y a y m i 1 n 1 k yi 1 et awsi et m i where k yi is the crop yield response factor et awsi is actual et at the growth stage i under different combined water stress and salt stress k yi was estimated by the least squares method 2 5 proposed new model based on stem water potential staged dry matter accumulation is more closely associated with yield than et therefore we first referred to the structure of jensen model to establish the relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and relative yield combined with the actual situation a correction coefficient was used to deal with the change of dry matter distribution under water deficit soil salinity as well as combined water deficit and soil salinity in the second step a function between soil water potential represented by pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation was established considering the effect of ion accumulation an equation was established that could be used to calculate pre dawn stem water potential using θ and ec e finally the new model can predict relative yield using θ and ec e the model simulation process is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 quantitative relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and relative yield referring to structure of the jensen model the equation between dry matter accumulation and relative yield was determined as 6 y a y m i 1 n d i dma a i dma mi γ i where dma mi is dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i for no stress treatment dma ai is actual dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i d i is the coefficient that is used to correct for the effect of changes in dry matter distribution at the growth stage i d i was estimated from the measured data γ i is the sensitivity coefficient of yield to dma at stage i and n is the number of growth stages γ i was estimated by the least squares method 2 5 2 quantitative relationship between pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation the following equation is developed for predicting plant response to water stress and salt stress as additive van genuchten and hoffman 1984 in this equation response is related to the combined matric and osmotic potential as follows 7 α s 1 1 h h 50 b where α s is the dimensionless stress response function h is the sum of osmotic and matric stress h 50 is the value of h at which there is a 50 reduction in yeild and b is empirical fitting parameter both water deficit and soil salinity initially affect the plant by inhibiting water uptake compared to soil matric potential and osmotic potential pre dawn stem water potential ψ s more directly reflects the water status of the plant in addition the relative dry matter accumulation of plants under stress can reflect the influence of stress on plants in accordance with this equation we established the quantitative relationship between pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation dma during the growth stage eq 7 could be rewritten as 8 dma ai dma mi 1 1 ψ s ψ s 50 i b where ψ s is pre dawn stem water potential under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity and the value of ψ s is mean value of pre dawn stem water potential during the growth stage ψ s 50 is the value of ψ s at which there is a 50 reduction in yield b is the shape parameter ψ s 50 and b are estimated by the least squares method obviously this equation does not consider the effects caused by ion accumulation in plants under salt stress we quantified the effect of ions by comparing the response of plant physiological parameters to osmotic stress under different soil salinity for each soil salinity we collected stem water potential and other physiological parameters ψ p rwc p n g s and t r for the four water treatments at three time points during a single irrigation cycle we compared the response of other physiological parameters under different soil salinities relative to the reduction in stem water potential caused by the reduction in soil water content based on the differences in the response of other physiological parameters of the plant to the reduction in stem water potential under different soil salinities fig 2 we determined the equation for the ionic influence coefficient as follow 9 o si 1 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 ec e t i ec e ec e ec e 0 δ i where o si is ion influence coefficient at the growth stage i ec e 0 is the value of ec e without salt pressure and the value of ec e 0 is 0 45 ds m 1 ec e t i is the threshold at the growth stage i when ec e is greater than the threshold value ion accumulation will have a negative effect on dry matter accumulation of growth stage i δ i is coefficient of influence of ion accumulation on dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i ec e t i and δ i are estimated by the least squares method finally the quantitative relationship between ψ s and relative dry matter accumulation was 10 dma ai dma mi 1 1 ψ s ψ s 50 i b i 1 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 δ i 2 5 3 quantitative relationship between soil water content electrical conductivity of rhizosphere and pre dawn stem water potential soil water content and salt content are two main factors influencing pre dawn stem water potential ψ s the pre dawn stem water potential of the plant depends mainly on the soil water potential when the effect of soil salinity is not considered the soil water potential is equivalent to the soil substrate potential determined by the soil water content the quantitative relationship between soil matrix potential and water content is represented by the soil water characteristic curve the brooks and corey model brooks and corey 1964 is one of the commonly used water characteristic curve models the equation is as follows 11 θ θ r θ s θ r φ h σ where θ s is saturated water content θ r is wilting coefficient θ is actual soil water content φ is the bubbling pressure σ dimensionless soil characteristic parameter parameters for eq 11 were obtained by fitting of h θ using retc 1 0 van lier 2017 table 1 shows fitted parameters for soil the soil water characteristic curve is shown in fig 2 with reference to the structure of the brooks and corey model the relationship of soil water content and pre dawn stem water potential under no salt stress is determined as 12 ψ s a θ θ r θ s θ r d where ψ s is stem water potential under single water deficit a and d are the shape parameters of the curve and are estimated by the least squares method the effect of salinity on plant stem water potential is related to salt and water contents pre dawn stem water potential is determined by θ and ec e under combined water deficit and soil salinity considering the influence of ec e the quantitative relationship between θ ec e and stem water potential is given as 13 ψ s a θ θ r θ s θ r d ec e ec e 0 c 1 θ s θ τ where c is a crop specific parameter which represents the decrease value of stem water potential caused by unit increase of ec e τ is the influence coefficient of soil water content on reducing stem water potential by ec e c and τ are estimated by the least squares method 2 6 evaluation of model performance the performance of the estimated model was evaluated by linear regression between measured and simulated values and the coefficients of determination r2 in addition the indicators of estimation errors and quality of modeling were also calculated e g the root mean square error rmse average absolute error aae the modeling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the willmott parameter of agreement dia willmott 1981 rmse characterizing the variance of the errors is calculated as 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 aae expressing the size of estimation errors is calculated as 15 aae 1 n i 1 n s i m i ef defined by the ratio of the mean square error to the variance in the measured data is calculated as follows 16 ef 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where m is the measured mean value d ia indicates the agreement between the measured and simulated values is given as follows 17 d ia 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 when d ia 1 a perfect agreement between the measured and simulated value is attained when d ia 0 there is no agreement moriasi et al 2007 2 7 statistical analyses we used the spss statistics 24 0 ibm ny usa to carry out analysis of variance and regression analysis the parameters were calibrated by fitting the data with the least squares method we investigated the significance of the difference between relative dry matter accumulation and relative fruit fresh weight by t test two way anova tukey s test was performed by year to test for the effects of salinity regime water deficit and their interaction on ψ s ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s and t r we chose five plants for each treatment and although this would have unbalanced data subclass numbers vary independently of treatment variables and the response variable is not influenced by subclass number piepho 1997 indicated that even with quite unbalanced data from a randomized complete block design an analysis of plot means is approximately valid we performed the two factor anova with reference to the method suggested by piepho et al 2022 our correlation analysis was performed mainly to show that changes in plant stem water potential were more closely associated with changes in other physiological parameters than soil water content or conductivity of soil extract pearson s product moment correlations was done between ψ s and ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s t r with plant scale data we obtained the parameters in the model by fitting the brooks and corey model with retc 1 0 3 results 3 1 response of plant physiological parameters to combined water deficit and soil salinity there were more water treatments in the 2020 experiment so the responses of plants to water stress salt stress and combined water and salt stress were mainly analyzed using measured data at the reproductive growth stage of 2020 season physiological indicators including stem water potential leaf osmotic potential leaf turgor pressure relative leaf water content net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate were significantly affected by soil salinity water deficit and their interactions table 4 there were differences in physiological parameters at the same pre dawn stem water potential due to different soil salinity the correlation coefficients r2 between plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s and osmotic potential ψ π leaf turgor ψ p relative leaf water content rwc net photosynthesis p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration t r all exceeded 0 85 indicating that ψ s was closely correlated with these physiological parameters table 5 differences in ψ s were caused by water deficit under the same soil salinity treatments when soil salinity was different there were significant differences in the distribution of physiological parameters relative to ψ s fig 3 under s3 combined soil salinity and water deficit on photosynthesis was smaller than that of single water stress there was an intersection between the fitting line of p n and ψ s under s3 and s0 the ψ s at the intersection is the critical ψ s for higher ψ s than ψ s at the intersection p n was greater under the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress than that under single water stress when ψ s was lower than that at the intersection p n under the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress was smaller than that under single water stress under s7 the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress on photosynthesis was greater than that of single water stress the effect of soil salinity on the reduction of photosynthesis caused by the reduction of ψ s was mainly related to the content of soil salinity g s was always higher under combined soil salinity and water deficit stress than that under single water stress indicating that plants growing in low salinity soil were more favorable to maintain g s when ψ s decreased the differences in transpiration rate t r and osmotic potential of the leaves ψ π under different soil salinities were small at the same pre dawn stem water potential fig 3 there was a linear correlation between turgor pressure of leaf cells ψ p and ψ s and the fitting lines of ψ p and ψ s for all soil salinity treatments were above that under s0 the reduction of stem water potential under soil salinity treatment had less effect on turgor pressure than that of s0 under all salinity treatments rwc was linearly related to water potential and rwc under combined soil salinity and water deficit stress was greater than that of single water deficit at the same ψ s 3 2 parameter calibration and validation of the new model 3 2 1 calibration and validation of parameter in the functional relationship between relative yield and relative dry matter accumulation the eq 6 was calibrated using the data of 2018 and 2018 19 seasons to obtain the sensitivity coefficient γ i at different growth stages under combined water deficit and soil salinity although the proportion of fruit biomass increased fruit water content decreased fig 4 therefore there was no significant difference between the relative dry matter accumulation and the relative increase of fruit fresh weight at the second stage fig 5 therefore the d 2 in eq 6 was set as 1 under water deficit soil salinity and combined water deficit and soil salinity the proportion of fruit biomass increased and fruit water content decreased at the third stage fig 6 in addition the proportion of fruit biomass exceeded 0 95 therefore changes in dry matter distribution have less effect at third stage d 3 in eq 6 was also set as 1 the other parameters are shown in table 6 the γ 2 and γ 3 of eq 6 were 0 810 and 0 367 respectively suggesting that yield was more sensitive to the decrease of dry matter accumulation at the second growth stage eq 6 was verified with the data of 2019 season there was a good agreement r2 0 91 between the measured relative values of yield and simulated by eq 6 fig 7 3 2 2 calibration and validation of parameter in the functional relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and pre dawn stem water potential using the data in 2018 and 2019 seasons eq 8 and eq 10 were calibrated the parameters are shown in table 6 the absolute value of ψ s 50 at stage iii was higher than that at stage ii indicating that dry matter accumulation at stage iii had stronger resistance to water deficit both ec et i and δ of eq 10 at stage iii were less than those at stage ii the results showed that soil salinity was lower when the interaction of soil salinity and water deficit on dry matter accumulation changed from antagonistic to synergistic at stage iii but the special effect of salt stress on dry matter accumulation was less the applicability of eq 8 and eq 10 was verified with the data of 2019 season respectively fig 8 compared to eq 8 r 2 of eq 10 increased by 11 76 and 7 87 at the second and third stages respectively eq 10 can better explain the change of relative dry matter accumulation during growth stage rsme and aae of eq 10 were lower than those of eq 8 and ef and dia improved the simulation accuracy of relative dry matter accumulation was improved by adding ion influence coefficient taking stem water potential as input dry matter accumulation could be well simulated by eq 10 under combined water deficit and soil salinity 3 3 parameter calibration and validation of equations of pre dawn stem water potential soil water content and electrical conductivity since there were more water treatments eq 12 and eq 13 were calibrated using the data of 2020 season without considering the influence of salinity r2 was 0 96 when the stem water potential was simulated by eq 12 fig 9 all the measured data in 2018 2018 19 and 2019 seasons were used to verification fig 10 shows the comparisons between measured ψ s and simulated ones obtained from eq 13 the value of r2 was 0 92 indicating that the simulated values were close to the measured values and the majority of the variation in the measured values were explained by eq 13 the rmse and aae were 0 032 and 0 024 respectively and ef and dia are close to 1 these results indicated that eq 13 could accurately predict ψ s of plants by θ and ec e under combined water and salt stress 3 4 comparison of the new model with the traditional model model i and model ii were calibrated using the data of 2018 and 2018 19 seasons when calculating the parameters of model i the water sensitivity coefficient of each growth period was obtained according to et and relative yield under water deficit treatment and then the salt sensitivity parameter was calibrated according to the data under water and salt stress the parameters of model ii were calculated by the measured et and relative yield under water and salt stress the water sensitivity coefficients of the second and third stages of model i were 0 951 and 0 386 respectively and the water sensitivity coefficients of the second and third stages of model ii were 1 052 and 0 581 respectively thus water sensitivity coefficient of stage ii was greater than that of stage iii the new model was obtained by combining eqs 6 10 and 13 and the average value of θ and ec e in the rhizosphere during growth stage were used as inputs to simulate the relative yield the measured relative yield and the relative yield predicted by the three models during the 2019 season fig 11 showed that compared with model i and model ii r2 of the new model improved by 5 81 and 10 98 respectively for new model the r2 was 0 91 ef was 0 89 dia was 0 98 and rmse and aee were less than 0 1 indicating a fairly good agreement between the simulated values with the measured data the new model performed much better than model i and model ii 4 discussion 4 1 effects of stem water potential on physiological parameters when the pre dawn stem water potential is used as an indicator to reflect the effects of combined soil salinity and water deficit stress on plants it is equivalent to only consider the effects of osmotic stress caused by soil salinity ion accumulation under salt stress has important effects on cell homeostasis metabolism and enzymatic activity so the effect of ion accumulation cannot be ignored zhu 2016 this might be the main reason for the difference in relative leaf water content leaf cell turgor photosynthesis stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis when the stem water potential was the same under different soil salinity munns et al 1995 reported that the salt specific effect in the presence of salt stress are related to the accumulation of ions in plants and na causes ion toxicity when it is above a threshold concentration in the cytoplasm below ion toxicity levels it mainly resulted in osmotic stress similar to water stress munns 2002 inorganic ions are also the main inorganic osmoregulation substance and the accumulation of inorganic ions plays an important role in resisting osmotic stress gharbi et al 2017 li et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 under salt stress some plants prevent na in the cytoplasm from reaching toxic concentrations by na exclusion from leaf blades or sequestering it in vacuoles munns and tester 2008 and the accumulation of na ions under osmotic stress is beneficial to the maintenance of cell turgor and stomatal conductance the results of this study showed that for low stem water potential soil salinity could increase the turgor pressure of tomato leaf cells and mild soil salinity was also beneficial to maintain stomatal conductance fig 3 in the absence of ion toxicity soil salinity was beneficial to maintain leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate under osmotic stress when ion toxicity occurs na influences p n by disrupting the proton motive force and chloroplast function and by interfering with co2 fixing enzymes van zelm et al 2020 in the presence of ion toxicity although na accumulation still had a positive effect on maintaining stomatal conductance ion toxicity might have a greater reduction on p n finally under the same pre dawn stem water potential the p n under the soil salinity treatment was lower than that under s0 fig 3 4 2 new model based on pre dawn stem water potential tomato yield and seasonal et are reported to be linearly ben gal et al 2003 chen et al 2014 kuscu et al 2014 as well as nonlinearly yang et al 2020 related under soil salinity and water deficit in accordance with well documented theory dewit 1958 the ratio of transpiration to potential transpiration is used as an estimate of relative dry matter yield the plant growth is directly affected by et and plant growth is also a determinant of final yield therefore predicting yield by dry matter accumulation is undoubtedly more reliable than predicting yield by et patane et al 2011 showed that the correlation r2 0 74 between et and yield was significantly lower than the correlation r2 0 98 between total dry matter accumulation and yield when water deficit was carried out throughout the growth period since eq 7 was proposed it has been continuously developed and improved to better adapt to comprehensive abiotic stresses suarez and simunek 1996 van genuchten 1987 however the interaction of water stress and salt stress as well as effect of ion accumulation have not been considered ors suarez 2017 showed that when using eq 7 to predict the yield of spinach under combined water stress and salt stress the predicted value was significantly higher than the measured value indicating that it is necessary to consider the interaction between water stress and salt stress as well as ion toxicity the changes of plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s combined the effects of water deficit and soil salinity so the response of ψ s contained the interaction effect to a certain extent the effect of ion accumulation on dry matter accumulation was considered as fully as possible the effect of ion accumulation on photosynthesis has been discussed in 4 1 in addition to affecting photosynthesis ion accumulation also has an important impact on the distribution of photosynthetic products amthor 2000 vanderwerf et al 1988 during osmotic adjustment the synthesis of organic solutes and the absorption of inorganic ions both consume the energy harvested by photosynthesis and thus reduce the energy available for dry matter accumulation munns and gilliham 2015 if the osmotic adjustment relies only on the accumulation of organic solutes the energy harvested by photosynthesis may be completely consumed munns et al 2020 therefore the accumulation of ions also has a favorable effect on the accumulation of dry matter under osmotic stress when we quantify the effect of ion accumulation on dry matter we divide it into two aspects favorable effect and unfavorable effect expressed as eq 9 4 3 model applicability at present soil salinity content is mainly expressed by ec e in order to facilitate the popularization and application of the model we established a quantitative relationship eq 13 between soil water content and ec e mcintyre 1980 reported that electrical conductivity and osmotic potential of soil saturation extract were linearly correlated ec e only represents the salinity content of the soil and the effect of ec e on the stem water potential is also related to the soil water content this may also be the reason for the significant interaction between water deficit and soil salinity on ψ s the parameters in eq 13 will vary greatly due to different soil textures the residual water content of sand and clay are 0 04 and 0 095 cm3 cm3 respectively chen et al 2022 and θ r is closely related to the residual water content in addition the value of ec e t i depends on the ability of the plant to sequester the absorbed toxic ions into the vacuole which is closely related to the plant s salt tolerance bassil and blumwald 2014 showed application of atnhx1 na h antiporter 1 proteins to improve salt compartmentation in the vacuoles of tomato vegetative tissue which improved salt tolerance of tomato 5 conclusion in this study the responses of main physiological parameters of tomato to pre dawn stem water potential under different soil salinity were analyzed afterwards a new crop water salt production function was established to predict yield with inputs θ and ec e via pre dawn stem water potential as a medium mild soil salt stress can enhance the ability of plants to maintain stomatal conductance and cell turgor pressure under water deficit and maintain higher photosynthesis of plants under certain water deficit overall when the soil salinity in the reproductive stage was lower than 1 431 ds m 1 the soil salinity alleviated the decrease of osmotic stress on dry matter accumulation and conversely enhanced the effect of osmotic stress at the mature stage the soil salinity threshold is 1 3 ds m 1 the new model improves the simulation accuracy of tomato yield under combined water deficit and salt stress by considering the interaction between water stress and salt stress as well as ion toxicity in addition the new model has a strong mechanism basis and the input data is easy to obtain which is conducive to popularization and application there is no doubt that future experiments are still

9093,prediction of crop yield under water and salt stress is essential for guiding deficit irrigation in saline soil the responses of tomato plants to water and salt stress and their interactions have profound effect on yield traditional crop water salt production functions do not fully account for the physiological response of plants to all stresses especially the response to the interaction of soil salinity and water deficit we developed a static crop water and salt production function based on the traditional water and salt production function combined with the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity and the specific effects of soil salinity based on a statistical model this research involves measurement of plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s osmotic potential ψ π leaf turgor ψ p relative leaf water content rwc net photosynthesis p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration t r and the responses of these physiological parameters to four water deficit treatments or four salt salinity treatments as well as combined water deficit and soil salinity the correlation analysis of physiological parameters showed that the pre dawn stem water potential of plant was closely correlated with ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s and t r the variations of physiological parameters with plant stem water potential were different under different soil salinity levels we used the pre dawn plant stem water potential as a unified indicator to characterize water deficit soil salinity and combined water deficit and soil salinity when predicting yield by stem water potential we quantified the difference between the responses of the physiological parameters to the reduction of pre dawn stem water potential under salt stress combined water deficit and soil salinity and that under water stress to improve the applicability of the function we established quantitative relationships between soil volumetric water content conductivity of saturated extract and predawn stem water potential finally we established a new crop water salt production function that takes the rhizosphere soil water content and electrical conductivity as the input and considers the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity and the effect of ion accumulation compared with other crop water salt production function models the new model has higher simulation accuracy and easier data acquisition which is conducive to application in greenhouse crop water and salt management keywords water deficit soil salinity pre dawn stem water potential physiological response crop water salt production function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the implementation of water savings in arid and semi arid areas is of great significance to alleviate water shortage for sustainable agricultural development huang et al 2020 arid and semi arid regions often have soil salinization problems water deficit may not lead to further yield reductions of crops grown in salinized soils maggio et al 2004 the yield of crops is mainly related to the physiological response of plants to abiotic stresses therefore research of crop yield simulation based on physiological responses under the combined water deficit and soil salinity has important practical significance for establishing a reasonable water saving irrigation regime in salinized soils traditional water and salt production functions are mainly done by correcting evapotranspiration or increasing the salt stress coefficient based on the water production function allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2007 wang and kang 2004 physiological and metabolic responses of crops to combined stress are not a simple superposition of only two effects but involve complex interactions schafer and piggott 2018 zandalinas et al 2021 the crop water salt production function established by the two methods is insufficient because the interaction of the two stresses as well as ion toxicity are not considered to develop the crop water salt production function based on available studies the simulation process has to take more into account the interaction between water deficit and soil salinity as well as the effect of ion accumulation it has been suggested that both water stress and salt stress mainly cause osmotic stress by reducing soil water potential maathuis 2014 borawska jarmulowicz 2017 chaves et al 2009 reported that the initial response of plants to water stress and salt stress were both triggered by osmotic stress signals the most direct effect of osmotic stress on the plant is to prevent water uptake by the plant leading to a reduction in plant water potential borawska jarmulowicz et al 2017 maathuis 2014 the interaction of water deficit and soil salinity has been implied by the changes in plant stem water potential under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity plant pre dawn stem water potential can be used as a unified indicator to characterize water stress salt stress and combined stress in addition the change in plant stem water potential is also a reflection of the change in soil water potential ameglio et al 1999 plant stem water potential is an important medium for linking soil water content soil salinity and plant physiological response photosynthesis is one of the most important physiological processes in plants and 90 of the plant biomass comes from photosynthesis steduto et al 2000 taïbi et al 2016 the decrease of net photosynthetic rate under mild osmotic stress is mainly due to stomatal restriction chaves et al 2009 lawlor and tezara 2009 and stomatal conductance is significantly affected by leaf relative water content rwc and water potential evans 2013 xue et al 2021 in addition to photosynthetic rate leaf area is also an important indicator to determine the total photosynthetic products of plants during leaf growth cell expansion plays a decisive role in the final leaf area renaudin et al 2017 cell turgor pressure is the main driving force of cell expansion and leaf cell expansion is very sensitive to turgor pressure bouchabke et al 2006 haas et al 2020 water stress and salt stress can reduce the cell turgor of plant arif et al 2020 mitchell et al 2008 navada et al 2020 moreover cell turgor pressure greatly affects the physiological and biochemical processes of leaves katerji et al 2011 katuwal et al 2020 patade et al 2012 rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 reported most stomatal closure in woody species under moderate drought could be explained by stomatal responses to changes in leaf cell turgor caused by changes in either soil water potential hydraulic conductance or osmotic pressure in addition to osmotic stress the effects of ion accumulation on plants under soil salinity cannot be ignored patade et al 2012 shabala and munns 2017 with the increase of soil salinity the non stomatal restriction gradually increased pan et al 2021 the progressive accumulation of ions in photosynthetically active mesophyll tissues leads to further inhibition of co2 assimilation borbely et al 2020 mehta et al 2010 munns et al 2006 the accumulation of large amounts of ions in the plant can lead to ion toxicity zhu 2016 in addition the enhancement of osmotic adjustment by ion accumulation would have a beneficial effect on plant resistance to osmotic stress under osmotic stress conditions plants osmotic adjustment is an important mechanism for plants to resist water stress and salt stress blum 2017 chen and jiang 2010 hessini et al 2009 osmotic adjustment can help plants maintain water uptake and cell turgor pressure by accumulating inorganic ions and compatible solutes hessini et al 2009 puniran hartley et al 2014 mejri et al 2016 showed that wild barley tolerated drought better than cultivated barley due to stronger osmotic adjustment katuwal et al 2020 showed that osmotic adjustment of plants under iso osmotic salt stress was stronger compared to that under osmotic stress the accumulation of dry matter can reflect the final effect of water stress salt stress as well as combined water stress and salt stress on plants which already includes the resistance of plants to stress the effects of osmotic stress and ion accumulation on plant physiological parameters respectively have been recognized however the role of ion accumulation in the effect of osmotic stress on plant physiological parameters under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity needs to be further determined tomato is a moderately salt tolerant plant that can withstand moderate salt stress and yield decreased with the increasing stress after exceeding the tolerance threshold value yang et al 2019 borbely et al 2020 the effect of water deficit on tomato yield is related to stress intensity stress duration and stress occurrence period and mild water stress does not result in reduced yields chen et al 2014 negrao et al 2017 the response of tomato yield and physiological parameters to different degrees of combined water stress and salt stress is still not well understood the main purposes of this study were to 1 explore the interaction of water deficit and soil salinity on physiological parameters of tomato and the relationship between stem water potential and other physiological parameters related to yield formation under combined water deficit and soil salinity 2 establishment of quantitative relationship between soil volumetric water content electrical conductivity and plant pre dawn stem water potential 3 propose a novel crop water salt production function based on physiological response and evaluate its performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials four experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station

deep was separated from the surrounding soil by impermeable film the soil in the growing plot was sandy loam with the ph between 6 8 and 7 6 which was backfilled after air dried crushed and sieved the fertilizers with 200 mg kg 1 soil n ch4n2o 400 mg kg 1 soil p ca h2po4 and 50 mg kg 1 soil k kh2po4 were mixed homogeneously with soil before the soil was re filled into the growing plot the average soil dry bulk density was 1 47 g cm3 and the field capacity θ f were 0 27 cm3 cm3 within the planned depth of wetted soil layer 40 cm field capacity is traditionally measured through a grab sample of known volume that is fully wetted and then allowed to sit under free drainage for two to three days after free drainage has ceased the water content of the sample is computed bajwa et al 2017 embrapa 1997 marques teixeira et al 2022 2 2 treatments the experiment was set up according to a completely randomized design with two replications salt treatment was achieved by homogeneously adding mixed salt to soil before the soil was filled into the growing plot four soil salinity treatments created were s0 no salt added mild soil salinity s3 salt was added to the soil at 3 g kg dry soil moderate soil salinity s5 salt was added to the soil at 5 g kg dry soil and severe soil salinity s7 salt was added to the soil at 7 g kg dry soil and corresponded to soil saturation extract mass ratio of soil

cl 15 91 5 06 so2 54 39 5 07 the soil in each plot was covered with plastic mulch and plants were irrigated with drippers placed under the mulch three levels of irrigation full irrigation w0 95 of θ f as the upper limit 80 of θ f as the upper limit w1 and 60 of θ f as the upper limit w3 were applied with four soil salinity regimes during 2018 and 2019 seasons 70 of θ f as the upper limit w2 and 50 of θ f as the upper limit w4 were additionally applied with four soil salinity regimes during 2018 19 season w1 w2 and w3 were finally applied with four soil salinity regimes during 2020 season the start time of irrigation was the same for all treatments irrigation was initiated for all treatments once average volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer 0 40 cm of full irrigation treatment dropped to around 75 2 ofθ f the amount of irrigation for each treatment was determined by the difference between the soil water content at the start of irrigation and the set upper limit water content two growing plots were randomly selected for each treatment and each growing plot contained 12 tomato plants for a total of 24 tomato plants per treatment physiological parameters and yield were measured at the individual plant scale the entire growth period of tomato was divided into three stages i e seedling stage i from planting to flowering reproductive stage ii from flowering to first fruit maturity and mature stage iii from first fruit maturity to all fruits harvested water deficits occurred during reproductive growth stage and mature stage in 2018 2018 19 and 2019 seasons respectively and only occurred during the reproductive growth period in 2020 treatments of water deficit at stage ii was fully irrigated at stage iii details of growth periods and water treatments are shown in table 2 the amount of irrigation and the number of irrigation times at different growth stages are listed in table 3 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture content and electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract in rhizosphere most of the tomato roots were distributed in 0 40 cm soil layer machado and oliveira 2003 wang et al 2021 volumetric soil water content θ was continuously monitored using 5te sensors meter inc usa buried in the root zone at 10 20 30 40 cm below the soil surface the soil water content monitored continuously was mainly used to determine the irrigation time the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ec e was measured by a conductivity meter fg30 fivego mettler toledo inc soil samples collected at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the soil surface using soil auger before and after irrigation were used to determine water content and ec e of the root zone our previous results showed that irrigation kept the average soil saturated leachate electrical conductivity of the root zone soil layer in a stable dynamic variation zhang et al 2022 we characterized the salinity of the soil as the mean of the measured values of all irrigation cycles after the average soil saturated leachate conductivity of the root zone soil layer was in a stable dynamic variation 2 3 2 plant physiological parameters pre dawn stem water potential ψ s was measured by a skpm 1400 pressure chamber skye instruments ltd uk between 4 a m and 6 a m leaves close to the tomato trusses were wrapped with aluminum bags for 10 min before each measurement thomas et al 2006 the leaves were frozen with liquid nitrogen after water potential determination the osmotic potential of sap expressed from freeze thawed leaf was determined using a vapor pressure osmometer vapro5600 wescor inc pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential were measured in three irrigation cycles at reproductive and mature stage respectively and each irrigation cycle was measured 3 times at 1 day 3 days and 5 days after irrigation turgor potential was calculated as the difference between pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential hsiao 1973 photosynthesis rate p n µmol m 2 s 1 transpiration rate t r mmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance g s mol m 2 s 1 were determined on fully expanded upper leaves with three replications in each treatment using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor corporation usa p n t r and g s were measured on the same date as the pre dawn stem water potential and osmotic potential each measurement was made between 9 am and 11 am five samples were measured for each treatment the relative water content of leaf was obtained by 1 rwc fw l dw l tw l dw l where fw l is leaf fresh weight dw l is leaf dry weight tw l is leaf turgid weight obtained by placing the leaf samples in vials filled with distilled water for 24 h and then removing surface water from the leaf and weighing them 2 3 3 evapotranspiration dry matter accumulation and yield the actual evapotranspiration et for each treatment was calculated according to the water balance equation as follows 2 et p i w d r sw where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm w is groundwater recharge mm d is deep percolation mm r is surface runoff mm sw is the change in soil water storage mm p is zero inside greenhouse the growing plot is separated from the surrounding soil by polyethylene film so w d and r are zero in summary eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 et i sw the dry matter was determined at the end of seedling reproductive and maturity and dry matter accumulation dma during reproductive and fruit ripening was calculated three samples were selected for each treatment for dry matter determination for the determination of yield we selected a total of 5 tomato samples from the two planting plots of each treatment fresh weight of fruit was recorded by electronic balance me2002e mettler toledo usa with accuracy of 0 01 g 2 4 traditional crop water salt production function the commonly used crop water salt production function models were mainly based on jensen 1968 and stewart model stewart et al 1977 this section mainly introduces two commonly used models the model i was developed on the basis of jensen model wang and kang 2004 4 y a y m ec emax ec e ec emax ec emin β i 1 n et ai et mi λ i where y m is the crop yield of no stress treatments y a is the crop yield under stress et mi is e t at the growth stage i of no stress treatment et ai is actual et at the growth stage i under water stress λ i is jensen s water deficit sensitivity parameter of crop yield for the growth stage i n is the number of growth stages ec emax is the limiting value of plant salt tolerance when the ec e is greater than this value the crop yield is zero ec e min is critical value of plant salt tolerance if the ec e is less than the threshold value crop yields will not be affected by salinity ec e is actual ec of soil saturation extract β is salt sensitivity parameter of crop yield λ i and β were estimated by the least squares method it is difficult to obtain exact values of ec emax and ec e min ec emax and ec e min were set as 3 80 ds m 1 and 0 85 ds m 1 respectively based on the measured data the model ii was developed on the basis of stewart model allen et al 1998 5 y a y m i 1 n 1 k yi 1 et awsi et m i where k yi is the crop yield response factor et awsi is actual et at the growth stage i under different combined water stress and salt stress k yi was estimated by the least squares method 2 5 proposed new model based on stem water potential staged dry matter accumulation is more closely associated with yield than et therefore we first referred to the structure of jensen model to establish the relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and relative yield combined with the actual situation a correction coefficient was used to deal with the change of dry matter distribution under water deficit soil salinity as well as combined water deficit and soil salinity in the second step a function between soil water potential represented by pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation was established considering the effect of ion accumulation an equation was established that could be used to calculate pre dawn stem water potential using θ and ec e finally the new model can predict relative yield using θ and ec e the model simulation process is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 quantitative relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and relative yield referring to structure of the jensen model the equation between dry matter accumulation and relative yield was determined as 6 y a y m i 1 n d i dma a i dma mi γ i where dma mi is dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i for no stress treatment dma ai is actual dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i d i is the coefficient that is used to correct for the effect of changes in dry matter distribution at the growth stage i d i was estimated from the measured data γ i is the sensitivity coefficient of yield to dma at stage i and n is the number of growth stages γ i was estimated by the least squares method 2 5 2 quantitative relationship between pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation the following equation is developed for predicting plant response to water stress and salt stress as additive van genuchten and hoffman 1984 in this equation response is related to the combined matric and osmotic potential as follows 7 α s 1 1 h h 50 b where α s is the dimensionless stress response function h is the sum of osmotic and matric stress h 50 is the value of h at which there is a 50 reduction in yeild and b is empirical fitting parameter both water deficit and soil salinity initially affect the plant by inhibiting water uptake compared to soil matric potential and osmotic potential pre dawn stem water potential ψ s more directly reflects the water status of the plant in addition the relative dry matter accumulation of plants under stress can reflect the influence of stress on plants in accordance with this equation we established the quantitative relationship between pre dawn stem water potential and relative dry matter accumulation dma during the growth stage eq 7 could be rewritten as 8 dma ai dma mi 1 1 ψ s ψ s 50 i b where ψ s is pre dawn stem water potential under the combined effect of water deficit and soil salinity and the value of ψ s is mean value of pre dawn stem water potential during the growth stage ψ s 50 is the value of ψ s at which there is a 50 reduction in yield b is the shape parameter ψ s 50 and b are estimated by the least squares method obviously this equation does not consider the effects caused by ion accumulation in plants under salt stress we quantified the effect of ions by comparing the response of plant physiological parameters to osmotic stress under different soil salinity for each soil salinity we collected stem water potential and other physiological parameters ψ p rwc p n g s and t r for the four water treatments at three time points during a single irrigation cycle we compared the response of other physiological parameters under different soil salinities relative to the reduction in stem water potential caused by the reduction in soil water content based on the differences in the response of other physiological parameters of the plant to the reduction in stem water potential under different soil salinities fig 2 we determined the equation for the ionic influence coefficient as follow 9 o si 1 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 ec e t i ec e ec e ec e 0 δ i where o si is ion influence coefficient at the growth stage i ec e 0 is the value of ec e without salt pressure and the value of ec e 0 is 0 45 ds m 1 ec e t i is the threshold at the growth stage i when ec e is greater than the threshold value ion accumulation will have a negative effect on dry matter accumulation of growth stage i δ i is coefficient of influence of ion accumulation on dry matter accumulation at the growth stage i ec e t i and δ i are estimated by the least squares method finally the quantitative relationship between ψ s and relative dry matter accumulation was 10 dma ai dma mi 1 1 ψ s ψ s 50 i b i 1 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 ec eti ec e ec e ec e 0 δ i 2 5 3 quantitative relationship between soil water content electrical conductivity of rhizosphere and pre dawn stem water potential soil water content and salt content are two main factors influencing pre dawn stem water potential ψ s the pre dawn stem water potential of the plant depends mainly on the soil water potential when the effect of soil salinity is not considered the soil water potential is equivalent to the soil substrate potential determined by the soil water content the quantitative relationship between soil matrix potential and water content is represented by the soil water characteristic curve the brooks and corey model brooks and corey 1964 is one of the commonly used water characteristic curve models the equation is as follows 11 θ θ r θ s θ r φ h σ where θ s is saturated water content θ r is wilting coefficient θ is actual soil water content φ is the bubbling pressure σ dimensionless soil characteristic parameter parameters for eq 11 were obtained by fitting of h θ using retc 1 0 van lier 2017 table 1 shows fitted parameters for soil the soil water characteristic curve is shown in fig 2 with reference to the structure of the brooks and corey model the relationship of soil water content and pre dawn stem water potential under no salt stress is determined as 12 ψ s a θ θ r θ s θ r d where ψ s is stem water potential under single water deficit a and d are the shape parameters of the curve and are estimated by the least squares method the effect of salinity on plant stem water potential is related to salt and water contents pre dawn stem water potential is determined by θ and ec e under combined water deficit and soil salinity considering the influence of ec e the quantitative relationship between θ ec e and stem water potential is given as 13 ψ s a θ θ r θ s θ r d ec e ec e 0 c 1 θ s θ τ where c is a crop specific parameter which represents the decrease value of stem water potential caused by unit increase of ec e τ is the influence coefficient of soil water content on reducing stem water potential by ec e c and τ are estimated by the least squares method 2 6 evaluation of model performance the performance of the estimated model was evaluated by linear regression between measured and simulated values and the coefficients of determination r2 in addition the indicators of estimation errors and quality of modeling were also calculated e g the root mean square error rmse average absolute error aae the modeling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the willmott parameter of agreement dia willmott 1981 rmse characterizing the variance of the errors is calculated as 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 aae expressing the size of estimation errors is calculated as 15 aae 1 n i 1 n s i m i ef defined by the ratio of the mean square error to the variance in the measured data is calculated as follows 16 ef 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where m is the measured mean value d ia indicates the agreement between the measured and simulated values is given as follows 17 d ia 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 when d ia 1 a perfect agreement between the measured and simulated value is attained when d ia 0 there is no agreement moriasi et al 2007 2 7 statistical analyses we used the spss statistics 24 0 ibm ny usa to carry out analysis of variance and regression analysis the parameters were calibrated by fitting the data with the least squares method we investigated the significance of the difference between relative dry matter accumulation and relative fruit fresh weight by t test two way anova tukey s test was performed by year to test for the effects of salinity regime water deficit and their interaction on ψ s ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s and t r we chose five plants for each treatment and although this would have unbalanced data subclass numbers vary independently of treatment variables and the response variable is not influenced by subclass number piepho 1997 indicated that even with quite unbalanced data from a randomized complete block design an analysis of plot means is approximately valid we performed the two factor anova with reference to the method suggested by piepho et al 2022 our correlation analysis was performed mainly to show that changes in plant stem water potential were more closely associated with changes in other physiological parameters than soil water content or conductivity of soil extract pearson s product moment correlations was done between ψ s and ψ π ψ p rwc p n g s t r with plant scale data we obtained the parameters in the model by fitting the brooks and corey model with retc 1 0 3 results 3 1 response of plant physiological parameters to combined water deficit and soil salinity there were more water treatments in the 2020 experiment so the responses of plants to water stress salt stress and combined water and salt stress were mainly analyzed using measured data at the reproductive growth stage of 2020 season physiological indicators including stem water potential leaf osmotic potential leaf turgor pressure relative leaf water content net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate were significantly affected by soil salinity water deficit and their interactions table 4 there were differences in physiological parameters at the same pre dawn stem water potential due to different soil salinity the correlation coefficients r2 between plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s and osmotic potential ψ π leaf turgor ψ p relative leaf water content rwc net photosynthesis p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration t r all exceeded 0 85 indicating that ψ s was closely correlated with these physiological parameters table 5 differences in ψ s were caused by water deficit under the same soil salinity treatments when soil salinity was different there were significant differences in the distribution of physiological parameters relative to ψ s fig 3 under s3 combined soil salinity and water deficit on photosynthesis was smaller than that of single water stress there was an intersection between the fitting line of p n and ψ s under s3 and s0 the ψ s at the intersection is the critical ψ s for higher ψ s than ψ s at the intersection p n was greater under the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress than that under single water stress when ψ s was lower than that at the intersection p n under the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress was smaller than that under single water stress under s7 the combined soil salinity and water deficit stress on photosynthesis was greater than that of single water stress the effect of soil salinity on the reduction of photosynthesis caused by the reduction of ψ s was mainly related to the content of soil salinity g s was always higher under combined soil salinity and water deficit stress than that under single water stress indicating that plants growing in low salinity soil were more favorable to maintain g s when ψ s decreased the differences in transpiration rate t r and osmotic potential of the leaves ψ π under different soil salinities were small at the same pre dawn stem water potential fig 3 there was a linear correlation between turgor pressure of leaf cells ψ p and ψ s and the fitting lines of ψ p and ψ s for all soil salinity treatments were above that under s0 the reduction of stem water potential under soil salinity treatment had less effect on turgor pressure than that of s0 under all salinity treatments rwc was linearly related to water potential and rwc under combined soil salinity and water deficit stress was greater than that of single water deficit at the same ψ s 3 2 parameter calibration and validation of the new model 3 2 1 calibration and validation of parameter in the functional relationship between relative yield and relative dry matter accumulation the eq 6 was calibrated using the data of 2018 and 2018 19 seasons to obtain the sensitivity coefficient γ i at different growth stages under combined water deficit and soil salinity although the proportion of fruit biomass increased fruit water content decreased fig 4 therefore there was no significant difference between the relative dry matter accumulation and the relative increase of fruit fresh weight at the second stage fig 5 therefore the d 2 in eq 6 was set as 1 under water deficit soil salinity and combined water deficit and soil salinity the proportion of fruit biomass increased and fruit water content decreased at the third stage fig 6 in addition the proportion of fruit biomass exceeded 0 95 therefore changes in dry matter distribution have less effect at third stage d 3 in eq 6 was also set as 1 the other parameters are shown in table 6 the γ 2 and γ 3 of eq 6 were 0 810 and 0 367 respectively suggesting that yield was more sensitive to the decrease of dry matter accumulation at the second growth stage eq 6 was verified with the data of 2019 season there was a good agreement r2 0 91 between the measured relative values of yield and simulated by eq 6 fig 7 3 2 2 calibration and validation of parameter in the functional relationship between relative dry matter accumulation and pre dawn stem water potential using the data in 2018 and 2019 seasons eq 8 and eq 10 were calibrated the parameters are shown in table 6 the absolute value of ψ s 50 at stage iii was higher than that at stage ii indicating that dry matter accumulation at stage iii had stronger resistance to water deficit both ec et i and δ of eq 10 at stage iii were less than those at stage ii the results showed that soil salinity was lower when the interaction of soil salinity and water deficit on dry matter accumulation changed from antagonistic to synergistic at stage iii but the special effect of salt stress on dry matter accumulation was less the applicability of eq 8 and eq 10 was verified with the data of 2019 season respectively fig 8 compared to eq 8 r 2 of eq 10 increased by 11 76 and 7 87 at the second and third stages respectively eq 10 can better explain the change of relative dry matter accumulation during growth stage rsme and aae of eq 10 were lower than those of eq 8 and ef and dia improved the simulation accuracy of relative dry matter accumulation was improved by adding ion influence coefficient taking stem water potential as input dry matter accumulation could be well simulated by eq 10 under combined water deficit and soil salinity 3 3 parameter calibration and validation of equations of pre dawn stem water potential soil water content and electrical conductivity since there were more water treatments eq 12 and eq 13 were calibrated using the data of 2020 season without considering the influence of salinity r2 was 0 96 when the stem water potential was simulated by eq 12 fig 9 all the measured data in 2018 2018 19 and 2019 seasons were used to verification fig 10 shows the comparisons between measured ψ s and simulated ones obtained from eq 13 the value of r2 was 0 92 indicating that the simulated values were close to the measured values and the majority of the variation in the measured values were explained by eq 13 the rmse and aae were 0 032 and 0 024 respectively and ef and dia are close to 1 these results indicated that eq 13 could accurately predict ψ s of plants by θ and ec e under combined water and salt stress 3 4 comparison of the new model with the traditional model model i and model ii were calibrated using the data of 2018 and 2018 19 seasons when calculating the parameters of model i the water sensitivity coefficient of each growth period was obtained according to et and relative yield under water deficit treatment and then the salt sensitivity parameter was calibrated according to the data under water and salt stress the parameters of model ii were calculated by the measured et and relative yield under water and salt stress the water sensitivity coefficients of the second and third stages of model i were 0 951 and 0 386 respectively and the water sensitivity coefficients of the second and third stages of model ii were 1 052 and 0 581 respectively thus water sensitivity coefficient of stage ii was greater than that of stage iii the new model was obtained by combining eqs 6 10 and 13 and the average value of θ and ec e in the rhizosphere during growth stage were used as inputs to simulate the relative yield the measured relative yield and the relative yield predicted by the three models during the 2019 season fig 11 showed that compared with model i and model ii r2 of the new model improved by 5 81 and 10 98 respectively for new model the r2 was 0 91 ef was 0 89 dia was 0 98 and rmse and aee were less than 0 1 indicating a fairly good agreement between the simulated values with the measured data the new model performed much better than model i and model ii 4 discussion 4 1 effects of stem water potential on physiological parameters when the pre dawn stem water potential is used as an indicator to reflect the effects of combined soil salinity and water deficit stress on plants it is equivalent to only consider the effects of osmotic stress caused by soil salinity ion accumulation under salt stress has important effects on cell homeostasis metabolism and enzymatic activity so the effect of ion accumulation cannot be ignored zhu 2016 this might be the main reason for the difference in relative leaf water content leaf cell turgor photosynthesis stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis when the stem water potential was the same under different soil salinity munns et al 1995 reported that the salt specific effect in the presence of salt stress are related to the accumulation of ions in plants and na causes ion toxicity when it is above a threshold concentration in the cytoplasm below ion toxicity levels it mainly resulted in osmotic stress similar to water stress munns 2002 inorganic ions are also the main inorganic osmoregulation substance and the accumulation of inorganic ions plays an important role in resisting osmotic stress gharbi et al 2017 li et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 under salt stress some plants prevent na in the cytoplasm from reaching toxic concentrations by na exclusion from leaf blades or sequestering it in vacuoles munns and tester 2008 and the accumulation of na ions under osmotic stress is beneficial to the maintenance of cell turgor and stomatal conductance the results of this study showed that for low stem water potential soil salinity could increase the turgor pressure of tomato leaf cells and mild soil salinity was also beneficial to maintain stomatal conductance fig 3 in the absence of ion toxicity soil salinity was beneficial to maintain leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate under osmotic stress when ion toxicity occurs na influences p n by disrupting the proton motive force and chloroplast function and by interfering with co2 fixing enzymes van zelm et al 2020 in the presence of ion toxicity although na accumulation still had a positive effect on maintaining stomatal conductance ion toxicity might have a greater reduction on p n finally under the same pre dawn stem water potential the p n under the soil salinity treatment was lower than that under s0 fig 3 4 2 new model based on pre dawn stem water potential tomato yield and seasonal et are reported to be linearly ben gal et al 2003 chen et al 2014 kuscu et al 2014 as well as nonlinearly yang et al 2020 related under soil salinity and water deficit in accordance with well documented theory dewit 1958 the ratio of transpiration to potential transpiration is used as an estimate of relative dry matter yield the plant growth is directly affected by et and plant growth is also a determinant of final yield therefore predicting yield by dry matter accumulation is undoubtedly more reliable than predicting yield by et patane et al 2011 showed that the correlation r2 0 74 between et and yield was significantly lower than the correlation r2 0 98 between total dry matter accumulation and yield when water deficit was carried out throughout the growth period since eq 7 was proposed it has been continuously developed and improved to better adapt to comprehensive abiotic stresses suarez and simunek 1996 van genuchten 1987 however the interaction of water stress and salt stress as well as effect of ion accumulation have not been considered ors suarez 2017 showed that when using eq 7 to predict the yield of spinach under combined water stress and salt stress the predicted value was significantly higher than the measured value indicating that it is necessary to consider the interaction between water stress and salt stress as well as ion toxicity the changes of plant pre dawn stem water potential ψ s combined the effects of water deficit and soil salinity so the response of ψ s contained the interaction effect to a certain extent the effect of ion accumulation on dry matter accumulation was considered as fully as possible the effect of ion accumulation on photosynthesis has been discussed in 4 1 in addition to affecting photosynthesis ion accumulation also has an important impact on the distribution of photosynthetic products amthor 2000 vanderwerf et al 1988 during osmotic adjustment the synthesis of organic solutes and the absorption of inorganic ions both consume the energy harvested by photosynthesis and thus reduce the energy available for dry matter accumulation munns and gilliham 2015 if the osmotic adjustment relies only on the accumulation of organic solutes the energy harvested by photosynthesis may be completely consumed munns et al 2020 therefore the accumulation of ions also has a favorable effect on the accumulation of dry matter under osmotic stress when we quantify the effect of ion accumulation on dry matter we divide it into two aspects favorable effect and unfavorable effect expressed as eq 9 4 3 model applicability at present soil salinity content is mainly expressed by ec e in order to facilitate the popularization and application of the model we established a quantitative relationship eq 13 between soil water content and ec e mcintyre 1980 reported that electrical conductivity and osmotic potential of soil saturation extract were linearly correlated ec e only represents the salinity content of the soil and the effect of ec e on the stem water potential is also related to the soil water content this may also be the reason for the significant interaction between water deficit and soil salinity on ψ s the parameters in eq 13 will vary greatly due to different soil textures the residual water content of sand and clay are 0 04 and 0 095 cm3 cm3 respectively chen et al 2022 and θ r is closely related to the residual water content in addition the value of ec e t i depends on the ability of the plant to sequester the absorbed toxic ions into the vacuole which is closely related to the plant s salt tolerance bassil and blumwald 2014 showed application of atnhx1 na h antiporter 1 proteins to improve salt compartmentation in the vacuoles of tomato vegetative tissue which improved salt tolerance of tomato 5 conclusion in this study the responses of main physiological parameters of tomato to pre dawn stem water potential under different soil salinity were analyzed afterwards a new crop water salt production function was established to predict yield with inputs θ and ec e via pre dawn stem water potential as a medium mild soil salt stress can enhance the ability of plants to maintain stomatal conductance and cell turgor pressure under water deficit and maintain higher photosynthesis of plants under certain water deficit overall when the soil salinity in the reproductive stage was lower than 1 431 ds m 1 the soil salinity alleviated the decrease of osmotic stress on dry matter accumulation and conversely enhanced the effect of osmotic stress at the mature stage the soil salinity threshold is 1 3 ds m 1 the new model improves the simulation accuracy of tomato yield under combined water deficit and salt stress by considering the interaction between water stress and salt stress as well as ion toxicity in addition the new model has a strong mechanism basis and the input data is easy to obtain which is conducive to popularization and application there is no doubt that future experiments are still

shortages caused by natural disaster economic development and population growth is facing most areas in the world dolan et al 2021 it is known that agricultural water supply contributes crop product promotion and hunger alleviation hence the developing countries e g china increased food production mainly through the expansion of irrigation area and water extraction huang et al 2015 beltran peña et al 2020 presently irrigation accounts for approximately 70 of blue water resources use in the whole society worldwide fao 2016 however a disproportionate share of agricultural water use not only increases regional water shortages but also limits other industries and economic growth sustainable agricultural water utilization contributed to food supply and social development at both local and global scales beltran peña et al 2020 therefore efficient management strategies construction based on agricultural water performance revelation has long identified as an important direction in the field of water resources management cao et al 2020 foster et al 2020 the agriculture water relationship assessment based on water balance from both crop production and consumption perspectives in virtue of water footprint wf and virtual water vw methods is concerned in modern water resources conservation agricultural wf refers to the amount of water used to produce each of the crop product and measures the resources appropriation in volumes of water consumed and or polluted hoekstra et al 2011 production wf pwf is the volume of freshwater that is consumed during the crop growth process from the perspective of consumption it consumption wf cwf can be defined as the water resources occupied by human through the consumption of agricultural products the cwf is jointly determined by that from the production perspective pwf the inter regional agricultural products trade and virtual water flow vwf networks bazrafshan et al 2019 li et al 2021 normally both pwf and cwf are divided into blue green and grey water components the blue wf refers to the consumption of surface water and groundwater throughout the crop growth cycle green wf refers to the consumption of rainwater insofar in the form of field evapotranspiration and the grey wf refers to the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 water resource utilization conservation and management based on agricultural wf and crop related vwf quantification have become a research hotspot in the past two decades the research team of hoekstra quantified the green blue and grey wfs of global crop production and consumption and the international vwf in a spatially explicit way for the period 1996 2005 based on the water footprint network wfn approach mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 subsequently a number of studies focusing on crop blue green and grey wfs and vwfs at various scales including country finogenova et al 2019 deng et al 2020 river basin novoa et al 2019 d ambrosio et al 2019 region province del milagro jorrat et al 2018 irrigation district yuguda et al 2020 and field xinchun et al 2018 wu et al 2021 have been published as an evaluation index of water resources exploitation wf was linked to regional water resources and water environment sustainability in research practice pellicer martínez et al 2016 rezaei kalvani et al 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 studies have shown that reducing the wf in crop cultivation was a reliable measure to alleviate regional water shortages and promote ecological sustainability xu et al 2019 nouri et al 2019 another feasible approach was the virtual water trade strategy faramarzi et al 2010 hence scholars have evaluated the risk of global and local water shortage and proposed countermeasures under the background of inter regional vwf qu et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 it was found in the allocable blue water performance observations that blue vwf alleviates water shortages in grain import region while limits the water resources sustainability in the exporter zhao et al 2015 wang and zimmerman 2016 cai et al 2018 in fact blue water only took up a small portion of food wf making water shortages in other colors green and grey a concern for regional water performance assessment xu et al 2019 for instance schyns et al 2019 revealed green water scarcity for food feed fiber timber and bioenergy on a global scale wan et al 2016 estimated quality induced water scarcity for nitrogen related water pollution transfer under globalization porkka et al 2016 and xinchun et al 2017 defined the green blue water scarcity and agricultural water stress in crop production respectively to link field water consumption to blue green water accessibility these above mentioned studies provide new directions and references for regional water resources conservation under wf framework however blue green and grey components was rarely distinguished in water scarcity assessment resulting the sophistication of wf method could not be fully demonstrated studies have shown that the sustainability of the blue green grey wfs was probability varies in specific region shu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to conduct vwf impact assessment linking the perspectives of crop production and consumption on the basis of blue green grey water scarcity clarification as the most populous country and the fastest growing economy in our planet china holds the per capita water resources only a quarter of the world s average meanwhile water resources and crop production are highly uneven distributed spatially in this country sun et al 2016 uncertainty over water supplies in northern agricultural region has been a potential risk to china s food security and water sustainability moreover the low efficiency of fertilizer causes non point source pollution which is difficult to eliminate thus laying a hidden threaten for the sustainability of water resources and environment it is necessary to reveal the impact of crop production and consumption on water resources to serve the formulation of water resources conservation strategies the purposes of current study are to establish an analyzing framework for the impact of vwf on regional water scarcity from the perspective of blue green grey wfs quantify the inter provincial crop blue green gray vwfs of china in the year 2014 analyze the effects of vwf on agricultural wf and water scarcity in 31 provinces autonomous region and municipality pams and discuss regional agricultural water resources conservation strategies for both water quantity and quality sustainability 2 methods and data 2 1 crop related water footprint and virtual water flow the water footprint network wfn approach was used in crop wf assessment in current paper due to the need to differentiate between blue green and grey components crop related wf could be observed from the perspectives of both production and consumption regional production water footprint pwf is the sum of that for all crops 1 pwf p wf i while i is the crop variety in the calculated region crop pwf is divided into blue pwfblue green pwfgreen and grey pwfgrey components 2 pwf pwf blue pwf green pwf grey pwfblue pwfgreen and pwfgrey for crop system were estimated according to the standard computational methods set in hoekstra et al 2011 pwf blue and pwf green are the amount of field blue irrigation and green rain water consumption respectively in total cropland 3 pwf blue a et blue 4 pwf green a et green where a is crop sown area in ha et blue and et green are field evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater in mm respectively field evapotranspiration and its composition were calculated using the cropwat 8 0 model xinchun et al 2017 the pwf grey was estimated in virtue of standard method as follow hoekstra et al 2011 5 pwf grey α ar c max c net where α is the leaching runoff fraction and is assumed to be 10 according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 ar is the rate of nitrogen application to the field per hectare kg ha and c max the maximum acceptable concentration c net the concentration in natural water and was assumed to be 0 mg l hoekstra et al 2011 the regional crop related wf from the consumption perspective cwf is jointly decided by pwf and vwf 6 cwf pwf vwf vwf for specific region pam is the difference between virtual water import vwi and virtual water export vwe 7 vwf vwi vwe vwi and vwe for the specific region pam are calculated using the eqs 8 and 9 8 vwi api j n pwf j n pro j n 9 vwe ape k p wf k pro k where api j n is the amount of agricultural product import for crop j from the region n in ton pwf j n the production water footprint for crop j in the region n in m³ pro j n the total production of crop j in the region n in ton ape k the amount of total agricultural product export for crop j of the observed region in ton p wf k and pro k are the production water footprint and total product for crop k in the observed specific region hence j k i and the n ranges between 0 and 30 for the calculated province in mainland of china with 31 pams the estimation of ape and api was explained in cao et al 2021a same as pwf both of cwf and vwf in current study were divided to blue green and grey components 2 2 water scarcity evaluation for crop production and consumption water stress index is used for regional water scarcity evaluation in current study water stress index from crop production wsi and consumption cwsi perspectives are the rate of pwf and cwf in the regional agricultural water resources awr availability 10 wsi pwf awr cwsi cwf awr awr is the amount of water resources that

from rainfall 12 twr wr blue wr green assuming that all the departments industry agriculture and domestic had equal access to blue water resources the wr blue could be estimated as 13 wr blue wr awu wu where wr is the total amount of regional blue water resources in m3 wu and awu are total water use withdrawn and agricultural water use withdrawn in m3 respectively green water is only consumed in agriculture compared to industry and domestic water use hence wr green is the total amount of effective precipitation p e in arable land over the year 14 wr green 10 a p e where a is the area of

level of ecosystem services ewr is assumed to be 80 of the total potential blue water resources available here 16 ewr 80 wr blue independent blue green and grey water stress indexes from both production and consumption perspectives are constructed based on crop related wf and inter provincial vwf considering the different properties of blue green and grey wfs blue and green water stress indices from the crop production and consumption perspectives are calculated as follows 17 wsi blue pwf blue wr blue ewr cwsi blue cwf blue wr blue ewr 18 wsi green pwf green trw cwsi green cwf green trw where wsi blue and cwsi blue quantifies the blue water scarcity in agricultural system from the perspectives of crop production and consumption and wsi green and cwsi green reveals the green water scarcity in from the crop production and consumption perspectives twr is the regional total rainwater which is the arable land multiplied by precipitation over the year in a similar way the grey water scarcity in agricultural system from the crop production and consumption perspectives could be evaluated as follows 19 wsi grey p wf grey twr pwf blue p wf green cwsi grey cwf grey twr pwf blue pwf green regional water scarcity is classified as 1 2 3 4 and 5 levels and the corresponding water scarcity type is stipulated in table 1 for all aforementioned indices according to existing research experience raskin et al 1997 smakhtin et al 2004 xinchun et al 2017 2 3 data crop related wf vwf and water scarcity in 31 pams fig 1 of china in 2014 were observed and assessed in current paper with a national precipitation 622 3 mm close to multi year average 2014 is a typical year for crop water relationship assessment mwr 2014 the crops observed in this research includes grain rice wheat maize beans and tubers cotton oils oilseed rape and peanuts fruits apples bananas pears oranges grapes and watermelons and others sugar crops fiber crops tobacco and tea nbsc 2015 the meteorological data includes average maximum temperature monthly average minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine hours for blue and green pwf calculation were downloaded from the website of china meteorological data services centre http data cma cn the crop sown area and output arable land irrigation area and fertilizer application were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 2015 nbsc 2015 the water resources availability total water use agricultural water us and irrigation efficiency were obtained from china water resources bulletin 2014 mwr 2014 3 results 3 1 blue green and grey virtual water flows within china the total crop output in china reached up to 1065 1 mt in 2014 of which grain and cotton occupied the highest 55 47 and lowest 0 58 proportion respectively the amount of agricultural product related to inter provincial crop trade was estimated to 275 mt which exceeded 25 of the national production in other words more than a quarter food consumption in china was obtained through crop commutation within the country crop production inter provincial trade and vwfs within china are quantified and listed in table 2 it is demonstrated in table 2 that the amount of grain involved in crop commutation and virtual water resources flow was 106 2 mt ranking the greatest of the all crops the proportion of crop product involved in inter provincial vwf for cotton was approximately 58 and higher than other crops significantly oils production was 67 8 mt in the observed year and only 2 1 mt of which was involved in inter provincial crop vwf the trade proportion of oils in its production as a whole 3 was lower than any other crops the output and trade volume of the category others were 139 0 and 102 4 mt respectively the production and consumption of sugars fibers tobacco and tea were dislocation in china difference in the crop production trade and wf per unit product leads to the difference in the amount of blue vwfblue green vwfgreen and grey vwfgrey virtual water communications listed in table 2 national vwfgreen reached up to 165 7 gm3 which was 2 6 and 4 3 times of the vwfgrey and vwfblue respectively the relationships of the virtual water components for all of the five categories of crops were vwfgreen vwfgrey vwfblue grain was the largest contributor of vwf and follow by the fruits these two categories of crops jointly accounted 78 8 of the national crop vwf high green water proportion in crop wf for the categories fruits and others compared to grain and cotton xinchun et al 2017 may be the main reason for the vwf and its composition pattern in china agricultural blue green and grey vwf networks among 31 pams of china are mapped in the fig 2 vwf routes and networks were formed by the provincial differences in the consumption demand and production amount of the five categories crops with the population exceeded 100 m guangdong had the greatest food consumption demand reaching up to 91 5 mt in china however crop production in this province was only 46 5 mt the situation was similar in other economically advanced south eastern pams such as zhejiang shanghai and fujian these pams and the northern municipalities beijing and tianjin were the main crop virtual water importers heilongjiang was the largest crop producer and exporter in china shandong and henan held both great crop consumption demand and production contribution overall 11 provinces had production surplus crop production exceeded consumption demand and became the main virtual water exporters in the contrast there were 20 pams had consumption gaps and became crop virtual water importers from the view of sub region the southeast has the largest food demand due to the population concentration and economic development the north china plain and northeast had abundant crop production and export quantity due to the large agricultural area crop trade routes in fig 2 illustrated the different in blue green and grey virtual water exchanges caused by the variations among pwfblue pwfgreen and pwfgrey the arcs with different colors on the periphery of chord diagram represented 31 pams the strings with the single color as the chords represent the virtual water exporters and ones with multiple colors and indented ends are the virtual water importers the length of the chord reflects relative size rather than absolute value of inter provincial vwfs it is revealed in fig 2 that there were difference between vwf patterns for crop retated blue green and grey water within china all of the pams showed the relationship vwfgreen vwfgrey vwfblue except xinjiang xinjiang and heilongjiang jointly contributed integral parts of inter provincial vwfblue and vwfgrey in china specifically 47 of national vwfblue and 21 of vwfgrey was supplied by xinjiang which were 2 5 and 1 3 times that of heilongjiang another important crop and virtual water exporter the sown area and production of cotton in xinjiang accounts for 46 3 and 59 5 of the national total respectively providing textile materials for other regions is the main reason for large vwfblue and vwfgrey in xinjiang one of the driest areas in the country as the major green water resources contributors heilongjiang henan and guangxi provided additional 28 9 21 4 and 19 9 gm3 vwfgreen mainly in the form of food delivery respectively for their externals another noticeable feature was that vwf routes and nodes were complex in crop communication within china for example xinjiang supplied virtual water for 30 pams and beijing s virtual water came from 19 pams 3 2 effects of vwf on regional agricultural water footprint normally agricultural water resources appropriation from production perspective is different from that from consumption perspective in specific regional due to the spatial difference in crop category production abilities and water requirement inter provincial virtual water commutation was an important way to regulate the contradiction between food production and consumption and had visible impact on the agricultural wf overall consumption demand of primary agricultural products was higher than the domestic output in china resulting in cwf 1668 2 gm3 was more than pwf 1285 4 gm3 national blue green and grey wfs from production and consumption perspectives are estimated and listed in table 3 the calculated data indicated that the grain was the crop category that occupied the largest amount of water resources from both production and consumption perspectives grain crops contributed about 53 of pwf and 46 of cwf in china the wf proportions of fruits and oils in total were higher than that of cotton and others inter region food and virtual water exchanges cut down blue green and grey water exploitation comparing crop production to consumption perspectives to meet the crop needs of residents in other words inter regional vwf produces all sided water saving benefits within china specifically green wf was reduced by 322 0 gm3 accounting for 84 of the total water appropriation reduction however things were different for the five crop categories water resources saved through grain cotton and oils reallocation while lost in fruits commutation within the country vwf satisfied food needs for all pams and improved agricultural water use efficiency in china plentiful green water saving was significant for the maintenance of natural vegetation meanwhile the appreciable water appropriation in the form of pollution reduction was conducive to the improvement of water quality the provincial agricultural blue green and grey wfs from both production and consumption perspectives were plotted in fig 3 in addition the comparison of production and consumption wfs of the five specific crop categories were shown in fig 4 in general provincial pwf components showed a characteristic of pwfgreen pwfgrey pwfblue and so did the crop blue green and grey cwfs meanwhile all of the parameters pwf cwf and their components showed obvious spatial differences among 31 pams of china it is demonstrated in fig 3 that almost all of the pams with great pwf and cwf were concentrated in the eastern china especially the north china plain pams with few crop wfs could be found in all of the five subregions shandong and henan occupied more than 100 gm3 water resources for both agricultural products production and consumption and greater than any other pams on the contrary pwf in beijing tianjin xizang tibet qinghai and ningxia was less than 10 gm3 due to the small scale of arable land specifically cwf in shandong reached up to 170 1 gm3 with cwfgreen was the main contributor in the observed year henan and jiangsu also held a cwf exceeding 100 gm3 grain was the leading crop in china and accounted for the largest proportion in both cwf and pwf pwf in most of the pams benefited from grain and fruit crops cultivation fig 4 the grain pwf in heilongjiang shandong and henan exceeded 50 gm3 fruits pwf was as high as 48 4 gm3 in shandong and exceeded 30 gm3 in hebei and henan the contribution of the two crop categories oils and others to cwf was significantly greater than that to pwf the fact that grain had larger production water demand than consumption led to pwf cwf in the northeast pams the large consumption demand of oil crops in eastern china and the southeast pams was the main reason for cwf above pwf there the gap between cwf and pwf in specific region revealed the effects of virtual water exchange on agricultural water consumption it is demonstrated in fig 4 that cwf was lower than pwf in 8 pams including xinjiang heilongjiang neimenggu liaoning henan guangxi hainan and ningxia and the contrary was the case in the remaining 23 pams vwf reduced the agricultural water requirement effectively in most pams of the country specifically crop pwf in zhejiang guangdong and sichuan have been reduced by more than 40 gm3 of which the green water accounted for the largest proportion 70 agricultural water resources requirement in the subgegions southeast and north china plain have been reduced by 204 and 150 gm3 respectively in the calculated year on the other hand the categories others grain and oils contributed 33 30 and 25 of agricultural wf reduction respectively in the southeast pams and the others and oils in north china plain pams accounted for 68 and 22 of the regional wf reduction the plentiful grain commutation increased agricultural pwf in northeast pams by 67 8 gm3 and 44 3 gm3 of which contributed by heilongjiang water resources exploitation and water scarcity of the main crop exporters e g the northeast pams was likely to be increased in the context of inter provincial agricultural vwfs it was not quite the same for the main crop and virtual water importers such as eastern china and the southeast pams they transferred food production to other regions through importing agricultural products to save agricultural water resources it is necessary to reduce grain output in the east and increase the food self sufficiency in the southern pams appropriately so as to reduce national water use in crop production further the green water use efficiency in crop production improvement along the southeast coast of the country is also conducive to the national water resources utilization sustainability 3 3 effects of vwf on regional water scarcity vwf had obvious impact on regional agricultural water utilization which in turn changes the agricultural water stress indices normally the water scarcity may be intensified in crop exporter while relieved in the importer due to inter regional vwf effects of vwf on regional water scarcity could be quantified by the difference between the water stress indices calculated from the crop production and consumption perspectives national blue green grey water stress indices values and the corresponding water scarcity types from both crop production and consumption perspectives are shown in the fig 5 it is illustrated in fig 5 that the national cwsi was estimated to be 1 20 in 2014 indicating china was facing severe agricultural water stress from the perspective of crop products consumption severe agricultural water stress in crop consumption in the country was mainly resulted by the scarce green water resources national cwsigreen was higher than 1 0 while both cwsiblue and cwsigrey was below 0 5 water scarcity level was 5th severe water stress judging by cwsigreen however it falls into 3nd level moderate water stress according to blue and grey water receipts and disbursements in other words rain water was less sustainable than irrigation water in agricultural products consumption of china national water stress index from crop production perspective was calculated to be 0 92 in the observed year making the country facing 4th water scarcity level high water stress in crop production wsigreen wsiblue and wsigrey were calculated as 0 45 0 80 and 0 16 and the corresponding water scarcity were judged as levels 3 moderate water stress 4 high water stress and 2 low water stress respectively furthermore water scarcity of china should be classified as resource based water scarcity mainly resulted by green and blue water resources shortage from the both crop production and consumption perspectives at the national scale vwf did not change the water shortage situation completely however it had a discernable effect on all the water scarcity indices on the whole the national water scarcity eased from the severe water stress to high water stress benefiting from inter provincial crop vwf the green water stress cut down from level 5 4 and the blue and grey water scarcity indices decreased by 0 03 and 0 07 respectively vwf has an effect on alleviating national water scarcity in terms of both water quantity and water quality in china provincial water stress indices were plotted in fig 6 in order to investigate the spatial pattern for the effect of vwf on water footprint scarcity the impact of vwf on agricultural water stress varied among pams it is demonstrated in fig 6 that almost all of the provincial four water stress indices have been changed in both value and level comparing the crop consumption and production perspectives the production water stress indices in most of the studied pams happened to be less than the consumption water stress indices in other words water scarcity in agricultural system was alleviated due to the dislocation of crop cultivation and the inter provincial virtual water exchange the difference in provincial blue green and grey water stress indices changes made different contributions for regional water resources sustainability specifically the integrated and blue water scarcity indices in beijing decreased by 27 2 and 61 8 respectively jiangsu held a maximum reduction in grey water scarcity index and a sharp fall in green water stress index was found in the southeast zhejiang fujian etc and southwest xizang sichuan etc on the contrary the net increase of the integrated water stress index in xinjiang was by 1 88 in the observed year both of the blue and green water stress indices in this province increased by more than 1 00 almost all of the water stress indices in northeast pams increased in the context of vwf the water scarcity levels judged by each index in neimenggu inner mongolia increased by 1 a same situation was found in jilin where blue green and grey water scarcity was upgraded blue and integrated water scarcity levels rose by 2 in heilongjiang blue and green water scarcity in xinjiang maintained at level 4 and the grey water scarcity rose from level 1 3 beijing and tianjin reduced blue green and grey water stress indices significantly in the context of vwf even though they still faced severe water scarcity water supply potential degradation especially the green and grey water stress indices increase was the most evident in the southeast pams and the green water scarcity has generally dropped by 1 level in the southwest pams the desynchrony of provincial blue green and grey water scarcity levels changed the spatial distribution pattern of water scarcity category fig 6 pams with high cwsiblue and severe blue consumption water scarcity were mainly distributed in the eastern and northwest china the blue water stress index in the northeast pams increased making the areas with blue water stress ranged levels 3 5 expanded the regions with high or severe green water scarcity which were concentrated in the north has been shriveled significantly pams with severe consumption and production grey water scarcity were concentrated in the eastern china in summary blue green and grey water stress indices in the north has increased while have been alleviated for the south in the context of crop vwf agricultural water scarcity types varied among 31 pams due to the differences in blue green and grey water scarcity levels the water scarcity types which were mainly divided into resource based water scarcity and systematic water scarcity both resource based and environmental water scarcity for each pam with high and severe water scarcity were mapped in fig 7 most of the pams were categorized to resource based water scarcity form both crop production and consumption perspectives the resource based water scarcity in 10 pams were attributed to green water shortage guizhou was the only one province with resource based water scarcity attributed to blue water shortage the severe water stress in neimenggu and anhui was resulted by both green and blue water resources limitation the numbers of pams most of which located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river facing systematic water scarcity in crop production and consumption were 12 and 9 four provinces located in the south of the yangtze river had no water shortage problem in agricultural production but faced with water scarcity attributed green water tress from the perspective of crop consumption the situation was reversed in the provinces heilongjiang guangxi and hainan shaanxi was categorized as systematic water scarcity in product demand and mitigated into resource based water scarcity attributed to green water shortage in reality xinjiang fall into systematic water scarcity due to the abundant of grey wf in crop cultivation overall the inter provincial blue green and grey virtual water exchanges alleviated the degree and simplified the water scarcity type in china however it aggravated the water scarcity in some crop and water resources exporters the trade routes and volumes of certain crops were unreasonable making the effect of vwfs on water scarcity alleviation was discounted xinjiang which produced most of china s cotton is an example cwsiblue cwsigreen and cwsigrey were at levels 4 4 and 1 respectively in xinjiang it held resource based water scarcity and short in both blue and green water due to the low precipitation xinjiang is not fit to play the role of crop and water exporter in terms of endowments virtual water from xinjiang to beijing and tianjin with serious blue and green water stresses alleviated the water scarcity of importers effectively however many of the export routes was from xinjiang to the southern pams with lower cwsiblue it exacerbated the imbalance of water resources among regions further the excessive product export made the grey water stress in xinjiang rise by two levels even though its grey wf of crop consumption was relatively small vwf from the regions with low water scarcity to high ones was the preferred routes to reduce agricultural water exploitation and enhance water resources sustainability especially when the trade volume and its effect on water resources was acceptable 4 discussion vwf changes the original water distribution and has a significant effect on water resources in both virtual water imports and export regions sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 regional water resource sustainability in the context of virtual water exchange has been widely concerned and water scarcity with consideration of green water and virtual water was identified as the research direction of this field liu et al 2017 green water is rarely involved in industrial production and its role in regional water sustainability was often overlooked however crop cultivation depends more on green water from precipitation than on blue water from irrigation facilities cao et al 2021b in addition our results show that the values of pwfgrey and vwfgrey are likely to be both generous and cannot be ignored grey water should be involved in the impact of vwf on water resources observation blue green and grey water scarcity indexes reflect resource based and environment based water scarcity respectively the performance of regional agricultural water shortage in terms of water quantity and quality can be fully understood by comparing blue green and grey water stress indices from the perspectives of crop production and consumption the effects of vwf on resources based and environment based water shortages provide important and comprehensive information for regional water resources management therefore it is necessary to establish the evaluation framework for the impact of vwf on water resources based on the blue green and grey wfs evaluation which is also the innovation of this paper therefore it is well reasoned that the results of this paper are different from previous studies feng et al 2014 sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 2020 the results of this study showed that vwf reduced wf and water demand in crop production relieved regional water pressure and simplified water scarcity types to a certain extent in china overall pattern of vwf was constructed from north to the south water scarcity was eased in the central and southern regions and exacerbated in the northern regions the difference of agricultural water shortage between north and south china meanwhile was widening due to the inter provincial exchange of agricultural products and water resources looking into the future the land and water resources for crop cultivation and production in the northern pams is likely to be overwhelmed while food self sufficiency in the south will be degraded china is expected to face a dilemma in agricultural development especially in water resources allocation and utilization it is necessary to conduct agricultural water saving management from the perspectives of both crop production and consumption to alleviate water scarcity ensure food security in china it is necessary to improve crop yield and water productivity so as to reduce the wf for per unit agricultural product from the crop production perspective it is urgent for the northeast pams to control crop pwf especially for grain and reduce virtual water outflow especially the vwfgreen so as to alleviate the systematic water scarcity the pams located eastern plains and southeast china are needed to increase the output of oil crops and other crops to reduce the output pressure of xinjiang heilongjiang and other exporters meanwhile it is in need to tap green water resource development potential and reduce agricultural water pollution further to promote the sustainability of regional water resources pams in eastern plain of the country is supposed to increase the available agricultural water and the water resources effective utilization rate in crop planting industry to reduce wsiblue wsigreen and wsigrey indices rationally crop trade routes and vwf volumes planning through strengthen policy support and guidance is also conducive to efficient and sustainable use of water resources from the food trade and water consumption perspective therefore food self sufficiency is encouraged in regions facing high levels water scarcity and fewer crop exports should be allowed from the regions with low agricultural production skills and water availability on the other hand crop product export from the areas with high water stress to the low ones should be controlled to ensure the water scarcity in the exporters within acceptable limits to be specific the southern region should expand crop cultivation area to increase agricultural production and decrease crop import in addition reducing vwfs from xinjiang to the southern pams with low water stress and controlling the crops trade volume from xinjiang gansu and ningxia to the areas with high water stress such as hebei and shandong are beneficial to the sustainable use of regional agricultural water resources in the observed country unravelling the effects of crop vwf on regional agricultural water footprint and scarcity based on blue green and grey water exploitations distinguish provides new and comprehensive information for agricultural water management it should be noted that the wfn method is flawed and it is difficult to perform uncertainty analysis or sensitivity analysis in crop wf assessment it is vital to build a comprehensive framework for agricultural wf combing the wfn approach with the life cycle assessment lca method recommended in the iso 14046 5 conclusion in the study wf and water scarcity in 31 pams of china from the perspectives of crop production and consumption have been evaluated our findings show that inter provincial vwf reveal additional insights when green and grey wfs are taken into account vwf reduced the agricultural wfs and ease regional crop cultivation tasks appropriately blue green and grey vwf decreased national water stress indices and water scarcity types were simplified at provincial scale there were still irrationals in the vwf network water resource management from the perspectives of crop cultivation communication and consumption are in need to ensure water security from a production perspective the productivity of regional agricultural water should be improved and the development and protection of water resources are needed to ensure water quantity and quality vwf pattern needs further optimization to rationally manage crop trade routes and trade volumes regions with low water scarcity and abundant water resources are encouraged to increase food self sufficiency and crops export it is also necessary to reduce the crop transport from pams facing high water stresses to low and control trade volumes to ensure the water scarcity of exporters such as xinjiang and heilongjiang below the safety value future research directions that combine the impact of vwf in the

9094,there was presently a lack of multidimensional investigation on the impact of virtual water flow vwf on regional water use and scarcity a framework for impact analysis of vwf in consideration of blue green and grey water differentiation taking the crop water relationship estimation in 31 provinces of china as case study was established in current paper results showed that vwf which mainly

shortages caused by natural disaster economic development and population growth is facing most areas in the world dolan et al 2021 it is known that agricultural water supply contributes crop product promotion and hunger alleviation hence the developing countries e g china increased food production mainly through the expansion of irrigation area and water extraction huang et al 2015 beltran peña et al 2020 presently irrigation accounts for approximately 70 of blue water resources use in the whole society worldwide fao 2016 however a disproportionate share of agricultural water use not only increases regional water shortages but also limits other industries and economic growth sustainable agricultural water utilization contributed to food supply and social development at both local and global scales beltran peña et al 2020 therefore efficient management strategies construction based on agricultural water performance revelation has long identified as an important direction in the field of water resources management cao et al 2020 foster et al 2020 the agriculture water relationship assessment based on water balance from both crop production and consumption perspectives in virtue of water footprint wf and virtual water vw methods is concerned in modern water resources conservation agricultural wf refers to the amount of water used to produce each of the crop product and measures the resources appropriation in volumes of water consumed and or polluted hoekstra et al 2011 production wf pwf is the volume of freshwater that is consumed during the crop growth process from the perspective of consumption it consumption wf cwf can be defined as the water resources occupied by human through the consumption of agricultural products the cwf is jointly determined by that from the production perspective pwf the inter regional agricultural products trade and virtual water flow vwf networks bazrafshan et al 2019 li et al 2021 normally both pwf and cwf are divided into blue green and grey water components the blue wf refers to the consumption of surface water and groundwater throughout the crop growth cycle green wf refers to the consumption of rainwater insofar in the form of field evapotranspiration and the grey wf refers to the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 water resource utilization conservation and management based on agricultural wf and crop related vwf quantification have become a research hotspot in the past two decades the research team of hoekstra quantified the green blue and grey wfs of global crop production and consumption and the international vwf in a spatially explicit way for the period 1996 2005 based on the water footprint network wfn approach mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 subsequently a number of studies focusing on crop blue green and grey wfs and vwfs at various scales including country finogenova et al 2019 deng et al 2020 river basin novoa et al 2019 d ambrosio et al 2019 region province del milagro jorrat et al 2018 irrigation district yuguda et al 2020 and field xinchun et al 2018 wu et al 2021 have been published as an evaluation index of water resources exploitation wf was linked to regional water resources and water environment sustainability in research practice pellicer martínez et al 2016 rezaei kalvani et al 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 studies have shown that reducing the wf in crop cultivation was a reliable measure to alleviate regional water shortages and promote ecological sustainability xu et al 2019 nouri et al 2019 another feasible approach was the virtual water trade strategy faramarzi et al 2010 hence scholars have evaluated the risk of global and local water shortage and proposed countermeasures under the background of inter regional vwf qu et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 it was found in the allocable blue water performance observations that blue vwf alleviates water shortages in grain import region while limits the water resources sustainability in the exporter zhao et al 2015 wang and zimmerman 2016 cai et al 2018 in fact blue water only took up a small portion of food wf making water shortages in other colors green and grey a concern for regional water performance assessment xu et al 2019 for instance schyns et al 2019 revealed green water scarcity for food feed fiber timber and bioenergy on a global scale wan et al 2016 estimated quality induced water scarcity for nitrogen related water pollution transfer under globalization porkka et al 2016 and xinchun et al 2017 defined the green blue water scarcity and agricultural water stress in crop production respectively to link field water consumption to blue green water accessibility these above mentioned studies provide new directions and references for regional water resources conservation under wf framework however blue green and grey components was rarely distinguished in water scarcity assessment resulting the sophistication of wf method could not be fully demonstrated studies have shown that the sustainability of the blue green grey wfs was probability varies in specific region shu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to conduct vwf impact assessment linking the perspectives of crop production and consumption on the basis of blue green grey water scarcity clarification as the most populous country and the fastest growing economy in our planet china holds the per capita water resources only a quarter of the world s average meanwhile water resources and crop production are highly uneven distributed spatially in this country sun et al 2016 uncertainty over water supplies in northern agricultural region has been a potential risk to china s food security and water sustainability moreover the low efficiency of fertilizer causes non point source pollution which is difficult to eliminate thus laying a hidden threaten for the sustainability of water resources and environment it is necessary to reveal the impact of crop production and consumption on water resources to serve the formulation of water resources conservation strategies the purposes of current study are to establish an analyzing framework for the impact of vwf on regional water scarcity from the perspective of blue green grey wfs quantify the inter provincial crop blue green gray vwfs of china in the year 2014 analyze the effects of vwf on agricultural wf and water scarcity in 31 provinces autonomous region and municipality pams and discuss regional agricultural water resources conservation strategies for both water quantity and quality sustainability 2 methods and data 2 1 crop related water footprint and virtual water flow the water footprint network wfn approach was used in crop wf assessment in current paper due to the need to differentiate between blue green and grey components crop related wf could be observed from the perspectives of both production and consumption regional production water footprint pwf is the sum of that for all crops 1 pwf p wf i while i is the crop variety in the calculated region crop pwf is divided into blue pwfblue green pwfgreen and grey pwfgrey components 2 pwf pwf blue pwf green pwf grey pwfblue pwfgreen and pwfgrey for crop system were estimated according to the standard computational methods set in hoekstra et al 2011 pwf blue and pwf green are the amount of field blue irrigation and green rain water consumption respectively in total cropland 3 pwf blue a et blue 4 pwf green a et green where a is crop sown area in ha et blue and et green are field evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater in mm respectively field evapotranspiration and its composition were calculated using the cropwat 8 0 model xinchun et al 2017 the pwf grey was estimated in virtue of standard method as follow hoekstra et al 2011 5 pwf grey α ar c max c net where α is the leaching runoff fraction and is assumed to be 10 according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 ar is the rate of nitrogen application to the field per hectare kg ha and c max the maximum acceptable concentration c net the concentration in natural water and was assumed to be 0 mg l hoekstra et al 2011 the regional crop related wf from the consumption perspective cwf is jointly decided by pwf and vwf 6 cwf pwf vwf vwf for specific region pam is the difference between virtual water import vwi and virtual water export vwe 7 vwf vwi vwe vwi and vwe for the specific region pam are calculated using the eqs 8 and 9 8 vwi api j n pwf j n pro j n 9 vwe ape k p wf k pro k where api j n is the amount of agricultural product import for crop j from the region n in ton pwf j n the production water footprint for crop j in the region n in m³ pro j n the total production of crop j in the region n in ton ape k the amount of total agricultural product export for crop j of the observed region in ton p wf k and pro k are the production water footprint and total product for crop k in the observed specific region hence j k i and the n ranges between 0 and 30 for the calculated province in mainland of china with 31 pams the estimation of ape and api was explained in cao et al 2021a same as pwf both of cwf and vwf in current study were divided to blue green and grey components 2 2 water scarcity evaluation for crop production and consumption water stress index is used for regional water scarcity evaluation in current study water stress index from crop production wsi and consumption cwsi perspectives are the rate of pwf and cwf in the regional agricultural water resources awr availability 10 wsi pwf awr cwsi cwf awr awr is the amount of water resources that could be theoretically supplied for agricultural production in m3 the environmental water requirement ewr was retained from the total potential water resources twr available for agriculture to maintain water and ecology sustainability 11 awr twr ewr where twr in m3 includes blue water resources wr blue accessed in the form of irrigation water withdrawn and green water resources wr green from rainfall 12 twr wr blue wr green assuming that all the departments industry agriculture and domestic had equal access to blue water resources the wr blue could be estimated as 13 wr blue wr awu wu where wr is the total amount of regional blue water resources in m3 wu and awu are total water use withdrawn and agricultural water use withdrawn in m3 respectively green water is only consumed in agriculture compared to industry and domestic water use hence wr green is the total amount of effective precipitation p e in arable land over the year 14 wr green 10 a p e where a is the area of cropland in ha p e is effective precipitation in mm 10 is the unit conversion factor p e is calculated using the soil conservation service method developed by the u s department of agriculture döll

level of ecosystem services ewr is assumed to be 80 of the total potential blue water resources available here 16 ewr 80 wr blue independent blue green and grey water stress indexes from both production and consumption perspectives are constructed based on crop related wf and inter provincial vwf considering the different properties of blue green and grey wfs blue and green water stress indices from the crop production and consumption perspectives are calculated as follows 17 wsi blue pwf blue wr blue ewr cwsi blue cwf blue wr blue ewr 18 wsi green pwf green trw cwsi green cwf green trw where wsi blue and cwsi blue quantifies the blue water scarcity in agricultural system from the perspectives of crop production and consumption and wsi green and cwsi green reveals the green water scarcity in from the crop production and consumption perspectives twr is the regional total rainwater which is the arable land multiplied by precipitation over the year in a similar way the grey water scarcity in agricultural system from the crop production and consumption perspectives could be evaluated as follows 19 wsi grey p wf grey twr pwf blue p wf green cwsi grey cwf grey twr pwf blue pwf green regional water scarcity is classified as 1 2 3 4 and 5 levels and the corresponding water scarcity type is stipulated in table 1 for all aforementioned indices according to existing research experience raskin et al 1997 smakhtin et al 2004 xinchun et al 2017 2 3 data crop related wf vwf and water scarcity in 31 pams fig 1 of china in 2014 were observed and assessed in current paper with a national precipitation 622 3 mm close to multi year average 2014 is a typical year for crop water relationship assessment mwr 2014 the crops observed in this research includes grain rice wheat maize beans and tubers cotton oils oilseed rape and peanuts fruits apples bananas pears oranges grapes and watermelons and others sugar crops fiber crops tobacco and tea nbsc 2015 the meteorological data includes average maximum temperature monthly average minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine hours for blue and green pwf calculation were downloaded from the website of china meteorological data services centre http data cma cn the crop sown area and output arable land irrigation area and fertilizer application were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 2015 nbsc 2015 the water resources availability total water use agricultural water us and irrigation efficiency were obtained from china water resources bulletin 2014 mwr 2014 3 results 3 1 blue green and grey virtual water flows within china the total crop output in china reached up to 1065 1 mt in 2014 of which grain and cotton occupied the highest 55 47 and lowest 0 58 proportion respectively the amount of agricultural product related to inter provincial crop trade was estimated to 275 mt which exceeded 25 of the national production in other words more than a quarter food consumption in china was obtained through crop commutation within the country crop production inter provincial trade and vwfs within china are quantified and listed in table 2 it is demonstrated in table 2 that the amount of grain involved in crop commutation and virtual water resources flow was 106 2 mt ranking the greatest of the all crops the proportion of crop product involved in inter provincial vwf for cotton was approximately 58 and higher than other crops significantly oils production was 67 8 mt in the observed year and only 2 1 mt of which was involved in inter provincial crop vwf the trade proportion of oils in its production as a whole 3 was lower than any other crops the output and trade volume of the category others were 139 0 and 102 4 mt respectively the production and consumption of sugars fibers tobacco and tea were dislocation in china difference in the crop production trade and wf per unit product leads to the difference in the amount of blue vwfblue green vwfgreen and grey vwfgrey virtual water communications listed in table 2 national vwfgreen reached up to 165 7 gm3 which was 2 6 and 4 3 times of the vwfgrey and vwfblue respectively the relationships of the virtual water components for all of the five categories of crops were vwfgreen vwfgrey vwfblue grain was the largest contributor of vwf and follow by the fruits these two categories of crops jointly accounted 78 8 of the national crop vwf high green water proportion in crop wf for the categories fruits and others compared to grain and cotton xinchun et al 2017 may be the main reason for the vwf and its composition pattern in china agricultural blue green and grey vwf networks among 31 pams of china are mapped in the fig 2 vwf routes and networks were formed by the provincial differences in the consumption demand and production amount of the five categories crops with the population exceeded 100 m guangdong had the greatest food consumption demand reaching up to 91 5 mt in china however crop production in this province was only 46 5 mt the situation was similar in other economically advanced south eastern pams such as zhejiang shanghai and fujian these pams and the northern municipalities beijing and tianjin were the main crop virtual water importers heilongjiang was the largest crop producer and exporter in china shandong and henan held both great crop consumption demand and production contribution overall 11 provinces had production surplus crop production exceeded consumption demand and became the main virtual water exporters in the contrast there were 20 pams had consumption gaps and became crop virtual water importers from the view of sub region the southeast has the largest food demand due to the population concentration and economic development the north china plain and northeast had abundant crop production and export quantity due to the large agricultural area crop trade routes in fig 2 illustrated the different in blue green and grey virtual water exchanges caused by the variations among pwfblue pwfgreen and pwfgrey the arcs with different colors on the periphery of chord diagram represented 31 pams the strings with the single color as the chords represent the virtual water exporters and ones with multiple colors and indented ends are the virtual water importers the length of the chord reflects relative size rather than absolute value of inter provincial vwfs it is revealed in fig 2 that there were difference between vwf patterns for crop retated blue green and grey water within china all of the pams showed the relationship vwfgreen vwfgrey vwfblue except xinjiang xinjiang and heilongjiang jointly contributed integral parts of inter provincial vwfblue and vwfgrey in china specifically 47 of national vwfblue and 21 of vwfgrey was supplied by xinjiang which were 2 5 and 1 3 times that of heilongjiang another important crop and virtual water exporter the sown area and production of cotton in xinjiang accounts for 46 3 and 59 5 of the national total respectively providing textile materials for other regions is the main reason for large vwfblue and vwfgrey in xinjiang one of the driest areas in the country as the major green water resources contributors heilongjiang henan and guangxi provided additional 28 9 21 4 and 19 9 gm3 vwfgreen mainly in the form of food delivery respectively for their externals another noticeable feature was that vwf routes and nodes were complex in crop communication within china for example xinjiang supplied virtual water for 30 pams and beijing s virtual water came from 19 pams 3 2 effects of vwf on regional agricultural water footprint normally agricultural water resources appropriation from production perspective is different from that from consumption perspective in specific regional due to the spatial difference in crop category production abilities and water requirement inter provincial virtual water commutation was an important way to regulate the contradiction between food production and consumption and had visible impact on the agricultural wf overall consumption demand of primary agricultural products was higher than the domestic output in china resulting in cwf 1668 2 gm3 was more than pwf 1285 4 gm3 national blue green and grey wfs from production and consumption perspectives are estimated and listed in table 3 the calculated data indicated that the grain was the crop category that occupied the largest amount of water resources from both production and consumption perspectives grain crops contributed about 53 of pwf and 46 of cwf in china the wf proportions of fruits and oils in total were higher than that of cotton and others inter region food and virtual water exchanges cut down blue green and grey water exploitation comparing crop production to consumption perspectives to meet the crop needs of residents in other words inter regional vwf produces all sided water saving benefits within china specifically green wf was reduced by 322 0 gm3 accounting for 84 of the total water appropriation reduction however things were different for the five crop categories water resources saved through grain cotton and oils reallocation while lost in fruits commutation within the country vwf satisfied food needs for all pams and improved agricultural water use efficiency in china plentiful green water saving was significant for the maintenance of natural vegetation meanwhile the appreciable water appropriation in the form of pollution reduction was conducive to the improvement of water quality the provincial agricultural blue green and grey wfs from both production and consumption perspectives were plotted in fig 3 in addition the comparison of production and consumption wfs of the five specific crop categories were shown in fig 4 in general provincial pwf components showed a characteristic of pwfgreen pwfgrey pwfblue and so did the crop blue green and grey cwfs meanwhile all of the parameters pwf cwf and their components showed obvious spatial differences among 31 pams of china it is demonstrated in fig 3 that almost all of the pams with great pwf and cwf were concentrated in the eastern china especially the north china plain pams with few crop wfs could be found in all of the five subregions shandong and henan occupied more than 100 gm3 water resources for both agricultural products production and consumption and greater than any other pams on the contrary pwf in beijing tianjin xizang tibet qinghai and ningxia was less than 10 gm3 due to the small scale of arable land specifically cwf in shandong reached up to 170 1 gm3 with cwfgreen was the main contributor in the observed year henan and jiangsu also held a cwf exceeding 100 gm3 grain was the leading crop in china and accounted for the largest proportion in both cwf and pwf pwf in most of the pams benefited from grain and fruit crops cultivation fig 4 the grain pwf in heilongjiang shandong and henan exceeded 50 gm3 fruits pwf was as high as 48 4 gm3 in shandong and exceeded 30 gm3 in hebei and henan the contribution of the two crop categories oils and others to cwf was significantly greater than that to pwf the fact that grain had larger production water demand than consumption led to pwf cwf in the northeast pams the large consumption demand of oil crops in eastern china and the southeast pams was the main reason for cwf above pwf there the gap between cwf and pwf in specific region revealed the effects of virtual water exchange on agricultural water consumption it is demonstrated in fig 4 that cwf was lower than pwf in 8 pams including xinjiang heilongjiang neimenggu liaoning henan guangxi hainan and ningxia and the contrary was the case in the remaining 23 pams vwf reduced the agricultural water requirement effectively in most pams of the country specifically crop pwf in zhejiang guangdong and sichuan have been reduced by more than 40 gm3 of which the green water accounted for the largest proportion 70 agricultural water resources requirement in the subgegions southeast and north china plain have been reduced by 204 and 150 gm3 respectively in the calculated year on the other hand the categories others grain and oils contributed 33 30 and 25 of agricultural wf reduction respectively in the southeast pams and the others and oils in north china plain pams accounted for 68 and 22 of the regional wf reduction the plentiful grain commutation increased agricultural pwf in northeast pams by 67 8 gm3 and 44 3 gm3 of which contributed by heilongjiang water resources exploitation and water scarcity of the main crop exporters e g the northeast pams was likely to be increased in the context of inter provincial agricultural vwfs it was not quite the same for the main crop and virtual water importers such as eastern china and the southeast pams they transferred food production to other regions through importing agricultural products to save agricultural water resources it is necessary to reduce grain output in the east and increase the food self sufficiency in the southern pams appropriately so as to reduce national water use in crop production further the green water use efficiency in crop production improvement along the southeast coast of the country is also conducive to the national water resources utilization sustainability 3 3 effects of vwf on regional water scarcity vwf had obvious impact on regional agricultural water utilization which in turn changes the agricultural water stress indices normally the water scarcity may be intensified in crop exporter while relieved in the importer due to inter regional vwf effects of vwf on regional water scarcity could be quantified by the difference between the water stress indices calculated from the crop production and consumption perspectives national blue green grey water stress indices values and the corresponding water scarcity types from both crop production and consumption perspectives are shown in the fig 5 it is illustrated in fig 5 that the national cwsi was estimated to be 1 20 in 2014 indicating china was facing severe agricultural water stress from the perspective of crop products consumption severe agricultural water stress in crop consumption in the country was mainly resulted by the scarce green water resources national cwsigreen was higher than 1 0 while both cwsiblue and cwsigrey was below 0 5 water scarcity level was 5th severe water stress judging by cwsigreen however it falls into 3nd level moderate water stress according to blue and grey water receipts and disbursements in other words rain water was less sustainable than irrigation water in agricultural products consumption of china national water stress index from crop production perspective was calculated to be 0 92 in the observed year making the country facing 4th water scarcity level high water stress in crop production wsigreen wsiblue and wsigrey were calculated as 0 45 0 80 and 0 16 and the corresponding water scarcity were judged as levels 3 moderate water stress 4 high water stress and 2 low water stress respectively furthermore water scarcity of china should be classified as resource based water scarcity mainly resulted by green and blue water resources shortage from the both crop production and consumption perspectives at the national scale vwf did not change the water shortage situation completely however it had a discernable effect on all the water scarcity indices on the whole the national water scarcity eased from the severe water stress to high water stress benefiting from inter provincial crop vwf the green water stress cut down from level 5 4 and the blue and grey water scarcity indices decreased by 0 03 and 0 07 respectively vwf has an effect on alleviating national water scarcity in terms of both water quantity and water quality in china provincial water stress indices were plotted in fig 6 in order to investigate the spatial pattern for the effect of vwf on water footprint scarcity the impact of vwf on agricultural water stress varied among pams it is demonstrated in fig 6 that almost all of the provincial four water stress indices have been changed in both value and level comparing the crop consumption and production perspectives the production water stress indices in most of the studied pams happened to be less than the consumption water stress indices in other words water scarcity in agricultural system was alleviated due to the dislocation of crop cultivation and the inter provincial virtual water exchange the difference in provincial blue green and grey water stress indices changes made different contributions for regional water resources sustainability specifically the integrated and blue water scarcity indices in beijing decreased by 27 2 and 61 8 respectively jiangsu held a maximum reduction in grey water scarcity index and a sharp fall in green water stress index was found in the southeast zhejiang fujian etc and southwest xizang sichuan etc on the contrary the net increase of the integrated water stress index in xinjiang was by 1 88 in the observed year both of the blue and green water stress indices in this province increased by more than 1 00 almost all of the water stress indices in northeast pams increased in the context of vwf the water scarcity levels judged by each index in neimenggu inner mongolia increased by 1 a same situation was found in jilin where blue green and grey water scarcity was upgraded blue and integrated water scarcity levels rose by 2 in heilongjiang blue and green water scarcity in xinjiang maintained at level 4 and the grey water scarcity rose from level 1 3 beijing and tianjin reduced blue green and grey water stress indices significantly in the context of vwf even though they still faced severe water scarcity water supply potential degradation especially the green and grey water stress indices increase was the most evident in the southeast pams and the green water scarcity has generally dropped by 1 level in the southwest pams the desynchrony of provincial blue green and grey water scarcity levels changed the spatial distribution pattern of water scarcity category fig 6 pams with high cwsiblue and severe blue consumption water scarcity were mainly distributed in the eastern and northwest china the blue water stress index in the northeast pams increased making the areas with blue water stress ranged levels 3 5 expanded the regions with high or severe green water scarcity which were concentrated in the north has been shriveled significantly pams with severe consumption and production grey water scarcity were concentrated in the eastern china in summary blue green and grey water stress indices in the north has increased while have been alleviated for the south in the context of crop vwf agricultural water scarcity types varied among 31 pams due to the differences in blue green and grey water scarcity levels the water scarcity types which were mainly divided into resource based water scarcity and systematic water scarcity both resource based and environmental water scarcity for each pam with high and severe water scarcity were mapped in fig 7 most of the pams were categorized to resource based water scarcity form both crop production and consumption perspectives the resource based water scarcity in 10 pams were attributed to green water shortage guizhou was the only one province with resource based water scarcity attributed to blue water shortage the severe water stress in neimenggu and anhui was resulted by both green and blue water resources limitation the numbers of pams most of which located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river facing systematic water scarcity in crop production and consumption were 12 and 9 four provinces located in the south of the yangtze river had no water shortage problem in agricultural production but faced with water scarcity attributed green water tress from the perspective of crop consumption the situation was reversed in the provinces heilongjiang guangxi and hainan shaanxi was categorized as systematic water scarcity in product demand and mitigated into resource based water scarcity attributed to green water shortage in reality xinjiang fall into systematic water scarcity due to the abundant of grey wf in crop cultivation overall the inter provincial blue green and grey virtual water exchanges alleviated the degree and simplified the water scarcity type in china however it aggravated the water scarcity in some crop and water resources exporters the trade routes and volumes of certain crops were unreasonable making the effect of vwfs on water scarcity alleviation was discounted xinjiang which produced most of china s cotton is an example cwsiblue cwsigreen and cwsigrey were at levels 4 4 and 1 respectively in xinjiang it held resource based water scarcity and short in both blue and green water due to the low precipitation xinjiang is not fit to play the role of crop and water exporter in terms of endowments virtual water from xinjiang to beijing and tianjin with serious blue and green water stresses alleviated the water scarcity of importers effectively however many of the export routes was from xinjiang to the southern pams with lower cwsiblue it exacerbated the imbalance of water resources among regions further the excessive product export made the grey water stress in xinjiang rise by two levels even though its grey wf of crop consumption was relatively small vwf from the regions with low water scarcity to high ones was the preferred routes to reduce agricultural water exploitation and enhance water resources sustainability especially when the trade volume and its effect on water resources was acceptable 4 discussion vwf changes the original water distribution and has a significant effect on water resources in both virtual water imports and export regions sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 regional water resource sustainability in the context of virtual water exchange has been widely concerned and water scarcity with consideration of green water and virtual water was identified as the research direction of this field liu et al 2017 green water is rarely involved in industrial production and its role in regional water sustainability was often overlooked however crop cultivation depends more on green water from precipitation than on blue water from irrigation facilities cao et al 2021b in addition our results show that the values of pwfgrey and vwfgrey are likely to be both generous and cannot be ignored grey water should be involved in the impact of vwf on water resources observation blue green and grey water scarcity indexes reflect resource based and environment based water scarcity respectively the performance of regional agricultural water shortage in terms of water quantity and quality can be fully understood by comparing blue green and grey water stress indices from the perspectives of crop production and consumption the effects of vwf on resources based and environment based water shortages provide important and comprehensive information for regional water resources management therefore it is necessary to establish the evaluation framework for the impact of vwf on water resources based on the blue green and grey wfs evaluation which is also the innovation of this paper therefore it is well reasoned that the results of this paper are different from previous studies feng et al 2014 sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 2020 the results of this study showed that vwf reduced wf and water demand in crop production relieved regional water pressure and simplified water scarcity types to a certain extent in china overall pattern of vwf was constructed from north to the south water scarcity was eased in the central and southern regions and exacerbated in the northern regions the difference of agricultural water shortage between north and south china meanwhile was widening due to the inter provincial exchange of agricultural products and water resources looking into the future the land and water resources for crop cultivation and production in the northern pams is likely to be overwhelmed while food self sufficiency in the south will be degraded china is expected to face a dilemma in agricultural development especially in water resources allocation and utilization it is necessary to conduct agricultural water saving management from the perspectives of both crop production and consumption to alleviate water scarcity ensure food security in china it is necessary to improve crop yield and water productivity so as to reduce the wf for per unit agricultural product from the crop production perspective it is urgent for the northeast pams to control crop pwf especially for grain and reduce virtual water outflow especially the vwfgreen so as to alleviate the systematic water scarcity the pams located eastern plains and southeast china are needed to increase the output of oil crops and other crops to reduce the output pressure of xinjiang heilongjiang and other exporters meanwhile it is in need to tap green water resource development potential and reduce agricultural water pollution further to promote the sustainability of regional water resources pams in eastern plain of the country is supposed to increase the available agricultural water and the water resources effective utilization rate in crop planting industry to reduce wsiblue wsigreen and wsigrey indices rationally crop trade routes and vwf volumes planning through strengthen policy support and guidance is also conducive to efficient and sustainable use of water resources from the food trade and water consumption perspective therefore food self sufficiency is encouraged in regions facing high levels water scarcity and fewer crop exports should be allowed from the regions with low agricultural production skills and water availability on the other hand crop product export from the areas with high water stress to the low ones should be controlled to ensure the water scarcity in the exporters within acceptable limits to be specific the southern region should expand crop cultivation area to increase agricultural production and decrease crop import in addition reducing vwfs from xinjiang to the southern pams with low water stress and controlling the crops trade volume from xinjiang gansu and ningxia to the areas with high water stress such as hebei and shandong are beneficial to the sustainable use of regional agricultural water resources in the observed country unravelling the effects of crop vwf on regional agricultural water footprint and scarcity based on blue green and grey water exploitations distinguish provides new and comprehensive information for agricultural water management it should be noted that the wfn method is flawed and it is difficult to perform uncertainty analysis or sensitivity analysis in crop wf assessment it is vital to build a comprehensive framework for agricultural wf combing the wfn approach with the life cycle assessment lca method recommended in the iso 14046 5 conclusion in the study wf and water scarcity in 31 pams of china from the perspectives of crop production and consumption have been evaluated our findings show that inter provincial vwf reveal additional insights when green and grey wfs are taken into account vwf reduced the agricultural wfs and ease regional crop cultivation tasks appropriately blue green and grey vwf decreased national water stress indices and water scarcity types were simplified at provincial scale there were still irrationals in the vwf network water resource management from the perspectives of crop cultivation communication and consumption are in need to ensure water security from a production perspective the productivity of regional agricultural water should be improved and the development and protection of water resources are needed to ensure water quantity and quality vwf pattern needs further optimization to rationally manage crop trade routes and trade volumes regions with low water scarcity and abundant water resources are encouraged to increase food self sufficiency and crops export it is also necessary to reduce the crop transport from pams facing high water stresses to low and control trade volumes to ensure the water scarcity of exporters such as xinjiang and heilongjiang below the safety value future research directions that combine the impact of vwf in the environment on water resources are worthy of attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
