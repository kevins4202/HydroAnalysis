16615,free nitrous acid fna pre treatment is a promising technology demonstrated effective in improving waste activated sludge degradability and anaerobic digestion ad performance pre treatment conditions including fna concentration and treatment duration determine operational and capital cost of full scale implementation which have not been studied in long term experiments the knowledge of fna pre treatment conditions improving the ad performance is urgently required to determine suitable conditions for the technology implementation in this work five different fna concentrations 2 2 4 4 7 2 12 mgn l and nitrite only without ph adjustment and three treatment durations 8 24 and 48 h were studied in four lab scale semi continuous ad reactors for over 300 days fna pre treatment was shown under all tested conditions effective in enhancing ad performances while its effectiveness and resulted benefits varied substantially amongst different pre treatment conditions the long term experiment demonstrated that the methane production sludge reduction and digested sludge viscosity of ad are positively correlated with the fna concentration and durations until an optimal condition is reached which was identified in this work to be fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h microbial community changes supported the apparent observation of enhanced sludge degradation at elevating fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the short term sludge solubilization results were inconsistent with the long term ad performance which was potentially caused by inhibitions from stringent fna pre treatment conditions applied fna 12 mgn l with 24 hour treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 hour treatment overall results suggested fna pre treatment at the optimized condition is highly beneficial to wwtps and competitive with other pre treatment technologies e g thermal hydrolysis pre treatment this work comprehensively evaluated the key design parameters of fna pre treatment process reached a major milestone in the development and applications of fna technologies keywords anaerobic digestion free nitrous acid pre treatment sludge reduction viscosity 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtp generate a large amount of waste activated sludge was which needs to be treated before final disposal sludge stabilization by anaerobic digestion ad is commonly practiced to reduce pathogens and offensive odors inhibit reduce or eliminate the potential of sludge putrefaction metcalf et al 2013 the key of achieving these objectives is to reduce the organic fraction of the sludge i e volatile solids duan 2019 which also generate methane ch4 rich biogas due to its energy recovery potential ad process offers a unique opportunity for achieving sustainable wastewater treatment li et al 2019 therefore it has been widely applied in large wwtps for sludge stabilization and energy recovery organic matters are degraded in ad by different groups of bacteria via four main processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the efficiency of ad process is often limited by the hydrolysis rate of was was is mainly biologically generated in the activated sludge process containing mostly bacteria extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by bacteria recalcitrant organics from raw wastewater or released by bacterial decay and inorganics from raw wastewater the biodegradability of was is relatively low carrère et al 2010b and many pre treatment technologies have thus been developed to enhance the degradation wang et al 2017 including physical ultrasonic wu et al 2018b chemical ozonation alkali and fna and thermal thermal hydrolysis pre treatments carrère et al 2010b wang et al 2017 free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 pre treatment is a promising pre treatment method for improving the biodegradability of was and enhancing the subsequent anaerobic digestion performance importantly fna is a green chemical that can be produced in wwtps by partial nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor nh4 no2 and at the same time a strong bactericidal agent at parts per million ppm levels duan et al 2020 law et al 2015 it was firstly demonstrated in short term biochemical methane potential bmp tests that pre treatment of was with fna at concentrations from 1 78 to 2 13 mgn l for 24 h could substantially facilitate sludge solubilization and increase the subsequent methane production in ad by around 30 wang et al 2013 intensive short term studies were later carried out to evaluate the fna pre treatment with was szypulska et al 2021 zahedi et al 2016 2017a b 2018 where improved solubilization and digestibility of was were consistently observed after fna pre treatments the effectiveness of fna pre treatment was then investigated in semi continuous ad reactors fna pre treatment with arbitrarily chosen treatment conditions have been evaluated with was in semi continuous lab scale ad reactors fna 1 8 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 5 treatment duration 24 h wei et al 2018 and pilot scale ad reactors fna 4 9 6 1 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 0 treatment duration 24 h temperature 23 30 c meng et al 2020 volatile solids vs destruction of the experimental ads were elevated by 17 47 and the methane production increased accordingly by 16 37 other improvements in sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal were also revealed it has been proposed that fna pre treatment is effective in disintegrating eps and cell membrane chislett et al 2020 wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 which resulted in sharp increase of hydrolysis rates and methane potential vs destruction in the subsequent ad process the fna concentration and treatment duration are crucial design and operational parameters in the fna pre treatment process the fna concentration affects the cost of chemical addition operational cost while the treatment duration determines the size of the treatment tank capital infrastructure investment the influences of fna pre treatment conditions on the anaerobic digestion performance urgently require investigations which contributes to the identification of optimal pre treatment conditions for full scale implementation after successful pilot scale trial meng et al 2020 both fna concentrations and treatment duration in the range of 0 36 2 13 mgn l and 0 24 h respectively were studied in short term batch tests and found positively correlated to enhancements of was solubilization and increments of methane production ma et al 2015 wang et al 2013 although batch studies have indicated a clear relationship between the treatment conditions and the was solubilization and methane production in ad long term studies are still required to verify the real impact of treatment conditions on the ad performance in all batch studies ph was adjusted after the pre treatment to remove residual fna inhibition before entering the serum bottles for anaerobic digestion however the residual fna inhibition under different pre treatment conditions could affect the ad operation and therefore needs to be evaluated also due to the inherent limitations of batch tests it is difficult if not impossible to infer conclusions as to the corresponding effects in full scale continuous flow reactors duan et al 2019b hilton barry and oleszkiewicz jan 1988 li et al 2020 therefore effects of fna pre treatment conditions needed to be evaluated in continuous ad reactor operations in this work five different fna concentrations 2 2 4 4 7 2 12 mgn l and nitrite only without ph adjustment and three treatment durations 8 24 and 48 h were studied in four lab scale semi continuous ad reactors the performances of the ad reactors in terms of methane production and vs destruction were closely monitored to evaluate the effects of fna pretreatment the rheology dewaterability viscosity and pathogen of the digested sludge were also determined when reactors were in steady states this work aims to elucidate the effects of different fna pre treatment conditions on ad performances facilitating the identification of optimal fna pre treatment conditions for implementation 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor setup and overall experimental design four 1 3 l anaerobic digestors with working volume of 0 5 l were operated in this study the volume of pre treatment unit before the experimental reactors r2 r3 and r4 was 0 3 l each the temperature of the anaerobic digestors was maintained at 35 1 c by recirculating warm water from a water bath through the water jacket of each reactor all the reactors and pre treatment units were continuously mixed by magnetic stirrers to investigate the effects of different fna concentrations and treatment durations the long term operation of four reactors r1 as control and r2 r3 r4 as experimental reactors was divided into four phases consisting of the baseline and three experimental phases namely exp phase i exp phase ii and exp phase iii the fna treatment concentrations and treatment durations applied to the reactors during each phase are summarized in fig 1 the choice of these experimental conditions is explained in supplementary information design of experimental conditions in the baseline phase day 0 50 all four ad reactors were operated in parallel to reach similar digestion performances in exp phase i day 51 173 fna pre treatments were introduced to the was fed to r2 r3 and r4 by controlling ph at 5 and varying nitrite concentration from 100 200 to 300 mgn l fna concentration of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 temp 25 c were achieved in the fna pre treatments for r2 r3 and r4 respectively a same treatment duration of 24 h is applied for all three pre treatments the fna concentration is calculated according to anthonisen et al 1976 in phase ii day 174 282 fna pre treatment with an even higher fna concentration of 12 0 mgn l was applied for was feeding into r2 by further increasing the nitrite concentration to 500 mgn l fna pretreatment with sole nitrite addition 200 mgno2 n l without ph adjustment was applied for was fed into r3 to assess the effectiveness of low fna concentrations with the ph of was varying mostly between 6 1 6 5 the resulted fna concentration sit in between 0 14 0 36 mgn l in average 0 22 mgn l the fna pretreatment duration is fixed at 24 h for r2 r3 at the same time the treatment duration for r4 was varied to investigate the effects of treatment duration while the treatment duration was reduced from 24 h to 8 h in phase ii the fna concentration was maintained at 7 2 mgn l in phase iii day 282 317 the treatment duration was investigated further by increasing the treatment duration of was pre treatment for r4 to 48 h while the fna concentration was maintained at 7 2 mgn l 2 2 reactor operation and fna pretreatment on a daily basis 0 042 l of thickened waste activated sludge twas or pre treated twas was fed into each reactor and the same amount of digestate was discharged through a multi head peristatic pump leading to a controlled sludge retention time srt of 12 days biogas generated in each reactor was measured by a tipping bucket gas meter and exhausted to a gas bag a water trap was installed in the gas line to avoid over pressure during feed and wastage period the gas meters were calibrated monthly and swapped to minimize the measurement errors the pre treatment units in the experimental system were continuously monitored with ph meters minichem and controlled at the designated ph levels by adding 1 m hcl via pumps controlled by programmable logic controller opto 22 2 3 sludge sources experiments were carried out with twas obtained from dissolved air flotation thickener of a local biological wwtp receiving approximately 120 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater luggage point wwtp brisbane australia this wwtp operates at a srt of 15 days and performs biological nitrogen and carbon removals twas was collected every week and stored at 4 c prior to use the characteristics of the twas were analysed regularly as summarized in table 1 all ad reactors were inoculated using a sludge sample collected from a full scale wwtp anaerobic digester luggage point

raw twas were measured in triplicate at steady state of each phase microbial samples were collected for the control and experimental reactors during the steady state of each phase in three consecutive days for microbial community analysis 2 5 analytical methods ts vs and tkn analysis were performed as per standard methods apha 1998 vs destruction of the anaerobic digesters was calculated based on

biogas dewaterability tests were undertaken in triplicate according to devlin et al 2011 each sample was centrifuged for 10 min followed by the removal of supernatant a cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge was added into the remaining sludge sample and stirred until water liquid separation appears the sludge was then transferred to a belt filter fabric to be centrifuged at 3785 rpm for 10 min for further dewatering the centrifuged sludge cake was collected for solid content determination the viscosity tests were undertaken using a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with cup and four blade vane geometry of diameter 14 mm as described in meng et al 2020 during the rheology tests temperature was maintained at 25 c using a peltier control to evaluate the sludge shear viscosity constant shear rate at 250 s 1 was used the pathogen removal performances of the anaerobic digesters were evaluated by quantifying fecal coliform in the twas and digestate using the colliert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories according to the manufacturer s instruction the sludge samples were diluted 103 to 106 times to 100 ml using sterilized ro water and sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples each 100 ml diluted sample was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the quanti tray 2000 was placed into an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h after incubation the number of positive yellow wells in quanti tray sealers was counted the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform can then be obtained based on the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au the method can provide 95 confidence limits comparable to the membrane filtration method the microbial communities in all reactors during each experimental phase were evaluated with illumina amplicon sequencing the detailed method has been described in duan et al 2019a briefly the total genomic dna was extracted from the concentrated sludge samples using the fastdna kit bio 101 vista ca the community profiling was performed on the illumina miseq platform universal primer pair

python data analysis library pandas 3 results and discussions 3 1 overall performance of the anaerobic digestors methane production from anaerobic digesters is one of the most representative parameters that reflects the overall ad performance methane production from each reactor recorded daily during the long term experiments is presented in fig 2 other important parameters of ad operation including vs destruction cod removal ammonium release and vfa concentrations from each reactor during the long term experiment are summarised in table 2 in the baseline phase all four reactors performed similarly in terms of methane production as well as vs destruction ammonium release and vfa concentrations p 0 05 fig 2 table 2 the control reactor r1 had relatively consistent performance during the over 300 day period serving as an ideal control for comparisons fig 2 table 2 in addition during the whole experiment period no significant vfa accumulation e g 100 mgcod l in any reactor occurred table 2 suggesting stable digestion performances of all studied reactors the exp phase i commenced with r2 r3 and r4 receiving twas pre treated with fna for 24 h at fna concentrations of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 mg n l respectively significantly higher methane productions than that in the control reactor were observed in all three reactors with fna pre treatment the methane productions of r1 r2 r3 and r4 stabilized at 136 7 1 6 157 5 2 2 16 1 improvement 177 1 2 5 31 4 improvement and 200 2 1 9 47 7 improvement mlch4 gvsadded respectively other reactor performance parameters all agreed upon the observed improvement the measured vs destruction of r1 r2 r3 and r4 during exp phase i in average is 31 8 0 3 34 6 0 2 36 6 0 3 and 42 3 0 4 respectively the improvement of vs destruction with fna pre treatment is consistent with that of methane production the same trend of improvement was also obtained for cod removal and ammonium concentrations in the reactor table 2 both reflecting the extent of enhanced organic matter degradation the effects of two more fna concentrations and a shorter treatment duration were tested in exp phase ii pre treatment unit of r2 received a high fna concentration of 12 mg n l pre treatment unit of r3 received 200 mg no2 l no ph control while r4 started to be evaluated for the treatment duration 8 h pretreatment at the fna concentration of 7 2 mg n l similar to the previous phase fna pre treatments resulted in varying extent of improvements to ad performances r2 r3 and r4 generated methane of 177 2 2 1 145 3 2 9 and 171 9 3 3 ml ch4 g vsadded representing 38 1 12 4 and 33 6 improvements over the control reactor r1 129 0 1 4 ml ch4 g vsadded respectively table 2 obtained vs destruction performances showed comparable degree of enhancements the vs destruction for r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 31 5 0 4 39 3 0 4 36 4 0 8 and 38 3 0 3 in average respectively the extent of improvements due to different fna pre treatment conditions on methane production is also consistent with increased cod removal performance and ammonium concentrations as shown in table 2 in exp phase iii the treatment duration was further evaluated with r4 treatment duration 48 h fna concentration 7 2 mg n l as expected the overall ad performances of r4 are better than that of r1 higher methane production 195 9 3 1 vs 129 1 1 2 ml ch4 gvsadded and vs destruction 40 8 0 4 vs 31 9 0 5 were obtained consistent with observed higher cod removal and ammonium concentrations table 2 highest ammonium concentrations of 1411 1 125 6 mgn l in this study were observed in r4 high free ammonia the unionised form of ammonium concentration is inhibitory to ad particularly to the methanogenesis process liu et al 2019 however the relatively low vfa concentrations measured in the reactor 43 0 3 8 vs 46 7 6 9 mgcod l in control reactor suggested the high ammonium release unlikely inhibited ad processes moreover it should be noted that the higher ammonium and scod concentrations observed in fna assisted ad reactors than that in the control table 2 will lead to higher ammonium and cod loading to the following supernatant treatment the cod loading may increase up to 18 7 6 18 7 higher scod measured in this work and ammonium loading may increase up to 26 4 8 9 26 4 higher ammonium measured in this work 3 2 impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on overall reactor performances while fna pre treatment consistently improve the ad performance under all tested conditions the extent of improvement varied significantly with different conditions taking methane production as an exemplary indicator the fna pre treatment concentration investigated from 0 22 200 mgno2 n l with no ph control to 12 0 mgn l led to a wide range 12 4 to 47 7 of methane production improvements to the reactors fig 3 a similarly the studied treatment duration from 8 to 48 h resulted in 32 6 to 52 0 enhancement of methane production fig 1b the methane production showed a proportional elevation with increasing fna concentrations until reaching the optimal fna concentration of 7 2 mg n l the lowest methane production with fna pre treatments is obtained with the lowest fna concentration applied 0 14 0 36 mgn l in average 0 22 mgn l with 200 mg no2 n l addition representing an improvement of 12 4 2 4 the elevation of fna concentrations led to higher improvement fig 3 the optimal fna concentration 7 2 mgn l achieved a methane production improvement of 47 7 1 4 relative to r1 however further increment of fna concentration to 12 0 mgn l did not lead to better methane production performance instead lower methane production was obtained under the highest fna concentration pre treatment condition the same trend was also observed with the vs destruction performances fig 3c results indicated that vs destruction increased proportionally to the fna concentrations until reaching 7 2 mg n l the consistent observation confirmed the results and correlations obtained from methane production data it should be noted that the relatively lower methane production of r4 with fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l was unlikely caused by the consumption of cod for the denitrification of extra no2 addition 200 mgno2 n l given the observed lower vs destruction fig 3c similarly the existence of an optimal treatment duration is also confirmed the improvement of the methane production is 33 6 2 5 48 0 1 5 and 52 0 2 0 for 8 24 and 48 h respectively while the extension of treatment during from 8 to 24 h significantly improved the methane production doubling of the treatment duration from 24 to 48 h did not lead to further enhancement fig 3b observed relationship between treatment duration and methane generation is also backed by the same correlation obtained for vs destruction fig 3d overall the methane production and vs destruction of ad improve with increasing fna concentration from 0 22 2 2 4 4 to 7 2 mgn l while further increment of fna concentration to 12 0 mgn l saw a deterioration of methane production and vs destruction of ad performance the extension of fna treatment duration from 8 to 24 h experience a significant enhancement of methane production and vs destruction nevertheless doubling the duration from 24 to 48 h did not improve either methane production or vs destruction of the investigated reactor the optimal fna pretreatment condition identified in this work was fna concentration of 7 2 ph 5 no2 300 mgn l and duration of 24 h it should be noted the observation in long term reactor operation is inconsistent with previous short term batch tests previous short term test showed fna treatment continues to cause higher extent of sludge solubilization with increasing fna concentrations from 1 3 to 53 0 mgn l 24 h treatment fna treatment with durations from 1 to 5 d were also positively correlated to organic matter release szypulska et al 2021 this discrepancy and potential cause will be discussed in more details in section 3 6 3 3 digested sludge rheological behaviour the rheological behaviour of digested sludge plays a fundamentally important role in sludge management particularly in the aspects of viscosity and dewaterability the sludge viscosity impacts heavily on sludge pumping reactor mixing and mass transfer ratkovich et al 2013 high sludge viscosity normally at high solids concentrations could limit the capacity of the anaerobic digesters due to pumping or mixing difficulties high viscosity may also affect the mass transfer within the anaerobic digesters constraining the ad performances sludge disposal is often a major cost of wwtp operation expenditure the digested sludge dewaterability largely determines the final amount of sludge for disposal sludge dewatering can minimize the volume of sludge facilitate transportation and even reduce the leachate from sludge landfills cao et al 2021 thus sludge dewaterability is a crucial parameter in wwtps fna pre treatment can reduce sludge viscosity and enhance sludge dewaterability meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 the relationships between the enhancements of viscosity and dewaterability and pre treatment conditions were investigated in this long term experiment 3 3 1 viscosity fna pre treatment at all tested conditions consistently reduced sludge viscosity while the effectiveness was associated with the pre treatment condition applied fig 4 in this study the sludge viscosity decreased from 397 68 34 65 mpa s 1 untreated twas to 220 18 31 48 mpa s 1 after ad digestate of r1 for details see table s1 consistent with literatures eshtiaghi et al 2013 the fna pre treatments substantially strengthened the improvement as much lower viscosity was observed in the digested sludge of reactors receiving fna pre treatment even with the lowest fna concentration applied 0 22 mgn l 200 mgno2 n l addition 30 lower viscosity than the control was observed fig 4 increasing fna concentrations led to higher reduction of sludge viscosity until reaching the optimal concentration of 7 2 mgn l the maximal viscosity reduction 57 1 relative to the digested sludge from control was achieved under the fna pre treatment concentration of 7 2 mg n l and treatment duration of 24 h further increment of fna concentration did not resulted in more improvement similarly the extension of fna treatment duration from 8 to 24 h improved the sludge viscosity while further extension to above 24 h resulted in less significant improvement fig 4 the observed relationship between fna pre treatment condition and sludge viscosity enhancements was nearly identical to that with the methane production and sludge reduction performance fig 3 the reduction of viscosity for digested sludge can be partially attributed to the lower solids concentration due to enhanced vs destruction more importantly the similarity is underpinned by the mechanism of fna pre treatment improving sludge degradation performance and the enhancement of sludge viscosity fna pre treatment could breakdown cell membrane and extracellular polymeric substances eps in was solubilizing organic matters duan et al 2020 the solubilization and release of organic matters lead to the enhancement of was biodegradability reflected by the improved sludge reduction and methane production in the anaerobic digesters wu et al 2018a at the same time the disintegration of cells and breakdown of eps changed the inherent properties of the sludge leading to reduced viscosity meng et al 2020 the similar impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on sludge reduction and viscosity indicated a correlation of sludge reduction and viscosity enhancement after fna pre treatment 3 3 2 dewaterability the dewaterability of digested sludge from each reactor was measured at baseline and each experimental phase at steady state the dewatered solids content was compared between experimental and baseline phases to determine the impacts of fna pre treatment on sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 4c d most investigated fna pre treatment conditions saw insignificant difference after implementing fna pre treatment p 0 05 only pre treatment at fna concentration of 12 0 mgn l for 24 h significantly improved sludge dewaterability p 0 05 pre treatment duration of 8 h at fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l was also able to enhance the dewatering notably contradicting results of fna pre treatment on sludge dewaterability have been observed in different fna studies meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wei et al 2018 first reported fna pre treatment at concentration of 1 8 mgn l for 24 h before continuous ad increased the dewatered solid content of digested sludge from 12 4 0 4 to 14 1 0 4 which could be translated into a 16 17 reduction in the final sludge volume for disposal however the following fna studies in continuous reactor operation including this work only observed insignificant change of sludge dewaterability with fna pre treatment meng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the contradicting observation may be due to the iron content in the sludge shortly after the study by wei et al 2018 iron salt started to be dosed at a rate of 10 mg fe l into the upstream sewer pipeline of the local wwtp which consequently resulted in improved digested sludge dewaterability kulandaivelu et al 2020 the twas used in this study was collect from the same wwtp which is receiving iron dosage therefore contained a total fe concentration of 620 156 mg fe l it is well recognized that the addition of ferric improves sludge dewaterability the dewatered sludge solid content from the control reactor in wei et al 2018 was 12 4 0 4 significantly lower than that in zhang et al 2019 17 3 0 3 in meng et al 2020 17 5 0 5 and in this work 17 7 0 3 it is therefore likely that fna pre treatment itself could improve sludge dewaterability in addition the results further suggest that exceptionally high fna may be particularly effective in enhancing dewaterability however when combined with ferric addition the fna pre treatment cannot further enhance the sludge dewaterability 3 4 pathogen removals activated sludge is often a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms which could pose serious public health problems pathogen level in the sludge is thus a critical stabilization parameter to determine the reuse potential of the digested sludge jiang et al 2020 as a typical indicator of the pathogen level in sludge samples the biomass specific fecal coliform mpn was determined for the twas and digested sludge from all reactors under steady state of each phase and the results are summarized in fig 5 the fna pre treatment itself effectively inactivated pathogens in the raw twas fna pre treatment with fna concentration of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 mgn l and 24 h substantially reduced the pathogen levels of twas from 5 74 0 06 log mpn gts to 3 70 0 03 3 73 0 05 and 3 58 0 09 log mpn gts the nearly 2 log immediate reduction of pathogen after fna pre treatment was even more effective than the 12 day ad process control reactor r1 which produced digested sludge containing fecal coliform of 4 12 0 06 log mpn gts however the digested sludge from reactors receiving fna pre treatments did not see improvements over the control reactor in fact negative correlations of fna pre treatment conditions on the pathogen levels of digested sludge were observed with the mildest fna concentration 0 22 mgn l resulted by 200 mgno2 n l addition the pathogen level in the digested sludge 4 00 0 16 log mpn gts was comparable with that of the control reactor elevating fna concentrations resulted in higher pathogen levels the reactor receiving fna treatment with fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l 24 h experienced the highest pathogen level of 5 74 0 16 log mpn g ts in its digested sludge which was similar to the raw twas 5 74 0 06 log mpn g ts for fna pre treatment with different treatment duration the reactor receiving the mildest condition pre treatment 8 h also performed the best in pathogen removal 4 19 0 08 log mpn gts among others digested sludge with pre treatment duration of 48 h has lower pathogen level than the one with pre treatment duration of 24 h fig 5 therefore it can be noted that the pre treatment conditions leading to better sludge reduction and methane production at the same time resulted in higher pathogen levels in digested sludge apparently while fna pre treatment immediately led to 2 log reduction of pathogen the pathogen in the fna pre treated sludge regrow in all reactors receiving fna pre treatment however previous study reported contradictory results the inactivated pathogen did not regrow in the study by wei et al 2018 while did regrow in the studies by meng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2019 from the results of this work it is clear that the contradicting observation of pathogen regrowth was not due to the different fna pre treatment conditions applied in previous studies it is clear in this work that under all fna pre treatment conditions the pathogen was able to regrow in the ad reactor anaerobic digester is known to inactivate pathogen due to the vfa and ammonia generated during the ad process jiang et al 2020 however with relatively high ammonia released from the reactor receiving fna pre treatment pathogens still managed to regrow it is currently not clear what might have caused the regrowth which can be a possible line for future research 3 5 microbial community the microbial community structure was closely monitored for all the reactors along each phase to assess the impacts of different fna pre treatment conditions at steady state of each phase three samples from each anaerobic digestor on three consecutive days were taken for analysis based on the sequencing data principal component analysis pca was conducted which suggested clear shifts of microbial communities in reactors receiving fna pre treatment fig 6 a more importantly the shift tends to be correlated to the fna pre treatment conditions the top 20 abundant genera in the reactors are shown in a heat map fig 6b which represent more than 50 abundance of the total microbial communities statistical correlation analyses were also performed described in supplementary information microbial community correlation analysis to assess the associations between the microbial community shift top 20 genera and fna pre treatment conditions the microbial community results supported the apparent observation of enhanced sludge degradation at elevating fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the abundances of a large group of hydrocarbon degradation bacteria were strongly positively correlated to the fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the positive correlations of hydrocarbon degraders adurb bin120 lentimicrobium uncultured cloacimonadaceae dmer64 fastidiosipila and fna concentrations during pre treatment are in accordance with the observed sludge reductions with different fna concentrations it is likely that the increasing availability of organic matters under fna pre treatments with elevating concentrations resulted in the enrichment of hydrocarbon degraders it also showed that the fna pre treatment did not affect the abundance of methanogens methanosaeta in the family of methanosaetaceae were the most abundant methanogens in all reactors 8 followed by methanoculleus in the family of methanomicrobiaceae 1 6 suggesting that acetoclastic methanogenesis by methanosaeta was the dominant pathway followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by methanoculleus pathway for methane production in studied ad reactors berghuis et al 2019 the abundances of phosphorus removal associated bacteria comamonadaceae ca competibacter uncultured caldilineaceae were found negatively associated with fna concentrations applied during pre treatment detailed quantitative correlation analyses are presented in supplementary information microbial community correlation analysis based on pearson s product moment correlation coefficients and spearman s rank correlation coefficients 3 6 sludge solubilization and nitrite reduction after pre treatment a number of short term batch studies have evaluated fna pre treatment conditions based on the assumption that the sludge solubilization scod release could be translated into eventual enhancement of ad performance szypulska et al 2021 zahedi et al 2016 2017a b zahedi et al 2018 it was shown fna pre treatment continues to cause higher extent of sludge solubilization with increasing fna concentrations from 1 3 to 53 0 mgn l 24 h treatment fna treatment with durations from 1 to 5 days were also positively correlated to organic matter release szypulska et al 2021 in fact the scod release after fna pre treatment measured in this work is consistent with previous short term studies the scod concentration increases with elevating fna concentrations from 2 2 to 12 mgn l as well as treatment duration from 8 to 48 h as shown in fig 7 a b also nitrite addition itself 200 mgn l was effective to improve the scod release at a similar extent to fna concentration of 4 4 mgn l which agrees with a previous study that suggested acidified ph fna is not needed to enhance methane production zahedi et al 2018 however in long term reactor operation fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l led to deteriorated ad performance than fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and fna treatment duration of 48 h did not result in higher ad performance than the duration of 24 h fig 3 similarly while nitrite addition 200 mgn l resulted in significant scod release similar with acidification fna 4 4 mgn l 200 mgno2 n l ph 5 the real methane production from the long term reactor operation is significantly lower than the condition of fna concentration of 2 2 mgn l with half of the nitrite concentration 100 mgn l fig 2 3 the comparison of long term reactor performances with short term scod release showed that short term scod release are not representative to the real ad performance enhancement the discrepancy of scod release and long term reactor performance was potentially caused by inhibitions from harsh fna pre treatment conditions the residual nitrite denitrification in ad sludge was measured in batch tests and suggested potential inhibition fig 7c a significant portion of nitrite has been consumed by denitrification during fna pre treatment in all treatment conditions details shown in supplementary information the fate of nitrite during fna pre treatment upon addition to the ad sludge the residual nitrite was further denitrified in ad sludge in most conditions nitrite was quickly depleted within 30 min however nitrite reduction rates were significantly lower in the two most stringent fna pre treatment conditions tested fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment at comparable nitrite concentrations the nitrite reduction rate 0 15 min in 48 h pre treatment duration 7 2 mgn l test of 0 53 0 21 mgno2 n l gvs was significantly lower than that in 24 hour pre treatment 7 2 mgn l test of 1 08 0 23 mgno2 n l gvs or 8 hour pre treatment test of 0 90 0 23 mgno2 n l gvs at comparable substrate level fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l 24 h test showed even lower denitrification rate in 30 60 min of 0 36 0 20 mgno2 n l gvs fig 7c the comparison of nitrite reduction between different treatment durations 8 24 h vs 48 h at 7 2 mgn l fna and fna pre treatment concentrations 12 mgn l vs 7 2 mgn l at 24 hour shows the harsh pre treatment condition may have inhibited denitrification in fact sludge pre treatment reportedly produces inhibitory compounds alkaline ultrasonic sludge pretreatment lu et al 2018 electrical alkali pretreatment zhen et al 2014 and thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp devos et al 2021 wilson and novak 2009 zhang et al 2018 have all been reported to generate inhibitory organics to ad processes or subsequent post treatment supernatant treatment notably extreme pre treatment conditions e g high ph of 12 for alkaline pre treatment higher energy input of 24 kj g ts or 5 v for ultrasonic or electrical pre treatment and temperature higher than 160 c for thp are found to result in significantly more severe inhibition than mild pre treatment conditions similarly stringent pre treatment conditions applied in this work fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment might have produced inhibitory substances which inhibited the subsequent denitrification these substances likely also caused inhibition to the ad performances in the reactors which explained the discrepancy between sludge solubilization and reactor performance 3 7 implications to wastewater treatment in this work the existence of an optimal fna pre treatment condition was identified which allows maximal enhancement of methane production sludge reduction and viscosity of the studied fna pre treatment conditions in this work fna concentration of 7 2mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h brings the most benefits however the identified optimal pre treatment condition is specific to the twas samples studied fna pre treatment is essentially a chemical treatment involving complicated chemical reactions with fna and activated sludge like any chemical reaction the optimal treatment condition is related to the amount concentration and characteristics of the substrates in the sludge then the questions follow namely how to determine the optimal fna pre treatment conditions for the was at a specific wwtp the most rigorous approach for determining the optimal condition is by operating long term ad reactors with a range of different pre treatment conditions like the approach adopted in this work however such approach involves significant investments of time the fna pre treatment batch results on sludge solubilization had been a more applicable approach to evaluate the fna pre treatment conditions note it was shown in this work that the batch solubilization results are not representative of final reactor performance improvements on sludge reduction methane generation and viscosity it is likely that a harsh fna pre treatment may inhibit ad performance as suggested in the long term operation results and nitrite denitrification batch results in this study the nitrite denitrification test and solubilization batch test can potentially be used together as a simplified approach to screen fna pre treatment conditions for a specific type of activated sludge nonetheless long term experiments are still necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the identified conditions on ad processes the optimized fna pre treatment condition was shown highly beneficial to wwtps and highly competitive with other pre treatment technologies greatly improved sludge reduction decreased the cost of final sludge disposal and the accordingly higher methane production enables more energy recovery from the ad process the significantly reduced viscosity of twas and digested sludge with fna pre treatment could improve the capacity of existing ad reactors fna pre treatment at optimal condition in this work achieved immediately 42 viscosity reduction for twas and led to 57 reduction for digested sludge compared with control pumping and mixing difficulties due to high viscosity is often one of the major challenges for ad intensification ratkovich et al 2013 the reduction of viscosity could help sludge pumping mixing and mass transfer in the reactor contributing to the intensification of ad reactors the methane production and sludge reduction improvement obtained from ad reactor receiving fna pre treatment at concentration of 7 2 mg n l and duration of 24 h is comparable with the most effective sludge pre treatments reported with thermal pretreatment barber 2016 carrère et al 2010a thermal pre treatment has reportedly achieved up to 50 biogas production enhancement on mesophilic ads operated at srt of 12 d fdz polanco et al 2008 similar with what was achieved in this study 47 enhancement importantly compared with other popular pre treatment technologies like thermal hydrolysis and ultrasound fna pre treatment does not require intensive infrastructure investment or incur substantial operation cost nitrite required can be produced from ad liquor law et al 2015 by making use of the nitrite the green chemical in wwtps fna pre treatment result in relatively small operational cost also demonstrating a circular economy concept 4 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on the anaerobic digestion process and the characteristics of the digested sludge by illustrating the impacts of the design parameters of fna pre treatment this work is a major milestone in the development of fna technologies the major conclusions are 1 fna pre treatment was shown at all tested conditions effective in improving anaerobic digestion performances while its effectiveness and resulted benefits varied substantially amongst pre treatment conditions 2 the long term experiment clearly demonstrated that the increase of methane production vs destruction of the ad process and the reduction of digested sludge viscosity are positively correlated with the fna concentration and durations until an optimal condition threshold is reached the optimal condition identified in this work is fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h 3 the short term sludge solubilization results were shown inconsistent with the long term ad performance enhancement at stringent fna pre treatment conditions fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment the discrepancy was potentially caused by inhibitions from stringent fna pre treatment conditions applied nitrite denitrification rates in ad sludge were shown inhibited after stringent fna pre treatment conditions the nitrite denitrification test along with sludge solubilization results can potentially be applied for preliminary assessment of fna pre treatment conditions for future applications 4 the optimized fna pre treatment condition was shown to be highly beneficial to wwtps as high as 48 more methane generation 42 more sludge reduction and 57 lower viscosity could be achieved by the optimized fna pre treatment which bring benefits to wwtps in terms of recovering more bioenergy saving sludge disposal cost and increasing ad reactor capacity it is shown that optimized fna pre treatment is a highly competitive technology compared with other pre treatment technologies declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this study was supported by the

16615,free nitrous acid fna pre treatment is a promising technology demonstrated effective in improving waste activated sludge degradability and anaerobic digestion ad performance pre treatment conditions including fna concentration and treatment duration determine operational and capital cost of full scale implementation which have not been studied in long term experiments the knowledge of fna pre treatment conditions improving the ad performance is urgently required to determine suitable conditions for the technology implementation in this work five different fna concentrations 2 2 4 4 7 2 12 mgn l and nitrite only without ph adjustment and three treatment durations 8 24 and 48 h were studied in four lab scale semi continuous ad reactors for over 300 days fna pre treatment was shown under all tested conditions effective in enhancing ad performances while its effectiveness and resulted benefits varied substantially amongst different pre treatment conditions the long term experiment demonstrated that the methane production sludge reduction and digested sludge viscosity of ad are positively correlated with the fna concentration and durations until an optimal condition is reached which was identified in this work to be fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h microbial community changes supported the apparent observation of enhanced sludge degradation at elevating fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the short term sludge solubilization results were inconsistent with the long term ad performance which was potentially caused by inhibitions from stringent fna pre treatment conditions applied fna 12 mgn l with 24 hour treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 hour treatment overall results suggested fna pre treatment at the optimized

pre treatment process reached a major milestone in the development and applications of fna technologies keywords anaerobic digestion free nitrous acid pre treatment sludge reduction viscosity 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtp generate a large amount of waste activated sludge was which needs to be treated before final disposal sludge stabilization by anaerobic digestion ad is commonly practiced to reduce pathogens and offensive odors inhibit reduce or eliminate the potential of sludge putrefaction metcalf et al 2013 the key of achieving these objectives is to reduce the organic fraction of the sludge i e volatile solids duan 2019 which also generate methane ch4 rich biogas due to its energy recovery potential ad process offers a unique opportunity for achieving sustainable wastewater treatment li et al 2019 therefore it has been widely applied in large wwtps for sludge stabilization and energy recovery organic matters are degraded in ad by different groups of bacteria via four main processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the efficiency of ad process is often limited by the hydrolysis rate of was was is mainly biologically generated in the activated sludge process containing mostly bacteria extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by bacteria recalcitrant organics from raw wastewater or released by bacterial decay and inorganics from raw wastewater the biodegradability of was is relatively low carrère et al 2010b and many pre treatment technologies have thus been developed to enhance the degradation wang et al 2017 including physical ultrasonic wu et al 2018b chemical ozonation alkali and fna and thermal thermal hydrolysis pre treatments carrère et al 2010b wang et al 2017 free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 pre treatment is a promising pre treatment method for improving the biodegradability of was and enhancing the subsequent anaerobic digestion performance importantly fna is a green chemical that can be produced in wwtps by partial nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor nh4 no2 and at the same time a strong bactericidal agent at parts per million ppm levels duan et al 2020 law et al 2015 it was firstly demonstrated in short term biochemical methane potential bmp tests that pre treatment of was with fna at concentrations from 1 78 to 2 13 mgn l for 24 h could substantially facilitate sludge solubilization and increase the subsequent methane production in ad by around 30 wang et al 2013 intensive short term studies were later carried out to evaluate the fna pre treatment with was szypulska et al 2021 zahedi et al 2016 2017a b 2018 where improved solubilization and digestibility of was were consistently observed after fna pre treatments the effectiveness of fna pre treatment was then investigated in semi continuous ad reactors fna pre treatment with arbitrarily chosen treatment conditions have been evaluated with was in semi continuous lab scale ad reactors fna 1 8 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 5 treatment duration 24 h wei et al 2018 and pilot scale ad reactors fna 4 9 6 1 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 0 treatment duration 24 h temperature 23 30 c meng et al 2020 volatile solids vs destruction of the experimental ads were elevated by 17 47 and the methane production increased accordingly by 16 37 other improvements in sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal were also revealed it has been proposed that fna pre treatment is effective in disintegrating eps and cell membrane chislett et al 2020 wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 which resulted in sharp increase of hydrolysis rates and methane potential vs destruction in the subsequent ad process the fna concentration and treatment duration are crucial design and operational parameters in the fna pre treatment process the fna concentration affects the cost of chemical addition operational cost while the treatment duration determines the size of the treatment tank capital infrastructure investment the influences of fna pre treatment conditions on the anaerobic digestion performance urgently require investigations which contributes to the identification of optimal pre treatment conditions for full scale implementation after successful pilot scale trial meng et al 2020 both fna concentrations and treatment duration in the range of 0 36 2 13 mgn l and 0 24 h respectively were studied in short term batch tests and found positively correlated to enhancements of was solubilization and increments of methane production ma et al 2015 wang et al 2013 although batch studies have indicated a clear relationship between the treatment conditions and the was solubilization and methane production in ad long term studies are still required to verify the real impact of treatment conditions on the ad performance in all batch studies ph was adjusted after the pre treatment to remove residual fna inhibition before entering the serum bottles for anaerobic digestion however the residual fna inhibition under different pre treatment conditions could affect the ad operation and therefore needs to be evaluated also due to the inherent limitations of batch tests it is difficult if not impossible to infer conclusions as to the corresponding effects in full scale continuous flow reactors duan et al 2019b hilton barry and oleszkiewicz jan 1988 li et al 2020 therefore effects of fna pre treatment conditions needed to be evaluated in continuous ad reactor operations in this work five different fna concentrations 2 2 4 4 7 2 12 mgn l and nitrite only without ph adjustment and three treatment durations 8 24 and 48 h were studied in four lab scale semi continuous ad reactors the performances of the ad reactors in terms of methane production and vs destruction were closely monitored to evaluate the effects of fna pretreatment the rheology dewaterability viscosity and pathogen of the digested sludge were also determined when reactors were in steady states this work aims to elucidate the effects of different fna pre treatment conditions on ad performances facilitating the identification of optimal fna pre treatment conditions for implementation 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor setup and overall experimental design four 1 3 l anaerobic digestors with working volume of 0 5 l were operated in this study the volume of pre treatment unit before the experimental reactors r2 r3 and r4 was 0 3 l each the temperature of the anaerobic digestors was maintained at 35 1 c by recirculating warm water from a water bath through the water jacket of each reactor all the reactors and pre treatment units were continuously mixed by magnetic stirrers to investigate the effects of different fna concentrations and treatment durations the long term operation of four reactors r1 as control and r2 r3 r4 as experimental reactors was divided into four phases consisting of the baseline and three experimental phases namely exp phase i exp phase ii and exp phase iii the fna treatment concentrations and treatment durations applied to the reactors during each phase are summarized in fig 1 the choice of these experimental conditions is explained in supplementary information design of experimental conditions in the baseline phase day 0 50 all four ad reactors were operated in parallel to reach similar digestion performances in exp phase i day 51 173 fna pre treatments were introduced to the was fed to r2 r3 and r4 by controlling ph at 5 and varying nitrite concentration from 100 200 to 300 mgn l fna concentration of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 temp 25 c were achieved in the fna pre treatments for r2 r3 and r4 respectively a same treatment duration of 24 h is applied for all three pre treatments the fna concentration is calculated according to anthonisen et al 1976 in phase ii day 174 282 fna pre treatment with an even higher fna concentration of 12 0 mgn l was applied for was feeding into r2 by further increasing the nitrite concentration to 500 mgn l fna pretreatment with sole nitrite addition 200 mgno2 n l without ph adjustment was applied for was fed into r3 to assess the effectiveness of low fna concentrations with the ph of was varying mostly between 6 1 6 5 the resulted fna concentration sit in between 0 14 0 36 mgn l in average 0 22 mgn l the fna pretreatment duration is fixed at 24 h for r2 r3 at the same time the treatment duration for r4 was varied to investigate the effects of treatment duration while the treatment duration was reduced from 24 h to 8 h in phase ii the fna concentration was maintained at 7 2 mgn l in phase iii day 282 317 the treatment duration was investigated further by increasing the treatment duration of was pre treatment for r4 to 48 h while the fna concentration was maintained at 7 2 mgn l 2 2 reactor operation and fna pretreatment on a daily basis 0 042 l of thickened waste activated sludge twas or pre treated twas was fed into each reactor and the same amount of digestate was discharged through a multi head peristatic pump leading to a controlled sludge retention time srt of 12 days biogas generated in each reactor was measured by a tipping bucket gas meter and exhausted to a gas bag a water trap was installed in the gas line to avoid over pressure during feed and wastage period the gas meters were calibrated monthly and swapped to minimize the measurement errors the pre treatment units in the experimental system were continuously monitored with ph meters minichem and controlled at the designated ph levels by adding 1 m hcl via pumps controlled by programmable logic controller opto 22 2 3 sludge sources experiments were carried out with twas obtained from dissolved air flotation thickener of a local biological wwtp receiving approximately 120 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater

biogas dewaterability tests were undertaken in triplicate according to devlin et al 2011 each sample was centrifuged for 10 min followed by the removal of supernatant a cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge was added into the remaining sludge sample and stirred until water liquid separation appears the sludge was then transferred to a belt filter fabric to be centrifuged at 3785 rpm for 10 min for further dewatering the centrifuged sludge cake was collected for solid content determination the viscosity tests were undertaken using a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with cup and four blade vane geometry of diameter 14 mm as described in meng et al 2020 during the rheology tests temperature was maintained at 25 c using a peltier control to evaluate the sludge shear viscosity constant shear rate at 250 s 1 was used the pathogen removal performances of the anaerobic digesters were evaluated by quantifying fecal coliform in the twas and digestate using the colliert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories according to the manufacturer s instruction the sludge samples were diluted 103 to 106 times to 100 ml using sterilized ro water and sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples each 100 ml diluted sample was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the quanti tray 2000 was placed into an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h after incubation the number of positive yellow wells in quanti tray sealers was counted the most probable

python data analysis library pandas 3 results and discussions 3 1 overall performance of the anaerobic digestors methane production from anaerobic digesters is one of the most representative parameters that reflects the overall ad performance methane production from each reactor recorded daily during the long term experiments is presented in fig 2 other important parameters of ad operation including vs destruction cod removal ammonium release and vfa concentrations from each reactor during the long term experiment are summarised in table 2 in the baseline phase all four reactors performed similarly in terms of methane production as well as vs destruction ammonium release and vfa concentrations p 0 05 fig 2 table 2 the control reactor r1 had relatively consistent performance during the over 300 day period serving as an ideal control for comparisons fig 2 table 2 in addition during the whole experiment period no significant vfa accumulation e g 100 mgcod l in any reactor occurred table 2 suggesting stable digestion performances of all studied reactors the exp phase i commenced with r2 r3 and r4 receiving twas pre treated with fna for 24 h at fna concentrations of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 mg n l respectively significantly higher methane productions than that in the control reactor were observed in all three reactors with fna pre treatment the methane productions of r1 r2 r3 and r4 stabilized at 136 7 1 6 157 5 2 2 16 1 improvement 177 1 2 5 31 4 improvement and 200 2 1 9 47 7 improvement mlch4 gvsadded respectively other reactor performance parameters all agreed upon the observed improvement the measured vs destruction of r1 r2 r3 and r4 during exp phase i in average is 31 8 0 3 34 6 0 2 36 6 0 3 and 42 3 0 4 respectively the improvement of vs destruction with fna pre treatment is consistent with that of methane production the same trend of improvement was also obtained for cod removal and ammonium concentrations in the reactor table 2 both reflecting the extent of enhanced organic matter degradation the effects of two more fna concentrations and a shorter treatment duration were tested in exp phase ii pre treatment unit of r2 received a high fna concentration of 12 mg n l pre treatment unit of r3 received 200 mg no2 l no ph control while r4 started to be evaluated for the treatment duration 8 h pretreatment at the fna concentration of 7 2 mg n l similar to the previous phase fna pre treatments resulted in varying extent of improvements to ad performances r2 r3 and r4 generated methane of 177 2 2 1 145 3 2 9 and 171 9 3 3 ml ch4 g vsadded representing 38 1 12 4 and 33 6 improvements over the control reactor r1 129 0 1 4 ml ch4 g vsadded respectively table 2 obtained vs destruction performances showed comparable degree of enhancements the vs destruction for r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 31 5 0 4 39 3 0 4 36 4 0 8 and 38 3 0 3 in average respectively the extent of improvements due to different fna pre treatment conditions on methane production is also consistent with increased cod removal performance and ammonium concentrations as shown in table 2 in exp phase iii the treatment duration was further evaluated with r4 treatment duration 48 h fna concentration 7 2 mg n l as expected the overall ad performances of r4 are better than that of r1 higher methane production 195 9 3 1 vs 129 1 1 2 ml ch4 gvsadded and vs destruction 40 8 0 4 vs 31 9 0 5 were obtained consistent with observed higher cod removal and ammonium concentrations table 2 highest ammonium concentrations of 1411 1 125 6 mgn l in this study were observed in r4 high free ammonia the unionised form of ammonium concentration is inhibitory to ad particularly to the methanogenesis process liu et al 2019 however the relatively low vfa concentrations measured in the reactor 43 0 3 8 vs 46 7 6 9 mgcod l in control reactor suggested the high ammonium release unlikely inhibited ad processes moreover it should be noted that the higher ammonium and scod concentrations observed in fna assisted ad reactors than that in the control table 2 will lead to higher ammonium and cod loading to the following supernatant treatment the cod loading may increase up to 18 7 6 18 7 higher scod measured in this work and ammonium loading may increase up to 26 4 8 9 26 4 higher ammonium measured in this work 3 2 impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on overall reactor performances while fna pre treatment consistently improve the ad performance under all tested conditions the extent of improvement varied significantly with different conditions taking methane production as an exemplary indicator the fna pre treatment concentration investigated from 0 22 200 mgno2 n l with no ph control to 12 0 mgn l led to a wide range 12 4 to 47 7 of methane production improvements to the reactors fig 3 a similarly the studied treatment duration from 8 to 48 h resulted in 32 6 to 52 0 enhancement of methane production fig 1b the methane production showed a proportional elevation with increasing fna concentrations until reaching the optimal fna concentration of 7 2 mg n l the lowest methane production with fna pre treatments is obtained with the lowest fna concentration applied 0 14 0 36 mgn l in average 0 22 mgn l with 200 mg no2 n l addition representing an improvement of 12 4 2 4 the elevation of fna concentrations led to higher improvement fig 3 the optimal fna concentration 7 2 mgn l achieved a methane production improvement of 47 7 1 4 relative to r1 however further increment of fna concentration to 12 0 mgn l did not lead to better methane production performance instead lower methane production was obtained under the highest fna concentration pre treatment condition the same trend was also observed with the vs destruction performances fig 3c results indicated that vs destruction increased proportionally to the fna concentrations until reaching 7 2 mg n l the consistent observation confirmed the results and correlations obtained from methane production data it should be noted that the relatively lower methane production of r4 with fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l was unlikely caused by the consumption of cod for the denitrification of extra no2 addition 200 mgno2 n l given the observed lower vs destruction fig 3c similarly the existence of an optimal treatment duration is also confirmed the improvement of the methane production is 33 6 2 5 48 0 1 5 and 52 0 2 0 for 8 24 and 48 h respectively while the extension of treatment during from 8 to 24 h significantly improved the methane production doubling of the treatment duration from 24 to 48 h did not lead to further enhancement fig 3b observed relationship between treatment duration and methane generation is also backed by the same correlation obtained for vs destruction fig 3d overall the methane production and vs destruction of ad improve with increasing fna concentration from 0 22 2 2 4 4 to 7 2 mgn l while further increment of fna concentration to 12 0 mgn l saw a deterioration of methane production and vs destruction of ad performance the extension of fna treatment duration from 8 to 24 h experience a significant enhancement of methane production and vs destruction nevertheless doubling the duration from 24 to 48 h did not improve either methane production or vs destruction of the investigated reactor the optimal fna pretreatment condition identified in this work was fna concentration of 7 2 ph 5 no2 300 mgn l and duration of 24 h it should be noted the observation in long term reactor operation is inconsistent with previous short term batch tests previous short term test showed fna treatment continues to cause higher extent of sludge solubilization with increasing fna concentrations from 1 3 to 53 0 mgn l 24 h treatment fna treatment with durations from 1 to 5 d were also positively correlated to organic matter release szypulska et al 2021 this discrepancy and potential cause will be discussed in more details in section 3 6 3 3 digested sludge rheological behaviour the rheological behaviour of digested sludge plays a fundamentally important role in sludge management particularly in the aspects of viscosity and dewaterability the sludge viscosity impacts heavily on sludge pumping reactor mixing and mass transfer ratkovich et al 2013 high sludge viscosity normally at high solids concentrations could limit the capacity of the anaerobic digesters due to pumping or mixing difficulties high viscosity may also affect the mass transfer within the anaerobic digesters constraining the ad performances sludge disposal is often a major cost of wwtp operation expenditure the digested sludge dewaterability largely determines the final amount of sludge for disposal sludge dewatering can minimize the volume of sludge facilitate transportation and even reduce the leachate from sludge landfills cao et al 2021 thus sludge dewaterability is a crucial parameter in wwtps fna pre treatment can reduce sludge viscosity and enhance sludge dewaterability meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 the relationships between the enhancements of viscosity and dewaterability and pre treatment conditions were investigated in this long term experiment 3 3 1 viscosity fna pre treatment at all tested conditions consistently reduced sludge viscosity while the effectiveness was associated with the pre treatment condition applied fig 4 in this study the sludge viscosity decreased from 397 68 34 65 mpa s 1 untreated twas to 220 18 31 48 mpa s 1 after ad digestate of r1 for details see table s1 consistent with literatures eshtiaghi et al 2013 the fna pre treatments substantially strengthened the improvement as much lower viscosity was observed in the digested sludge of reactors receiving fna pre treatment even with the lowest fna concentration applied 0 22 mgn l 200 mgno2 n l addition 30 lower viscosity than the control was observed fig 4 increasing fna concentrations led to higher reduction of sludge viscosity until reaching the optimal concentration of 7 2 mgn l the maximal viscosity reduction 57 1 relative to the digested sludge from control was achieved under the fna pre treatment concentration of 7 2 mg n l and treatment duration of 24 h further increment of fna concentration did not resulted in more improvement similarly the extension of fna treatment duration from 8 to 24 h improved the sludge viscosity while further extension to above 24 h resulted in less significant improvement fig 4 the observed relationship between fna pre treatment condition and sludge viscosity enhancements was nearly identical to that with the methane production and sludge reduction performance fig 3 the reduction of viscosity for digested sludge can be partially attributed to the lower solids concentration due to enhanced vs destruction more importantly the similarity is underpinned by the mechanism of fna pre treatment improving sludge degradation performance and the enhancement of sludge viscosity fna pre treatment could breakdown cell membrane and extracellular polymeric substances eps in was solubilizing organic matters duan et al 2020 the solubilization and release of organic matters lead to the enhancement of was biodegradability reflected by the improved sludge reduction and methane production in the anaerobic digesters wu et al 2018a at the same time the disintegration of cells and breakdown of eps changed the inherent properties of the sludge leading to reduced viscosity meng et al 2020 the similar impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on sludge reduction and viscosity indicated a correlation of sludge reduction and viscosity enhancement after fna pre treatment 3 3 2 dewaterability the dewaterability of digested sludge from each reactor was measured at baseline and each experimental phase at steady state the dewatered solids content was compared between experimental and baseline phases to determine the impacts of fna pre treatment on sludge dewaterability as shown in fig 4c d most investigated fna pre treatment conditions saw insignificant difference after implementing fna pre treatment p 0 05 only pre treatment at fna concentration of 12 0 mgn l for 24 h significantly improved sludge dewaterability p 0 05 pre treatment duration of 8 h at fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l was also able to enhance the dewatering notably contradicting results of fna pre treatment on sludge dewaterability have been observed in different fna studies meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wei et al 2018 first reported fna pre treatment at concentration of 1 8 mgn l for 24 h before continuous ad increased the dewatered solid content of digested sludge from 12 4 0 4 to 14 1 0 4 which could be translated into a 16 17 reduction in the final sludge volume for disposal however the following fna studies in continuous reactor operation including this work only observed insignificant change of sludge dewaterability with fna pre treatment meng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the contradicting observation may be due to the iron content in the sludge shortly after the study by wei et al 2018 iron salt started to be dosed at a rate of 10 mg fe l into the upstream sewer pipeline of the local wwtp which consequently resulted in improved digested sludge dewaterability kulandaivelu et al 2020 the twas used in this study was collect from the same wwtp which is receiving iron dosage therefore contained a total fe concentration of 620 156 mg fe l it is well recognized that the addition of ferric improves sludge dewaterability the dewatered sludge solid content from the control reactor in wei et al 2018 was 12 4 0 4 significantly lower than that in zhang et al 2019 17 3 0 3 in meng et al 2020 17 5 0 5 and in this work 17 7 0 3 it is therefore likely that fna pre treatment itself could improve sludge dewaterability in addition the results further suggest that exceptionally high fna may be particularly effective in enhancing dewaterability however when combined with ferric addition the fna pre treatment cannot further enhance the sludge dewaterability 3 4 pathogen removals activated sludge is often a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms which could pose serious public health problems pathogen level in the sludge is thus a critical stabilization parameter to determine the reuse potential of the digested sludge jiang et al 2020 as a typical indicator of the pathogen level in sludge samples the biomass specific fecal coliform mpn was determined for the twas and digested sludge from all reactors under steady state of each phase and the results are summarized in fig 5 the fna pre treatment itself effectively inactivated pathogens in the raw twas fna pre treatment with fna concentration of 2 2 4 4 and 7 2 mgn l and 24 h substantially reduced the pathogen levels of twas from 5 74 0 06 log mpn gts to 3 70 0 03 3 73 0 05 and 3 58 0 09 log mpn gts the nearly 2 log immediate reduction of pathogen after fna pre treatment was even more effective than the 12 day ad process control reactor r1 which produced digested sludge containing fecal coliform of 4 12 0 06 log mpn gts however the digested sludge from reactors receiving fna pre treatments did not see improvements over the control reactor in fact negative correlations of fna pre treatment conditions on the pathogen levels of digested sludge were observed with the mildest fna concentration 0 22 mgn l resulted by 200 mgno2 n l addition the pathogen level in the digested sludge 4 00 0 16 log mpn gts was comparable with that of the control reactor elevating fna concentrations resulted in higher pathogen levels the reactor receiving fna treatment with fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l 24 h experienced the highest pathogen level of 5 74 0 16 log mpn g ts in its digested sludge which was similar to the raw twas 5 74 0 06 log mpn g ts for fna pre treatment with different treatment duration the reactor receiving the mildest condition pre treatment 8 h also performed the best in pathogen removal 4 19 0 08 log mpn gts among others digested sludge with pre treatment duration of 48 h has lower pathogen level than the one with pre treatment duration of 24 h fig 5 therefore it can be noted that the pre treatment conditions leading to better sludge reduction and methane production at the same time resulted in higher pathogen levels in digested sludge apparently while fna pre treatment immediately led to 2 log reduction of pathogen the pathogen in the fna pre treated sludge regrow in all reactors receiving fna pre treatment however previous study reported contradictory results the inactivated pathogen did not regrow in the study by wei et al 2018 while did regrow in the studies by meng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2019 from the results of this work it is clear that the contradicting observation of pathogen regrowth was not due to the different fna pre treatment conditions applied in previous studies it is clear in this work that under all fna pre treatment conditions the pathogen was able to regrow in the ad reactor anaerobic digester is known to inactivate pathogen due to the vfa and ammonia generated during the ad process jiang et al 2020 however with relatively high ammonia released from the reactor receiving fna pre treatment pathogens still managed to regrow it is currently not clear what might have caused the regrowth which can be a possible line for future research 3 5 microbial community the microbial community structure was closely monitored for all the reactors along each phase to assess the impacts of different fna pre treatment conditions at steady state of each phase three samples from each anaerobic digestor on three consecutive days were taken for analysis based on the sequencing data principal component analysis pca was conducted which suggested clear shifts of microbial communities in reactors receiving fna pre treatment fig 6 a more importantly the shift tends to be correlated to the fna pre treatment conditions the top 20 abundant genera in the reactors are shown in a heat map fig 6b which represent more than 50 abundance of the total microbial communities statistical correlation analyses were also performed described in supplementary information microbial community correlation analysis to assess the associations between the microbial community shift top 20 genera and fna pre treatment conditions the microbial community results supported the apparent observation of enhanced sludge degradation at elevating fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the abundances of a large group of hydrocarbon degradation bacteria were strongly positively correlated to the fna concentrations applied during pre treatment the positive correlations of hydrocarbon degraders adurb bin120 lentimicrobium uncultured cloacimonadaceae dmer64 fastidiosipila and fna concentrations during pre treatment are in accordance with the observed sludge reductions with different fna concentrations it is likely that the increasing availability of organic matters under fna pre treatments with elevating concentrations resulted in the enrichment of hydrocarbon degraders it also showed that the fna pre treatment did not affect the abundance of methanogens methanosaeta in the family of methanosaetaceae were the most abundant methanogens in all reactors 8 followed by methanoculleus in the family of methanomicrobiaceae 1 6 suggesting that acetoclastic methanogenesis by methanosaeta was the dominant pathway followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by methanoculleus pathway for methane production in studied ad reactors berghuis et al 2019 the abundances of phosphorus removal associated bacteria comamonadaceae ca competibacter uncultured caldilineaceae were found negatively associated with fna concentrations applied during pre treatment detailed quantitative correlation analyses are presented in supplementary information microbial community correlation analysis based on pearson s product moment correlation coefficients and spearman s rank correlation coefficients 3 6 sludge solubilization and nitrite reduction after pre treatment a number of short term batch studies have evaluated fna pre treatment conditions based on the assumption that the sludge solubilization scod release could be translated into eventual enhancement of ad performance szypulska et al 2021 zahedi et al 2016 2017a b zahedi et al 2018 it was shown fna pre treatment continues to cause higher extent of sludge solubilization with increasing fna concentrations from 1 3 to 53 0 mgn l 24 h treatment fna treatment with durations from 1 to 5 days were also positively correlated to organic matter release szypulska et al 2021 in fact the scod release after fna pre treatment measured in this work is consistent with previous short term studies the scod concentration increases with elevating fna concentrations from 2 2 to 12 mgn l as well as treatment duration from 8 to 48 h as shown in fig 7 a b also nitrite addition itself 200 mgn l was effective to improve the scod release at a similar extent to fna concentration of 4 4 mgn l which agrees with a previous study that suggested acidified ph fna is not needed to enhance methane production zahedi et al 2018 however in long term reactor operation fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l led to deteriorated ad performance than fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and fna treatment duration of 48 h did not result in higher ad performance than the duration of 24 h fig 3 similarly while nitrite addition 200 mgn l resulted in significant scod release similar with acidification fna 4 4 mgn l 200 mgno2 n l ph 5 the real methane production from the long term reactor operation is significantly lower than the condition of fna concentration of 2 2 mgn l with half of the nitrite concentration 100 mgn l fig 2 3 the comparison of long term reactor performances with short term scod release showed that short term scod release are not representative to the real ad performance enhancement the discrepancy of scod release and long term reactor performance was potentially caused by inhibitions from harsh fna pre treatment conditions the residual nitrite denitrification in ad sludge was measured in batch tests and suggested potential inhibition fig 7c a significant portion of nitrite has been consumed by denitrification during fna pre treatment in all treatment conditions details shown in supplementary information the fate of nitrite during fna pre treatment upon addition to the ad sludge the residual nitrite was further denitrified in ad sludge in most conditions nitrite was quickly depleted within 30 min however nitrite reduction rates were significantly lower in the two most stringent fna pre treatment conditions tested fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment at comparable nitrite concentrations the nitrite reduction rate 0 15 min in 48 h pre treatment duration 7 2 mgn l test of 0 53 0 21 mgno2 n l gvs was significantly lower than that in 24 hour pre treatment 7 2 mgn l test of 1 08 0 23 mgno2 n l gvs or 8 hour pre treatment test of 0 90 0 23 mgno2 n l gvs at comparable substrate level fna pre treatment concentration of 12 mgn l 24 h test showed even lower denitrification rate in 30 60 min of 0 36 0 20 mgno2 n l gvs fig 7c the comparison of nitrite reduction between different treatment durations 8 24 h vs 48 h at 7 2 mgn l fna and fna pre treatment concentrations 12 mgn l vs 7 2 mgn l at 24 hour shows the harsh pre treatment condition may have inhibited denitrification in fact sludge pre treatment reportedly produces inhibitory compounds alkaline ultrasonic sludge pretreatment lu et al 2018 electrical alkali pretreatment zhen et al 2014 and thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp devos et al 2021 wilson and novak 2009 zhang et al 2018 have all been reported to generate inhibitory organics to ad processes or subsequent post treatment supernatant treatment notably extreme pre treatment conditions e g high ph of 12 for alkaline pre treatment higher energy input of 24 kj g ts or 5 v for ultrasonic or electrical pre treatment and temperature higher than 160 c for thp are found to result in significantly more severe inhibition than mild pre treatment conditions similarly stringent pre treatment conditions applied in this work fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment might have produced inhibitory substances which inhibited the subsequent denitrification these substances likely also caused inhibition to the ad performances in the reactors which explained the discrepancy between sludge solubilization and reactor performance 3 7 implications to wastewater treatment in this work the existence of an optimal fna pre treatment condition was identified which allows maximal enhancement of methane production sludge reduction and viscosity of the studied fna pre treatment conditions in this work fna concentration of 7 2mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h brings the most benefits however the identified optimal pre treatment condition is specific to the twas samples studied fna pre treatment is essentially a chemical treatment involving complicated chemical reactions with fna and activated sludge like any chemical reaction the optimal treatment condition is related to the amount concentration and characteristics of the substrates in the sludge then the questions follow namely how to determine the optimal fna pre treatment conditions for the was at a specific wwtp the most rigorous approach for determining the optimal condition is by operating long term ad reactors with a range of different pre treatment conditions like the approach adopted in this work however such approach involves significant investments of time the fna pre treatment batch results on sludge solubilization had been a more applicable approach to evaluate the fna pre treatment conditions note it was shown in this work that the batch solubilization results are not representative of final reactor performance improvements on sludge reduction methane generation and viscosity it is likely that a harsh fna pre treatment may inhibit ad performance as suggested in the long term operation results and nitrite denitrification batch results in this study the nitrite denitrification test and solubilization batch test can potentially be used together as a simplified approach to screen fna pre treatment conditions for a specific type of activated sludge nonetheless long term experiments are still necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the identified conditions on ad processes the optimized fna pre treatment condition was shown highly beneficial to wwtps and highly competitive with other pre treatment technologies greatly improved sludge reduction decreased the cost of final sludge disposal and the accordingly higher methane production enables more energy recovery from the ad process the significantly reduced viscosity of twas and digested sludge with fna pre treatment could improve the capacity of existing ad reactors fna pre treatment at optimal condition in this work achieved immediately 42 viscosity reduction for twas and led to 57 reduction for digested sludge compared with control pumping and mixing difficulties due to high viscosity is often one of the major challenges for ad intensification ratkovich et al 2013 the reduction of viscosity could help sludge pumping mixing and mass transfer in the reactor contributing to the intensification of ad reactors the methane production and sludge reduction improvement obtained from ad reactor receiving fna pre treatment at concentration of 7 2 mg n l and duration of 24 h is comparable with the most effective sludge pre treatments reported with thermal pretreatment barber 2016 carrère et al 2010a thermal pre treatment has reportedly achieved up to 50 biogas production enhancement on mesophilic ads operated at srt of 12 d fdz polanco et al 2008 similar with what was achieved in this study 47 enhancement importantly compared with other popular pre treatment technologies like thermal hydrolysis and ultrasound fna pre treatment does not require intensive infrastructure investment or incur substantial operation cost nitrite required can be produced from ad liquor law et al 2015 by making use of the nitrite the green chemical in wwtps fna pre treatment result in relatively small operational cost also demonstrating a circular economy concept 4 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the impacts of fna pre treatment conditions on the anaerobic digestion process and the characteristics of the digested sludge by illustrating the impacts of the design parameters of fna pre treatment this work is a major milestone in the development of fna technologies the major conclusions are 1 fna pre treatment was shown at all tested conditions effective in improving anaerobic digestion performances while its effectiveness and resulted benefits varied substantially amongst pre treatment conditions 2 the long term experiment clearly demonstrated that the increase of methane production vs destruction of the ad process and the reduction of digested sludge viscosity are positively correlated with the fna concentration and durations until an optimal condition threshold is reached the optimal condition identified in this work is fna concentration of 7 2 mgn l and treatment duration of 24 h 3 the short term sludge solubilization results were shown inconsistent with the long term ad performance enhancement at stringent fna pre treatment conditions fna 12 mgn l with 24 h treatment fna 7 2 mgn l with 48 h treatment the discrepancy was potentially caused by inhibitions from stringent fna pre treatment conditions applied nitrite denitrification rates in ad sludge were shown inhibited after stringent fna pre treatment conditions the nitrite denitrification test along with sludge solubilization results can potentially be applied for preliminary assessment of fna pre treatment conditions for future applications 4 the optimized fna pre treatment condition was shown to be highly beneficial to wwtps as high as 48 more methane generation 42 more sludge reduction and 57 lower viscosity could be achieved by the optimized fna pre treatment which bring benefits to wwtps in terms of recovering more bioenergy saving sludge disposal cost and increasing ad reactor capacity it is shown that optimized fna pre treatment is a highly competitive technology compared with other pre treatment technologies declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this study was supported by the

16616,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 likely emerged from a zoonotic spill over event and has led to a global pandemic the public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing with quarantine and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread non traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater based epidemiology wbe have also been leveraged during this pandemic genomic epidemiology uses high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events as well as the diversity of circulating variants wbe uses wastewater to analyse community spread as it is known that sars cov 2 is shed through bodily excretions since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of sars cov 2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone in this study we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the usa where the majority of samples represent maricopa county arizona usa with the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale we undertook a single nucleotide variant snv analysis on data from 52 samples with 90 sars cov 2 genome coverage of sequence reads and compared these snvs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients we identified 7973 snvs of which 548 were novel snvs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical derived data as of 17th june 2020 the day after our last wastewater sampling date however between 17th of june 2020 and 20th november 2020 almost half of the novel snvs have since been detected in clinical derived data using the combination of snvs present in each sample we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in north america prior to our sampling dates the wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical derived data principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates we demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with snvs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the sars cov 2 genetic population structure circulating within a community which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases keywords sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance wastewater based epidemiology high throughput sequencing 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is the biggest pandemic since the 1918 h1n1 influenza a virus wang et al 2020 yan et al 2020 the sars cov 2 outbreak in humans likely emerged from a zoonotic transmission event s and was first recorded in december 2019 in the city of wuhan china andersen et al 2020 boni et al 2020 zhang and holmes 2020 according to the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center dong et al 2020 there have been 95 million confirmed cases resulting in more than 2 million deaths globally as of 18th january 2021 sars cov 2 is a positive sense single stranded rna virus in the family coronaviridae gorbalenya et al 2020 that can cause a range of symptoms in infected individuals including complications with breathing dry cough fever and diarrhoea wang et al 2020 however the majority of individuals show little to no symptoms buitrago garcia et al 2020 byambasuren et al 2020 kimball et al 2020 syangtan et al 2020 clinical testing of individuals for sars cov 2 is the primary surveillance method for informing public health strategic interventions and essential for implementing preventive measures such as quarantine to mitigate the spread of the virus the most frequently used approach for clinical testing relies on the detection of genomic elements of sars cov 2 by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr based methods cdc 2020a who 2020a the clinical analysis is now also being complemented with antibody based assays adams et al 2020 becker et al 2021 bryant et al 2020 cdc 2020b who 2020b that provide an indication of current or previous exposure to sars cov 2 high throughput sequencing hts technologies are being used to sequence the sars cov 2 genome from a subset of the infected population globally using clinical samples this has resulted in a large number of published genomes elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 and has provided insight into its origins spread and diversity via computational approaches in genomic epidemiology screening testing of a large number of individuals for sars cov 2 can be challenging particularly from a logistics perspective furthermore in most countries it is largely the symptomatic population that is targeted for testing and therefore a large proportion of infected asymptomatic individuals may be missed nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples have been the principal sample types used for screening however sars cov 2 has also been detected in other clinical specimens such as faeces from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals chen et al 2020 jones et al 2020 park et al 2020 tang et al 2020 xing et al 2020 moreover of late wastewater samples have been utilized as a way to identify several pathogenic human viruses and not surprisingly it has gained attention for assessing population level trends of sars cov 2 infections detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater untreated and treated has been a focus of research with feasibility highlighted in the review by farkas et al 2020 and with reported studies from locations including north america d aoust et al 2021 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 wu et al 2020 europe balboa et al 2021 kocamemi et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 asia kumar et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and oceania ahmed et al 2020 these studies used a range of sample concentration and viral rna recovery approaches followed by rt qpcr amplification to detect and determine the viral load two recent studies have sequenced the sars cov 2 genomes recovered from wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 despite the promising success of these prior studies it is still unclear how well wastewater based epidemiology can identify the genetic diversity of sars cov 2 in a given population and how this relates to known viral diversity of clinical cases this is especially important as new lineages are being discovered for example the b 1 351 strain in the united kingdom that contains single nucleotide variants snvs of potential biological significance such as n501y in the spike protein rambaut et al 2020b and k417n e484k and n501y in south africa tegally et al 2021 to investigate the potential of using wastewater to gain insights into variants of sars cov 2 circulating in the population we used a tiling amplicon based high throughput sequencing approach to determine sars cov 2 sequences spanning the genome in 91 wastewater samples collected from 11 states in the united states usa between 7th april 2020 and 16th june 2020 to further survey the viral diversity circulating within a community and to examine how these relate to sequences from clinical cases we undertook snv analysis and beta diversity analyses of sars cov 2 sequences in 52 90 coverage out of the 91 wastewater samples from 10 states we focused specifically on spatial and temporal trends and how they compare with clinically derived data 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and transport flow or time weighted 24 hr composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected either from the headworks of the wastewater treatment plant from

june 2020 table 1 fig 1 a sup fig 1 most samplers had refrigeration capabilities or were supplied with an ice dry ice blend to keep the interior collection vessel cool during sample collection wastewater was thoroughly mixed and transferred to high density polyethylene sample bottles and placed on ice for transport the samples were either hand delivered or shipped next day 2 day in insulated shipping containers for subsequent processing and analysis 2 2 wastewater sample processing and rna extraction aliquots of 150 ml of each composite wastewater sample were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes filter and then subsequently through a 0 2 μm pes filter the filtrate was then concentrated using the amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter units milliporesigma usa by centrifuging at 4500 rpm for 15 min for each sample the process was repeated five times in total using two filter units and subsequently the concentrates were pooled per sample from the two filter units for each sample a 200 μl aliquot was used to extract total rna using the rneasy mini kit qiagen usa 2 3 sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection and high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 genome sequences to determine the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the extracted rna was used in a reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr assay targeting the e gene as designed and validated by corman et al 2020 and cited by the who who 2020a this probe based assay was performed as per the specifications outlined in corman et al 2020 using the superscript iii platinum one step qrt pcr kit invitrogen usa this assay was validated and used by holland et al 2020 on sars cov 2 clinical samples a total of 91 samples from 11 states in the usa fig 1 were collected between 7th april 2020 and

sequencing the sars cov 2 rt qpcr assay ct values ranged from 26 8 to 36 for the 91 samples fig 1 total rna 11 μl from each sample was used to generate cdna using the superscript iv first strand synthesis system thermo fisher usa the manufacturer s protocol was followed with one modification the reverse transcription incubation step 50ºc was increased from 10 to 50 min 10 μl of cdna from each

psomagen usa on an illumina hiseq 2500 sequencer 2 100 paired end option on 1 lane in rapid mode 2 4 bioinformatics pipeline and analyses the illumina raw read sequences were aligned to the reference genome of sars cov 2 mn908947 refseq id nc 045512 2 using the burrows wheeler alignment tool bwa mem li and durbin 2009 the primers used for the tiling pcr based amplification step were soft clipped using ivar trim tool grubaugh et al 2019 which also removed reads 30nts and reads that started outside of the primer region trimming with a sliding window of 4 for a minimum phred quality of 20 was performed as default by ivar primers that may have mismatches with the reference sequence were also evaluated and reads from those amplicons with varying primer binding efficiency were also removed as described by grubaugh et al 2019 the genome coverage minimum quality of 20 and 10 coverage and mean depth was calculated for all samples for the 52 samples with 90 genome coverage variant calling was performed using ivar grubaugh et al 2019 with minimum base quality of 20 and 20 coverage with no cut off frequency since we have population level sequence data this approach was used because unlike the case with a clinical sample from a single infected individual wastewater contains material from a population that inhabits a particular region and therefore represents a collection of sars cov 2 variants actively shed by infected individuals within the population from the variants that were identified only those with a p value 0 05 in the fisher s exact test implemented in ivar tests if snv frequency is higher than the mean error rate at the specific position were maintained suggested masked sites due to biases shown by phylogenetic analysis or sequencing technology de maio et al 2020 as of september 2020 were removed for downstream analyses to identify the possible novel snvs the snvs determined from the 52 wastewater samples with sars cov 2 genome read coverage 90 were searched in all clinical data available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 at two time points 17th june 2020 and 20th november 2020 the 17th june 2020 download dataset includes clinical sample dates of 24th december 2019 to 11th june 2020 whereas 20th november 2020 download dataset includes those from 24th december 2019 to 16th november 2020 variants that were not present in the gisaid deposited sars cov 2 genomes were considered novel however to be more stringent variants that were only present in one of the wastewater samples were removed from further analyses 2 5 support for lineages assigned by phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak lineages pangolin each environmental sample was compared against the sars cov 2 genomes available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 an open access genomic database to collect a set of clinical genomes whose mutations were supported by the snvs identified above to reduce false positives basal genomes defined as those with 3 or fewer mutations relative to the reference mn908947 were excluded the set of genomes supported by each environmental sample snv profile were grouped by lineages assigned by phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak lineages pangolin rambaut et al 2020a and lineages with fewer than 3 genomes were excluded to avoid any misannotations resulting in false positives pangolin is an online platform that assigns lineages to sequences rambaut et al 2020a and is updated as new metadata are submitted to gisaid for each group of genomes grouped per pangolin we then looked to see whether any genome was from north america and if so recorded the time between the genome s sampling date and the collection date of the environmental sample note that the set of genomes which we summarize as certain sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin may be different for each environmental sample and thus the time between clinical and environmental sampling dates depends on the particular snv profile of the environmental sample given that linkage of snvs is not possible via short read sequencing support for mutation profiles observed in clinical genomes and correspondingly pangolin does not guarantee that the lineages were present in the environmental sample 2 6 sample based sars cov 2 sequence distance calculation and ordination analysis the genotype of each sample was represented in a four column matrix in this matrix each row corresponds to a position in the reference genome and the value at each column is the frequency of occurrences for each nucleotide a c g and t at each genomic position the yue clayton measure of dissimilarity index yue and clayton 2005 on the nucleotide frequency of the compared samples was calculated if the nucleotide frequency at a position of a sample cannot be calculated due to zero depth the yue clayton measure of dissimilarity index at this position between this sample and any other sample compared is assumed to be zero the sum of the yue clayton dissimilarity yue and clayton 2005 of all genomic positions was used as a measure of distance between samples the distance matrix was constructed by calculating pairwise distances of all samples and was subsequently used for principal coordinates analysis pcoa gower 1966 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample collection processing amplification and high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 from wastewater samples sixty of our 91 samples 66 were collected in arizona 9 locations located in maricopa county arizona sup fig 1 12 13 were collected from 9 locations in louisville kentucky sup fig 1 and 19 21 were collected from other states see table 1 and fig 1 for details the tiling pcr amplification enrichment process for the sars cov 2 genome generated 341 amplicons covering 99 of the genome albeit missing the 200 nts of 5 end and 162 nts from 3 end the genome coverage calculated for all samples ranged between 1 3 and 99 52 of the 91 rt qpcr positive samples showed 90 coverage minimum quality of 20 and 10 reads per position table 1 we note that there is no clear correlation between coverage and ct values obtained using the rt qpcr assay as some samples with lower ct values appear to have low coverage and depth fig 1 nonetheless the mean depth is lower with higher ct values fig 1 this has been shown in other wastewater derived viral sequencing projects using an illumina sequencing platforms via an amplification process izquierdo lara et al 2021 and a capture approach crits christoph et al 2021 this lack of correlation is not unexpected given the nature of wastewater where dilution and degradation play a significant role thereby this likely results in samples with differing levels of genomic rna degradation furthermore since the rt qpcr assay only targets a specific small region of the genome the ct value based quantification vary additionally it is important to highlight that there are several variables attributed to the handling and transport process of the wastewater samples prior to concentration and rna extraction we acknowledge that we did not measure the recovery efficacy of sar cov 2 in our extractions from wastewater via a spiked surrogate recovery efficacy can help guide whether the majority of the sar cov 2 sequence population in the sample has been captured for downstream analysis to counter this we use a conservative approach of only reporting and analysing the snvs from the samples n 52 for which we have 90 genome coverage certainly there are snvs in our samples that are likely not captured in our sequencing effort due to 1 preferential amplification of genomic regions due to sample quality 2 snvs in the non coding regions not covered by the tiling amplicon approach 3 sequence repeat regions that would yield low quality sequencing despite this we were still able to identify 548 novel sars cov 2 snvs and therefore this conservative approach highlights the number of snvs that are detectable in the excreted viral population with sequence coverage of 90 3 2 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence analyses a total of 7973 snvs were detected for the 52 analysed samples with 90 genome coverage after quality control steps from which the number of detected snvs per sample ranged from 24 to 793 sup table 1 sup table 2 fig 2 a as expected mean depth is correlated with the number of snvs detected in each sample fig 2b the regression analysis indicates the trend to determine unique variants within the 52 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences snvs counted in more than one sample at each site were removed and this resulted in 5680 unique snvs identified across the genome of these 4372 are non synonymous and 1308 are synonymous substitutions sup table 2 additionally 246 result in nonsense mutations and 64 are in non coding regions we highlight that snv a23403g responsible for the spike protein substitution d614g that is frequently seen in clinical data although it has not thus far been shown to be under strong positive selection volz et al 2021 was present in all 52 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences from one sample sample 147 tempe arizona a new variant a23403t was also identified that results in a d614v substitution in the spike protein but at very low frequency sup table 1 3 3 comparative analysis of sars cov 2 snvs in clinical and wastewater derived samples during the collection period the wastewater derived sars cov 2 snvs were compared with substitutions that have been detected in clinical derived sequences available in public databases the first aim was to identify possible novel snvs present in the analysed wastewater samples that had not yet been identified in any of the sequences available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 from clinical samples globally to accomplish this we initially undertook an analysis to identify all the detected snvs in the clinical data available from gisaid up until the 17th june 2020 subsequent to the last day of wastewater sampling in this study 16th june 2020 which consisted of 45 836 sars cov 2 genome sequences a total of 548 novel snvs sup table 3 were identified in the 52 wastewater samples collectively of these 469 were non synonymous not including nonsense mutations and 79 were synonymous substitutions fig 3 since we evaluated all variants regardless of frequency some locations as expected had more than one possible variant and are illustrated in fig 3 and outlined in sup table 1 these 548 snvs are distributed along the sars cov 2 genome with three of those located in non coding regions the vast majority of novel snvs were detected in up to 8 of the wastewater samples analysed the exceptions are four non synonymous mutations three on the orf1ab and one in the n gene that are present in 8 samples fig 3 and sup table 1 it is important to highlight that not all the novel snvs may be associated with a viral lineage circulating in infected individuals but it is highly likely that a portion of those snvs are associated with viral genomes that have not yet been sampled and or deposited in public sequence databases 3 4 identification of sars cov 2 snvs in wastewater samples in clinical derived samples post collection period to determine how many snvs have been identified post wastewater sample collection 16th june 2020 a second snv comparison was performed with all the clinical derived sequence data available as of 20th november 2020 203 741 sars cov 2 genomes available at gisaid based on the analysis of samples during the collection period snvs that were not detected in the clinical derived sequence data up until 17th june 2020 were considered as novel snvs from the 548 snvs considered as novel from the wastewater derived samples 263 snvs have subsequently been identified in clinical derived samples in the period of 17th june 20th november 2020 sup table 1 fig 3 from those 126 47 snvs were identified in the usa which provides good support that novel identified snvs in wastewater samples are associated with circulating sars cov 2 lineages in infected individuals sup table 3 however none of those 126 snvs detected in the wastewater samples were detected in clinical derived sequence data from the same usa states most of the novel snvs we report were identified in wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences from arizona however only 54 patient derived genomes had been submitted to gisaid between 17th june 2020 and 20th november 2020 and those had collection dates ranging from 12th march 2020 to 27th june 2020 before 17th june 2020 only 86 patient derived genomes from arizona were available in gisaid with collection dates ranging from 22nd january 2020 to 2nd april 2020 the remainder of the novel snvs 137 263 were identified in clinical derived samples from a variety of countries sup table 3 suggesting that sequences containing those snvs were likely circulating in the population in the usa but had not been sampled in a clinical setting or made available in public databases two hundred eighty five snvs identified in the wastewater derived samples with the last sampling date of 16th june 2020 had not been identified in clinical derived sars cov 2 sequences deposited between then and 20th november 2020 the results show that a proportion of those novel snvs are present in lineages circulating in the usa but we acknowledge that not all of these novel snvs are necessarily fixed in sars cov 2 lineages that are actively being transmitted nor is it possible to determine if any of these snvs are linked within lineages nonetheless the identification of the novel snvs clearly demonstrates the relevance of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence analysis which can provide valuable information on snvs that have not yet been captured using clinical derived approaches wastewater derived sequence analysis provides information at a population scale and can allow for rapid detection of clinically relevant important snvs our snv analysis shows that there is no particular region of the genome that is a snv hotspot and this mirrors what is observed in clinical derived samples see updates on snvs analysis of clinical data at https nextstrain org ncov global 3 5 determination of putative lineages of sars cov 2 in wastewater derived sequences given that wastewater harbours a collective population of sars cov 2 and therefore likely many variants it is not ideal to determine consensus sequences and consensus sequences based phylogeny therefore our first approach was to evaluate which clades in the global phylogeny of clinical derived sequences are supported by the snvs present in each sample based on the sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin rambaut et al 2020a the represented sars cov 2 lineages for each wastewater sample that are supported are shown in fig 4 we determined the time frames for which these lineages were first detected in north american clinical derived sequences relative to the date each wastewater sample was collected fig 4a we also undertook a comprehensive analysis of all the lineages detected in each state in the usa up to november 2020 that were supported by at least one environmental sample this included the number of clinical derived sars cov 2 genomes sequenced in each lineage fig 4b this approach helps to determine whether wastewater based surveillance for sars cov 2 can provide valuable insights on putative circulating lineages in the wastewater contributing population although there are several limitations to the analysis of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences our analysis of snv based supported lineages revealed some interesting findings from the 52 analysed wastewater samples 15 sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin rambaut et al 2020a were supported with lineage b 1 5 being the most prominent for the wastewater derived sequences the b 1 5 lineage has been identified in clinical samples in 27 usa states our wastewater derived sequence data suggests that b 1 5 may also be present in 6 additional states in the usa arizona colorado idaho kansas kentucky and new jersey in 17 of the 52 wastewater samples there were up to two supported sars cov 2 lineages that had not been detected in north american clinical samples during the period of our wastewater collection as of 17th june 2020 fig 4 these 17 samples were from the states of arizona kentucky and massachusetts fig 4b in wastewater derived sequences from arizona which represents the greatest proportion of samples the observed circulating lineages based on clinical derived sequences are well represented ladner et al 2020 with an additional nine possible circulating lineages identified although wastewater based sars cov 2 sequence analysis does not provide the same level of genome confidence and thus lineage assignment as those from clinical samples the wastewater derived data can be used to identify possible circulating lineages and assess the diversity of sars cov 2 we would like to emphasize that despite us identifying supported lineages based on snvs analysis without verification of full genomes using long read sequencing technologies it is not possible to confirm all the specific lineages present in the wastewater nevertheless it is apparent that valuable population level variant information on sars cov 2 can be gleaned from wastewater sampling including significant sequence data that are potentially missed in clinical derived sequence data where genomes are sequenced from predominantly infected individuals who might represent a small percentage of those shedding virus in a community 3 6 principal coordinates analysis pcoa analysis of nucleotide frequencies in fig 5 a we show our pcoa analysis results using nucleotide frequencies to evaluate the viral population diversity within and between samples sars cov 2 sequences in the samples from the ten states were overall highly diverse and those with two or more samples from the same state tend to cluster closer together fig 5a and c the main exceptions are those from kansas 20th may 2020 and 27th may 2020 and colorado 20th may 2020 and 28th may 2020 that do not cluster together both were collected a week apart and the locations have an estimated human population size of 25 900 and 8 300 respectively additionally the arizona wastewater sars cov 2 sequences are broadly distributed in the pcoa plot which is likely a consequence of the large number of samples collected over a three month period across several sites within maricopa county arizona tempe sites guadalupe and gilbert fig 5b and c in comparison to those in the arizona wastewater samples the sars cov 2 sequences in samples from louisville kentucky are much more tightly clustered in the pcoa plot despite sampling from several locations in the city over a two month period fig 5a despite the large number of samples collected in arizona compared to kentucky and the other states if seven individual samples were to be randomly picked from each location over the same period as those from kentucky the sars cov 2 genetic distance between them would still be apparently higher for arizona we hypothesize that one contributing factor to the differences in viral diversity present in these two areas i e maricopa county arizona and louisville kentucky is that tempe the region where the majority of the samples were collected is home to one of the largest universities in the usa maricopa county is the 4th most populous county in the usa with 4 4 million inhabitants maricopa county 2020 and a major travel hub with an international airport the highest number of samples collected within a state both temporally and spatially for this study was in arizona in arizona we note that the wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences in samples from the same locations do not necessarily cluster together in the pcoa plot fig 5a and c nonetheless there are clear shifts in the sars cov 2 sequence variants in each location over time fig 5b and c this is most evident for the town of guadalupe arizona given the sampling effort here where the sars cov 2 sequences in the samples collected in early may 2020 cluster with lower distance but we can see a clear shift in the viral population starting late may 2020 through to early june fig 5c which coincides with stay at home lockdown being lifted on 15th may 2020 it is important to highlight that the town of guadalupe arizona has a small resident community 6 500 from where wastewater was collected moreover sars cov 2 sequences in the samples from the same location at closer timepoints are often more likely to be similar yet there are exceptions such as the samples from site tp04 tempe arizona that have no resident population fig 5b and c the shift in sars cov 2 sequence diversity in locations such as tp04 tempe arizona over time may be due to new infections given the transient population increases in sars cov 2 viral rna in wastewater have been correlated to an increase in the number of cases locally medema et al 2020 observing a shift in the sars cov 2 population diversity through wastewater analysis with time provides insights into corresponding dynamics of increased infection in the community for example in tempe the number of recorded cases nearly doubled in june 2020 when analysing wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence data and correlating it with human dynamics business districts in the cities will certainly see the activity of transient community members and this will likely reflect in sequence diversity data 4 conclusion the sars cov 2 pandemic response has relied mostly on clinical based epidemiology as surveillance for informed response to mitigate viral transmission however there are certain limitations to clinical derived epidemiology such as the number of patient samples that can be analysed based on resources as well as a bias towards sampling predominantly symptomatic patients wastewater based analyses has been shown to be a useful approach for monitoring of genomic levels of sars cov 2 and community level surveillance further hts of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples could provide a population level analysis of circulating lineages and complement surveillance based on clinical derived sequences in this study we analyse hts data of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences to determine snvs putative circulating lineages and population structure at a spatial and temporal scale we were able to recover near full length genome coverage from 55 of the analysed samples which demonstrates that wastewater can provide useful genomic data for epidemiology despite high level of variability of handling and processing of samples as well as viral rna degradation in addition by identifying snvs in sars cov 2 sequences from each wastewater sample we were able to determine likely pangolin lineages some of which were not known to be circulating in the usa as of 20th november 2020 in conjunction with diversity analyses using distance matrices we show trends in viral populations which can help monitor the shifts in the sars cov 2 sequences within regions this study supports the use of wastewater sampling as a tool suitable for analysing the genomics of ongoing outbreaks of infectious diseases such as sars cov 2 as demonstrated here hts of rna from wastewater can provide novel information on snvs and lineages which when coupled with that derived from clinical data can help identify new emerging variants lineages of clinical importance within a population the study results indicating a shift in the sars cov 2 sequence variation in wastewater from each location over time shows the ongoing need for such approaches as a collective the approaches we have outlined in this study can be used within a public health setting as an early warning tool to inform infectious disease mitigation measures

16616,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 likely emerged from a zoonotic spill over event and has led to a global pandemic the public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing with quarantine and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread non traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater based epidemiology wbe have also been leveraged during this pandemic genomic epidemiology uses high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events as well as the diversity of circulating variants wbe uses wastewater to analyse community spread as it is known that sars cov 2 is shed through bodily excretions since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of sars cov 2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone in this study we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the usa where the majority of samples represent maricopa county arizona usa with the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale we undertook a single nucleotide variant snv analysis on data from 52 samples with 90 sars cov 2 genome coverage of sequence reads and compared these snvs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients we identified 7973 snvs of which 548 were novel snvs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical derived data as of 17th june 2020 the day after our last wastewater sampling date however between 17th of june 2020 and 20th november 2020 almost half of the novel snvs have since been detected in clinical derived data using the combination of snvs present in each sample we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in north america prior to our sampling dates the wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical derived data principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates we demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with snvs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the sars cov 2 genetic population structure circulating within a community which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases keywords sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance wastewater based epidemiology high throughput sequencing 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is the biggest pandemic since the 1918 h1n1 influenza a virus wang et al 2020 yan et al 2020 the sars cov 2 outbreak in humans likely emerged from a zoonotic transmission event s and was first recorded in december 2019 in the city of wuhan china andersen et al 2020 boni et al 2020 zhang and holmes 2020 according to the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center dong et al 2020 there have been 95 million confirmed cases resulting in more than 2 million deaths globally as of 18th january 2021 sars cov 2 is a positive sense single stranded rna virus in the family coronaviridae gorbalenya et al 2020 that can cause a range of symptoms in infected individuals including complications with breathing dry cough fever and diarrhoea wang et al 2020 however the majority of individuals show little to no symptoms buitrago garcia et al 2020 byambasuren et al 2020 kimball et al 2020 syangtan et al 2020 clinical testing of individuals for sars cov 2 is the primary surveillance method for informing public health strategic interventions and essential for implementing preventive measures such as quarantine to mitigate the spread of the virus the most frequently used approach for clinical testing relies on the detection of genomic elements of sars cov 2 by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr based methods cdc 2020a who 2020a the clinical analysis is now also being complemented with antibody based assays adams et al 2020 becker et al 2021 bryant et al 2020 cdc 2020b who 2020b that provide an indication of current or previous exposure to sars cov 2 high throughput sequencing hts technologies are being used to sequence the sars cov 2 genome from a subset of the infected population globally using clinical samples this has resulted in a large number of published genomes elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 and has provided insight into its origins spread and diversity via computational approaches in genomic epidemiology screening testing of a large number of individuals for sars cov 2 can be challenging particularly from a logistics perspective furthermore in most countries it is largely the symptomatic population that is targeted for testing and therefore a large proportion of infected asymptomatic individuals may be missed nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples have been the principal sample types used for screening however sars cov 2 has also been detected in other clinical specimens such as faeces from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals chen et al 2020 jones et al 2020 park et al 2020 tang et al 2020 xing et al 2020 moreover of late wastewater samples have been utilized as a way to identify several pathogenic human viruses and not surprisingly it has gained attention for assessing population level trends of sars cov 2 infections detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater untreated and treated has been a focus of research with feasibility highlighted in the review by farkas et al 2020 and with reported studies from locations including north america d aoust et al 2021 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 wu et al 2020 europe balboa et al 2021 kocamemi et al 2020 la rosa

concentration and viral rna recovery approaches followed by rt qpcr amplification to detect and determine the viral load two recent studies have sequenced the sars cov 2 genomes recovered from wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 despite the promising success of these prior studies it is still unclear how well wastewater based epidemiology can identify the genetic diversity of sars cov 2 in a given population and how this relates to known viral diversity of clinical cases this is especially important as new lineages are being discovered for example the b 1 351 strain in the united kingdom that contains single nucleotide variants snvs of potential biological significance such as n501y in the spike protein rambaut et al 2020b and k417n e484k and n501y in south africa tegally et al 2021 to investigate the potential of using wastewater to gain insights into variants of sars cov 2 circulating in the population we used a tiling amplicon based high throughput sequencing approach to determine sars cov 2 sequences spanning the genome in 91 wastewater samples collected from 11 states in the united states usa between 7th april 2020 and 16th june 2020 to further survey the viral diversity circulating within a community and to examine how these relate to sequences from clinical cases we undertook snv analysis and beta diversity analyses of sars cov 2 sequences in 52 90 coverage out of the 91 wastewater samples from 10 states we focused specifically on spatial and temporal trends and how they compare with clinically derived data 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and transport flow or time weighted 24 hr composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected either from the headworks of the wastewater treatment plant from within the wastewater collection system or at hospital facilities using high frequency automated samplers teledyne isco usa from locations across 11 states in the usa between 7th april 2020 and 16th june 2020 table 1 fig 1 a sup fig 1 most samplers had refrigeration capabilities or were supplied with an ice dry ice blend to keep the interior collection vessel cool during sample collection wastewater was thoroughly mixed and transferred to high density polyethylene sample bottles and placed on ice for transport the samples were either hand delivered or shipped next day 2 day in insulated shipping containers for subsequent processing and analysis 2 2 wastewater sample processing and rna extraction aliquots of 150 ml of each composite wastewater sample were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone pes filter and then subsequently through a 0 2 μm pes filter the filtrate was then concentrated using the amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter units milliporesigma usa by centrifuging at 4500 rpm for 15 min for each sample the process was repeated five times in total using two filter units and subsequently the concentrates were pooled per sample from the two filter units for each sample a 200 μl aliquot was used to extract total rna using the rneasy mini kit qiagen usa 2 3 sars cov 2 rt qpcr detection and high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 genome sequences to determine the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the extracted rna was used in a reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr assay targeting the e gene as designed and validated by corman et al 2020 and cited by the who who 2020a this probe based assay was performed as per the specifications outlined in corman et al 2020 using the superscript iii platinum one step qrt pcr kit invitrogen usa this assay was validated and used by holland et al 2020 on sars cov 2 clinical samples a total of 91 samples from 11 states in the usa fig 1 were collected between 7th april 2020 and 16th june 2020 that tested positive and one negative control sample collected in october 2019 in tempe arizona table 1 were selected for sample processing and high throughput sars cov 2 amplicon sequencing the sars cov 2 rt qpcr assay ct values ranged from 26 8 to 36 for the 91 samples fig 1 total rna 11 μl from each sample was used to generate cdna using the superscript iv first strand synthesis system thermo fisher usa the manufacturer s protocol was followed with one modification the reverse transcription incubation step 50ºc was increased from 10 to 50 min 10 μl of cdna from each sample was used to generate illumina sequencing libraries 92 libraries in total with the swift nomalase amplicon sars cov 2 panel snap and these were subsequently normalized pooled and sequenced at psomagen usa on an illumina hiseq 2500 sequencer 2 100 paired end option on 1 lane in rapid mode 2 4 bioinformatics pipeline and analyses the illumina raw read sequences were aligned to the reference genome of sars cov 2 mn908947 refseq id nc 045512 2 using the burrows wheeler alignment tool bwa mem li and durbin 2009 the primers used for the tiling pcr based amplification step were soft clipped using ivar trim tool grubaugh et al 2019 which also removed reads 30nts and reads that started outside of the primer region trimming with a sliding window of 4 for a minimum phred quality of 20 was performed as default by ivar primers that may have mismatches with the reference sequence were also evaluated and reads from those amplicons with varying primer binding efficiency were also removed as described by grubaugh et al 2019 the genome coverage minimum quality of 20 and 10 coverage and mean depth was calculated for all samples for the 52 samples with 90 genome coverage variant calling was performed using ivar grubaugh et al 2019 with minimum base quality of 20 and 20 coverage with no cut off frequency since we have population level sequence data this approach was used because unlike the case with a clinical sample from a single infected individual wastewater contains material from a population that inhabits a particular region and therefore represents a collection of sars cov 2 variants actively shed by infected individuals within the population from the variants that were identified only those with a p value 0 05 in the fisher s exact test implemented in ivar tests if snv frequency is higher than the mean error rate at the specific position were maintained suggested masked sites due to biases shown by phylogenetic analysis or sequencing technology de maio et al 2020 as of september 2020 were removed for downstream analyses to identify the possible novel snvs the snvs determined from the 52 wastewater samples with sars cov 2 genome read coverage 90 were searched in all clinical data available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 at two time points 17th june 2020 and 20th november 2020 the 17th june 2020 download dataset includes clinical sample dates of 24th december 2019 to 11th june 2020 whereas 20th november 2020 download dataset includes those from 24th december 2019 to 16th november 2020 variants that were not present in the gisaid deposited sars cov 2 genomes were considered novel however to be more stringent variants that were only present in one of the wastewater samples were removed from further analyses 2 5 support for lineages assigned by phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak lineages pangolin each environmental sample was compared against the sars cov 2 genomes available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 an open access genomic database to collect a set of clinical genomes whose mutations were supported by the snvs identified above to reduce false positives basal genomes defined as those with 3 or fewer mutations relative to the reference mn908947 were excluded the set of genomes supported by each environmental sample snv profile were grouped by lineages assigned by phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak lineages pangolin rambaut et al 2020a and lineages with fewer than 3 genomes were excluded to avoid any misannotations resulting in false positives pangolin is an online platform that assigns lineages to sequences rambaut et al 2020a and is updated as new metadata are submitted to gisaid for each group of genomes grouped per pangolin we then looked to see whether any genome was from north america and if so recorded the time between the genome s sampling date and the collection date of the environmental sample note that the set of genomes which we summarize as certain sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin may be different for each environmental sample and thus the time between clinical and environmental sampling dates depends on the particular snv profile of the environmental sample given that linkage of snvs is not possible via short read sequencing support for mutation profiles observed in clinical genomes and correspondingly pangolin does not guarantee that the lineages were present in the environmental sample 2 6 sample based sars cov 2 sequence distance calculation and ordination analysis the genotype of each sample was represented in a four column matrix in this matrix each row corresponds to a position in the reference genome and the value at each column is the frequency of occurrences for each nucleotide a c g and t at each genomic position the yue clayton measure of dissimilarity index yue and clayton 2005 on the nucleotide frequency of the compared samples was calculated if the nucleotide frequency at a position of a sample cannot be calculated due to zero depth the yue clayton measure of dissimilarity index at this position between this sample and any other sample compared is assumed to be zero the sum of the yue clayton dissimilarity yue and clayton 2005 of all genomic positions was used as a measure of distance between samples the distance matrix was constructed by calculating pairwise distances of all samples and was subsequently used for principal coordinates analysis pcoa gower 1966 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample collection processing amplification and high throughput sequencing of sars cov 2 from wastewater samples sixty of our 91 samples 66 were collected in arizona 9 locations located in maricopa county arizona sup fig 1 12 13 were collected from 9 locations in louisville kentucky sup fig 1 and 19 21 were collected from other states see table 1 and fig 1 for details the tiling pcr amplification enrichment process for the sars cov 2 genome generated 341 amplicons covering 99 of the genome albeit missing the 200 nts of 5 end and 162 nts from 3 end the genome coverage calculated for all samples ranged between 1 3 and 99 52 of the 91 rt qpcr positive samples showed 90 coverage minimum quality of 20 and 10 reads per position table 1 we note that there is no clear correlation between coverage and ct values obtained using the rt qpcr assay as some samples with lower ct values appear to have low coverage and depth fig 1 nonetheless the mean depth is lower with higher ct values fig 1 this has been shown in other wastewater derived viral sequencing projects using an illumina sequencing platforms via an amplification process izquierdo lara et al 2021 and a capture approach crits christoph et al 2021 this lack of correlation is not unexpected given the nature of wastewater where dilution and degradation play a significant role thereby this likely results in samples with differing levels of genomic rna degradation furthermore since the rt qpcr assay only targets a specific small region of the genome the ct value based quantification vary additionally it is important to highlight that there are several variables attributed to the handling and transport process of the wastewater samples prior to concentration and rna extraction we acknowledge that we did not measure the recovery efficacy of sar cov 2 in our extractions from wastewater via a spiked surrogate recovery efficacy can help guide whether the majority of the sar cov 2 sequence population in the sample has been captured for downstream analysis to counter this we use a conservative approach of only reporting and analysing the snvs from the samples n 52 for which we have 90 genome coverage certainly there are snvs in our samples that are likely not captured in our sequencing effort due to 1 preferential amplification of genomic regions due to sample quality 2 snvs in the non coding regions not covered by the tiling amplicon approach 3 sequence repeat regions that would yield low quality sequencing despite this we were still able to identify 548 novel sars cov 2 snvs and therefore this conservative approach highlights the number of snvs that are detectable in the excreted viral population with sequence coverage of 90 3 2 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence analyses a total of 7973 snvs were detected for the 52 analysed samples with 90 genome coverage after quality control steps from which the number of detected snvs per sample ranged from 24 to 793 sup table 1 sup table 2 fig 2 a as expected mean depth is correlated with the number of snvs detected in each sample fig 2b the regression analysis indicates the trend to determine unique variants within the 52 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences snvs counted in more than one sample at each site were removed and this resulted in 5680 unique snvs identified across the genome of these 4372 are non synonymous and 1308 are synonymous substitutions sup table 2 additionally 246 result in nonsense mutations and 64 are in non coding regions we highlight that snv a23403g responsible for the spike protein substitution d614g that is frequently seen in clinical data although it has not thus far been shown to be under strong positive selection volz et al 2021 was present in all 52 wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences from one sample sample 147 tempe arizona a new variant a23403t was also identified that results in a d614v substitution in the spike protein but at very low frequency sup table 1 3 3 comparative analysis of sars cov 2 snvs in clinical and wastewater derived samples during the collection period the wastewater derived sars cov 2 snvs were compared with substitutions that have been detected in clinical derived sequences available in public databases the first aim was to identify possible novel snvs present in the analysed wastewater samples that had not yet been identified in any of the sequences available in gisaid elbe and buckland merrett 2017 shu and mccauley 2017 from clinical samples globally to accomplish this we initially undertook an analysis to identify all the detected snvs in the clinical data available from gisaid up until the 17th june 2020 subsequent to the last day of wastewater sampling in this study 16th june 2020 which consisted of 45 836 sars cov 2 genome sequences a total of 548 novel snvs sup table 3 were identified in the 52 wastewater samples collectively of these 469 were non synonymous not including nonsense mutations and 79 were synonymous substitutions fig 3 since we evaluated all variants regardless of frequency some locations as expected had more than one possible variant and are illustrated in fig 3 and outlined in sup table 1 these 548 snvs are distributed along the sars cov 2 genome with three of those located in non coding regions the vast majority of novel snvs were detected in up to 8 of the wastewater samples analysed the exceptions are four non synonymous mutations three on the orf1ab and one in the n gene that are present in 8 samples fig 3 and sup table 1 it is important to highlight that not all the novel snvs may be associated with a viral lineage circulating in infected individuals but it is highly likely that a portion of those snvs are associated with viral genomes that have not yet been sampled and or deposited in public sequence databases 3 4 identification of sars cov 2 snvs in wastewater samples in clinical derived samples post collection period to determine how many snvs have been identified post wastewater sample collection 16th june 2020 a second snv comparison was performed with all the clinical derived sequence data available as of 20th november 2020 203 741 sars cov 2 genomes available at gisaid based on the analysis of samples during the collection period snvs that were not detected in the clinical derived sequence data up until 17th june 2020 were considered as novel snvs from the 548 snvs considered as novel from the wastewater derived samples 263 snvs have subsequently been identified in clinical derived samples in the period of 17th june 20th november 2020 sup table 1 fig 3 from those 126 47 snvs were identified in the usa which provides good support that novel identified snvs in wastewater samples are associated with circulating sars cov 2 lineages in infected individuals sup table 3 however none of those 126 snvs detected in the wastewater samples were detected in clinical derived sequence data from the same usa states most of the novel snvs we report were identified in wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences from arizona however only 54 patient derived genomes had been submitted to gisaid between 17th june 2020 and 20th november 2020 and those had collection dates ranging from 12th march 2020 to 27th june 2020 before 17th june 2020 only 86 patient derived genomes from arizona were available in gisaid with collection dates ranging from 22nd january 2020 to 2nd april 2020 the remainder of the novel snvs 137 263 were identified in clinical derived samples from a variety of countries sup table 3 suggesting that sequences containing those snvs were likely circulating in the population in the usa but had not been sampled in a clinical setting or made available in public databases two hundred eighty five snvs identified in the wastewater derived samples with the last sampling date of 16th june 2020 had not been identified in clinical derived sars cov 2 sequences deposited between then and 20th november 2020 the results show that a proportion of those novel snvs are present in lineages circulating in the usa but we acknowledge that not all of these novel snvs are necessarily fixed in sars cov 2 lineages that are actively being transmitted nor is it possible to determine if any of these snvs are linked within lineages nonetheless the identification of the novel snvs clearly demonstrates the relevance of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence analysis which can provide valuable information on snvs that have not yet been captured using clinical derived approaches wastewater derived sequence analysis provides information at a population scale and can allow for rapid detection of clinically relevant important snvs our snv analysis shows that there is no particular region of the genome that is a snv hotspot and this mirrors what is observed in clinical derived samples see updates on snvs analysis of clinical data at https nextstrain org ncov global 3 5 determination of putative lineages of sars cov 2 in wastewater derived sequences given that wastewater harbours a collective population of sars cov 2 and therefore likely many variants it is not ideal to determine consensus sequences and consensus sequences based phylogeny therefore our first approach was to evaluate which clades in the global phylogeny of clinical derived sequences are supported by the snvs present in each sample based on the sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin rambaut et al 2020a the represented sars cov 2 lineages for each wastewater sample that are supported are shown in fig 4 we determined the time frames for which these lineages were first detected in north american clinical derived sequences relative to the date each wastewater sample was collected fig 4a we also undertook a comprehensive analysis of all the lineages detected in each state in the usa up to november 2020 that were supported by at least one environmental sample this included the number of clinical derived sars cov 2 genomes sequenced in each lineage fig 4b this approach helps to determine whether wastewater based surveillance for sars cov 2 can provide valuable insights on putative circulating lineages in the wastewater contributing population although there are several limitations to the analysis of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences our analysis of snv based supported lineages revealed some interesting findings from the 52 analysed wastewater samples 15 sars cov 2 lineages assigned by pangolin rambaut et al 2020a were supported with lineage b 1 5 being the most prominent for the wastewater derived sequences the b 1 5 lineage has been identified in clinical samples in 27 usa states our wastewater derived sequence data suggests that b 1 5 may also be present in 6 additional states in the usa arizona colorado idaho kansas kentucky and new jersey in 17 of the 52 wastewater samples there were up to two supported sars cov 2 lineages that had not been detected in north american clinical samples during the period of our wastewater collection as of 17th june 2020 fig 4 these 17 samples were from the states of arizona kentucky and massachusetts fig 4b in wastewater derived sequences from arizona which represents the greatest proportion of samples the observed circulating lineages based on clinical derived sequences are well represented ladner et al 2020 with an additional nine possible circulating lineages identified although wastewater based sars cov 2 sequence analysis does not provide the same level of genome confidence and thus lineage assignment as those from clinical samples the wastewater derived data can be used to identify possible circulating lineages and assess the diversity of sars cov 2 we would like to emphasize that despite us identifying supported lineages based on snvs analysis without verification of full genomes using long read sequencing technologies it is not possible to confirm all the specific lineages present in the wastewater nevertheless it is apparent that valuable population level variant information on sars cov 2 can be gleaned from wastewater sampling including significant sequence data that are potentially missed in clinical derived sequence data where genomes are sequenced from predominantly infected individuals who might represent a small percentage of those shedding virus in a community 3 6 principal coordinates analysis pcoa analysis of nucleotide frequencies in fig 5 a we show our pcoa analysis results using nucleotide frequencies to evaluate the viral population diversity within and between samples sars cov 2 sequences in the samples from the ten states were overall highly diverse and those with two or more samples from the same state tend to cluster closer together fig 5a and c the main exceptions are those from kansas 20th may 2020 and 27th may 2020 and colorado 20th may 2020 and 28th may 2020 that do not cluster together both were collected a week apart and the locations have an estimated human population size of 25 900 and 8 300 respectively additionally the arizona wastewater sars cov 2 sequences are broadly distributed in the pcoa plot which is likely a consequence of the large number of samples collected over a three month period across several sites within maricopa county arizona tempe sites guadalupe and gilbert fig 5b and c in comparison to those in the arizona wastewater samples the sars cov 2 sequences in samples from louisville kentucky are much more tightly clustered in the pcoa plot despite sampling from several locations in the city over a two month period fig 5a despite the large number of samples collected in arizona compared to kentucky and the other states if seven individual samples were to be randomly picked from each location over the same period as those from kentucky the sars cov 2 genetic distance between them would still be apparently higher for arizona we hypothesize that one contributing factor to the differences in viral diversity present in these two areas i e maricopa county arizona and louisville kentucky is that tempe the region where the majority of the samples were collected is home to one of the largest universities in the usa maricopa county is the 4th most populous county in the usa with 4 4 million inhabitants maricopa county 2020 and a major travel hub with an international airport the highest number of samples collected within a state both temporally and spatially for this study was in arizona in arizona we note that the wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences in samples from the same locations do not necessarily cluster together in the pcoa plot fig 5a and c nonetheless there are clear shifts in the sars cov 2 sequence variants in each location over time fig 5b and c this is most evident for the town of guadalupe arizona given the sampling effort here where the sars cov 2 sequences in the samples collected in early may 2020 cluster with lower distance but we can see a clear shift in the viral population starting late may 2020 through to early june fig 5c which coincides with stay at home lockdown being lifted on 15th may 2020 it is important to highlight that the town of guadalupe arizona has a small resident community 6 500 from where wastewater was collected moreover sars cov 2 sequences in the samples from the same location at closer timepoints are often more likely to be similar yet there are exceptions such as the samples from site tp04 tempe arizona that have no resident population fig 5b and c the shift in sars cov 2 sequence diversity in locations such as tp04 tempe arizona over time may be due to new infections given the transient population increases in sars cov 2 viral rna in wastewater have been correlated to an increase in the number of cases locally medema et al 2020 observing a shift in the sars cov 2 population diversity through wastewater analysis with time provides insights into corresponding dynamics of increased infection in the community for example in tempe the number of recorded cases nearly doubled in june 2020 when analysing wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequence data and correlating it with human dynamics business districts in the cities will certainly see the activity of transient community members and this will likely reflect in sequence diversity data 4 conclusion the sars cov 2 pandemic response has relied mostly on clinical based epidemiology as surveillance for informed response to mitigate viral transmission however there are certain limitations to clinical derived epidemiology such as the number of patient samples that can be analysed based on resources as well as a bias towards sampling predominantly symptomatic patients wastewater based analyses has been shown to be a useful approach for monitoring of genomic levels of sars cov 2 and community level surveillance further hts of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples could provide a population level analysis of circulating lineages and complement surveillance based on clinical derived sequences in this study we analyse hts data of wastewater derived sars cov 2 sequences to determine snvs putative circulating lineages and population structure at a spatial and temporal scale we were able to recover near full length genome coverage from 55 of the analysed samples which demonstrates that wastewater can provide useful genomic data for epidemiology despite high level of variability of handling and processing of samples as well as viral rna degradation in addition by identifying snvs in sars cov 2 sequences from each wastewater sample we were able to determine likely pangolin lineages some of which were not known to be circulating in the usa as of 20th november 2020 in conjunction with diversity analyses using distance matrices we show trends in viral populations which can help monitor the shifts in the sars cov 2 sequences within regions this study supports the use of wastewater sampling as a tool suitable for analysing the genomics of ongoing outbreaks of infectious diseases such as sars cov 2 as demonstrated here hts of rna from wastewater can provide novel information on snvs and lineages which when coupled with that derived from clinical data can help identify new emerging variants lineages of clinical importance within a population the study results indicating a shift in the sars cov 2 sequence variation in wastewater from each location over time shows the ongoing need for such approaches as a collective the approaches we have outlined in this study can be used within a public health setting as an early warning tool to inform infectious disease mitigation measures

viral variants with putatively greater transmissibility virulence or both early and near real time detection of these variants of concern voc and the ability to accurately follow their incidence and prevalence in communities is wanting wastewater based epidemiology wbe which uses nucleic acid amplification tests to detect viral fragments is a reliable proxy of covid 19 incidence and prevalence and thus offers the potential to monitor voc viral load in a given population here we describe and validate a primer extension pcr strategy targeting a signature mutation in the n gene of sars cov 2 this allows quantification of b 1 1 7 versus non b 1 1 7 allele frequency in wastewater without the need to employ quantitative rt pcr standard curves we show that the wastewater b 1 1 7 profile correlates with its clinical counterpart and benefits from a near real time and facile data collection and reporting pipeline this assay can be quickly implemented within a current sars cov 2 wbe framework with minimal cost allowing early and contemporaneous estimates of b 1 1 7 community transmission prior to or in lieu of clinical screening and identification our study demonstrates that this

was accomplished by manually surveying nucleotide mutation tables across gisaid sequences categorized by pango lineage using covidcg org chen et al 2021 we then confirmed and visualized these findings

by phu staff designation of a confirmed case as having a variant or mutation of interest was done manually for the period of this study confirmed covid 19 cases and confirmed b 1 1 7 lineage infection among people residing in the city of barrie at the time of illness with accurate episode dates earliest of onset of symptoms testing date or date case reported from january 7 2021 to march 23 2021 was extracted from ccm on march 25 2021 case data among people residing in ottawa and testing positive between january 1 2021 and april 28 2021 was extracted on april 28 2021 it is important to note that practices related to routine screening or whole genome sequencing for voc including b 1 1 7 vary over time in ontario with testing practices scaling up and down in response to changing public health priorities and capacity 2 7 statistical tests and plots spearman s rank correlation was determined between d3l wastewater allele frequency and clinical case proportion over time a two tailed student s t test was used to determine the significance of the correlation relative to the null hypothesis of zero correlation both were calculated in the analysis correlation dialogue within graphpad prism v 9 1 2 for mac os motulsky radial plots were generated on nextstrain org hadfield et al 2018 other plots were generated with graphpad prism v 9 1 2 for mac os 2 8 voc allele frequency the proportion of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater that can be attributed to d3l alleles the d3l allele frequency was determined based on equivalent primer efficiencies and y intercepts i e assay sensitivities observed for both d3 and d3l standard curves these equivalent assay properties allow direct comparison of ct values that fall along the qrt pcr standard curves derived from rna templates thus a perceived advantage of this method is that it doesn t require absolute quantification via standard curves to determine the b 1 1 7 specific d3l signal as a proportion of the total sars cov 2 d3l d3 signal d3 and d3l ct values were transformed into linear space and allele frequency was calculated as the ratio of d3l and the sum of d3 and d3l allele amounts these operations are defined in the formula 2 ct d3l 2 ct d3l 2 ct d3 3 results and discussion 3 1 assay design strategy clinical diagnosis of a b 1 1 7 case with its multiple mutations requires a highly specific assay with a very high positive predictive value this is difficult to achieve in a singleplex qrt pcr assay as targeting multiple co occurring mutations at different loci may be needed to unambiguously define a voc multiplexed assays or secondary screens incorporating sanger sequencing and or whole genome sequencing are therefore required to confirm the genetic lineage of a virus isolated from clinical specimens pho voc testing descriptions 2021 unlike testing of individuals wastewater samples include genomes and fragments thereof sourced from multiple infections and can be collected at high frequency e g daily over continuous periods the additional longitudinal granularity provided by wastewater sampling allows passive population level probing of covid 19 infection courses this property provides substantial power to probe and follow the dynamics of allele frequencies in a population as infections wax and wane we hypothesized that following a single signature mutation in this context would yield sufficient power to distinguish voc lineages this is because other variants carrying a mutation at the same locus are likely to be rare and below detection limits as they are believed to be less transmissible and thus have a very low prevalence which does not change over time fig 1 a we found that one such signature mutation on the n gene at the amino acid level d3l is present in the b 1 1 7 lineage fig 1b moreover a single nucleotide variant snv in the wobble position of n d3 t28282a appears to be unique to the b 1 1 7 lineage fig 1c serendipitously d3l lies only 5 bp upstream from the start of the cdc 2019 ncov n1 amplicon region which we currently target to detect sars cov 2 in wastewater d aoust et al 2021a 2021b 2021c taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the n1 target we designed forward primers with mutations at the 3 end complementary to the b 1 1 7 signature allele at this locus fig 1d this allele specific primer extension strategy works by virtue of the inability of dna polymerase to extend mismatched nucleotides at the 3 end of the primer lefever et al 2013 this method affords high allele specificity while obviating the complexities and high cost associated with the development of competition probe assays we then combined this forward primer with the existing n1 probe and reverse primer fig 1d and materials and methods we call these two new assays d3 and d3l distinguishing non b 1 1 7 from b 1 1 7 viral lineages respectively when applied in the wastewater context coincident with the development of the assay described in this work lee et al also demonstrated the feasibility of the allele specific primer extension strategy to monitor voc mutations in wastewater with assays designed to detect 3 different mutations on the sars cov 2 s protein lee et al 2021 additional voc specific qrt pcr assays such as those that are based on allele specific competition probes have also been described and validated in wastewater samples peterson et al 2021 while the strategy of using a single genomic locus signature might give sufficient resolution in the wastewater context it is important to note that this assay may not have a high specificity in clinical samples for viruses of the b 1 1 7 lineage as a rare mutation may occur at this location in individual cases another caveat of the proposed assay is that emerging viral variants might accumulate additional mutations in the probe and primer region of the assay that would affect sensitivity indeed partway into designing and testing this new assay at the end of december 2020 when b 1 1 7 was becoming prevalent in the united kingdom we noted the emergence of a snv in b 1 1 7 sequences deposited at gisaid that co occurred with the d3l mutation and is located in the middle of the d3l forward primer this deletion mutant a28271del quickly became the dominant snv in the b 1 1 7 lineage co occurring with d3l at similar frequencies in the united kingdom fig 1d the d3l forward primer used in this study therefore incorporates this snv together this design strategy i e targeting a signature mutation that lies close to existing sensitive qpcr probe primer sets has the potential to create specific and sensitive qrt pcr assays for determining the proportion of voc specific rna signal in wastewater samples 3 2 sensitivity and allele specificity on synthetic and patient feces derived rna templates we performed d3l d3 and n1 qrt pcr assays on serial dilutions of b 1 1 7 or lineage b wuhan hu 1 in vitro transcribed rna templates obtained from a commercial supplier twist bioscience san francisco ca to generate standard curves fig 2 a b to compare similar template inputs we determined the copy number cp of the rna templates based on n1 rt ddpcr indicated in figs 2a b and s1 qrt pcr for n1 exhibited excellent efficiency 98 and analytical sensitivity 4 4 wells detected down to 5 cp with either the b 1 1 7 or lineage b templates fig 2a b consistent with our previous data d aoust et al 2021b and that of others ahmed et al 2021 importantly both d3l and d3 assays on their respective complementary rna templates demonstrated excellent efficiency 98 1 and 98 4 linearity 96 and 99 and analytical sensitivity 4 4 wells detected comparable to n1 although y intercepts tended to be approximately 2 cycles higher indicating that the limit of detection for d3 and d3l is higher than n1 under these conditions an allele specific assay must be able to discriminate the targeted alleles without cross talk i e it must not amplify the non targeted allele to this end we assessed the d3l and d3 assays on serial dilutions of their orthogonal templates lineage b and b 1 1 7 respectively fig 2a b we observed excellent allele specificity with no detectable cross talk no amplification at 45 cycles until template copy number approached 300 ct 31 at which point weak detections were observed differences of 8 10 cycles between complementary and orthogonal templates compare δct in fig 2a b importantly this cycle difference was maintained when template copies were an order of magnitude higher to independently confirm our observations the laboratory of dr mark servos a participant in the ontario wastewater surveillance initiative manuel et al 2021 assessed the d3 and d3l primer efficiencies and analytical sensitivity on the same rna templates but using a different one step qrt pcr supermix and found similar performance fig s1 we next assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the d3l assay by probing fecal rna extracted from covid 19 hospital patients that had been admitted in fall 2020 to the ottawa hospital prior to the introduction of b 1 1 7 into the community sars cov 2 rna isolated from human feces could be partially degraded fragmented and contains both sub genomic sg and genomic g rnas the d3l and d3 forward primers span an intergenic region of the genome and the two 5 terminal nucleotides of the forward primers are a mismatch for the leader sequence that is present on intact n sgrna transcripts fig 1d thus d3l and d3 qrt pcr sensitivity may be lower in viral rna extracted from covid 19 patient feces compared to n1 although we readily detected n1 amplicons ct 33 in covid 19 patient feces pooled from 2 patients we observed that d3 signal in the same sample was 30 of n1 fig 2c critically we did not observe any amplification of the d3l allele in patient feces after 45 cycles consistent with the allele specificity observed with the synthetic rna template and the putative b 1 1 7 negative status of the patients fig 2c using n1 to normalize any rt and or pcr inhibition that might be present in rna extracted from feces we compared d3 sensitivity in patient fecal rna vs that obtained from ivt rna comparing the difference in cts δct between d3 and n1 signals fig 2d we found that the d3 assay was approximately 50 less sensitive amplified 1 cycle later with a fecally extracted vs ivt viral rna template although this data was derived from a single pooled fecal sample from two patients it nonetheless suggests some form of rt and or pcr inhibition that is specific to the d3 assay as we are controlling for general rt and or pcr inhibition by normalizing to n1 which shares a common probe and reverse primer with the d3 assay this could be due to a number of properties that are inherent to the fecal matrix including 1 increased competition from other rnas present 2 increased d3 rna fragmentation 3 sgrna derived cdnas that are amplified less efficiently due to mismatches at the 5 end of the forward primer 4 impaired reverse transcription of the d3 region or 5 pcr inhibitors that differentially affect d3 cdna amplification further investigation is needed to understand this phenomenon together these data demonstrate the sensitivity and allelic specificity of d3l and d3 assays in covid 19 patient fecal samples and support the applicability of this assay to the wastewater context 3 3 application of assay to influent and primary sludge wastewaters we obtained 24h composite influent and grab primary sludge samples n 1 for each sample type collected on january 26 2021 from a wrrf serving the mid size pop 135k community of barrie ontario more than two weeks prior to sampling on january 8 a covid 19 outbreak was declared at a long term care facility ltcf within the wrrf catchment more than 100 b 1 1 7 cases associated with this outbreak were later confirmed by whole genome sequencing of clinical samples at the provincial laboratories most cases were likely active at the time of sampling fig 3 a we readily detected n1 amplicons in both samples indicating that sars cov 2 was prevalent in the community at the time of sampling and served as a positive control fig 3b critically both samples from barrie yielded detectable signal with the d3l assay fig 3b d3 targeting non b 1 1 7 was at very low levels compared to d3l given that primer efficiencies of d3 and d3l are virtually identical fig 2a b this allowed us to estimate their relative abundance and suggested that b 1 1 7 was the dominant viral lineage in the community at the time of sampling to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the d3l assay in a background of non b 1 1 7 sars cov 2 in a wastewater context we sampled a 24h composite of primary sludge obtained on january 16 2021 from a wastewater resource recovery facility wrrf serving a large canadian urban center ottawa ontario pop 1m although we could detect both n1 and d3 alleles the d3l assay failed to detect b 1 1 7 specific rna fragments fig 3b according to ottawa public health fewer than 5 clinically verified and travel related b 1 1 7 cases were active in this community at the time of the wastewater sampling to validate the d3l qrt pcr assay we sent the same barrie raw influent sample to be sequenced at the national microbiology laboratory nml in winnipeg manitoba in a companion report by landgraff et al a consensus metagenome was sequenced from this sample that was consistent with viruses of the b 1 1 7 lineage thus confirming both our qrt pcr data and the contemporaneous clinical landscape in the community landgraff et al 2021 3 4 measurement of community incidence passive and near real time monitoring tools to assess disease incidence and prevalence within communities and across larger political jurisdictions have transformative potential for public health in the context of the current pandemic where an already highly transmissible respiratory virus has undergone antigenic drift that has led to higher attack rates rapid intelligence and action is required to effectively curtail new outbreaks where the immunized predominate breakthrough events resulting from infections with emerging viral variants must be rapidly identified clinical covid 19 surveillance of populations continues to be hampered in many parts of the world due to low resources and inadequate supply chain networks vandenberg et al 2021 even in jurisdictions with excellent clinical surveillance systems socioeconomic barriers and hesitancy to testing make it difficult for epidemiologists and governments to maintain a clear picture of covid 19 in their communities rubin 2020 complementary approaches are therefore highly desirable we aimed to assess the feasibility of quantifying the proportion of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater that can be attributed to a voc in a community using the d3l d3 assays twice weekly measurements for n1 d3l and d3 in ottawa primary sludge were undertaken beginning february 21 2021 n1 served as a voc agnostic positive control we did not reliably detect 1 of 3 replicates under 40 cts d3l alleles until march 2 2021 at which point we computed the d3l allele frequency making up the total sars cov 2 allelic signature in wastewater a ratio of d3l b 1 1 7 signal to total sars cov 2 signal d3 d3l see materials and methods for more detail additional non detects were observed until the middle of march at which point d3l allele concentrations consistently increased and with which we were able to calculate allele frequencies fig 3c top to quantify the functional sensitivity of the d3 d3l vs n1 assays in situ i e the relative ability to detect fecally shed viral rna fragments present in the primary sludge vs analytical sensitivity derived in vitro i e on synthetic rna template we measured the distribution of n1 as well as the sum of d3 and d3l signals the latter of which is an estimate of the total signal from this genomic locus in wastewater we observed a nearly 1 log difference in the mean of the two distributions fig s2a indicating that amplification from the d3 and d3l loci is significantly impaired in the wastewater context compared to that on synthetic rna or template extracted from patient feces possible explanations include differential inhibition of rt and or pcr increased fragmentation in the locus targeted by the forward primers increased competition of forward primers for other nucleic acid templates or the fact that they overlap an intergenic region that might differentially detect genomic vs sub genomic rna concentrations we next determined if the d3l allele frequency observed in wastewater correlated with voc specific clinical surveillance efforts sars cov 2 genomic surveillance in ontario could not process the volume of cases during the winter and spring covid 19 waves in ottawa which precluded unbiased sampling and reporting the sars cov 2 case distribution across this period january april 2021 in ottawa is shown in grey in fig 3c bottom coincident with our assay development in january february 2021 and in an effort to minimize sampling bias and reporting lags the pho laboratories developed validated and deployed february march 2021 a clinical qrt pcr test targeting s n501y this mutation was at first deemed diagnostic for the b 1 1 7 lineage pho voc testing descriptions 2021 however the emergence of additional variants with n501y in ontario in february march 2021 namely b 1 351 and p 1 necessitated a new multiplexed pcr test targeting both n501y and e484k this replaced the singleplex n501y test in late march and n501y e484k genotypes were considered probable b 1 1 7 pho voc testing descriptions 2021 only a very small number of p 1 and b 1 351 cases were reported in ottawa during this study period and contributed to n501y and n501y e484 but not n501y e484 or n501y e484 counts fig 3c bottom and personal communication from ottawa public health therefore due to the low prevalence of p 1 and b 1 351 in ottawa before april 2021 we assigned n501y cases as probable b 1 1 7 in this study retrospective analysis of the number of clinical cases plotted as a function of presumed date of onset of symptoms or test episode date between january 1 and april 28 2021 showed a rapid and sustained increase in the number of n501y or n501y e484k probable b 1 1 7 cases beginning in the middle of march and peaking by the beginning of april consistent with the general increase in sars cov 2 cases in ottawa observed in this period fig 3c bottom note the significant time lag in clinical voc reporting approx 10 days denoted by the orange shaded regions in fig 3c due to bottlenecks in the primary and secondary screening of nasopharyngeal swabs due to both lab and data entry delays during a period of high disease incidence in the community personal communication ottawa public health we calculated the proportion of n501y n501y n501y e484 n501y e484k cases relative to all cases and plotted this based on episode date fig 3c top for simplicity we included n501y e484k cases i e not b 1 1 7 as we could not distinguish b 1 1 7 b 1 351 p 1 cases from the earlier singleplex derived n501y counts moreover n501y e484k cases did not materially contribute to case proportion in the study window fig s2b thus considering all n501y cases derived from both singleplex and duoplex testing simplified our analysis and interpretation a cursory examination shows that the distribution of clinical n501y case proportion generally followed that of the wastewater d3l allele frequency over time fig 3c top exceptions include in the first half of march when a bump in clinical n501y cases was observed that wasn t matched in the wastewater data we speculate that this might have been caused by sampling bias i e overrepresentation of travelers or outbreaks and non b 1 1 7 vocs that may have been captured by the n501y singleplex assay additionally we observed a suppression of wastewater n1 signal due to snowmelt in early march that may have resulted in false negatives for d3l we also observed a loss of correlation due to clinical reporting time lags towards the end of the study period in late april notwithstanding these biases associated with both the clinical and wastewater data when we considered 21 paired clinical wastewater observations in the period of january 1 april 15 2021 omitting the clinical reporting lag period of april 16 28 2021 we found a high correlation that deviated significantly from zero rs 0 861 p 0 0001 between b 1 1 7 specific clinical case proportions and wastewater allele frequencies fig 3d during the initial phase of the b 1 1 7 epidemic in ottawa when clinical cases were low the wastewater assay had insufficient sensitivity leading to 11 non detect observations between january 16 and march 20 these zero values skew the distribution and we therefore repeated our correlation analysis omitting the non detected observation pairs fig 3e this 2nd analysis also showed a strong correlation that deviates significantly from zero rs 0 714 p 0 008 finally to again validate the reliability and specificity of the d3l qrt pcr assay in reporting b 1 1 7 viral rna in wastewater an influent sampled collected at ottawa wrrf on april 25 2021 was sent for metagenomic sequencing to nml timepoint indicated in fig 3c landgraff et al 2021 as was seen with the barrie sample the ottawa wastewater sample yielded a consensus b 1 1 7 metagenome 4 conclusion these data support the use of wastewater based allele specific qrt pcr strategies to follow the emergence and proportion of voc specific rna signal that makes up total wastewater sars cov 2 rna signal in populations served by wrrfs we demonstrate that an allele specific qrt pcr assay targeting a single locus on the sars cov 2 genome can provide sufficiently high lineage specificity and detection sensitivity in the wastewater context we also demonstrate good correlation between two independent measures of voc b 1 1 7 infection in a population namely clinical case proportion and wastewater allele frequency which together can be used to triangulate incidence and prevalence of voc specific infections the latter method to monitor voc appears less susceptible to data inaccuracies and bottlenecks associated with scaling that occurs during times of elevated disease incidence in the community moreover the flexibility of this proxy measure of covid 19 incidence allows rapid and parallel implementation of multiple assays targeting other voc specific alleles within existing wbe surveillance architectures in conclusion our study demonstrates that targeting signature mutations in the n gene with allele specific primer extension qrt pcr represents a viable strategy to

16617,the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has claimed millions of lives to date antigenic drift has resulted in viral variants with putatively greater transmissibility virulence or both early and near real time detection of these variants of concern voc and the ability to accurately follow their incidence and prevalence in communities is wanting wastewater based epidemiology wbe which uses nucleic acid amplification tests to detect viral fragments is a reliable proxy of covid 19 incidence and prevalence and thus offers the potential to monitor voc viral load in a given population here we describe and validate a primer extension pcr strategy targeting a signature mutation in the n gene of sars cov 2 this allows quantification of b 1 1 7 versus non b 1 1 7 allele frequency in wastewater without the need to employ quantitative rt pcr standard curves we show that the wastewater b 1 1 7 profile correlates with its clinical counterpart and benefits from a near real time and facile data collection and reporting pipeline this assay can be quickly implemented within a current sars cov 2 wbe framework with minimal cost allowing early and contemporaneous estimates of b 1 1 7 community transmission prior to or in lieu of clinical screening and identification our study demonstrates that this strategy can provide public health units with an additional and much needed tool to rapidly triangulate voc incidence prevalence with high sensitivity and lineage specificity graphical abstract image

many wbe research groups including those participating in the provincial wastewater surveillance initiative in ontario canada critically these qrt pcr assays currently do not distinguish vocs here we describe and validate a qrt pcr assay that targets a b 1 1 7 specific allele that lies adjacent to the n1 region and which employs new forward primers along with the existing n1 probe and reverse primer this assay uses an allele specific primer extension strategy capable of discriminating single nucleotide variants in a pooled sample such as wastewater as such this strategy can be employed to detect other vocs as they emerge 2 materials and methods 2 1 water resource recovery facility description and sample collection 24 h composite samples of primary clarified sludge pcs were collected

gisaid clinical sars cov 2 genomic database elbe and buckland merrett 2017 to probe for amino acid mutations that were present in 95 of b 1 1 7 sequences and with 0 1 prevalence in other lineages this was accomplished by manually surveying nucleotide mutation tables across gisaid sequences categorized by pango lineage using covidcg org chen et al 2021 we then confirmed and visualized these findings by generating radial plots from subsampled gisaid sequences using nextstrain org hadfield et al 2018 specifically radial plots of amino acid and nucleotide level genomic loci were generated using the global database which subsampled 3799 gisaid sars cov 2 sequences on february 12 2021 to compare our wastewater findings to the local clinical picture we obtained case data from ottawa public health and the simcoe muskoka district health unit these ontario public health units phus track public health in the cities of ottawa and barrie respectively cases were confirmed cases of covid 19 attributed to the phu as determined by the ministry of health of ontario s surveillance case definition pho case definition 2021 reported cases were constrained to those residing in the phu providing data at the time of illness confirmed case data was extracted from ontario s public health case and contact management system ccm a central data depository for covid 19 case and contact management and reporting in ontario managed by the ontario ministry of health and accessed by phus data on vocs are entered into this system from a data stream from the ontario lab integration system olis or by manual entry by phu staff designation of a confirmed case as having a variant or mutation of interest was done manually for the period of this study confirmed covid 19 cases and confirmed b 1 1 7 lineage infection among people residing in the city of barrie at the time of illness with accurate episode dates earliest of onset of symptoms testing date or date case reported from january 7 2021 to march 23 2021 was extracted from ccm on march 25 2021 case data among people residing in ottawa and testing positive between january 1 2021 and april 28 2021 was extracted on april 28 2021 it is important to note that practices related to routine screening or whole genome sequencing for voc including b 1 1 7 vary over time in ontario with testing practices scaling up and down in response to changing public health priorities and capacity 2 7 statistical tests and plots spearman s rank correlation was determined between d3l wastewater allele frequency and clinical case proportion over time a two tailed student s t test was used to determine the significance of the correlation relative to the null hypothesis of zero correlation both were calculated in the analysis correlation dialogue within graphpad prism v 9 1 2 for mac os motulsky radial plots were generated on nextstrain org hadfield et al 2018 other plots were generated with graphpad prism v 9 1 2 for mac os 2 8 voc allele frequency the proportion of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater that can be attributed to d3l alleles the d3l allele frequency was determined based on equivalent primer efficiencies and y intercepts i e assay sensitivities observed for both d3 and d3l standard curves these equivalent assay properties allow direct comparison of ct values that fall along the qrt pcr standard curves derived from rna templates thus a perceived advantage of this method is that it doesn t require absolute quantification via standard curves to determine the b 1 1 7 specific d3l signal as a proportion of the total sars cov 2 d3l d3 signal d3 and d3l ct values were transformed into linear space and allele frequency was calculated as the ratio of d3l and the sum of d3 and d3l allele amounts these operations are defined in the formula 2 ct d3l 2 ct d3l 2 ct d3 3 results and discussion 3 1 assay design strategy clinical diagnosis of a b 1 1 7 case with its multiple mutations requires a highly specific assay with a very high positive predictive value this is difficult to achieve in a singleplex qrt pcr assay as targeting multiple co occurring mutations at different loci may be needed to unambiguously define a voc multiplexed assays or secondary screens incorporating sanger sequencing and or whole genome sequencing are therefore required to confirm the genetic lineage of a virus isolated from clinical specimens pho voc testing descriptions 2021 unlike testing of individuals wastewater samples include genomes and fragments thereof sourced from multiple infections and can be collected at high frequency e g daily over continuous periods the additional longitudinal granularity provided by wastewater sampling allows passive population level probing of covid 19 infection courses this property provides substantial power to probe and follow the dynamics of allele frequencies in a population as infections wax and wane we hypothesized that following a single signature mutation in this context would yield sufficient power to distinguish voc lineages this is because other variants carrying a mutation at the same locus are likely to be rare and below detection limits as they are believed to be less transmissible and thus have a very low prevalence which does not change over time fig 1 a we found that one such signature mutation on the n gene at the amino acid level d3l is present in the b 1 1 7 lineage fig 1b moreover a single nucleotide variant snv in the wobble position of n d3 t28282a appears to be unique to the b 1 1 7 lineage fig 1c serendipitously d3l lies only 5 bp upstream from the start of the cdc 2019 ncov n1 amplicon region which we currently target to detect sars cov 2 in wastewater d aoust et al 2021a 2021b 2021c taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the n1 target we designed forward primers with mutations at the 3 end complementary to the b 1 1 7 signature allele at this locus fig 1d this allele specific primer extension strategy works by virtue of the inability of dna polymerase to extend mismatched nucleotides at the 3 end of the primer lefever et al 2013 this method affords high allele specificity while obviating the complexities and high cost associated with the development of competition probe assays we then combined this forward primer with the existing n1 probe and reverse primer fig 1d and materials and methods we call these two new assays d3 and d3l distinguishing non b 1 1 7 from b 1 1 7 viral lineages respectively when applied in the wastewater context coincident with the development of the assay described in this work lee et al also demonstrated the feasibility of the allele specific primer extension strategy to monitor voc mutations in wastewater with assays designed to detect 3 different mutations on the sars cov 2 s protein lee et al 2021 additional voc specific qrt pcr assays such as those that are based on allele specific competition probes have also been described and validated in wastewater samples peterson et al 2021 while the strategy of using a single genomic locus signature might give sufficient resolution in the wastewater context it is important to note that this assay may not have a high specificity in clinical samples for viruses of the b 1 1 7 lineage as a rare mutation may occur at this location in individual cases another caveat of the proposed assay is that emerging viral variants might accumulate additional mutations in the probe and primer region of the assay that would affect sensitivity indeed partway into designing and testing this new assay at the end of december 2020 when b 1 1 7 was becoming prevalent in the united kingdom we noted the emergence of a snv in b 1 1 7 sequences deposited at gisaid that co occurred with the d3l mutation and is located in the middle of the d3l forward primer this deletion mutant a28271del quickly became the dominant snv in the b 1 1 7 lineage co occurring with d3l at similar frequencies in the united kingdom fig 1d the d3l forward primer used in this study therefore incorporates this snv together this design strategy i e targeting a signature mutation that lies close to existing sensitive qpcr probe primer sets has the potential to create specific and sensitive qrt pcr assays for determining the proportion of voc specific rna signal in wastewater samples 3 2 sensitivity and allele specificity on synthetic and patient feces derived rna templates we performed d3l d3 and n1 qrt pcr assays on serial dilutions of b 1 1 7 or lineage b wuhan hu 1 in vitro transcribed rna templates obtained from a commercial supplier twist bioscience san francisco ca to generate standard curves fig 2 a b to compare similar template inputs we determined the copy number cp of the rna templates based on n1 rt ddpcr indicated in figs 2a b and s1 qrt pcr for n1 exhibited excellent efficiency 98 and analytical sensitivity 4 4 wells detected down to 5 cp with either the b 1 1 7 or lineage b templates fig 2a b consistent with our previous data d aoust et al 2021b and that of others ahmed et al 2021 importantly both d3l and d3 assays on their respective complementary rna templates demonstrated excellent efficiency 98 1 and 98 4 linearity 96 and 99 and analytical sensitivity 4 4 wells detected comparable to n1 although y intercepts tended to be approximately 2 cycles higher indicating that the limit of detection for d3 and d3l is higher than n1 under these conditions an allele specific assay must be able to discriminate the targeted alleles without cross talk i e it must not amplify the non targeted allele to this end we assessed the d3l and d3 assays on serial dilutions of their orthogonal templates lineage b and b 1 1 7 respectively fig 2a b we observed excellent allele specificity with no detectable cross talk no amplification at 45 cycles until template copy number approached 300 ct 31 at which point weak detections were observed differences of 8 10 cycles between complementary and orthogonal templates compare δct in fig 2a b importantly this cycle difference was maintained when template copies were an order of magnitude higher to independently confirm our observations the laboratory of dr mark servos a participant in the ontario wastewater surveillance initiative manuel et al 2021 assessed the d3 and d3l primer efficiencies and analytical sensitivity on the same rna templates but using a different one step qrt pcr supermix and found similar performance fig s1 we next assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the d3l assay by probing fecal rna extracted from covid 19 hospital patients that had been admitted in fall 2020 to the ottawa hospital prior to the introduction of b 1 1 7 into the community sars cov 2 rna isolated from human feces could be partially degraded fragmented and contains both sub genomic sg and genomic g rnas the d3l and d3 forward primers span an intergenic region of the genome and the two 5 terminal nucleotides of the forward primers are a mismatch for the leader sequence that is present on intact n sgrna transcripts fig 1d thus d3l and d3 qrt pcr sensitivity may be lower in viral rna extracted from covid 19 patient feces compared to n1 although we readily detected n1 amplicons ct 33 in covid 19 patient feces pooled from 2 patients we observed that d3 signal in the same sample was 30 of n1 fig 2c critically we did not observe any amplification of the d3l allele in patient feces after 45 cycles consistent with the allele specificity observed with the synthetic rna template and the putative b 1 1 7 negative status of the patients fig 2c using n1 to normalize any rt and or pcr inhibition that might be present in rna extracted from feces we compared d3 sensitivity in patient fecal rna vs that obtained from ivt rna comparing the difference in cts δct between d3 and n1 signals fig 2d we found that the d3 assay was approximately 50 less sensitive amplified 1 cycle later with a fecally extracted vs ivt viral rna template although this data was derived from a single pooled fecal sample from two patients it nonetheless suggests some form of rt and or pcr inhibition that is specific to the d3 assay as we are controlling for general rt and or pcr inhibition by normalizing to n1 which shares a common probe and reverse primer with the d3 assay this could be due to a number of properties that are inherent to the fecal matrix including 1 increased competition from other rnas present 2 increased d3 rna fragmentation 3 sgrna derived cdnas that are amplified less efficiently due to mismatches at the 5 end of the forward primer 4 impaired reverse transcription of the d3 region or 5 pcr inhibitors that differentially affect d3 cdna amplification further investigation is needed to understand this phenomenon together these data demonstrate the sensitivity and allelic specificity of d3l and d3 assays in covid 19 patient fecal samples and support the applicability of this assay to the wastewater context 3 3 application of assay to influent and primary sludge wastewaters we obtained 24h composite influent and grab primary sludge samples n 1 for each sample type collected on january 26 2021 from a wrrf serving the mid size pop 135k community of barrie ontario more than two weeks prior to sampling on january 8 a covid 19 outbreak was declared at a long term care facility ltcf within the wrrf catchment more than 100 b 1 1 7 cases associated with this outbreak were later confirmed by whole genome sequencing of clinical samples at the provincial laboratories most cases were likely active at the time of sampling fig 3 a we readily detected n1 amplicons in both samples indicating that sars cov 2 was prevalent in the community at the time of sampling and served as a positive control fig 3b critically both samples from barrie yielded detectable signal with the d3l assay fig 3b d3 targeting non b 1 1 7 was at very low levels compared to d3l given that primer efficiencies of d3 and d3l are virtually identical fig 2a b this allowed us to estimate their relative abundance and suggested that b 1 1 7 was the dominant viral lineage in the community at the time of sampling to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the d3l assay in a background of non b 1 1 7 sars cov 2 in a wastewater context we sampled a 24h composite of primary sludge obtained on january 16 2021 from a wastewater resource recovery facility wrrf serving a large canadian urban center ottawa ontario pop 1m although we could detect both n1 and d3 alleles the d3l assay failed to detect b 1 1 7 specific rna fragments fig 3b according to ottawa public health fewer than 5 clinically verified and travel related b 1 1 7 cases were active in this community at the time of the wastewater sampling to validate the d3l qrt pcr assay we sent the same barrie raw influent sample to be sequenced at the national microbiology laboratory nml in winnipeg manitoba in a companion report by landgraff et al a consensus metagenome was sequenced from this sample that was consistent with viruses of the b 1 1 7 lineage thus confirming both our qrt pcr data and the contemporaneous clinical landscape in the community landgraff et al 2021 3 4 measurement of community incidence passive and near real time monitoring tools to assess disease incidence and prevalence within communities and across larger political jurisdictions have transformative potential for public health in the context of the current pandemic where an already highly transmissible respiratory virus has undergone antigenic drift that has led to higher attack rates rapid intelligence and action is required to effectively curtail new outbreaks where the immunized predominate breakthrough events resulting from infections with emerging viral variants must be rapidly identified clinical covid 19 surveillance of populations continues to be hampered in many parts of the world due to low resources and inadequate supply chain networks vandenberg et al 2021 even in jurisdictions with excellent clinical surveillance systems socioeconomic barriers and hesitancy to testing make it difficult for epidemiologists and governments to maintain a clear picture of covid 19 in their communities rubin 2020 complementary approaches are therefore highly desirable we aimed to assess the feasibility of quantifying the proportion of sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater that can be attributed to a voc in a community using the d3l d3 assays twice weekly measurements for n1 d3l and d3 in ottawa primary sludge were undertaken beginning february 21 2021 n1 served as a voc agnostic positive control we did not reliably detect 1 of 3 replicates under 40 cts d3l alleles until march 2 2021 at which point we computed the d3l allele frequency making up the total sars cov 2 allelic signature in wastewater a ratio of d3l b 1 1 7 signal to total sars cov 2 signal d3 d3l see materials and methods for more detail additional non detects were observed until the middle of march at which point d3l allele concentrations consistently increased and with which we were able to calculate allele frequencies fig 3c top to quantify the functional sensitivity of the d3 d3l vs n1 assays in situ i e the relative ability to detect fecally shed viral rna fragments present in the primary sludge vs analytical sensitivity derived in vitro i e on synthetic rna template we measured the distribution of n1 as well as the sum of d3 and d3l signals the latter of which is an estimate of the total signal from this genomic locus in wastewater we observed a nearly 1 log difference in the mean of the two distributions fig s2a indicating that amplification from the d3 and d3l loci is significantly impaired in the wastewater context compared to that on synthetic rna or template extracted from patient feces possible explanations include differential inhibition of rt and or pcr increased fragmentation in the locus targeted by the forward primers increased competition of forward primers for other nucleic acid templates or the fact that they overlap an intergenic region that might differentially detect genomic vs sub genomic rna concentrations we next determined if the d3l allele frequency observed in wastewater correlated with voc specific clinical surveillance efforts sars cov 2 genomic surveillance in ontario could not process the volume of cases during the winter and spring covid 19 waves in ottawa which precluded unbiased sampling and reporting the sars cov 2 case distribution across this period january april 2021 in ottawa is shown in grey in fig 3c bottom coincident with our assay development in january february 2021 and in an effort to minimize sampling bias and reporting lags the pho laboratories developed validated and deployed february march 2021 a clinical qrt pcr test targeting s n501y this mutation was at first deemed diagnostic for the b 1 1 7 lineage pho voc testing descriptions 2021 however the emergence of additional variants with n501y in ontario in february march 2021 namely b 1 351 and p 1 necessitated a new multiplexed pcr test targeting both n501y and e484k this replaced the singleplex n501y test in late march and n501y e484k genotypes were considered probable b 1 1 7 pho voc testing descriptions 2021 only a very small number of p 1 and b 1 351 cases were reported in ottawa during this study period and contributed to n501y and n501y e484 but not n501y e484 or n501y e484 counts fig 3c bottom and personal communication from ottawa public health therefore due to the low prevalence of p 1 and b 1 351 in ottawa before april 2021 we assigned n501y cases as probable b 1 1 7 in this study retrospective analysis of the number of clinical cases plotted as a function of presumed date of onset of symptoms or test episode date between january 1 and april 28 2021 showed a rapid and sustained increase in the number of n501y or n501y e484k probable b 1 1 7 cases beginning in the middle of march and peaking by the beginning of april consistent with the general increase in sars cov 2 cases in ottawa observed in this period fig 3c bottom note the significant time lag in clinical voc reporting approx 10 days denoted by the orange shaded regions in fig 3c due to bottlenecks in the primary and secondary screening of nasopharyngeal swabs due to both lab and data entry delays during a period of high disease incidence in the community personal communication ottawa public health we calculated the proportion of n501y n501y n501y e484 n501y e484k cases relative to all cases and plotted this based on episode date fig 3c top for simplicity we included n501y e484k cases i e not b 1 1 7 as we could not distinguish b 1 1 7 b 1 351 p 1 cases from the earlier singleplex derived n501y counts moreover n501y e484k cases did not materially contribute to case proportion in the study window fig s2b thus considering all n501y cases derived from both singleplex and duoplex testing simplified our analysis and interpretation a cursory examination shows that the distribution of clinical n501y case proportion generally followed that of the wastewater d3l allele frequency over time fig 3c top exceptions include in the first half of march when a bump in clinical n501y cases was observed that wasn t matched in the wastewater data we speculate that this might have been caused by sampling bias i e overrepresentation of travelers or outbreaks and non b 1 1 7 vocs that may have been captured by the n501y singleplex assay additionally we observed a suppression of wastewater n1 signal due to snowmelt in early march that may have resulted in false negatives for d3l we also observed a loss of correlation due to clinical reporting time lags towards the end of the study period in late april notwithstanding these biases associated with both the clinical and wastewater data when we considered 21 paired clinical wastewater observations in the period of january 1 april 15 2021 omitting the clinical reporting lag period of april 16 28 2021 we found a high correlation that deviated significantly from zero rs 0 861 p 0 0001 between b 1 1 7 specific clinical case proportions and wastewater allele frequencies fig 3d during the initial phase of the b 1 1 7 epidemic in ottawa when clinical cases were low the wastewater assay had insufficient sensitivity leading to 11 non detect observations between january 16 and march 20 these zero values skew the distribution and we therefore repeated our correlation analysis omitting the non detected observation pairs fig 3e this 2nd analysis also showed a strong correlation that deviates significantly from zero rs 0 714 p 0 008 finally to again validate the reliability and specificity of the d3l qrt pcr assay in reporting b 1 1 7 viral rna in wastewater an influent sampled collected at ottawa wrrf on april 25 2021 was sent for metagenomic sequencing to nml timepoint indicated in fig 3c landgraff et al 2021 as was seen with the barrie sample the ottawa wastewater sample yielded a consensus b 1 1 7 metagenome 4 conclusion these data support the use of wastewater based allele specific qrt pcr strategies to follow the emergence and proportion of voc specific rna signal that makes up total wastewater sars cov 2 rna signal in populations served by wrrfs we demonstrate that an allele specific qrt pcr assay targeting a single locus on the sars cov 2 genome can provide sufficiently high lineage specificity and detection sensitivity in the wastewater context we also demonstrate good correlation between two independent measures of voc b 1 1 7 infection in a population namely clinical case proportion and wastewater allele frequency which together can be used to triangulate incidence and prevalence of voc specific infections the latter method to monitor voc appears less susceptible to data inaccuracies and bottlenecks associated with scaling that occurs during times of elevated disease incidence in the community moreover the flexibility of this proxy measure of covid 19 incidence allows rapid and parallel implementation of multiple assays targeting other voc specific alleles within existing wbe surveillance architectures in conclusion our study demonstrates that targeting signature mutations in the n gene with allele specific primer extension qrt pcr represents a viable strategy to quantitatively monitor emerging voc in wastewater over time with high sensitivity specificity and speed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

xiamen university xiamen 361102 china corresponding author secondary water supply systems swsss are characterized by long water stagnation and low levels of chlorine residuals which may pose a high microbial risk to terminal users in this study the swsss of 12 residential neighborhoods in a metropolitan area of 5 million people in southeastern china were seasonally investigated to assess their microbial risks by determining more than 30 physicochemical and biological parameters although the microbiological quality of swss water met the requirements of the standards for drinking water quality of china it did deteriorate in various aspects the heterotrophic plate counts with r2a media were high 100 cfu ml in some swss tank and tap water samples propidium monoazide pma qpcr revealed a one magnitude higher abundance of viable bacteria in the tank and tap water samples average 103 63 1 10 and 103 65 1 25 gene copies ml respectively compared with the input water samples and enterococcus acanthamoeba and hartmannella vermiformis were only detected in the tanks in particular the high detection frequency of legionella in 35 tank and 21 tap water samples suggested it is a supplementary microbial safety indicator in swsss the microbial regrowth potential was more obvious in summer and illumina sequencing also demonstrated distinct seasonal changes in the relative abundance of bacterial gene sequences at the genus level turbidity and residual chlorine were closely connected with total bacterial biomass and the latter seemed responsible for microbial community structure alteration the extremely low chlorine residuals associated with a high abundance of total bacteria as high as 106 48 gene copies ml and legionella as high as 106 71 gene copies 100 ml in the closed valve tanks highlighted the high microbial risk increased by mishandling the operation of swsss this study found that swsss possessed a higher microbial risk than the drinking water network which suggested that the frequency and scope of monitoring the microbial risk of swsss in megacities should be strengthened for the purpose of waterborne epidemic disease prevention and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords secondary water supply systems microbial risk water stagnation residual chlorine pma qpcr illumina sequencing 1 introduction in recent years increasing numbers of residential neighborhoods called ju min xiao qu in chinese with high rise buildings have been built in large cities to cope with the scarcity of land resources due to rapid urbanization worldwide secondary water supply systems swsss also meaning onsite water storage systems are commonly built inside such building infrastructures and provide water to the higher floors to compensate for the deficiency of hydraulic pressure in the municipal pipe network in modern cities li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 as components of water supply infrastructure swsss play an important role in ensuring the health and welfare of residents living on high floors usually swsss are relatively simple as they are mainly composed of water storage tanks and water pumps but the mismatch between storage tank size and water demand should be considered since it may result in low water turnover and long water stagnation miyagi et al 2017 water stagnation is an important driving factor responsible for the deterioration of drinking water quality in storage tanks such as chlorine loss warm temperature leaching of metals and sediment accumulation evison and sunna 2001 lu et al 2015 ziadat 2005 more importantly these features can trigger serious microbial contamination in swsss high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria bacterial 16s rrna genes fungal counts and potential pathogens such as legionella and amoebae have been detected in water storage tanks worldwide evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 customers utilizing the tap water provided by swsss therefore might be exposed to high microbial risk although microbial contamination in swsss has been widely discussed there are limits in detection methods and research scales the detection methods used for quantifying microbial contamination are biased and most researchers tend to use single culture dependent evison and sunna 2001 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 or culture independent li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 methods culture based methods play a paramount role in regular water quality monitoring however the microbial community structure in swsss is complex evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 only small fractions of microbial groups can be detected by na plates while many can grow on oligotrophic r2a plates but the majority of microorganisms are in a viable but nonculturable vbnc state in drinking water including most pathogenic bacteria guo et al 2021 these vbnc state pathogens might resuscitate in the intestines and express their virulence ramamurthy et al 2014 currently there is still a lack of paradigms combining culture dependent and culture independent methods to comprehensively assess microbial risk in swsss in addition the population size of most cities is continuously expanding for example 96 cities in china reached million inhabitant levels in 2019 according to the urban construction statistical yearbook of china 2020 the water distribution networks of these large cities are huge interconnected and complex which might provide different niches and differently shaped microbiota from those in small scale distribution networks li et al 2018a unfortunately the seasonal and spatial microbial safety of swsss in cities with million inhabitant population levels remains unknown the main purpose of this study was to comprehensively investigate the microbial characteristics and health risk of swsss especially seasonal and spatial influences in cities with a million inhabitant scale population the specific objectives were 1 to reveal the temporal and spatial microbial community characteristics and potential microbial risks in swsss 2 to determine the relationship between physicochemical water parameters and the microbial community and 3 to provide qualitative and quantitative support for the scientific management and operation of swsss 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary water supply systems this study was conducted in residential neighborhoods of xiamen fujian province china xiamen has accelerated its urbanization in recent years and its permanent population reached 5 16 million in 2020 according to communiqué of the seventh national census of xiamen city xiamen municipal bureau of statistics 2021 seven water plants jointly serve its six districts with different kinds of water sources including the jiulongjiang river bantou reservoir shidou reservoir and tingxi reservoir a large number of residential neighborhoods with high rise buildings were constructed and different types of property companies participate in the management of the residential neighborhoods although the local health department has strengthened the water quality monitoring of swsss in residential neighborhoods a systematic microbial risk evaluation has not been carried out in this study two representative residential neighborhoods were chosen in each administrative district and a total of twelve residential neighborhoods were selected fig 1 a among them four kinds of swss layouts were noted fig 1b one residential neighborhood in the huli district employed an on site underground tank coupled with a rooftop tank fig 1b 1 two neighborhoods in the haicang district employed one storage tank fig 1b 2 most of the selected neighborhoods employed double tanks fig 1b 3 however the water valve of one storage tank in some neighborhoods was closed fig 1b 4 in addition four residential neighborhoods employed concrete tile water tanks while the others applied stainless steel water tanks fig 1a 2 2 sample collection and processing drinking water in swsss was seasonally sampled at four time periods oct 14th 2019 nov 21st 2019 autumn dec 27th 2019 jan 14th 2020 winter may 6th 2020 june 2nd 2020 spring and july 10th 2020 aug 8th 2020 summer due to the impact of the covid 19 epidemic water samples were only collected from six residential neighborhoods in winter a total of 121 water samples were collected during this investigation and the numbers of water samples in each event were as follows autumn 32 winter 18 spring 34 summer 37 in each swss three kinds of water samples i e inputs tanks and taps were collected for the input water samples the faucet was chosen on the first floor which was directly attached to the central drinking water distribution systems of the residential building or in the park of the residential neighborhood for the tank water samples most of the storage tanks were equipped with siphons that were chosen for sampling and some tank water samples were collected through the drain pipe of the storage tank for the tap water samples floors 7 30 which were connected to the swsss of the residential building were randomly selected at each sampling site after the tap water and drain pipe water were flushed for 5 min at the maximum flow velocity the water sample was then collected using a 20 l polyethylene plastic bucket which had been treated overnight with sodium hypochlorite the collected water samples were then transported to the laboratory within 2 hrs for later use with respect to the method of collecting tap water samples after flushing for 5 min the rationale lies not only in the national guideline for taking tap water samples the ministry of health of the p r china 2006 but also in the real situation as the following i e the daily water consumption per capita in xiamen was about 163 l xiamen water resources bureau 2019 in general there are 2 4 persons in a family in xiamen the total water consumption by a family per day was about 300 600 l although people don t flush water for minutes at one time the total duration for using water should be much longer flushing for 5 min means 150 200 l water passes away it is about 1 3 1 2 of the daily usage so taking water samples from this point should be acceptable one liter of each water sample was placed in a glass bottle and then stored at 4 c within 24 hrs for chemical analysis of water quality parameters sodium thiosulfate was added to quench the chlorine residuals for bacterial cultivation each water sample with the maximum volume was filtered through a 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane millipore usa to collect the planktonic bacteria all filtered membranes were treated with propidium monoazide pma biotium usa following our previous study guo et al 2021 and the treated membranes were then stored at 80 c for dna extraction 2 3 water quality analysis the water samples were measured in situ for water temperature

was used to perform one way anova to compare physiochemical and or biological data between the three groups of water samples nonparametric spearman rank correlation was used to identify the relationship between physicochemical water quality parameters and target microbial biomass li et al 2018a redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the effects of physicochemical water quality parameters on microbial community structure zhang et al 2021b nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to assess the similarity in microbial community structure among water samples with bray curtis dissimilarity the calculated rda and nmds analyses used the vegan package in r software www r project org 3 results 3 1 water quality characteristics the variation in water physicochemical parameters is shown in fig 2 fig s2 and table s2 the average water temperature ranged from 18 90 0 97 c to 31 63 0 71 c and correlated with seasonal changes fig s2a a significant increase in do was observed in the tank and tap water samples average 7 96 0 63 mg l and 7 98 0 65 mg l respectively compared with the input water samples average 7 58 0 85 mg l p 0 05 fig 2c especially in summer fig s2c 4 similarly the turbidity was significantly higher in the tank water samples average 0 38 0 33 ntu than the input water samples average 0 19 0 10 ntu p 0 05 fig 2d especially in summer fig s2d 4 approximately 69 of tank and 48 of tap water samples had increased turbidity of more than 20 relative to input water samples table s3 which means that the management of the swsss needs to be improved furthermore three tank water samples sphlbrt1 1 sujma1 1 and susma1 1 were found to be higher than the chinese drinking water standard gb 5749 2006 for turbidity 1 ntu table s2 with high increased ratio 323 950 of turbidity from input water samples to the three tank water samples was observed table s3 in addition no significant difference in turbidity was observed between the tank and input water samples collected from closed valve tanks p 0 05 fig s4h and different tank materials p 0 05 fig s5a significant reductions in residual chlorine were observed in the tank and tap water samples average 0 44 0 20 and 0 42 0 21 mg l respectively compared with the input water samples average 0 57 0 23 mg l p 0 05 fig 2e approximately 51 of tank and 55 of tap water samples had a chlorine disinfectant decrease of more than 20 relative to input water samples table s3 further emphasizing the importance of strengthening the management of swsss high correlation was observed between the change ratio of residual chlorine and the bacterial 16s rrna gene figs s3c and s3d significant decrease in residual chlorine concentration from input water samples to tank and tap water samples was presented in summer p 0 05 fig s2e furthermore a significant loss of chlorine disinfectant was observed in the closed valve tank water samples p 0 05 fig s4i with a percent reduction of free chlorine residual of 45 to 99 table s3 continuous reduction of chlorine disinfectant was observed in the building structure where underground and roof storage tanks were used in combination table s2 the residual chlorine concentration of the input water samples varied in different districts and the haicang district was the lowest during the investigation compared with other districts p 0 05 fig 3a in addition the tank materials gave little influence on the decrease of chlorine residuals in haicang district fig s5b in addition there were no obvious changes in the concentrations of so4 2 no3 n tn and toc figs 2f i the concentrations of po4 3 nh4 n and no2 n in most water samples were below the detection limits table s2 it should be noted that the concentrations of so4 2 no3 n and tn in the districts of huli haicang and siming were higher than those in the tongan and xiangan districts table s2 which could be ascribed to different water sources 3 2 bacterial regrowth potential in swsss the bacterial biomass of the water samples quantified by the heterotrophic plate count and pma qpcr methods during the investigation are presented in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the results demonstrated that the total cultivable bacteria in the tank and tap water samples were slightly higher than that of input water samples reflected by r2a fig 4a it is not surprising that few water samples presented positive results with na table s2 however the abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was significantly higher in the tank and tap water samples average 103 63 1 10 and 103 65 1 25 gene copies ml respectively than in the input water samples average 103 08 0 91 gene copies ml p 0 05 fig 5a suggesting significant bacterial regrowth in the swsss in addition there is no doubt that the potential for bacterial regrowth in summer was higher than that in other seasons fig s6a a significantly higher abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was observed in the closed valve tank water samples 105 32 1 16 gene copies ml than in the input and tap water samples 102 91 1 05 and 102 96 1 15 gene copies ml respectively p 0 05 fig s4m the bacterial biomass of input water samples in haicang district was higher than that of the other districts during the investigation fig 3b however no difference in the bacterial regrowth potential was observed between the two kinds of tank materials in haicang district fig s5c 3 3 detection of fungi in swsss cultivable fungi were detected in most water samples at low levels 20 cfu 100 ml fig 4b however a high abundance of the pathogenic fungal 28s rrna gene average of 103 17 0 91 103 51 0 83 gene copies 100 ml was detected fig 5b no difference in total fungi among the three groups of water samples was observed in addition no seasonal variation in fungal biomass was noted fig s6b 3 4 occurrence of opportunistic and enteric bacterial pathogens as shown in fig 5 two enteric pathogens and seven opportunistic pathogens were discovered during the investigation mycobacteria spp was detected in 74 of the water samples and a significantly higher abundance of the mycobacteria spp was detected in the tap water samples p 0 05 fig 5c especially in summer fig s6c the detection frequencies of legionella spp in the tank and tap water samples 35 and 21 respectively were higher than that of the input water 9 with comparable gene copy numbers fig 5d specifically the gene copy numbers of legionella spp in input tank and tap water samples were measured as 100 3 87 gene copies 100 ml 100 6 71 gene copies 100 ml and 100 4 36 gene copies 100 ml respectively it should be noted that the closed valve tank water samples presented a high abundance of legionella with 102 84 6 71 gene copies 100 ml l pneumophila with low abundance 101 99 gene copies 100 ml was only detected in one tank water sample in addition the water samples yielded low detection frequencies of enterococcus spp acanthamoeba spp h vermiformis salmonella spp staphylococcus aureus and aeromonas hydrophilia fig 5d enterococcus 101 96 3 43 gene copies 100 ml acanthamoeba 101 91 2 38 gene copies 100 ml and h vermiformis 103 43 4 10 gene copies 100 ml were only detected in tank water samples on the other hand salmonella staphylococcus aureus and aeromonas hydrophilia presented low gene copy numbers 101 08 3 38 gene copies 100 ml in tap water samples 3 5 microbial community structure in swsss a total of 805 000 high quality illumina sequences of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were obtained from 115 water samples assigned to 29 phyla and 604 genera proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the majority of water samples relative abundance 28 99 9 followed by bacteroidetes 0 70 actinobacteria 0 37 and firmicutes 0 13 according to their overall abundance in pooled water samples fig s7 at the genus level season dependent microbial community composition was observed fig 6 phreatobacter was the dominant genus in water samples collected in autumn winter and spring however pseudomonas and rhizobiales unclassified became the dominant groups in summer water samples ralstonia with high relative abundance was concentrated in some water samples collected in autumn in general a clear separation was observed by sampling season for the water samples in nmds analysis adonis r2 0 231 p 0 01 figs 7 a adonis r2 0 21 p 0 05 fig 7d this indicated that the total microbial community structure gradually succeeded as the water temperature rose and the summer water samples presented a dramatic variation in total microbial composition the nmds also revealed tight clustering of water samples by the sampling area adonis r2 0 159 p 0 01 fig 7b the type of water sample had little effect on its classification adonis r2 0 032 p 0 05 fig 7c however the closed valve tank water samples presented dramatic community shifts among the three groups of water samples adonis r2 0 259 p 0 01 fig 7e this phenomenon suggested that the extremely low chlorine residuals could reshape the unique microbial community composition in swsss in addition the materials of the storage tank did not affect the microbial variation adonis r2 0 024 p 0 05 fig 7f 3 6 correlation between physicochemical water quality parameters and microbiomes correlations between the physicochemical water quality parameters and the abundance of target microorganisms were analyzed by utilizing a nonparametric spearman rank correlation approach residual chlorine displayed negative associations with all target microorganisms total water samples r 0 357 to 0 676 p 0 01 table 1 in addition a high positive correlation was noted between turbidity and total bacteria r 0 500 p 0 01 and mycobacterium spp r 0 521 p 0 01 in tank water samples table s4 rda was performed to analyze the influence of physicochemical water quality parameters on microbial community structure at the otu level in which rda1 and rda2 explained 25 98 of the total variation fig 8 temperature was the most significant explanatory variable for the variation in microbial community structure with a maximum interpretation ratio of 26 92 followed by so4 2 19 08 do 12 75 and residual chlorine 13 15 table 2 ph 3 02 and turbidity 2 66 exhibited the lowest influence on the variation in microbial community structure 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of microbial pathogens in swsss it has been reported that the opportunistic pathogens were ubiquitously existed in swsss and the occurrence pattern of opportunistic pathogens detected in this study was similar to previous studies li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 all studies have reported a high abundance of mycobacteria spp and legionella spp and a relatively lower abundance of acanthamoeba and aeromonas hydrophilia in addition a high level of pathogenic fungi and relatively low enteric pathogens i e enterococcus spp and salmonella spp were detected in this study fig 5 the high abundance of fungal 28s rrna genes was consistent with the results of previous studies investigating fungi in drinking water van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 and concrete tile tank water novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 this might be due to their high resistance to chlorine pereira et al 2013 and the presence of fungal hyphae with large dna copies novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 also found that diverse fungal isolates from a concrete tile tank could produce acids which threatened the tank material in addition the primers used in this study targeted several pathogenic fungal genera vollmer et al 2008 therefore further scrutiny of pathogenic fungal species is needed to clarify the exposure risk in local drinking water systems attention should also be paid to the disinfection of fungi at swsss the ubiquitous presence of mycobacteria in swsss might be associated with its characteristics of biofilm formation and chlorine resistance vaerewijck et al 2005 a high abundance of mycobacteria has also been found in swsss around the world li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 lin et al 2019 reported that m intracellulare m abscessus m avium m kansasii m massiliense and m fortuitum were the most frequent clinical species detected in fujian high frequency detection of legionella spp and relatively low levels of l pneumophila were consistent with the results of previous studies investigating legionella populations in swsss li et al 2018a and drinking water distribution systems lu et al 2016 furthermore diverse legionella species were isolated from a drinking water distribution system in spain salinas et al 2021 l pneumophila is the most important clinical species due to its pathogenicity in legionnaires disease lechevallier 2019 despite its relatively low proportion more attention should be given to l pneumophila therefore the presence of mycobacteria and legionella in local swsss can be a potential threat to public health and should be examined thoroughly with complementary techniques such as selective media to identify the specific exposure risks of microbial species acanthamoeba is known to produce a rare but serious infection acanthamoeba keratitis anger and lally 2008 h vermiformis was one of the most representative genera in drinking water networks delafont et al 2013 it is well known that free living amoebae such as acanthamoeba and h vermiformis can serve as hosts of legionella and mycobacteria delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2014 a high correlation between quantities of legionella and acanthamoeba has been found in swss lu et al 2015 however it seems that there was no positive correlation between these two pathogens in this study fig 5d it is known that a large volume of water 100 l is recommended for the detection of protozoans such as cryptosporidium and giardia in the standard examination methods for drinking water gb t 5750 2006 therefore the low frequency of amoebae species might be partially due to the small sampling volume used in this study 4 2 increased microbial risks in swsss water storage tanks represent an ideal place for microbial growth given their unique characteristic of low chlorine residuals li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 higher abundances of the total bacterial 16s rrna gene and mycobacteria spp were detected in storage tank and tap water samples than in input water samples in this study fig 5 which was in agreement with the results from shanghai s residential buildings by li et al 2018a in addition gene markers of acanthamoeba enterococcus spp h vermiformis legionella spp and s aureus were detected only in tank and tap water samples rather than input water samples indicating that deteriorated water gave microbial risks of pathogenic microorganisms in swsss more seriously a higher abundance and frequency of legionella spp were detected in the tank and tap water samples than in the input water samples and similar results were found for bulk water by li et al 2018a and sediments by lu et al 2015 in swsss which indicates that swsss might be a non ignorable reservoirs for legionella spp it is well known that some species e g l pneumophila of legionella spp are pathogens with a high capability to cause infection so high attention must be paid to their extremely high detection together the results indicated that consumers who use the tap waters served by the swsss in this study might be exposed to higher microbial risk 4 3 dominant bacterial groups in swsss the microbial compositions in this study were similar to those in a previous study in swsss in which proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant microbial groups li et al 2018a and the relative abundance of the genera detected in this study exhibited distinct seasonal changes at the genus level fig 6 phreatobacter was the main genus in most of the water samples and occupies the dominant position in drinking water across the world perrin et al 2019 stanish et al 2016 it is not surprising that a high abundance of phreatobacter was observed since the concentration of residual chlorine in this study ranged from 0 01 to 1 00 mg l as stanish et al 2016 found that this species was more abundant in low chlorine 1 mg l which was also confirmed by perrin et al 2019 the presented high abundance of rhizobiales unclassified in the summer might be due to warm water wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a found that the average number of otus assigned to pseudomonas was significantly higher in stagnate water in indoor pipes but we could not explain the large percentages of pseudomonas present in summer water samples in addition it is still unclear why ralstonia presented high concentrations and as a suggestion further studies regarding the genera pseudomonas and ralstonia in swsss are recommended due to their high infection levels ribas et al 2000 ryan and adley 2014 4 4 dominant water quality factors influencing microbial biomass turbidity and residual chlorine were water quality parameters that were closely related to microbial biomass in this study high correlation between turbidity and the total bacterial biomass was only observed in the tank water samples table s4 while residual chlorine had a high correlation with the total bacterial biomass overall table 1 in addition turbidity and residual chlorine were the two important water quality parameters that presented a significant difference between the three groups of water samples in this study fig 2 a significant increase in turbidity in tank water samples might be associated with aging and corrosion of the inner walls zhang et al 2021b and the local scaling caused by organic acids secreted by bacteria and fungi novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 chlorine residuals were the most important factor in inhibiting bacterial regrowth in drinking water but it is known that maintaining the stability of chlorine residuals in swsss is challenging due to water stagnation evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a miyagi et al 2017 a high correlation between the change ratio of residual chlorine and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance of water samples from inputs to tanks and taps was observed fig s3 although the change ratio of turbidity presented a low correlation with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance a high correlation between turbidity and the total bacterial biomass was observed in the tank water samples table s4 roos et al 2017 also reported that acute gastrointestinal illness was strongly correlated with high turbidity thus we set a change ratio of 20 of turbidity and residual chlorine when the magnitude of the changes exceeds 20 there might be a greater microbial risk unfortunately at least half of the tank and tap water samples compared with input water samples had changes in turbidity and residual chlorine values by more than 20 in the present study table s3 moreover the samples with residual chlorine that did not meet the drinking water standard 0 05 mg l gb 5749 2006 were mainly collected from storage tanks table s2 especially closed valve storage tanks therefore a reliable method to control microbial risk is tuning residual chlorine in the swsss in addition a supplemental disinfection device such as uv can be employed to further reduce the microbial risk in swsss li et al 2018b 4 5 effect of environmental factors on microbial community structure in this study nmds and rda illustrated that the season i e water temperature and sampling area i e the city in which the system is located were the dominant factors affecting the microbial community structure the overarching influence of season on microbial communities could likely be ascribed to the water temperature changes over a year fig 7a as the temperature had the largest interpretation ratio for the variation in microbial community structure table 2 in addition significant microbial regrowth and a reduction in residual chlorine from input water samples to tank and tap water samples were observed in summer figs s2e and s6a which indicated that the water temperature was one of the most important factors driving the changes in microbiomes multiple water sources jointly guarantee the water demand of xiamen and han et al 2020 found that source water contributed a huge proportion 50 30 to shaping the tap water microbial community structure in addition the interactions between water chemistry pipe materials and other factors in the large and complex water distribution system induced significant differences in chlorine residuals among the districts fig 3a and further shaped the districts microbiome li et al 2018a wang et al 2015 although chlorine disinfectant was not the most important factor that shaped the microbial community structure a dramatic community shift was observed in the closed valve tank water samples fig 7e which might be due to the regrowth of some microbial groups under extremely low chlorine conditions since a high negative correlation was noted between chlorine disinfectant and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance in this study table 1 the changes in the microbial community structure and the inactivation of microorganisms caused by chlorine disinfectant cannot be ignored martin et al 2020 pereira et al 2013 therefore from the perspective of the swsss themselves residual chlorine was also an important factor inducing the changes in microbial community structure 4 6 effect of swss operation on the bacterial community a special secondary water supply mode double tanks with one tank valve closed was noted in this study fig 1b4 after closing the water valve of the storage tanks the bulk water was mainly supplied to the taps through the open valve storage tank and therefore the water in the closed valve storage tank might stagnate for a couple of days or even weeks serious microbial contamination e g legionella spp and significantly low chlorine residuals were observed in this type of tank water sample p 0 05 figs 5d and s4 more importantly an obvious microbial community structure was present in different water groups in the residential neighborhoods with closed valve tank fig 7e than in the overall sample sites fig 7c as evidenced by the adonis analysis p 0 01 vs p 0 05 the results illustrated that unreasonable operation of swsss could cause serious deterioration of water quality compared with the normal water supply mode and maintaining the fluidity of the water in the storage tank was important to reduce microbial risk tank materials can strongly influence microbial communities and evison and sunna 2001 found a higher similarity of microbial taxa between water samples from two cast iron water tanks compared with fiberglass and polyethylene tanks among the two kinds of storage tanks located in haicang district selected for comparison in this study no significant differences in residual chlorine turbidity microbial biomass or microbial community structure were observed figs s5 and 7f this might be due to the bulk water that can be continuously renewed and maintained at the same level of chlorine residuals and therefore the microbial regrowth in the selected two storage tanks was not serious and presented only a small difference 5 conclusions this is the first comprehensive investigation of seasonal and spatial microbiomes in swsss to reveal the microbial risks over one year in a developed region the microbial risks were determined by culture dependent and culture independent methods which makes our results more comprehensive precise and reliable we are convinced that the following conclusions have guiding significance for the biosafety control of urban drinking water 1 on the whole the water quality in swsss could meet the requirements of drinking water standards including microbial parameters however the microbial risk was actually increased based on the detection of specific and non regulated microorganisms via pma qpcr 2 the detection of diverse pathogens illustrated that the local swsss were important reservoirs for viable opportunistic and enteric pathogens a significant increase in the abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and legionella was observed in swsss together with the detection of enterococcus acanthamoeba and h vermiformis primarily in storage tanks these results highlighted the promoting role of swsss in microbial regrowth and colonization of potential pathogens in particular the microbial regrowth potential was more obvious in summer which needs to receive more attention 3 in view of the very high detected abundance and frequency of legionella spp in swsss legionella spp was recommended as a supplementary indicator to evaluate the microbial safety of the local swsss 4 low chlorine residuals were the dominant factor driving microbial regrowth and microbial community shifts in swsss in addition we should pay attention to the changes in the microbial community caused by regional differences and the increase in water temperature and turbidity 5 low chlorine residuals dramatic changes in microbial community structure and the high abundance of total bacteria and legionella in the closed valve tank water samples highlighted that mishandled operation of swsss could increase microbial risk credit

microbial risk to terminal users in this study the swsss of 12 residential neighborhoods in a metropolitan area of 5 million people in southeastern china were seasonally investigated to assess their microbial risks by determining more than 30 physicochemical and biological parameters although the microbiological quality of swss water met the requirements of the standards for drinking water quality of china it did deteriorate in various aspects the heterotrophic plate counts with r2a media were high 100 cfu ml in some swss tank and tap water samples propidium monoazide pma qpcr revealed a one magnitude higher abundance of viable bacteria in the tank and tap water samples average 103 63 1 10 and 103 65 1 25 gene copies ml respectively compared with the input water samples and enterococcus acanthamoeba and hartmannella vermiformis were only detected in the tanks in particular the high detection frequency of legionella in 35 tank and 21 tap water samples suggested it is a supplementary microbial safety indicator in swsss the microbial regrowth potential was more obvious in summer and illumina sequencing also demonstrated distinct seasonal changes in the relative abundance of bacterial gene sequences at the genus level turbidity and residual chlorine were closely connected with total bacterial biomass and the latter seemed responsible for microbial community structure alteration the extremely low chlorine residuals associated with a high abundance of total bacteria as high as 106 48 gene copies ml and legionella as high as 106 71 gene copies 100 ml in the closed valve tanks highlighted the high microbial risk increased by mishandling the operation of swsss this study found that swsss possessed a higher microbial risk than the drinking water network which suggested that the frequency and scope of monitoring the microbial risk of swsss in megacities should be strengthened for the purpose of waterborne epidemic disease prevention and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords secondary water supply systems microbial risk water stagnation residual chlorine pma qpcr illumina sequencing 1 introduction in recent years increasing numbers of residential neighborhoods called ju min xiao qu in chinese with high rise buildings have been built in large cities to cope with the scarcity of land resources due to rapid urbanization worldwide secondary water supply systems swsss also meaning onsite water storage systems are commonly built inside such building infrastructures and provide water to the higher floors to compensate for the deficiency of hydraulic pressure in the municipal pipe network in modern cities li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 as components of water supply infrastructure swsss play an important role in ensuring the health and welfare of residents living on high floors usually swsss are relatively simple as they are mainly composed of water storage tanks and water pumps but the mismatch between storage tank size and water demand should be considered since it may result in low water turnover and long water stagnation miyagi et al 2017 water stagnation is an important driving factor responsible for the deterioration of drinking water quality in storage tanks such as chlorine loss warm temperature leaching of metals and sediment accumulation evison and sunna 2001 lu et al 2015 ziadat 2005 more importantly these features can trigger serious microbial contamination in swsss high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria bacterial 16s rrna genes fungal counts and potential pathogens such as legionella and amoebae have been detected in water storage tanks worldwide evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 customers utilizing the tap water provided by swsss therefore might be exposed to high microbial risk although microbial contamination in swsss has been widely discussed there are limits in detection methods and research scales the detection methods used for quantifying microbial contamination are biased and most researchers tend to use single culture dependent evison and sunna 2001 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 or culture independent li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 methods culture based methods play a paramount role in regular water quality monitoring however the microbial community structure in swsss is complex evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 only small fractions of microbial groups can be detected by na plates while many can grow on oligotrophic r2a plates but the majority of microorganisms are in a viable but nonculturable vbnc state in drinking water including most pathogenic bacteria guo et al 2021 these vbnc state pathogens might resuscitate in the intestines and express their virulence ramamurthy et al 2014 currently there is still a lack of paradigms combining culture dependent and culture independent methods to comprehensively assess microbial risk in swsss in addition the population size of most cities is continuously expanding for example 96 cities in china reached million inhabitant levels in 2019 according to the urban construction statistical yearbook of china 2020 the water distribution networks of these large cities are huge interconnected and complex which might provide different niches and differently shaped microbiota from those in small scale distribution networks li et al 2018a unfortunately the seasonal and spatial microbial safety of swsss in cities with million inhabitant population levels remains unknown the main purpose of this study was to comprehensively investigate the microbial characteristics and health risk of swsss especially seasonal and spatial influences in cities with a million inhabitant scale population the specific objectives were 1 to reveal the temporal and spatial microbial community characteristics and potential microbial risks in swsss 2 to determine the relationship between physicochemical water parameters and the microbial community and 3 to provide qualitative and quantitative support for the scientific management and operation of swsss 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary water supply systems this study was conducted in residential neighborhoods of xiamen fujian province china xiamen has accelerated its urbanization in recent years and its permanent population reached 5 16 million in 2020 according to communiqué of the seventh national census of xiamen city xiamen municipal bureau of statistics 2021 seven water plants jointly serve its six districts with different kinds of water sources including the jiulongjiang river bantou reservoir shidou reservoir and tingxi reservoir a large number of residential neighborhoods with high rise buildings were constructed and different types of property companies participate in the management of the residential neighborhoods although the local health department has strengthened the water quality monitoring of swsss in residential neighborhoods a systematic microbial risk evaluation has not been carried out in this study two representative residential neighborhoods were chosen in each administrative district and a total of twelve residential neighborhoods were selected fig 1 a among them four kinds of swss layouts were noted fig 1b one residential neighborhood in the huli district employed an on site underground tank coupled with a rooftop tank fig 1b 1 two neighborhoods in the haicang district employed one storage tank fig 1b 2 most of the selected neighborhoods employed double tanks fig 1b 3 however the water valve of one storage tank in some neighborhoods was closed fig 1b 4 in addition four residential neighborhoods employed concrete tile water tanks while the others applied stainless steel water tanks fig 1a 2 2 sample collection and processing drinking water in swsss was seasonally sampled at four time periods oct 14th 2019 nov 21st 2019 autumn dec 27th 2019 jan 14th 2020 winter may 6th 2020 june 2nd 2020 spring and july 10th 2020 aug 8th 2020 summer due to the impact of the covid 19 epidemic water samples were only collected from six residential neighborhoods in winter a total of 121 water samples were collected during this investigation and the numbers of water samples in each event were as follows autumn 32 winter 18 spring 34 summer 37 in each swss three kinds of water samples i e inputs tanks and taps were collected for the input water samples the faucet was chosen on the first floor which was directly attached to the central drinking water distribution systems of the residential building or in the park of the residential neighborhood for the tank water samples most of the storage tanks were equipped with siphons that were chosen for sampling and some tank water samples were collected through the drain pipe of the storage tank for the tap water samples floors 7 30 which were connected to the swsss of the residential building were randomly selected at each sampling site after the tap water and drain pipe water were flushed for 5 min at the maximum flow velocity the water sample was then collected using a 20 l polyethylene plastic bucket which had been treated overnight with sodium hypochlorite the collected water samples were then transported to the laboratory within 2 hrs for later use with respect to the method of collecting tap water samples after flushing for 5 min the rationale lies not only in the national guideline for taking tap water samples the ministry of health of the p r china 2006 but also in the real situation as the following i e the daily water consumption per capita in xiamen was about 163 l xiamen water resources bureau 2019 in general there are 2 4 persons in a family in xiamen the total water consumption by a family per day was about 300 600 l although people don t flush water for minutes at one time the total duration for using water should be much longer flushing for 5 min means 150 200 l water passes away it is about 1 3 1 2 of the daily usage so taking water samples from this point should be acceptable one liter of each water sample was placed in a glass bottle and then stored at 4 c within 24 hrs for chemical analysis of water quality parameters sodium thiosulfate was added to quench the chlorine residuals for bacterial cultivation each water sample with the maximum volume was filtered through a 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane millipore usa to collect the planktonic bacteria all filtered membranes were treated with propidium monoazide pma biotium usa following our previous study guo et al 2021 and the treated membranes were then stored at 80 c for dna extraction 2 3 water quality analysis the water samples were measured in situ for water temperature

usearch programs edgar 2010 kozich et al 2013 taxonomic categories of zotus were assigned by the ezbiocloud database yoon et al 2017 after removing the archaeal algal and unclassified bacterial sequences the sampling depth for each sample was flattened to 7 000 six samples were excluded from further analysis due to the small read library the dna reads were submitted to the ncbi database http www ncbi nlm nih gov under the access number prjna722664 2 6 statistical analysis in this study water samples collected from the closed valve storage tanks with long stagnation were different from those collected from the open valve storage tanks therefore two types of data were individually used for statistical analysis in addition we compared the impact of the storage tank material on the water quality parameters e g residual chlorine turbidity and total bacteria with the water samples collected from the haicang district due to their similar swss design ibm spss 22 statistical software was used to perform one way anova to compare physiochemical and or biological data between the three groups of water samples nonparametric spearman rank correlation was used to identify the relationship between physicochemical water quality parameters and target microbial biomass li et al 2018a redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the effects of physicochemical water quality parameters on microbial community structure zhang et al 2021b nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to assess the similarity in microbial community structure among water samples with bray curtis dissimilarity the calculated rda and nmds analyses used the vegan package in r software www r project org 3 results 3 1 water quality characteristics the variation in water physicochemical parameters is shown in fig 2 fig s2 and table s2 the average water temperature ranged from 18 90 0 97 c to 31 63 0 71 c and correlated with seasonal changes fig s2a a significant increase in do was observed in the tank and tap water samples average 7 96 0 63 mg l and 7 98 0 65 mg l respectively compared with the input water samples average 7 58 0 85 mg l p 0 05 fig 2c especially in summer fig s2c 4 similarly the turbidity was significantly higher in the tank water samples average 0 38 0 33 ntu than the input water samples average 0 19 0 10 ntu p 0 05 fig 2d especially in summer fig s2d 4 approximately 69 of tank and 48 of tap water samples had increased turbidity of more than 20 relative to input water samples table s3 which means that the management of the swsss needs to be improved furthermore three tank water samples sphlbrt1 1 sujma1 1 and susma1 1 were found to be higher than the chinese drinking water standard gb 5749 2006 for turbidity 1 ntu table s2 with high increased ratio 323 950 of turbidity from input water samples to the three tank water samples was observed table s3 in addition no significant difference in turbidity was observed between the tank and input water samples collected from closed valve tanks p 0 05 fig s4h and different tank materials p 0 05 fig s5a significant reductions in residual chlorine were observed in the tank and tap water samples average 0 44 0 20 and 0 42 0 21 mg l respectively compared with the input water samples average 0 57 0 23 mg l p 0 05 fig 2e approximately 51 of tank and 55 of tap water samples had a chlorine disinfectant decrease of more than 20 relative to input water samples table s3 further emphasizing the importance of strengthening the management of swsss high correlation was observed between the change ratio of residual chlorine and the bacterial 16s rrna gene figs s3c and s3d significant decrease in residual chlorine concentration from input water samples to tank and tap water samples was presented in summer p 0 05 fig s2e furthermore a significant loss of chlorine disinfectant was observed in the closed valve tank water samples p 0 05 fig s4i with a percent reduction of free chlorine residual of 45 to 99 table s3 continuous reduction of chlorine disinfectant was observed in the building structure where underground and roof storage tanks were used in combination table s2 the residual chlorine concentration of the input water samples varied in different districts and the haicang district was the lowest during the investigation compared with other districts p 0 05 fig 3a in addition the tank materials gave little influence on the decrease of chlorine residuals in haicang district fig s5b in addition there were no obvious changes in the concentrations of so4 2 no3 n tn and toc figs 2f i the concentrations of po4 3 nh4 n and no2 n in most water samples were below the detection limits table s2 it should be noted that the concentrations of so4 2 no3 n and tn in the districts of huli haicang and siming were higher than those in the tongan and xiangan districts table s2 which could be ascribed to different water sources 3 2 bacterial regrowth potential in swsss the bacterial biomass of the water samples quantified by the heterotrophic plate count and pma qpcr methods during the investigation are presented in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the results demonstrated that the total cultivable bacteria in the tank and tap water samples were slightly higher than that of input water samples reflected by r2a fig 4a it is not surprising that few water samples presented positive results with na table s2 however the abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was significantly higher in the tank and tap water samples average 103 63 1 10 and 103 65 1 25 gene copies ml respectively than in the input water samples average 103 08 0 91 gene copies ml p 0 05 fig 5a suggesting significant bacterial regrowth in the swsss in addition there is no doubt that the potential for bacterial regrowth in summer was higher than that in other seasons fig s6a a significantly higher abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was observed in the closed valve tank water samples 105 32 1 16 gene copies ml than in the input and tap water samples 102 91 1 05 and 102 96 1 15 gene copies ml respectively p 0 05 fig s4m the bacterial biomass of input water samples in haicang district was higher than that of the other districts during the investigation fig 3b however no difference in the bacterial regrowth potential was observed between the two kinds of tank materials in haicang district fig s5c 3 3 detection of fungi in swsss cultivable fungi were detected in most water samples at low levels 20 cfu 100 ml fig 4b however a high abundance of the pathogenic fungal 28s rrna gene average of 103 17 0 91 103 51 0 83 gene copies 100 ml was detected fig 5b no difference in total fungi among the three groups of water samples was observed in addition no seasonal variation in fungal biomass was noted fig s6b 3 4 occurrence of opportunistic and enteric bacterial pathogens as shown in fig 5 two enteric pathogens and seven opportunistic pathogens were discovered during the investigation mycobacteria spp was detected in 74 of the water samples and a significantly higher abundance of the mycobacteria spp was detected in the tap water samples p 0 05 fig 5c especially in summer fig s6c the detection frequencies of legionella spp in the tank and tap water samples 35 and 21 respectively were higher than that of the input water 9 with comparable gene copy numbers fig 5d specifically the gene copy numbers of legionella spp in input tank and tap water samples were measured as 100 3 87 gene copies 100 ml 100 6 71 gene copies 100 ml and 100 4 36 gene copies 100 ml respectively it should be noted that the closed valve tank water samples presented a high abundance of legionella with 102 84 6 71 gene copies 100 ml l pneumophila with low abundance 101 99 gene copies 100 ml was only detected in one tank water sample in addition the water samples yielded low detection frequencies of enterococcus spp acanthamoeba spp h vermiformis salmonella spp staphylococcus aureus and aeromonas hydrophilia fig 5d enterococcus 101 96 3 43 gene copies 100 ml acanthamoeba 101 91 2 38 gene copies 100 ml and h vermiformis 103 43 4 10 gene copies 100 ml were only detected in tank water samples on the other hand salmonella staphylococcus aureus and aeromonas hydrophilia presented low gene copy numbers 101 08 3 38 gene copies 100 ml in tap water samples 3 5 microbial community structure in swsss a total of 805 000 high quality illumina sequences of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were obtained from 115 water samples assigned to 29 phyla and 604 genera proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the majority of water samples relative abundance 28 99 9 followed by bacteroidetes 0 70 actinobacteria 0 37 and firmicutes 0 13 according to their overall abundance in pooled water samples fig s7 at the genus level season dependent microbial community composition was observed fig 6 phreatobacter was the dominant genus in water samples collected in autumn winter and spring however pseudomonas and rhizobiales unclassified became the dominant groups in summer water samples ralstonia with high relative abundance was concentrated in some water samples collected in autumn in general a clear separation was observed by sampling season for the water samples in nmds analysis adonis r2 0 231 p 0 01 figs 7 a adonis r2 0 21 p 0 05 fig 7d this indicated that the total microbial community structure gradually succeeded as the water temperature rose and the summer water samples presented a dramatic variation in total microbial composition the nmds also revealed tight clustering of water samples by the sampling area adonis r2 0 159 p 0 01 fig 7b the type of water sample had little effect on its classification adonis r2 0 032 p 0 05 fig 7c however the closed valve tank water samples presented dramatic community shifts among the three groups of water samples adonis r2 0 259 p 0 01 fig 7e this phenomenon suggested that the extremely low chlorine residuals could reshape the unique microbial community composition in swsss in addition the materials of the storage tank did not affect the microbial variation adonis r2 0 024 p 0 05 fig 7f 3 6 correlation between physicochemical water quality parameters and microbiomes correlations between the physicochemical water quality parameters and the abundance of target microorganisms were analyzed by utilizing a nonparametric spearman rank correlation approach residual chlorine displayed negative associations with all target microorganisms total water samples r 0 357 to 0 676 p 0 01 table 1 in addition a high positive correlation was noted between turbidity and total bacteria r 0 500 p 0 01 and mycobacterium spp r 0 521 p 0 01 in tank water samples table s4 rda was performed to analyze the influence of physicochemical water quality parameters on microbial community structure at the otu level in which rda1 and rda2 explained 25 98 of the total variation fig 8 temperature was the most significant explanatory variable for the variation in microbial community structure with a maximum interpretation ratio of 26 92 followed by so4 2 19 08 do 12 75 and residual chlorine 13 15 table 2 ph 3 02 and turbidity 2 66 exhibited the lowest influence on the variation in microbial community structure 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of microbial pathogens in swsss it has been reported that the opportunistic pathogens were ubiquitously existed in swsss and the occurrence pattern of opportunistic pathogens detected in this study was similar to previous studies li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 all studies have reported a high abundance of mycobacteria spp and legionella spp and a relatively lower abundance of acanthamoeba and aeromonas hydrophilia in addition a high level of pathogenic fungi and relatively low enteric pathogens i e enterococcus spp and salmonella spp were detected in this study fig 5 the high abundance of fungal 28s rrna genes was consistent with the results of previous studies investigating fungi in drinking water van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 and concrete tile tank water novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 this might be due to their high resistance to chlorine pereira et al 2013 and the presence of fungal hyphae with large dna copies novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 also found that diverse fungal isolates from a concrete tile tank could produce acids which threatened the tank material in addition the primers used in this study targeted several pathogenic fungal genera vollmer et al 2008 therefore further scrutiny of pathogenic fungal species is needed to clarify the exposure risk in local drinking water systems attention should also be paid to the disinfection of fungi at swsss the ubiquitous presence of mycobacteria in swsss might be associated with its characteristics of biofilm formation and chlorine resistance vaerewijck et al 2005 a high abundance of mycobacteria has also been found in swsss around the world li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 lin et al 2019 reported that m intracellulare m abscessus m avium m kansasii m massiliense and m fortuitum were the most frequent clinical species detected in fujian high frequency detection of legionella spp and relatively low levels of l pneumophila were consistent with the results of previous studies investigating legionella populations in swsss li et al 2018a and drinking water distribution systems lu et al 2016 furthermore diverse legionella species were isolated from a drinking water distribution system in spain salinas et al 2021 l pneumophila is the most important clinical species due to its pathogenicity in legionnaires disease lechevallier 2019 despite its relatively low proportion more attention should be given to l pneumophila therefore the presence of mycobacteria and legionella in local swsss can be a potential threat to public health and should be examined thoroughly with complementary techniques such as selective media to identify the specific exposure risks of microbial species acanthamoeba is known to produce a rare but serious infection acanthamoeba keratitis anger and lally 2008 h vermiformis was one of the most representative genera in drinking water networks delafont et al 2013 it is well known that free living amoebae such as acanthamoeba and h vermiformis can serve as hosts of legionella and mycobacteria delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2014 a high correlation between quantities of legionella and acanthamoeba has been found in swss lu et al 2015 however it seems that there was no positive correlation between these two pathogens in this study fig 5d it is known that a large volume of water 100 l is recommended for the detection of protozoans such as cryptosporidium and giardia in the standard examination methods for drinking water gb t 5750 2006 therefore the low frequency of amoebae species might be partially due to the small sampling volume used in this study 4 2 increased microbial risks in swsss water storage tanks represent an ideal place for microbial growth given their unique characteristic of low chlorine residuals li et al 2018a lu et al 2015 higher abundances of the total bacterial 16s rrna gene and mycobacteria spp were detected in storage tank and tap water samples than in input water samples in this study fig 5 which was in agreement with the results from shanghai s residential buildings by li et al 2018a in addition gene markers of acanthamoeba enterococcus spp h vermiformis legionella spp and s aureus were detected only in tank and tap water samples rather than input water samples indicating that deteriorated water gave microbial risks of pathogenic microorganisms in swsss more seriously a higher abundance and frequency of legionella spp were detected in the tank and tap water samples than in the input water samples and similar results were found for bulk water by li et al 2018a and sediments by lu et al 2015 in swsss which indicates that swsss might be a non ignorable reservoirs for legionella spp it is well known that some species e g l pneumophila of legionella spp are pathogens with a high capability to cause infection so high attention must be paid to their extremely high detection together the results indicated that consumers who use the tap waters served by the swsss in this study might be exposed to higher microbial risk 4 3 dominant bacterial groups in swsss the microbial compositions in this study were similar to those in a previous study in swsss in which proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant microbial groups li et al 2018a and the relative abundance of the genera detected in this study exhibited distinct seasonal changes at the genus level fig 6 phreatobacter was the main genus in most of the water samples and occupies the dominant position in drinking water across the world perrin et al 2019 stanish et al 2016 it is not surprising that a high abundance of phreatobacter was observed since the concentration of residual chlorine in this study ranged from 0 01 to 1 00 mg l as stanish et al 2016 found that this species was more abundant in low chlorine 1 mg l which was also confirmed by perrin et al 2019 the presented high abundance of rhizobiales unclassified in the summer might be due to warm water wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a found that the average number of otus assigned to pseudomonas was significantly higher in stagnate water in indoor pipes but we could not explain the large percentages of pseudomonas present in summer water samples in addition it is still unclear why ralstonia presented high concentrations and as a suggestion further studies regarding the genera pseudomonas and ralstonia in swsss are recommended due to their high infection levels ribas et al 2000 ryan and adley 2014 4 4 dominant water quality factors influencing microbial biomass turbidity and residual chlorine were water quality parameters that were closely related to microbial biomass in this study high correlation between turbidity and the total bacterial biomass was only observed in the tank water samples table s4 while residual chlorine had a high correlation with the total bacterial biomass overall table 1 in addition turbidity and residual chlorine were the two important water quality parameters that presented a significant difference between the three groups of water samples in this study fig 2 a significant increase in turbidity in tank water samples might be associated with aging and corrosion of the inner walls zhang et al 2021b and the local scaling caused by organic acids secreted by bacteria and fungi novak babič and gunde cimerman 2021 chlorine residuals were the most important factor in inhibiting bacterial regrowth in drinking water but it is known that maintaining the stability of chlorine residuals in swsss is challenging due to water stagnation evison and sunna 2001 li et al 2018a miyagi et al 2017 a high correlation between the change ratio of residual chlorine and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance of water samples from inputs to tanks and taps was observed fig s3 although the change ratio of turbidity presented a low correlation with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance a high correlation between turbidity and the total bacterial biomass was observed in the tank water samples table s4 roos et al 2017 also reported that acute gastrointestinal illness was strongly correlated with high turbidity thus we set a change ratio of 20 of turbidity and residual chlorine when the magnitude of the changes exceeds 20 there might be a greater microbial risk unfortunately at least half of the tank and tap water samples compared with input water samples had changes in turbidity and residual chlorine values by more than 20 in the present study table s3 moreover the samples with residual chlorine that did not meet the drinking water standard 0 05 mg l gb 5749 2006 were mainly collected from storage tanks table s2 especially closed valve storage tanks therefore a reliable method to control microbial risk is tuning residual chlorine in the swsss in addition a supplemental disinfection device such as uv can be employed to further reduce the microbial risk in swsss li et al 2018b 4 5 effect of environmental factors on microbial community structure in this study nmds and rda illustrated that the season i e water temperature and sampling area i e the city in which the system is located were the dominant factors affecting the microbial community structure the overarching influence of season on microbial communities could likely be ascribed to the water temperature changes over a year fig 7a as the temperature had the largest interpretation ratio for the variation in microbial community structure table 2 in addition significant microbial regrowth and a reduction in residual chlorine from input water samples to tank and tap water samples were observed in summer figs s2e and s6a which indicated that the water temperature was one of the most important factors driving the changes in microbiomes multiple water sources jointly guarantee the water demand of xiamen and han et al 2020 found that source water contributed a huge proportion 50 30 to shaping the tap water microbial community structure in addition the interactions between water chemistry pipe materials and other factors in the large and complex water distribution system induced significant differences in chlorine residuals among the districts fig 3a and further shaped the districts microbiome li et al 2018a wang et al 2015 although chlorine disinfectant was not the most important factor that shaped the microbial community structure a dramatic community shift was observed in the closed valve tank water samples fig 7e which might be due to the regrowth of some microbial groups under extremely low chlorine conditions since a high negative correlation was noted between chlorine disinfectant and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance in this study table 1 the changes in the microbial community structure and the inactivation of microorganisms caused by chlorine disinfectant cannot be ignored martin et al 2020 pereira et al 2013 therefore from the perspective of the swsss themselves residual chlorine was also an important factor inducing the changes in microbial community structure 4 6 effect of swss operation on the bacterial community a special secondary water supply mode double tanks with one tank valve closed was noted in this study fig 1b4 after closing the water valve of the storage tanks the bulk water was mainly supplied to the taps through the open valve storage tank and therefore the water in the closed valve storage tank might stagnate for a couple of days or even weeks serious microbial contamination e g legionella spp and significantly low chlorine residuals were observed in this type of tank water sample p 0 05 figs 5d and s4 more importantly an obvious microbial community structure was present in different water groups in the residential neighborhoods with closed valve tank fig 7e than in the overall sample sites fig 7c as evidenced by the adonis analysis p 0 01 vs p 0 05 the results illustrated that unreasonable operation of swsss could cause serious deterioration of water quality compared with the normal water supply mode and maintaining the fluidity of the water in the storage tank was important to reduce microbial risk tank materials can strongly influence microbial communities and evison and sunna 2001 found a higher similarity of microbial taxa between water samples from two cast iron water tanks compared with fiberglass and polyethylene tanks among the two kinds of storage tanks located in haicang district selected for comparison in this study no significant differences in residual chlorine turbidity microbial biomass or microbial community structure were observed figs s5 and 7f this might be due to the bulk water that can be continuously renewed and maintained at the same level of chlorine residuals and therefore the microbial regrowth in the selected two storage tanks was not serious and presented only a small difference 5 conclusions this is the first comprehensive investigation of seasonal and spatial microbiomes in swsss to reveal the microbial risks over one year in a developed region the microbial risks were determined by culture dependent and culture independent methods which makes our results more comprehensive precise and reliable we are convinced that the following conclusions have guiding significance for the biosafety control of urban drinking water 1 on the whole the water quality in swsss could meet the requirements of drinking water standards including microbial parameters however the microbial risk was actually increased based on the detection of specific and non regulated microorganisms via pma qpcr 2 the detection of diverse pathogens illustrated that the local swsss were important reservoirs for viable opportunistic and enteric pathogens a significant increase in the abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and legionella was observed in swsss together with the detection of enterococcus acanthamoeba and h vermiformis primarily in storage tanks these results highlighted the promoting role of swsss in microbial regrowth and colonization of potential pathogens in particular the microbial regrowth potential was more obvious in summer which needs to receive more attention 3 in view of the very high detected abundance and frequency of legionella spp in swsss legionella spp was recommended as a supplementary indicator to evaluate the microbial safety of the local swsss 4 low chlorine residuals were the dominant factor driving microbial regrowth and microbial community shifts in swsss in addition we should pay attention to the changes in the microbial community caused by regional differences and the increase in water temperature and turbidity 5 low chlorine residuals dramatic changes in microbial community structure and the high abundance of total bacteria and legionella in the closed valve tank water samples highlighted that mishandled operation of swsss could increase microbial risk credit

16619,we argue that doctoral education in water needs an elevated focus towards educating game changers who can drive innovation and change towards more sustainable futures across academic and non academic settings today s doctoral graduates in water are increasingly employed outside academia and challenged to understand complex and interconnected systems to integrate and synthesize information from different disciplines and to lead the way toward increasingly creative resilient robust and socially sustainable solutions supervisors are challenged by interdisciplinary research topics and by growing diversity of objectives too often at the cost of their wellbeing the need to keep up with the rapid scientific and technological development and floods of big data is pressing we synthesize key insights from higher education literature and doctoral programs in water research to identify priority actions targeted at four key actor groups supervisors and supervisees research group university and industry the actions contribute to appropriate resourcing enabling an environment for enhanced teamwork practices and systematic structures for progress establishing supporting

challenges in human history tortajada and biswas 2020 united nations 2021 this calls for cooperation across research disciplines sectors and geographic borders water education and research are at the heart of several concurrent trends first the research landscape keeps diversifying with recently established interdisciplinary research fields such as ecohydrology mcclain et al 2012 sociohydrology pande and sivapalan 2017 and hydroeconomics booker et al 2012 as well as interdisciplinary journals such as urban water niemczynowicz 1999 and water security lall et al 2017 second the use of artificial intelligence and supercomputing in water research requires understanding of state of the art technologies and big data approaches shen 2018 third the number of doctoral graduates is growing fast for example in south korea the number of engineering doctorates increased by 1900 in 1983 2003 akay 2008 governments increasingly recognize the value of highly educated professionals for research and innovation that can tackle local regional and global water problems and anticipate future challenges carr et al 2020 duke and denicolo 2017 universities provide the formal training of water professionals besides skilled researchers consultants in industry and government and academic leaders they are increasingly called upon to educate future game changers who while excelling in their own specialization can work across disciplines drive innovation engage with stakeholders and lead interdisciplinary teams harshbarger and evans 1967 uhlenbrook and de jong 2012 steelman and mcdonnell 2017

mathematics and chemical engineering focus on developing interdisciplinary perspectives on water university of waterloo 2021 while such forerunner initiatives are to be applauded they are often implemented in isolation and prone to growing pains due to lack of institutional support one such caveat is the limited knowledge we have of the inner workings that enable and promote structural and cultural change within groups departments and institutions to fully support a rebirth of doctoral education borrego et al 2014 with this paper we aim to guide future developments for modernizing doctoral education in water research noting that a plethora of studies focus on problems and what we are doing wrong we focus on what we can do to bridge this implementation gap between persistent problems and feasible and supported solutions to make this point we first synthesize important insights from 1 empirical doctoral programs in water research and education science more broadly and 2 experiences from a pilot project 2017 2021 in a water engineering research group based in finland the latter experiences and insights were documented via workshops interviews and journey mapping throughout the project by combining insights from empirical literature and first hand experiences when piloting new ways of working we are able to identify priority actions for the key actors in doctoral education in water research including individuals research group university and industry which are presented in a roadmap 2 educating game changers what needs to change rethinking doctoral education calls for adaptation of long standing research and education practices which by tradition strongly encourage specialization and tie students to a discipline and department such as hydrology geology or engineering despite some early successes of interdisciplinary research programs they are also likely to experience constraints due to limited resources infrastructure expertise time and funding these constrains tend to reinforce existing practices rather than allow new openings for change this implies that the goals of innovative doctoral programs are not necessarily supported by the existing institutions systems or even people involved in doctoral education which has severe consequences for both students and supervisors this is especially relevant in water research which spans multiple disciplines from urban planning to political sciences and from managing pristine groundwaters to wastewater engineering the lack of formal support and encouragement together with a lack of transparency on expectations challenges both students and supervisors bastalich 2017 a frequently mentioned challenge in interdisciplinary studies is the limited understanding and support from the research environment often culminating in feelings of distress and isolation tress et al 2009 duke and denicolo 2017 two different situations can be distinguished when working at a department with a strong disciplinary focus students often face the dilemma of either adopting discipline specific norms or feeling intellectually homeless delamont et al 2003 in interdisciplinary research environments students can easily establish a collaborative research culture among themselves but connecting to external researchers is difficult one extreme case from the united states revealed that students felt the pressure to work twice as hard as they were in charge of managing an interdisciplinary research project without any institutional recognition or encouragement wallen et al 2019 high workload is another recurring theme students in interdisciplinary doctoral programs tend to be overloaded with course work and diverse expectations from projects departments and universities lindvig 2018 serlet et al 2020 such increasing workload is sometimes exacerbated by decreasing the time for completing a doctorate for example the european doctoral program science for management of rivers and their tidal systems asked students to complete requirements for interdisciplinary collaboration international mobility and management oriented research within only three years an evaluation of this program showed that scientific outputs were prioritized over the investment of time in interdisciplinary collaboration professional identity and transferable skills serlet et al 2020 other empirical research also notes that students coping responses to such challenges may have an opposite effect and result in a limited scope for creativity and experimentation or personal development lindvig 2018 wellbeing problems of doctoral students often resulting from the abovementioned reasons are well acknowledged and almost the new normal barry et al 2018 woolston 2019 the wellbeing of supervisors however appear less recognized and supported supervision of doctoral students often falls into an unorganized terrain between research and education supervisors are expected to fulfill a broad spectrum of responsibilities including management transferring research skills encouraging critical thinking and developing a relationship of inspiration and care lee 2008 the increasingly diverse goals of interdisciplinary doctoral education further challenge supervisors as research topics may go beyond their expertise a professor in water research may need to supervise students on topics from epidemiology to political science and from global food trade systems to microplastics further supervisors are expected to provide an enabling environment for research learning and collaboration but efficient supportive structures e g timeline checkpoints and responsibilities for these are often lacking nowadays doctoral programs increasingly need to prepare graduates for knowledge intensive non

16619,we argue that doctoral education in water needs an elevated focus towards educating game changers who can drive innovation and change towards more sustainable futures across academic and non academic settings today s doctoral graduates in water are increasingly employed outside academia and challenged to understand complex and interconnected systems to integrate and synthesize information from different disciplines and to lead the way toward increasingly creative resilient robust and socially sustainable solutions supervisors are challenged by interdisciplinary research topics and by growing diversity of objectives too often at the cost of their wellbeing the need to keep up with the rapid scientific and technological development and floods of big data is pressing we synthesize key insights from higher education literature and doctoral programs in water research to identify priority actions targeted at four key actor groups supervisors and supervisees research group university and industry the actions contribute to appropriate resourcing enabling an environment for enhanced teamwork practices and systematic structures for progress establishing supporting structures will leverage the much needed communities of practice involved in co creating and transforming supervision and education of doctoral students in interdisciplinary water research keywords water professional water engineering supervisors doctoral students interdisciplinary team science 1 renaissance of doctoral education in water research we are facing the greatest array of water challenges in human history tortajada and biswas 2020 united nations 2021 this calls for cooperation across research disciplines sectors and geographic borders water education and research are at the heart of several concurrent trends first the research landscape keeps diversifying with recently established interdisciplinary research fields such as ecohydrology mcclain et al 2012 sociohydrology pande and sivapalan 2017 and hydroeconomics booker et al 2012 as well as interdisciplinary journals such as urban water niemczynowicz 1999 and water security lall et al 2017 second the use of artificial intelligence and supercomputing in water research requires understanding of state of the art technologies and big data approaches shen 2018 third the number of doctoral graduates is growing fast for example in south korea the number of engineering doctorates increased by 1900 in 1983 2003 akay 2008 governments increasingly recognize the value of highly educated professionals for research and innovation that can tackle local regional and global water problems and anticipate future challenges carr et al 2020 duke and denicolo 2017 universities provide the formal training of water professionals besides skilled researchers consultants in industry and government and academic leaders they are increasingly called upon to educate future game changers who while excelling in their own specialization can work across disciplines drive innovation engage with stakeholders and lead interdisciplinary teams harshbarger and evans 1967 uhlenbrook and de jong 2012 steelman and mcdonnell 2017 vehmaa et al 2018 higher education policies echo this challenge worldwide in 2011 the european commission introduced seven key principles for innovative higher education research excellence attractive institutional environment interdisciplinary research options exposure to industry and other employment sectors international networking transferable skills training and quality assurance european commission 2011 the integrative graduate education research and training igert program in the united states 1998 2015 was a forerunner model for graduate education and training in interdisciplinary environments the last decade has seen a surge of new interdisciplinary doctoral programs in water that aim to implement the abovementioned principles some examples of such innovative programs with leading institutions in brackets are newave vrije universiteit amsterdam aims to train a new generation of future water governance leaders by equipping them with transdisciplinary skills newave 2021 international graduate school for water and development ihe delft follows the t shape model for competence development and focuses on problem oriented research and international collaboration with research and development institutes un ihe 2021 vienna doctoral programme on water resource systems 2009 2020 vienna university of technology works across ten disciplines with a focus on cross disciplinary interaction international networking and high quality mentoring carr et al 2017 2018 collaborative water program university of waterloo 11 academic units e g economics public health mathematics and chemical engineering focus on developing interdisciplinary perspectives on water university of waterloo 2021 while such forerunner initiatives are to be applauded they are often implemented in isolation and prone to growing pains due to lack of institutional support one such caveat is the limited knowledge we have of the inner workings that enable and promote structural and cultural change within groups departments and institutions to fully support a rebirth of doctoral education borrego et al 2014 with this paper we aim to guide future developments for modernizing doctoral education in water research noting that a plethora of studies focus on problems and what we are doing wrong we focus on what we can do to bridge this implementation gap between persistent problems and feasible and supported solutions to make this point we first synthesize important insights from 1 empirical doctoral programs in water research and education science more broadly and 2 experiences from a pilot project 2017 2021 in a water engineering research group based in finland the latter experiences and insights were documented via workshops interviews and journey mapping throughout the project by combining insights from empirical literature and first hand experiences when piloting new ways of working we are able to identify priority actions for the key actors in doctoral education in water research including individuals research group university and industry which are presented in a roadmap 2 educating game changers what needs to change rethinking doctoral education calls for adaptation of long standing research and education practices which by tradition strongly encourage specialization and tie students to a discipline and department such as hydrology geology or engineering despite some early successes of interdisciplinary research programs they are also likely to experience constraints due to limited resources infrastructure expertise time and funding these constrains tend to reinforce existing practices rather than allow new openings for change this implies that the goals of innovative doctoral programs are not necessarily supported by the existing institutions systems or even people involved in doctoral education which has severe consequences for both students and supervisors this is especially relevant in water research which spans multiple disciplines from urban planning to political sciences and from managing pristine groundwaters to wastewater engineering the lack of formal support and encouragement together with a lack of transparency on expectations challenges both students and supervisors bastalich 2017 a frequently mentioned challenge in interdisciplinary studies is the limited understanding and support from the research environment often culminating in feelings of distress and isolation tress et al 2009 duke and denicolo 2017 two different situations can be distinguished when working at a department with a strong disciplinary focus students often face the dilemma of either adopting discipline specific norms or feeling intellectually homeless delamont et al 2003 in interdisciplinary research environments students can easily establish a collaborative research culture among themselves but connecting to external researchers is difficult one extreme case from the united states revealed that students felt the pressure to work twice as hard as they were in charge of managing an interdisciplinary research project without any institutional recognition or encouragement wallen et al 2019 high workload is another recurring theme students in interdisciplinary doctoral programs tend to be overloaded with course work and diverse expectations from projects departments and universities lindvig 2018 serlet et al 2020 such increasing workload is sometimes exacerbated by decreasing the time for completing a doctorate for example the european doctoral program science for management of rivers and their tidal systems asked students to complete requirements for interdisciplinary collaboration international mobility and management oriented research within only three years an evaluation of this program showed that scientific outputs were prioritized over the investment of time in interdisciplinary collaboration professional identity and transferable skills serlet et al 2020 other empirical research also notes that students coping responses to such challenges may have an opposite effect and result in a limited scope for creativity and experimentation or personal development lindvig 2018 wellbeing problems of doctoral students often resulting from the abovementioned reasons are well acknowledged and almost the new normal barry et al 2018 woolston 2019 the wellbeing of supervisors however appear less recognized and supported supervision of doctoral students often falls into an unorganized terrain between research and education supervisors are expected to fulfill a broad spectrum of responsibilities including management transferring research skills encouraging critical thinking and developing a relationship of inspiration and care lee 2008 the increasingly diverse goals of interdisciplinary doctoral education further challenge supervisors as research topics may go beyond their expertise a professor in water research may need to supervise students on topics from epidemiology to political science and from global food trade systems to microplastics further supervisors are expected to provide an enabling environment for research learning and collaboration but efficient supportive structures e g timeline checkpoints and responsibilities for these are often lacking nowadays doctoral programs increasingly need to prepare graduates for knowledge intensive non
