26130,many initiatives try to integrate data from different parties to solve problems that could not be addressed by a sole participant despite the well known benefits of collaboration concerns of data privacy and confidentiality are still an obstacle that impedes progress in collaborative global research this work tackles this issue using an online learning algorithm to generate a single model where the data remains with each party and there is no need to integrate it to a single source this approach is demonstrated in building a global soil organic carbon model based on databases of field observations held by 65 different countries the model is trained by visiting each country one at a time only knowledge and parameters of the model are transferred between countries the results show that it is possible that the proposed approach yields a similar prediction accuracy compared with a model that is trained with all the data keywords data privacy digital soil mapping neural networks if the mountain won t come to muhammad then muhammad must go to the mountain turkish proverb 1 introduction the rise of big data in various disciplines has presented new opportunities to address global scale health and environmental issues by data integration analysing data compiled from various countries or agencies examples include compiling a global gene database desantis et al 2003 compiling a global soil database batjes 2009 and analysing species interaction datasets poelen et al 2014 in an ideal situation data sharing that allows full access to datasets collected by different parties can enhance collaboration between researchers and accelerate finding solutions data sharing is even associated with increased citation rates piwowar et al 2007 despite the positive nature of this collaborative spirit data sharing comes with concerns about privacy and confidentiality fienberg et al 1985 and national sovereignty the data privacy issue is commonly attended by preventing data sharing it is critical to develop techniques to enable the integration and sharing of data without losing privacy some privacy preserving methods that have been proposed include data aggregation adding noise to the original data wieland et al 2008 or data encryption kantarcioglu and clifton 2004 others include data sanitising or removing privacy sensitive information from the database which could be time consuming as an alternative to these sometimes convoluted solutions we propose a novel use of an online learning technique via machine learning ml algorithms we use the concept of transferring knowledge extracted from the data but not transferring the data itself thus preserving data privacy ml has been widely used in biophysical modelling with first appearances in the late 1980s early 1990s yost et al 1988 stockwell et al 1990 this paper explores the use of ml algorithms to generate a single model with data horizontally distributed between different parties i e each party has different rows each data holder party cannot see other parties data but yet the model can be built using all parties data the proposed solution can aid researchers of different disciplines of earth and environmental sciences which require collaborative projects the major challenge in such collaborative projects is data privacy bulatewicz et al 2013 proposed a general purpose software component as a foundation for model linkages and integrated studies were data is pulled from other sources to feed a model within a model chain data privacy issue can still be an issue in such approach the pulling step can be replaced by our approach to obtain a distributed chain of models with data partitioned between different parties our approach could also be applied to modular approaches like sme3 spatial modeling environment 3 maxwell 1999 or any model integration framework dolk and kottemann 1993 more generally our approach can be used in many other collaborative projects where difficulties when compiling data are common borgman 2012 but rarely reported first we present the theory of online learning algorithms and its optimisation strategy then we explore the use of stochastic gradient descent as a way of optimising the model from distributed data finally we demonstrate the application of online learning as a way of building a global soil carbon model where the model visits each country successively the unique solution presented in this paper enables widespread data sharing without the need for data integration and respects data privacy 2 online learners the basis of ml is to optimise parameters of the model from the data the most common way to find the optimal parameters for a given model is by minimising an objective function ml has a variety of methods to optimise this process including some modifications of the classical steepest descent method proposed by cauchy 1847 batch gradient descent bgd is a variation of this method which uses all the available data to find its way always pointing in the right direction to a minimum objective function fig 1 a the successive estimates w t of an optimal parameter w are computed by 1 w t 1 w t η t 1 l i 1 l w q z i w t where w q is the gradient of the loss function q z an observation x y composed of a set of covariates x and a response y η t the learning rate and l the total number of observations at each iteration of the bgd algorithm the average of the gradients of the loss function needs to be calculated using the entire dataset a variation of bgd stochastic gradient descent sgd approximates to the solution using a subsample of the training data sub batch at a time usually in a more erratic trajectory compared with bgd fig 1b in the case when the batch size is equal to one this is done by computing the successive estimates w t using 2 w t 1 w t η t w q z t w t by dropping the averaging operation in eq 1 the sgd algorithm can optimise a model without the need to access all the data at once in theory averaging all the small optimisation updates would yield a similar result to the one obtained by bgd for a more complete description of both algorithms we refer the reader to bottou 1998 given this characteristic sgd has been widely used in ml to solve large scale problems zhang 2004 bousquet and bottou 2008 where the amount of data is too big to be handled by the core memory of a computer system toledo 1999 or in applications where it is necessary to process a stream of information like financial stock data lee et al 2010 considering a case where every sub batch is visited once the use of the sgd optimisation can be expanded to train a model where every sub batch resides in different independent locations in this work we focus on horizontally partitioned data where each party contributes the same data attributes in different rows 3 a case of mapping global soil carbon stock we illustrate the use of the proposed online machine learning algorithm with a case study inspired by a recent publication by stockmann et al 2015 the study aimed to create a global model to predict soil organic carbon soc based on environmental covariates and a curated database of field observations from various countries soil is recognised as the largest terrestrial carbon store and the knowledge of its distribution and stock allows implementation of global initiatives such as the 4 per 1000 initiative which was launched during the cop 21 meeting with an aim to increase global soil carbon content to offset anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission minasny et al 2017 the modelling was performed within a digital soil mapping framework were a soil property is a function of spatially referenced environmental covariates that represent soil forming factors mcbratney et al 2003 digital soil mapping researchers in collaboration with different organisations have done an exhaustive work rescuing and organising soil legacy data in many countries arrouays et al 2017 this data has been used to generate high resolution maps of predicted keysoil properties along with their prediction uncertainties much of the rescued soil legacy data has been shared via soil information systems e g sislac ciat 2013 spade m2 hiederer 2010 or national databases but an important proportion has not mainly due to legislative or license restrictions the dataset used in this work comprises 106 431 observations distributed among 65 countries fig 2 each of the data contributing countries have at least 100 observations the aim is to develop a model that predicts the topsoil soc content of oc at 0 5 cm depth using global environmental covariates elevation and derived slope long term mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation all the covariates were resampled to 500 m resolution to generate the model we used the scikit learn python library pedregosa et al 2011 we selected a neural network regressor mlpregressor as our model since neural networks have proven to be a flexible alternative sarle 1994 yielding good results in many disciplines we decided to use a simple model architecture with one 100 neurons hidden layer and a relu activation function nair and hinton 2010 we used the sgd optimiser using a sub batch size of 5 maximum 200 iterations an initial learning rate η 0 of 5 10 4 and an inverse scaling learning rate schedule where the effective learning rate η t at each iteration t is given by 3 η t η 0 t we trained the mlpregressor by feeding data to the model one country at a time this procedure simulates the situation where at each step the partially trained model travels to a new location to learn from a new dataset the whole process is described in fig 3 to facilitate convergence the predictors were scaled before training the model and in this study the covariates were scaled to the 0 1 range using the minimum and maximum values of the first country added to the queue as in 4 x i x i min x 1 max x 1 min x 1 i 2 3 n where x 1 corresponds to the values of the covariate x for the first country added to the queue and x i to the values of the covariate x for the subsequent countries the reason to perform such scaling is that is not possible to know a priori the distribution of the subsequent datasets to be fed to the model to circumvent the effect of the order in which the data were fed to the model we used a random permutation of the order of the countries before training the model the soc values were log transformed and the model predictions were back transformed before proceeding with the analysis 3 1 a comparison with an alternative approach a possible alternative to our method is the use of model ensemble specifically averaging the predictions of different learners which is a common way of combining models breiman 1996 we trained a model for each country separately following the same order as the online model training we averaged the predictions of the first n models where n is equal to the number of countries already processed the prediction of the global model is generated by an ensemble of the models y ˆ 5 y ˆ i 1 n y i w i where y i is the prediction of the model i and w i corresponds to the weight assigned to that model in this work we used an equal weight averaging where w i 1 n in addition to the average at each step we calculated the total variance of the predictions following error propagation rules 3 2 response to redundant data the training pipeline described above simulates a situation where the data came from different countries and where each country occupies a certain spatial domain thus adding new information from each country will complete a global picture of the model in an uncontrolled training condition the data can come from anywhere to simulate this condition and assess the sensitivity of the proposed approach to redundant information we added five randomly selected subset of already seen data repeated from one to six times to the end of the training queue 3 3 evaluation we performed 1000 realisations of the model using the statistical bootstrap sampling with replacement efron and tibshirani 1993 at each of the incremental training step the model was evaluated against observations not included on the bootstrap sample by calculating the root of the median squared error rmdse we decided to use rmdse instead of the root mean squared error since the soc distribution is heavily right skewed and a measure based on the median squared error is a more robust alternative kempen et al 2012 to evaluate the overall effect of using online learning to compare our proposed approach with the single global dataset approach we trained the same algorithm using the complete dataset from all of the countries with 1000 realisations in a bootstrap routine 4 results and discussion 4 1 online versus complete dataset the simulation results showed that the online model which trained the model using data from one country at a time decreases the error successively and at the end of the routine reaches an error level that is slightly larger than the model trained with the complete dataset fig 4 more notably the variation of the model predictions given by the bootstrap sampling and also the random order in which the countries were added decreases considerably both error and variation of the prediction depict the evolution of the online model at the first stage the model is specific and very sensitive to the initial data the country that initiated the model and as the training evolves with more countries adding their data the model becomes more general and robust this condition is more evident when we observe the evolution of the prediction error of the first and last country added to the model fig 5 the first stage of the model represents a model which is calibrated from a country s data which performed poorly when it is extrapolated to the rest of the world as data from more countries are added to the training queue the model becomes more universal and as a consequence the prediction error of the first country added to the queue starts increasing as it loses that country s specificity the opposite effect was observed for the last country added to the model which has a large error at the beginning of the model evolution and decreases as more knowledge was added into the model in terms of the spatial representation of the model fig 6 the pattern is similar to the evolution of the model error as described in fig 5 initial maps generated using knowledge extracted from few countries data do not show the known pattern of global soc distribution the maps evolved as knowledge from different countries were incorporated into the model and the spatial distribution of soc converged to the established global pattern stockmann et al 2015 as depicted in the final step of fig 6 4 2 online versus ensemble similar to the online model the ensemble model which averages outputs from the model trained at each country shows a decrease in the error variance as models from different countries are added to the model fig 7 however the error from the model ensemble shows a larger error than the online learning model the error variance reduction due to model averaging is a common phenomenon exploited in ml where bootstrap aggregation bagging breiman 1996 is one of the simplest and preferred methods the error of the model ensemble slightly increases which is a common result of bagging as pointed out by zhang 2004 for simplicity at the moment of selecting an averaging method we used a simple equal weight average since more sophisticated methods are usually dependent on features not easily available under distributed training conditions for instance the methods proposed by granger and ramanathan 1984 the weights correspond to the ordinary least squares estimates of a multiple linear regression that depends on a vector of the observed values once a practical validation strategy is generated see section 4 5 it would be possible to evaluate other ensemble methods which might perform better than the equal weight average regarding computational time both online and ensemble models performed similarly however the time for model prediction linearly increases with the number of models used in the ensemble this could be an issue and could potentially be crucial in some domains for instance digital soil mapping where the combination of large extents high resolution and bootstrap routines leads to running a single model realisation on billions of pixels this computational burden can take several hours or days to generate a model output padarian et al 2014 2017 hengl et al 2017 4 3 response to redundant data as already mentioned in a real world application the algorithm will most likely have to deal with redundant information as observed in fig 8 the incremental inclusion of already seen data could have a detrimental effect on the learning process it is possible to observe a shift of the final prediction error and more importantly a significant increase in the variance of the predictions as we aim to continuously add more information to the model it is also important to avoid feeding redundant information japkowicz and stephen 2002 which is similar to the data duplication problem as described by kołcz et al 2003 imbalanced data is a common problem in ml chawla et al 2004 which is known to reduce the performance of the algorithms in our case study the increase in the variance implies a reversion of the process depicted in fig 5 shifting from a global model to a local one this problem needs to be tackled when we aim to create a collaborative global model one possible solution is to apply weights to new data so data that are already in the domain of prediction will be weighted less 4 4 hyperparameter selection hyperparameters are the group of parameters of a ml algorithm which cannot be learned in the training process e g learning rate batch size etc neural networks are very sensitive to these hyperparameters which in some cases can increase the computation time and more importantly reduce the accuracy or even cause the algorithm never to converge hyperparameter selection can be performed in different ways from an exhaustive grid search where all the combinations of parameters are tested to random selection from a range of values bergstra and bengio 2012 or from a distribution snoek et al 2012 in large scale online learning the optimisation is usually performed from a small sub sample of the data which yields good results bottou 2012 this condition is only true when the sub sample is representative of the data which poses a challenge in situations like our case study where at each step we incorporate data from different countries or places and the initiator party first party or country does not have access to data from other countries thus an initial training from public domain data could help in setting the best hyperparameters it is advisable to follow some general advice about setting hyperparameters in the context of online learners and sgd for more detail on this subject we refer the reader to bottou 2012 4 5 validation strategy during this work we were able to validate the model at each step during the training because we had access to all the data and we simulated the situation were the data was distributed among different countries in a real application the validation strategy will most likely vary similar to hyperparameter selection it would be possible to use a public domain dataset with similar characteristics to the expected final model coverage in order to validate each step of the training 4 6 platform in order to implement our approach we envision the use of a platform to facilitate collaborative modelling and model sharing similar work has been done by the project berkeley open infrastructure for network computing anderson 2004 where data is transferred to different computers to be processed in our case instead of transferring data the model will travel to agencies that have agreed to collaborate the agency will train the model using its data and only the model parameters will be sent to the main platform the proposed platform addressed some of the technical issues described previously which can be summarised below data redundancy keeping track of trained data by only storing metadata which includes data domain information for instance define the geographic area covered by the observations or statistical distribution of the covariates data redundancy can be addressed by a variation of data declustering in the geographical space journel 1983 or alternatively relative to the covariate space carré et al 2007 data thus can be weighted accordingly in the model training avoiding over training on certain part of the geographical or covariate space hyperparameter selection and validation as an alternative to using global public domain data if multiple datasets are simultaneously available in the platform each held by their corresponding agency and assuming that the combination of them is more representative than the initiation dataset it would be technically possible to perform a better hyperparameter optimisation and validation 5 conclusions this work addresses the problem of collaborative modelling when data privacy is a concern and restricts data sharing we successfully emulated a situation where different countries provide soil data without sharing it and by using an online learning algorithm trained one dataset at a time we showed that is possible to yield a similar prediction accuracy compared with the model that is trained with all the data we believe that even if in some cases the accuracy can be affected it is possible to compromise on the accuracy loss with the access to more information which provides a broader range of conditions from where a machine learning algorithm can generate its rules the proposed method for collaboration learning tackles the data privacy concerns which frequently hampers global collaboration the proposed online learning method is unique and distinct from privacy preserving data mining algorithms which require data encryption the method utilised the optimisation algorithm meaning that it can be used in a variety of ml models for classification or regression tasks

condition is only true when the sub sample is representative of the data which poses a challenge in situations like our case study where at each step we incorporate data from different countries or places and the initiator party first party or country does not have access to data from other countries thus an initial training from public domain data could help in setting the best hyperparameters it is advisable to follow some general advice about setting hyperparameters in the context of online learners and sgd for more detail on this subject we refer the reader to bottou 2012 4 5 validation strategy during this work we were able to validate the model at each step during the training because we had access to all the data and we simulated the situation were the data was distributed among different countries in a real application the validation strategy will most likely vary similar to hyperparameter selection it would be possible to use a public domain dataset with similar characteristics to the expected final model coverage in order to validate each step of the training 4 6 platform in order to implement our approach we envision the use of a platform to facilitate collaborative modelling and model sharing similar work has been done by the project berkeley open infrastructure for network computing anderson 2004 where data is transferred to different computers to be processed in our case instead of transferring data the model will travel to agencies that have agreed to collaborate the agency will train the model using its data and only the model parameters will be sent to the main platform the proposed platform addressed some of the technical issues described previously which can be summarised below data redundancy keeping track of trained data by only storing metadata which includes data domain information for instance define the geographic area covered by the observations or statistical distribution of the covariates data redundancy can be addressed by a variation of data declustering in the geographical space journel 1983 or alternatively relative to the covariate space carré et al 2007 data thus can be weighted accordingly in the model training avoiding over training on certain part of the geographical or covariate space hyperparameter selection and validation as an alternative to using global public domain data if multiple datasets are simultaneously available in the platform each held by their corresponding agency and assuming that the combination of them is more representative than the initiation dataset it would be technically possible to perform a better hyperparameter optimisation and validation 5 conclusions this work addresses the problem of collaborative modelling when data privacy is a concern and restricts data sharing we successfully emulated a situation where different countries provide soil data without sharing it and by using an online learning algorithm trained one dataset at a time we showed that is possible to yield a similar prediction accuracy compared with the model that is trained with all the data we believe that even if in some cases the accuracy can be affected it is possible to compromise on the accuracy loss with the access to more information which provides a broader range of conditions from where a machine learning algorithm can generate its rules the proposed method for collaboration learning tackles the data privacy concerns which frequently hampers global collaboration the proposed online learning method is unique and distinct from privacy preserving data mining algorithms which require data encryption the method utilised the optimisation algorithm meaning that it can be used in a variety of ml models for classification or regression tasks

tamu edu software swat executables 1 introduction the assessment of watersheds in the context of human and ecosystem health is a topic of great interest to both hydrologists and ecologists seeking to promote sustainable practices hoque et al 2012 hydrologists and ecologists are becoming increasingly cognizant of the importance of quantifying risks to assess the health of watersheds the potential for an entire system to fail the probability of a failed system recovering and the consequences of a system lapsing into a failed condition can be quantified by using appropriate statistical techniques and risk based indicators to assess a watershed furthermore policies promoting watershed recovery and resilience screening programs must be supported by establishing protection and restoration priorities for watershed management the u s environmental protection agency epa has shifted towards integrated watershed assessments for states for example pennsylvania s aquatic community classification was conducted for the state of pennsylvania to identify stream community types and habitat types for freshwater ecosystems a condition assessment was then conducted to identify the least disturbed streams and to set watershed conservation restoration and enhancement priorities walsh et al 2007 the watersheds disturbance approach of connecticut identified the least disturbed watersheds based on an impervious surface and natural land cover analysis an ibi approach water quality flow modifications and water withdrawals this assessment identified watersheds of exceptional quality that can be used as reference sites in the development of a biological condition gradient for the state and that can be prioritized for protection bellucci et al 2009 the epa s recovery potential screening tool uses a wide variety of landscape datasets impaired water attributes reported by states to the epa and monitoring data to evaluate ecological stressor and social indicators to prioritize watersheds for protection or restoration norton et al 2009 wickham and norton 2008 a number of previous studies have recently assessed the priorities of effective watershed management through hydrology and water quality analysis by integrating a watershed model and criteria evaluation approach jun et al 2011 proposed water resource vulnerability indices to offer spatial priority for watershed management of the bukhan river basin in south korea to account for the impacts of climate change using the hspf model results zhao et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model with six indicators including total nitrogen export and total phosphorous export to evaluate the riparian buffer restoration priorities in the liuxihe river basin of southern china chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 designed a framework to identify watershed priority management areas for the daning river watershed in china by quantifying the pollution emissions from multiple assessment units and their effects on the quality of nearby water bodies by using the swat model yang et al 2016 examined the water quality effects of riparian wetland loss and restoration at a watershed scale to analyze both the sediment and nutrient retention effects of riparian wetland scenarios for the black river watershed in southern ontario canada by using the swat model results for runoff sediment and nutrients chung et al 2017 developed an indicator based multi criteria approach to assess water resource vulnerability in sub basins and applied the approach in the han river basin using the swat model and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach monitoring approaches are generally expensive and time consuming especially for large scale watersheds rowny and stewart 2012 zeng et al 2013 considering the complexity of watershed processes watershed models such as the swat have been used as indispensable tools to investigate the dynamic processes over broad temporal and spatial scales buchanan et al 2013 ghebremichael et al 2013 regional water quantity and quality can be assessed through systematic modeling using the swat hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 because of its robust approach which is based on the soil water balance at the watershed scale the swat model has been successfully applied to a number of river basins and is widely used to study the long term effects of hydrological changes e g sun and cornish 2005 wan et al 2013 karlsson et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 sellami et al 2016 chung et al 2017 and environmental changes e g eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 rosenberg et al 2003 bouraoui et al 2004 chaplot 2007 mehdi et al 2015 zhou and li 2015 thus the use of a qualified watershed model may be essential to assessing continuous time series changes and spatial distribution changes in watershed information in addition understanding the spatial distributions and temporal trends in watershed priority decisions is important for efficient integrated watershed management most previous research studies have used a fragmentary approach to address hydrology and water quality issues by using monitoring data for a limited period without assessing various components e g landscape stream channels hydrology water quality habitat and biological diversity thus it is essential to explore the integrated influence of large scale watersheds with various watershed characteristics this study can be further enhanced by incorporating information about various components of the protection and restoration process with watershed subdivision schemes for more effective watershed management strategies for these reasons an integrated approach is needed to target watershed priorities for protection and restoration therefore the primary objective of this study is to suggest an application strategy for protection and restoration priorities at the watershed scale based on watershed health vulnerability and resilience assessments of the han river basin 34 148 km2 in south korea a related objective is to examine whether considering the health vulnerability and social contexts within a watershed affects the priority values for protection and restoration and their scale dependency detailed information regarding the framework is presented below 2 materials and methods 2 1 objectives the overall goal of this study is to analyze resilience protection and restoration priorities through the quantification of watershed health vulnerability and social context for watershed management strategies in the han river basin in this study the indicators for watershed health assessment are selected based on six essential components using the methodology suggested by the u s epa 2012 all these watershed health indicators are evaluated to match the situation in south korea by using measurable data and watershed modeling results in particular a methodology to examine the hydrology and water quality for watershed health is developed to assess possible long term changes in a watershed as simulated through a watershed scale hydrological model namely swat according to existing research that has assessed the long term changes in the han river basin the changes in runoff due to climate change in han river basin is expected to cause many changes to the future seasonal water volume and water scarcity is predicted to increase in the long term jun et al 2011 kim et al 2014 urban land cover in the han river basin is positively associated with increases in water pollution which has increased for the majority of the monitoring stations chang 2008 then indicators for watershed vulnerability assessment are selected based on the four components to identify areas of potential development based on the current zoning regulations areas of vulnerability can be identified based on standard watersheds from korea hydrologic unit map and the healthy areas that fall within those vulnerable boundaries can be prioritized for watershed protection and restoration the korea hydrologic unit map is a standard map that combines data from national organizations for water resource development planning and management the standard watersheds are the smallest hydrologic unit designated by the korean government the resilience screening data formats contain scores for integrated capacities watershed hydrological condition water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure vulnerability and social contexts the resilience levels are used to inform watershed priorities because resilience incorporates economic concepts fig 1 shows a flowchart of the study procedures the specific objectives of this study are as follows to assess integrated watershed health scores to integrate multiple indicators that represent different healthy watershed attributes in standard watersheds from the korea hydrologic unit map to assess watershed vulnerability scores by contrasting past and future indicators that represent artificial vulnerability factors in standard watersheds from the korea hydrologic unit map to analyze how the comparative assessment of resilience can help prioritize restoration efforts among large numbers of watersheds to set protection and restoration priorities and application strategies according to the results of watershed health and vulnerability assessments 2 2 study area description the han river basin 34 148 km2 is one of the five major river basins in south korea 99 720 km2 this basin occupies approximately 31 of the country and falls within the

using the swat model the swat model is a physically based continuous long term distributed parameter model designed to predict the effects of land management practices on hydrology and water quality in agricultural watersheds under varying soil land use and management conditions arnold et al 1998 the swat model is based on the concept of hydrologic response units hrus which are portions of a sub basin with unique land use management and soil attributes the runoff sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru are calculated separately based on weather soil properties topography vegetation and land management and are then summed to determine the total loading from the sub basin neitsch et al 2002 a detailed description can be found in the swat user s manual and theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2005a 2005b the watershed health assessment requires the indicator data for hydrology and water quality to be simulated by the swat model and the detailed component selection is presented in section 2 5 this section briefly summarizes the model data and implementation and the statistical results of calibration and validation 2 4 1 measured data for the swat model evaluation

years 2005 2009 of daily inflow storage volume sediments t n and t p data and was then validated using another five years 2010 2014 of data in addition the model was calibrated and validated using evapotranspiration and soil moisture data measured at two locations sm and cm and groundwater level data measured at five locations gpgp ypgg ypyd yimp and hcgd over five years 2009 2013 the parameters were calibrated by trial and error until they achieved the necessary modeling performance the calibrated parameters and hydrograph of the calibration results in the han river basin were described by chung et al 2017 the statistical results for hydrology and water quality for the model calibration and validation are summarized in table 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash

for watershed health assessment the foundation of watershed health assessment is a compilation of various watershed information based on the primary physical attributes of the watershed conditions according to a study by the u s epa 2012 six essential indicators are fundamental to assessing the health of watersheds landscape conditions geomorphology hydrology water quality habitats and biological conditions sub indices for each of the six components have been developed and the sub index values for each watershed were then aggregated into a single watershed health index value for each watershed this methodology can be used to assess the natural capacities of a watershed and problems and drafts of possible solutions for effective watershed management all sub index and index values are relative i e healthier vs not as healthy rather than absolute i e no healthy vs unhealthy cutoff score is identified thus these values are intended to compare relative differences among watersheds rather than to precisely define healthy vs unhealthy watersheds in this study the following six healthy watershed components were used to evaluate the watershed health in the han river basin 1 landscape conditions 2 stream geomorphology 3 hydrology 4 water quality 5 aquatic habitats and 6 biological conditions the extent and connectivity of natural land cover within a watershed are very important for ecological integrity natural land cover within a watershed and especially within headwater areas and riparian corridors helps to maintain the hydrologic regime regulate the inputs of nutrients and organic matter and provide habitats for fish and wildlife u s epa 2012 in this study assessing the connectivity of watersheds of natural land cover forest wetland river and natural grassland involves a green area assessment that is watersheds of unfragmented natural land cover and corridors of sufficient width to allow for the migration of wildlife between the watersheds the percentages of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin that are occupied by natural land cover habitat blocks were calculated using gis techniques the green area metric was calculated as follows 1 g r e e n a r e a m e t r i c a r e a k m 2 o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r i n w a t e r s h e d t o t a l a r e a k m 2 i n w a t e r s h e d the amount of natural land cover within an active river area is another important indicator of landscape conditions natural land cover within an active river area including the river channel lakes ponds and riparian lands is necessary for the physical and ecological functioning of aquatic ecosystems u s epa 2012 in their natural state active river areas maintain the ecological integrity of rivers streams and riparian areas and the connection of those areas to the local ground water system ipcc 2007 the methods used to delineate the active river area involve gis techniques and analyses of elevation land cover and wetlands data the criteria for identifying the streamside areas have not yet been decided so an area with a width of 30 50 m can be used as a cutoff for identifying streamside material contribution areas u s epa 2012 in this study the percentage natural land cover for the riparian area within 50 m of streams was calculated for each of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin using gis techniques the active river area metric was calculated as follows 2 a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a m e t r i c a r e a k m 2 o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r i n a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a t o t a l a r e a k m 2 i n a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a the natural stream geomorphology can be an important indicator of watershed health because it can fragment both terrestrial and aquatic habitats throughout a watershed in this study the geomorphic conditions were assessed in a similar manner to the stream condition categories of the vermont stream geomorphic assessment protocols kline et al 2009 the stream order was calculated along nine levels using dems and stream maps and four river types were classified through subsequent detailed land cover assessments four river types were classified reference mountainous river stream order 1 good small river stream order 2 3 fair local river stream order 4 5 and poor urban and national river stream order 6 9 the percentage of assessed stream length for the reference condition was calculated for each watershed the stream geomorphology metric was calculated as follows 3 s t r e a m g e o m o r p h o l o g y m e t r i c s t r e a m l e n g t h k m o f r e

shallow aquifers can serve as indicators of potential hydrologic alteration in this study the swat model results chung et al 2017 over thirty years 1985 2014 were used to reconstruct daily time series of the following hydrologic components prec and tq for the total processes sq for the surface processes infilt sw and lq for the soil water dynamics and percol recharge and gwq for the groundwater dynamics the annual average value of the 237 total sub watersheds over these thirty years 1985 2014 was used as the reference condition the reference condition values for the nine hydrologic components were as follows 1395 1 mm for prec 919 5 mm for tq 249 4 mm for sq 726 4 mm for infilt 85 3 mm for sw 345 9 mm for lq 363 8 mm for percol 22 9 mm for recjarge and 342 2 mm for gwq dividing the simulated value of the watershed by the reference condition gives the storage ratios of the nine components the storage ratios of these nine components produced four hydrologic classifications namely total metrics surface processes metrics soil water dynamics metrics and groundwater dynamics metrics which are used to determine optional specific management objectives the storage ratios of each component for the four hydrology metrics were calculated for each watershed and used as metrics of the hydrologic conditions the hydrology metric was calculated as follows 4 h y d r o l o g y m e

reconstruct load based daily time series for the following water quality constituents over thirty years 1985 2014 sediment mg l t n mg l and t p mg l the basic environmental policy act bepa in south korea specified ecoregional water quality criteria for identifying the least disturbed sites throughout south korea ministry of environment 2016 these criteria were used to identify streams and lakes that were likely to exhibit reference conditions based on their sediment t n and t p concentrations according to the bepa the water quality criteria for streams and lakes can be classified on a seven point scale excellent very good good marginally good fair poor and very poor the levels greater than marginally good level were used as the reference condition the reference condition values for the three water quality components were 15 mg l for sediments 0 6 mg l for t n and 0 05 mg l for t p the percentage of the assessed values exhibiting the reference conditions was calculated for each watershed the water quality metric was calculated as follows 5 w a t e r q u a l i t y m e t r i c s i m u l a t e d v a l u e m g l sediment t n and t p o f w a t e r s h e d r e f e r e n c e v a l

biological indicators tdi bmi and fai were chosen to identify healthy instream conditions for the han river basin these data can identify healthy instream conditions in the context of aquatic ecosystem health healthy watersheds should have tdi bmi and fai scores that are close to those of the reference conditions according to the nationwide aquatic ecological monitoring program report

watershed vulnerability assessment watershed vulnerability assessment facilitates the prioritization of protection and restoration strategies this process is essential for identifying artificial watershed stressors alongside watershed health assessment for the intact components of watersheds factors that threaten watershed health may include expected urban and suburban development climate change effects increased water demand industrialization agriculture and other stressors u s epa 2012 in this study four essential indicators are selected to assess watershed vulnerability 1 changes to impervious land cover 2 climate changes 3 water use changes and 4 recent land cover changes the watershed vulnerability was calculated using data for future projections of impervious cover climate change projections future water demand and recent changes in anthropogenic land cover in the han river basin the clue s model verburg et al 2002 was used to simulate future projections of impervious land cover for the year 2050 in the han river basin the clue s model comprises two parts a non spatial demand module and a spatially explicit allocation procedure the non spatial module calculates the area changes for all land uses at the aggregate level verburg et al 2002 non spatial demands are converted into land use changes at various locations in the study area during the spatially explicit allocation procedure yearly land use demands which must be defined prior to the allocation procedure can be set using various approaches such as economic models lin et al 2007 the 2008 land cover map from the kme and 2008 clue s land cover map were compared to evaluate the land use generated by clue s for the studied watersheds the clue s was set to a 1 1 km resolution due to the limited number of grids the kappa coefficient cohen 1960 was 0 78 and values between 0 6 and 0 8 represent high agreement between the classification map and the ground reference information the future land uses in 2050 were predicted by applying the derived regression models and the prepared land uses the future impervious land cover was projected to increase in many watersheds throughout the han river basin by 2050 details on the methodology and the results of future land cover projections can be found in the study by lee et al 2016 the projected values of impervious land cover were compared to the current impervious land cover in 2008 to calculate a percent change metric for each watershed the impervious area change metric was calculated as follows 8 b i o l o g i c a l c o n d i t i o n m e t r i c o

baseline period from 1976 to 2005 and the projected temperature and precipitation from 2040 to 2069 were calculated for each watershed in the han river basin in this study rcp 8 5 assumes that the ghg emissions will increase throughout the 21st century and approach very high levels 940 ppm co2 by 2100 the hadgem3 ra model published by the kma is currently available for the han river basin as a

watershed s ecological conditions gregory et al 2002 lackey 2001 palmer et al 2005 the social metrics that appear to be potentially measurable and relevant to recovery include the role of agency involvement existing priority recognition community information flow economic incentives and measures of economic well being in this study three essential indicators were selected to assess the social contexts 1 the financial independence rate 2 the grdp and 3 the number of water management public officers which includes waterworks and sewerage thus this indicator is related to the socioeconomic aspects of coping with water quality problems such as the waterworks distribution ratio the simple zonal statistics were used to assign values for the social context components at the sub watershed level 2 8 watershed health vulnerability and social context index formulation the watershed health vulnerability and social context were evaluated by normalizing the metric scores to integrate data for multiple watershed attributes into a composite score normalization was conducted by defining a reference value for the indicator score such as health vulnerability and social context by percentile rank for communication purposes the indicator score was scaled to normalize the sub index and final watershed index scores to a range from 0 to 1 the indicator scores for watershed health and social context must also be directionally aligned meaning that higher scores should equate to better conditions for each metric the indicator scores for watershed vulnerability indicate the opposite of the watershed health indicator scores the inverse 1 x of each value e g water quality components can be taken for metrics that were not directionally aligned using their original units a composite index of watershed health was constructed by averaging the normalized indicator scores for each attribute a sub index was first calculated for attributes with more than one indicator and the sub indices were then averaged to obtain the integrated watershed health index score u s epa 2012 similar to the method used to calculate the watershed health index the vulnerability and social context indices were calculated by normalizing and combining the individual metric scores depending on the specific management objectives placing more weight on some ecological attributes than on others and using optional sub indices may be appropriate at that point the process becomes subjective and a logical decision framework can be used to solicit and document expert opinions smith et al 2003 weighting was not used in this integrated assessment study the normalized metrics sub indices and integrated watershed indices were calculated as follows 14 n o r m a l i z e d m e t r i c v l a u e o b s e r v e d

watershed resilience screening method provides a systematic approach for comparing watersheds and identifying differences in how well these regions may respond to restoration resilience is defined as the likelihood that an impaired watershed will attain certain water quality standards or other valued attributes given its ecological capacity to regain its functions its exposure to stressors and the social context that affects efforts to improve its condition u s epa 2012 the original tool was developed to establish restoration priorities for impaired watersheds norton et al 2009 scoring the three classes of metrics ensures that ecological conditions stressor scenarios and social factors are all addressed distinguishing the influence of social variables from the influence of watershed conditions is particularly valuable because social variables often determine the success of restoration fig 3 a illustrates a three dimensional bubble plot for integrating the three summary scores in this study plotting the summary score in a two dimensional matrix of integrated capacities and stressors identifies the relative recovery potential of the watershed based on conditional variables a high capacity with low stress zone a signifies better resilience prospects pass whereas a low capacity with high stress zone c implies lower resilience fail the bubbles organize social scores into relative dot sizes which enable the user to compare resilience in this study the resilience for the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin were analyzed using the results of integrated capacity metrics watershed hydrological health water quality aquatic habitats and biological conditions stressor exposure metrics watershed vulnerability and social context metrics according to this screening process the results of these watershed health and vulnerability assessments can be used to set strategic management priorities at the watershed scale fig 3b illustrates the methodology used to assign relative priorities in the han river basin the median watershed health score for the basin splits the y axis in half and the median watershed vulnerability score for the basin splits the x axis in half these two median lines create four quadrants that can be used to classify watersheds according to their relative restoration and protection needs healthy watersheds with high vulnerability zone b can be considered a priority for protection actions before watershed health is degraded healthy watersheds with low vulnerability zone a should still be protected but the need may not be as urgent degraded watersheds with low vulnerability zone d can be considered a priority for restoration because of their high potential for recovery and degraded watersheds with high vulnerability zone c can be considered less of a priority degraded watersheds with low vulnerability can be considered a priority for restoration because of their high potential for recovery whereas degraded watersheds with high vulnerability can be considered less of a priority when the emphasis is on achieving results and demonstrating management effectiveness u s epa 2012 in this study the protection and restoration priorities of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin were classified using watershed health and vulnerability index scores according to this management prioritization process 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of watershed health vulnerability and social context in the han river basin the results of the individual assessments were synthesized to integrate and assess the watershed health vulnerability and social context index scores in the han river basin the sample areas used to explain the differences in the watershed health results for each component included the 101206 urban 1 4 and forest 88 1 100201 urban 0 8 and forest 88 2 and 101801 urban 9 8 and forest 55 7 standard watersheds fig 2a the 101206 100201 and 101801 standard watersheds were located in the upstream region of the soyang dam syd in the upstream region of the chungju dam cjd and in the downstream region of the paldang dam pdd respectively watershed health analyses of each component were conducted for the 237 sub watersheds as standard watersheds of the han river basin using the data reconstruction results for the landscape stream geomorphology hydrology water quality aquatic habitat conditions and biological conditions fig 4 displays the normalized scores for each of the six attribute sub indices and the integrated watershed health scores the integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther down the watershed the watershed health scores for the 101206 and 100201 standard watersheds were 1 and 0 91 respectively indicating very healthy watersheds although the watershed health was good distinctive weaknesses were discovered namely the hydrological conditions 0 06 in the 101206 watershed and the water quality conditions 0 1 in the 100201 watershed the watershed health of the 101801 standard watershed was low at 0 25 whereas the hydrology and aquatic habitat conditions were relatively healthy watershed vulnerability assessment was conducted based on a land use change model climate change predictive model water use forecast and recent land use change forecast fig 5 the impervious watershed area downstream of the han river basin is expected to continue growing through 2050 fig 5a the recent land cover change patterns steadily increased in a similar fashion to the impervious area increase particularly over the past seven years fig 5d some parts of the downstream region that had already been urbanized exhibited low vulnerability the vulnerability of water demand was high in the downstream region of the han river basin following the trend towards urban population concentration fig 5c fig 6 shows the results of the social context assessment based on the financial independence rate grdp and number of water management public officers each indicator can be described as very significant providing a substantial boost to public support for restoring affected watersheds the higher the financial independence rate fig 6a of a watershed is the higher the water resource stability and the grdp of a watershed are fig 6b grdp is the economic indicator that allows investment for water resource policies and projects the economic support and governance had a high probability in the urban area of the downstream region compared to many parts of the upstream region fig 7 and table 3 show the effects of each component on the watershed health vulnerability and social context according to the watershed locations test area of fig 2c in the han river basin 3 2 analysis of watershed resilience and protection and restoration priorities in the han river basin prior to analyzing the protection and restoration priorities resilience screening was conducted to assess the resilience of watersheds using the results of integrated capacities watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure watershed vulnerability and social context in 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin fig 8 in this study the resilience screening which included orthogonal measurements of the integrated capacity stressor exposure and social context was quantile rank ordered by comparative screening methods including the sum of ranks and cluster analysis scores of high capacity with low stressor zone a indicated better resilience prospects pass with social scores greater than 0 5 whereas the scores of low capacity with high stressors zone c indicated lower resilience fail with social scores less than 0 5 according to the sum of ranks method fig 8a resilience screening by cluster analysis was conducted to cover all the watersheds and to verify the results of the sum of ranks method and the results were classified into three levels high 89 watersheds 38 medium 82 watersheds 35 and low 66 watersheds 28 fig 8b fig 9 a shows the spatial distribution results of the cluster analysis which assigned nominal rankings of low medium and high priority for the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin the resilience rankings were higher for the upstream watersheds which exhibited better watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions and less impairment these rankings were lower for some parts of the upstream region with low funding prospects even though the watershed health was good the resilience rankings for the downstream watersheds were intermediate with better funding prospects despite the poor health conditions and high impairment the resilience rankings in this study provide an alternate view of prioritization possibilities the results of the protection and restoration priorities are described below the spatial distribution results of four priorities namely protection 51 watersheds 22 protection priority 68 watersheds 29 restoration 51 watersheds 22 and restoration priorities 67 watersheds 28 were assigned to the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin as shown in fig 9b most of the regions in the syd and cjd watersheds in the upstream region of the han river basin required protection or protection priority and most regions in the downstream area of the pdd watersheds required restoration or restoration priority the final result is a map that shows the areas with high priority for restoration and more than average resilience fig 9c this approach can be utilized for a number of standard watersheds local communities and regions throughout the han river basin these studies compare the relative likelihoods of recovery and the application of restoration priorities among the restoration group of basins in the case studies below 3 3 case studies application strategy for restoration priorities for watershed management according to the above results the four different types of watersheds and the management goals of recovery and priority presented a flexible interaction between systematic data and analysis and compared management actions of recovery and priority for the watersheds in the han river basin the individual scores for each of the metrics and sub indices can help guide the selection of specific management actions for a given watershed to address more specific objectives figs 10 13 display the detailed component scores for four example watersheds namely the 100414 101301 100609 and 101801 standard watersheds the 100414 watershed was identified as a restoration area low resilience with a low watershed health score 0 18 especially in terms of low green area groundwater and water quality but a relatively high vulnerability score 0 70 especially in terms of changes to impervious land cover and recent land cover changes this result indicates a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves total maximum daily load tmdl implementation and groundwater management and local governments e g reforestation fig 10 the 101301 watershed was identified as a restoration priority high resilience with low watershed health 0 25 and vulnerability scores 0 28 especially in terms of low green areas water quality wetlands and imbalances in domestic industrial and agricultural water use but a relatively high social context score 0 56 these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation and non point source nps pollution management and local governments e g reforestation wetland construction and water transactions fig 11 the 100609 watershed was identified as a restoration area intermediate resilience with a low watershed health score 0 33 especially in terms of low green areas hydrology water quality and biological conditions but a relatively high vulnerability score 0 87 especially in terms of changes to impervious land cover and precipitation changes these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation ecological restoration and drought management and local governments e g reforestation and wetland construction fig 12 finally the 101801 watershed was identified as a restoration priority intermediate resilience with low watershed health 0 25 and vulnerability scores 0 20 especially in terms of low green areas water quality and biological conditions and imbalances in domestic industrial and agricultural water use but a very high social context score 0 96 these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation and ecological restoration and local governments e g reforestation wetland construction and agricultural diversion point relocation fig 13 by viewing and comparing the health vulnerability and social context scores resilience and priorities for each of the components an understanding of the relative conditions of the assessment components can be used to direct resources to aid in watershed protection and restoration the index scores of this study are planned to be recalculated every five years to meet a comprehensive national water resource plan that incorporates enhanced methods and available data this approach will allow for refinements in our watershed health and vulnerability assessment and the tracking of trends in watershed health over time 4 conclusions this study provides a reference for understanding the amount priority level and location of territories that correspond to watersheds that require conservation and restoration this paper presents the first study of diverse watersheds that incorporates conservation and restoration planning strategies to identify priority areas for conservation and restoration to guide management strategies and actions at the national and regional levels analyses of resilience and protection and restoration priorities were conducted through the quantification of watershed health vulnerability and social context for watershed management strategies in the han river basin resilience screening was conducted to assess the recovery potential of watersheds using the results of integrated capacities watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure watershed vulnerability and social contexts the results of the watershed health and vulnerability assessments can be used to set strategic management priorities at the watershed scale the resilience screening classified the results into three levels namely high 89 watersheds 38 medium 82 watersheds 35 and low 66 watersheds 28 using the sum of ranks method and cluster analysis most of the regions in the syd and cjd watersheds in the upstream region of the han river basin require protection and protection priority while most areas in the downstream region of the pdd watersheds require restoration and restoration priority this approach can be utilized in a number of standard watersheds local communities and regions throughout the han river basin these studies compare the relative likelihoods of recovery and prioritize the application of restoration measures among watersheds in the basin

26131,the watershed health vulnerability and recovery potential for determining protection and restoration priorities were assessed for the han river basin 34 148 km2 in south korea six components including the watershed landscape stream geomorphology hydrology water quality aquatic habitat conditions and biological conditions were used to evaluate the watershed health basin natural capacity the soil and water assessment tool swat was utilized to examine the hydrology and water quality components in the study basin which includes 237 sub watersheds three multipurpose dams one hydroelectric dam and three multifunction weirs four components namely the future impervious area future climate conditions future water use and recent land cover changes were used to evaluate the

tamu edu software swat executables 1 introduction the assessment of watersheds in the context of human and ecosystem health is a topic of great interest to both hydrologists and ecologists seeking to promote sustainable practices hoque et al 2012 hydrologists and ecologists are becoming increasingly cognizant of the importance of quantifying risks to assess the health of watersheds the potential for an entire system to fail the probability of a failed system recovering and the consequences of a system lapsing into a failed condition can be quantified by using appropriate statistical techniques and risk based indicators to assess a watershed furthermore policies promoting watershed recovery and resilience screening programs must be supported by establishing protection and restoration priorities for watershed management the u s environmental protection agency epa has shifted towards integrated watershed assessments for states for example pennsylvania s aquatic community classification was conducted for the state of pennsylvania to identify stream community types and habitat types for freshwater ecosystems a condition assessment was then conducted to identify the least disturbed streams and to set watershed conservation restoration and enhancement priorities walsh et al 2007 the watersheds disturbance approach of connecticut identified the least disturbed watersheds based on an impervious surface and natural land cover analysis an ibi approach water quality flow modifications and water withdrawals this assessment identified watersheds of exceptional quality that can be used as reference sites in the development of a biological condition gradient for the state and that can be prioritized for protection bellucci et al 2009 the epa s recovery potential screening tool uses a wide variety of landscape datasets impaired water attributes reported by states to the epa and monitoring data to evaluate ecological stressor and social indicators to prioritize watersheds for protection or restoration norton et al 2009 wickham and norton 2008 a number of previous studies have recently assessed the priorities of effective watershed management through hydrology and water quality analysis by integrating a watershed model and criteria evaluation approach jun et al 2011 proposed water resource vulnerability indices to offer spatial priority for watershed management of the bukhan river basin in south korea to account for the impacts of climate change using the hspf model results zhao et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model with six indicators including total nitrogen export and total phosphorous export to evaluate the riparian buffer restoration priorities in the liuxihe river basin of southern china chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 designed a framework to identify watershed priority management areas for the daning river watershed in china by quantifying the pollution emissions from multiple assessment units and their effects on the quality of nearby water bodies by using the swat model yang et al 2016 examined the water quality effects of riparian wetland loss and restoration at a watershed scale to analyze both the sediment and nutrient retention effects of riparian wetland scenarios for the black river watershed in southern ontario canada by using the swat model results for runoff sediment and nutrients chung et al 2017 developed an indicator based multi criteria approach to assess water resource vulnerability in sub basins and applied the approach in the han river basin using the swat model and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach monitoring approaches are generally expensive and time consuming especially for large scale watersheds rowny and stewart 2012 zeng et al 2013 considering the complexity of watershed processes watershed models such as the swat have been used as indispensable tools to investigate the dynamic processes over broad temporal and spatial scales buchanan et al 2013 ghebremichael et al 2013 regional water quantity and quality can be assessed through systematic modeling using the swat hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 because of its robust approach which is based on the soil water balance at the watershed scale the swat model has been successfully applied to a number of river basins and is widely used to study the long term effects of hydrological changes e g sun and cornish 2005 wan et al 2013 karlsson et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 sellami et al 2016 chung et al 2017 and environmental changes e g eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 rosenberg et al 2003 bouraoui et al 2004 chaplot 2007 mehdi et al 2015 zhou and li 2015 thus the use of a qualified watershed model may be essential to assessing continuous time series changes and spatial distribution changes in watershed information in addition understanding the spatial distributions and temporal trends in watershed priority decisions is important for efficient integrated watershed management most previous research studies have used a fragmentary approach to address hydrology and water quality issues by using monitoring data for a limited period without assessing various components e g landscape stream channels hydrology water quality habitat and biological diversity thus it is essential to explore the integrated influence of large scale watersheds with various watershed characteristics this study can be further enhanced by incorporating information about various components of the protection and restoration process with watershed subdivision schemes for more effective watershed management strategies for these reasons an integrated approach is needed to target watershed priorities for protection and restoration therefore the primary objective of this study is to suggest an application strategy for protection and restoration priorities at the watershed scale based on watershed health vulnerability and resilience assessments of the han river basin 34 148 km2 in south korea a related objective is to examine whether considering the health vulnerability and social contexts within a watershed affects the priority values for protection and restoration and their scale dependency detailed information regarding the framework is presented below 2 materials and methods 2 1 objectives the overall goal of this study is to analyze resilience protection and restoration priorities through the quantification of watershed health vulnerability and social context for watershed management strategies in the han river basin in this study the indicators for watershed health assessment are selected based on six essential components using the methodology suggested by the u s epa 2012 all these watershed health indicators are evaluated to match the situation in south korea by using measurable data and watershed modeling results in particular a methodology to examine the hydrology and water quality for watershed health is developed to assess possible long term changes in a watershed as simulated through a watershed scale hydrological model namely swat according to existing research that has assessed the long term changes in the han river basin the changes in runoff due to climate change in han river basin is expected to cause many changes to the future seasonal water volume and water scarcity is predicted to increase in the long term jun et al 2011 kim et al 2014 urban land cover in the han river basin is positively associated with increases in water pollution which has increased for the majority of the monitoring stations chang 2008 then indicators for watershed vulnerability assessment are selected based on the four components to identify areas of potential development based on the current zoning regulations areas of vulnerability can be identified based on standard watersheds from korea hydrologic unit map and the healthy areas that fall within those vulnerable boundaries can be prioritized for watershed protection and restoration the korea hydrologic unit map is a standard map that combines data from national organizations for water resource development planning and management the standard watersheds are the smallest hydrologic unit designated by the korean government the resilience screening data formats contain scores for integrated capacities watershed hydrological condition water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure vulnerability and social contexts the resilience levels are used to inform watershed priorities because resilience incorporates economic concepts fig 1 shows a flowchart of the study procedures the specific objectives of this study are as follows to assess integrated watershed health scores to integrate multiple indicators that represent different healthy watershed attributes in standard watersheds from the korea hydrologic unit map to assess watershed vulnerability scores by contrasting past and future indicators that represent artificial vulnerability factors in standard watersheds from the korea hydrologic unit map to analyze how the comparative assessment of resilience can help prioritize restoration efforts among large numbers of watersheds to set protection and restoration priorities and application strategies according to the results of watershed health and vulnerability assessments 2 2 study area description the han river basin 34 148 km2 is one of the five major river basins in south korea 99 720 km2 this basin occupies approximately 31 of the country and falls within the latitude range of 36 03 n to 38 55 n and the longitude range of 126 24 e to 129 02 e fig 2 the basin has three main rivers the north han river 12 969 km2 the south han river 12 894 km2 and the imjin river 8285 km2 the north han river and south river merge and then flow into the metropolitan city of seoul a city of 10 million residents the water resources of the river basin must be managed sustainably because of the expanding water demand of the seoul area including its satellite cities 12 million individuals and any potential changes to the water resources due to climate change must be evaluated ahn and kim 2015 the dominant land use of the han river basin is forest 73 25 033 km2 followed by cultivated cropland in the lowland fertile areas 5915 km2 which includes rice paddy fields 6 and upland crops 12 fig 2b based on 30 years of weather data from 1985 to 2014 the average annual precipitation is 1395 mm and the annual mean temperature is 11 5 c fig 2a shows the study area and the

using the swat model the swat model is a physically based continuous long term distributed parameter model designed to predict the effects of land management practices on hydrology and water quality in agricultural watersheds under varying soil land use and management conditions arnold et al 1998 the swat model is based on the concept of hydrologic response units hrus which are portions of a sub basin with unique land use management and soil attributes the runoff sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru are calculated separately based on weather soil properties topography vegetation and land management and are then summed to determine the total loading from the sub basin neitsch et al 2002 a detailed description can be found in the swat user s manual and theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2005a 2005b the watershed health assessment requires the indicator data for hydrology and water quality to be simulated by the swat model and the detailed component selection is presented in section 2 5 this section briefly summarizes the model data and implementation and the statistical results of calibration and validation 2 4 1 measured data for the swat model evaluation the han river basin was divided into 237 sub watersheds and 1987 hrus for swat modeling the sub watershed delineation was defined using the 90 m srtm dem supplied by the ciat a 2008 land cover map for

for watershed health assessment the foundation of watershed health assessment is a compilation of various watershed information based on the primary physical attributes of the watershed conditions according to a study by the u s epa 2012 six essential indicators are fundamental to assessing the health of watersheds landscape conditions geomorphology hydrology water quality habitats and biological conditions sub indices for each of the six components have been developed and the sub index values for each watershed were then aggregated into a single watershed health index value for each watershed this methodology can be used to assess the natural capacities of a watershed and problems and drafts of possible solutions for effective watershed management all sub index and index values are relative i e healthier vs not as healthy rather than absolute i e no healthy vs unhealthy cutoff score is identified thus these values are intended to compare relative differences among watersheds rather than to precisely define healthy vs unhealthy watersheds in this study the following six healthy watershed components were used to evaluate the watershed health in the han river basin 1 landscape conditions 2 stream geomorphology 3 hydrology 4 water quality 5 aquatic habitats and 6 biological conditions the extent and connectivity of natural land cover within a watershed are very important for ecological integrity natural land cover within a watershed and especially within headwater areas and riparian corridors helps to maintain the hydrologic regime regulate the inputs of nutrients and organic matter and provide habitats for fish and wildlife u s epa 2012 in this study assessing the connectivity of watersheds of natural land cover forest wetland river and natural grassland involves a green area assessment that is watersheds of unfragmented natural land cover and corridors of sufficient width to allow for the migration of wildlife between the watersheds the percentages of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin that are occupied by natural land cover habitat blocks were calculated using gis techniques the green area metric was calculated as follows 1 g r e e n a r e a m e t r i c a r e a k m 2 o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r i n w a t e r s h e d t o t a l a r e a k m 2 i n w a t e r s h e d the amount of natural land cover within an active river area is another important indicator of landscape conditions natural land cover within an active river area including the river channel lakes ponds and riparian lands is necessary for the physical and ecological functioning of aquatic ecosystems u s epa 2012 in their natural state active river areas maintain the ecological integrity of rivers streams and riparian areas and the connection of those areas to the local ground water system ipcc 2007 the methods used to delineate the active river area involve gis techniques and analyses of elevation land cover and wetlands data the criteria for identifying the streamside areas have not yet been decided so an area with a width of 30 50 m can be used as a cutoff for identifying streamside material contribution areas u s epa 2012 in this study the percentage natural land cover for the riparian area within 50 m of streams was calculated for each of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin using gis techniques the active river area metric was calculated as follows 2 a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a m e t r i c a r e a k m 2 o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r i n a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a t o t a l a r e a k m 2 i n a c t i v e r i v e r a r e a the natural stream geomorphology can be an important indicator of watershed health because it can fragment both terrestrial and aquatic habitats throughout a watershed in this study the geomorphic conditions were assessed in a similar manner to the stream condition categories of the vermont stream geomorphic assessment protocols kline et al 2009 the stream order was calculated along nine levels using dems and stream maps and four river types were classified through subsequent detailed land cover assessments four river types were classified reference mountainous river stream order 1 good small river stream order 2 3 fair local river stream order 4 5 and poor urban and national river stream order 6 9 the percentage of assessed stream length for the reference condition was calculated for each watershed the stream geomorphology metric was calculated as follows 3 s t r e a m g e o m o r p h o l o g y m e t r i c s t r e a m l e n g t h k m o f r e

shallow aquifers can serve as indicators of potential hydrologic alteration in this study the swat model results chung et al 2017 over thirty years 1985 2014 were used to reconstruct daily time series of the following hydrologic components prec and tq for the total processes sq for the surface processes infilt sw and lq for the soil water dynamics and percol recharge and gwq for the groundwater dynamics the annual average value of the 237 total sub watersheds over these thirty years 1985 2014 was used as the reference condition the reference condition values for the nine hydrologic components were as follows 1395 1 mm for prec 919 5 mm for tq 249 4 mm for sq 726 4 mm for infilt 85 3 mm for sw 345 9 mm for lq 363 8 mm for percol 22 9 mm for recjarge and 342 2 mm for gwq dividing the simulated value of the watershed by the reference condition gives the storage ratios of the nine components the storage ratios of these nine components produced four hydrologic classifications namely total metrics surface processes metrics soil water dynamics metrics and groundwater dynamics metrics which are used to determine optional specific management objectives the storage ratios of each component for the four hydrology metrics were calculated for each watershed and used as metrics of the hydrologic conditions the hydrology metric was calculated as follows 4 h y d r o l o g y m e

reconstruct load based daily time series for the following water quality constituents over thirty years 1985 2014 sediment mg l t n mg l and t p mg l the basic environmental policy act bepa in south korea specified ecoregional water quality criteria for identifying the least disturbed sites throughout south korea ministry of environment 2016 these criteria were used to identify streams and lakes that were likely to exhibit reference conditions based on their sediment t n and t p concentrations according to the bepa the water quality criteria for streams and lakes can be classified on a seven point scale excellent very good good marginally good fair poor and very poor the levels greater than marginally good level were used as the reference condition the reference condition values for the three water quality components were 15 mg l for sediments 0 6 mg l for t n and 0 05 mg l for t p the percentage of the assessed values exhibiting the reference conditions was calculated for each watershed the water quality metric was calculated as follows 5 w a t e r q u a l i t y m e t r i c s i m u l a t e d v a l u e m g l sediment t n and t p o f w a t e r s h e d r e f e r e n c e v a l

biological indicators tdi bmi and fai were chosen to identify healthy instream conditions for the han river basin these data can identify healthy instream conditions in the context of aquatic ecosystem health healthy watersheds should have tdi bmi and fai scores that are close to those of the reference conditions according to the nationwide aquatic ecological monitoring program report ministry of environment 2013 indices that range from 0 to 100 can be classified on a four point scale of best good fair and poor for biological condition criteria the best and good levels were used as the reference condition the tdi bmi and fai scores at percentages less than the reference conditions were calculated for each watershed the biological condition metric was calculated as follows 9 i m

watershed vulnerability assessment watershed vulnerability assessment facilitates the prioritization of protection and restoration strategies this process is essential for identifying artificial watershed stressors alongside watershed health assessment for the intact components of watersheds factors that threaten watershed health may include expected urban and suburban development climate change effects increased water demand industrialization agriculture and other stressors u s epa 2012 in this study four essential indicators are selected to assess watershed vulnerability 1 changes to impervious land cover 2 climate changes 3 water use changes and 4 recent land cover changes the watershed vulnerability was calculated using data for future projections of impervious cover climate change projections future water demand and recent changes in anthropogenic land cover in the han river basin the clue s model verburg et al 2002 was used to simulate future projections of impervious land cover for the year 2050 in the han river basin the clue s model comprises two parts a non spatial demand module and a spatially explicit allocation procedure the non spatial module calculates the area changes for all land uses at the aggregate level verburg et al 2002 non spatial demands are converted into land use changes at various locations in the study area during the spatially explicit allocation procedure yearly land use demands which must be defined prior to the allocation procedure can be set using various approaches such as economic models lin et al 2007 the 2008 land cover map from the kme and 2008 clue s land cover map were compared to evaluate the land use generated by clue s for the studied watersheds the clue s was set to a 1 1 km resolution due to the limited number of grids the kappa coefficient cohen 1960 was 0 78 and values between 0 6 and 0 8 represent high agreement between the classification map and the ground reference information the future land uses in 2050 were predicted by applying the derived regression models and the prepared land uses the future impervious land cover was projected to increase in many watersheds throughout the han river basin by 2050 details on the methodology and the results of future land cover projections can be found in the study by lee et al 2016 the projected values of impervious land cover were compared to the current impervious land cover in 2008 to calculate a percent change metric for each watershed the impervious area change metric was calculated as follows 8 b i o l o g i c a l c o n d i t i o n m e t r i c o

baseline period from 1976 to 2005 and the projected temperature and precipitation from 2040 to 2069 were calculated for each watershed in the han river basin in this study rcp 8 5 assumes that the ghg emissions will increase throughout the 21st century and approach very high levels 940 ppm co2 by 2100 the hadgem3 ra model published by the kma is currently available for the han river basin as a

urbanization land cover between 2008 and 2014 was also calculated for each watershed to examine drastic land use changes the simple zonal statistics were used to assign values for the land cover statistical data at the sub watershed level this metric represents recent landscape alterations which are an important indicator of aquatic ecosystem degradation schueler 1994 king et al 2011 recent land cover data indicate that anthropogenic land uses have continued to increase throughout the han river basin in recent years the recent land cover change metric was calculated as follows 13 r e c e

watershed s ecological conditions gregory et al 2002 lackey 2001 palmer et al 2005 the social metrics that appear to be potentially measurable and relevant to recovery include the role of agency involvement existing priority recognition community information flow economic incentives and measures of economic well being in this study three essential indicators were selected to assess the social contexts 1 the financial independence rate 2 the grdp and 3 the number of water management public officers which includes waterworks and sewerage thus this indicator is related to the socioeconomic aspects of coping with water quality problems such as the waterworks distribution ratio the simple zonal statistics were used to assign values for the social context components at the sub watershed level 2 8 watershed health vulnerability and social context index formulation the watershed health vulnerability and social context were evaluated by normalizing the metric scores to integrate data for multiple watershed attributes into a composite score normalization was conducted by defining a reference value for the indicator score such as health vulnerability and social context by percentile rank for communication purposes the indicator score was scaled to normalize the sub index and final watershed index scores to a range from 0 to 1 the indicator scores for watershed health and social context must also be directionally aligned meaning that higher scores should equate to better conditions for each metric the indicator scores for watershed vulnerability indicate the opposite of the watershed health indicator scores the inverse 1 x of each value e g water quality components can be taken for metrics that were not directionally aligned using their original units a composite index of watershed health was constructed by averaging the normalized indicator scores for each attribute a sub index was first calculated for attributes with more than one indicator and the sub indices were then averaged to obtain the integrated watershed health index score u s epa 2012 similar to the method used to calculate the watershed health index the vulnerability and social context indices were calculated by normalizing and combining the individual metric scores depending on the specific management objectives placing more weight on some ecological attributes than on others and using optional sub indices may be appropriate at that point the process becomes subjective and a logical decision framework can be used to solicit and document expert opinions smith et al 2003 weighting was not used in this integrated assessment study the normalized metrics sub indices and integrated watershed indices were calculated as follows 14 n o r m a l i z e d m e t r i c v l a u e o b s e r v e d

watershed resilience screening method provides a systematic approach for comparing watersheds and identifying differences in how well these regions may respond to restoration resilience is defined as the likelihood that an impaired watershed will attain certain water quality standards or other valued attributes given its ecological capacity to regain its functions its exposure to stressors and the social context that affects efforts to improve its condition u s epa 2012 the original tool was developed to establish restoration priorities for impaired watersheds norton et al 2009 scoring the three classes of metrics ensures that ecological conditions stressor scenarios and social factors are all addressed distinguishing the influence of social variables from the influence of watershed conditions is particularly valuable because social variables often determine the success of restoration fig 3 a illustrates a three dimensional bubble plot for integrating the three summary scores in this study plotting the summary score in a two dimensional matrix of integrated capacities and stressors identifies the relative recovery potential of the watershed based on conditional variables a high capacity with low stress zone a signifies better resilience prospects pass whereas a low capacity with high stress zone c implies lower resilience fail the bubbles organize social scores into relative dot sizes which enable the user to compare resilience in this study the resilience for the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin were analyzed using the results of integrated capacity metrics watershed hydrological health water quality aquatic habitats and biological conditions stressor exposure metrics watershed vulnerability and social context metrics according to this screening process the results of these watershed health and vulnerability assessments can be used to set strategic management priorities at the watershed scale fig 3b illustrates the methodology used to assign relative priorities in the han river basin the median watershed health score for the basin splits the y axis in half and the median watershed vulnerability score for the basin splits the x axis in half these two median lines create four quadrants that can be used to classify watersheds according to their relative restoration and protection needs healthy watersheds with high vulnerability zone b can be considered a priority for protection actions before watershed health is degraded healthy watersheds with low vulnerability zone a should still be protected but the need may not be as urgent degraded watersheds with low vulnerability zone d can be considered a priority for restoration because of their high potential for recovery and degraded watersheds with high vulnerability zone c can be considered less of a priority degraded watersheds with low vulnerability can be considered a priority for restoration because of their high potential for recovery whereas degraded watersheds with high vulnerability can be considered less of a priority when the emphasis is on achieving results and demonstrating management effectiveness u s epa 2012 in this study the protection and restoration priorities of the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin were classified using watershed health and vulnerability index scores according to this management prioritization process 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of watershed health vulnerability and social context in the han river basin the results of the individual assessments were synthesized to integrate and assess the watershed health vulnerability and social context index scores in the han river basin the sample areas used to explain the differences in the watershed health results for each component included the 101206 urban 1 4 and forest 88 1 100201 urban 0 8 and forest 88 2 and 101801 urban 9 8 and forest 55 7 standard watersheds fig 2a the 101206 100201 and 101801 standard watersheds were located in the upstream region of the soyang dam syd in the upstream region of the chungju dam cjd and in the downstream region of the paldang dam pdd respectively watershed health analyses of each component were conducted for the 237 sub watersheds as standard watersheds of the han river basin using the data reconstruction results for the landscape stream geomorphology hydrology water quality aquatic habitat conditions and biological conditions fig 4 displays the normalized scores for each of the six attribute sub indices and the integrated watershed health scores the integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther down the watershed the watershed health scores for the 101206 and 100201 standard watersheds were 1 and 0 91 respectively indicating very healthy watersheds although the watershed health was good distinctive weaknesses were discovered namely the hydrological conditions 0 06 in the 101206 watershed and the water quality conditions 0 1 in the 100201 watershed the watershed health of the 101801 standard watershed was low at 0 25 whereas the hydrology and aquatic habitat conditions were relatively healthy watershed vulnerability assessment was conducted based on a land use change model climate change predictive model water use forecast and recent land use change forecast fig 5 the impervious watershed area downstream of the han river basin is expected to continue growing through 2050 fig 5a the recent land cover change patterns steadily increased in a similar fashion to the impervious area increase particularly over the past seven years fig 5d some parts of the downstream region that had already been urbanized exhibited low vulnerability the vulnerability of water demand was high in the downstream region of the han river basin following the trend towards urban population concentration fig 5c fig 6 shows the results of the social context assessment based on the financial independence rate grdp and number of water management public officers each indicator can be described as very significant providing a substantial boost to public support for restoring affected watersheds the higher the financial independence rate fig 6a of a watershed is the higher the water resource stability and the grdp of a watershed are fig 6b grdp is the economic indicator that allows investment for water resource policies and projects the economic support and governance had a high probability in the urban area of the downstream region compared to many parts of the upstream region fig 7 and table 3 show the effects of each component on the watershed health vulnerability and social context according to the watershed locations test area of fig 2c in the han river basin 3 2 analysis of watershed resilience and protection and restoration priorities in the han river basin prior to analyzing the protection and restoration priorities resilience screening was conducted to assess the resilience of watersheds using the results of integrated capacities watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure watershed vulnerability and social context in 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin fig 8 in this study the resilience screening which included orthogonal measurements of the integrated capacity stressor exposure and social context was quantile rank ordered by comparative screening methods including the sum of ranks and cluster analysis scores of high capacity with low stressor zone a indicated better resilience prospects pass with social scores greater than 0 5 whereas the scores of low capacity with high stressors zone c indicated lower resilience fail with social scores less than 0 5 according to the sum of ranks method fig 8a resilience screening by cluster analysis was conducted to cover all the watersheds and to verify the results of the sum of ranks method and the results were classified into three levels high 89 watersheds 38 medium 82 watersheds 35 and low 66 watersheds 28 fig 8b fig 9 a shows the spatial distribution results of the cluster analysis which assigned nominal rankings of low medium and high priority for the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin the resilience rankings were higher for the upstream watersheds which exhibited better watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions and less impairment these rankings were lower for some parts of the upstream region with low funding prospects even though the watershed health was good the resilience rankings for the downstream watersheds were intermediate with better funding prospects despite the poor health conditions and high impairment the resilience rankings in this study provide an alternate view of prioritization possibilities the results of the protection and restoration priorities are described below the spatial distribution results of four priorities namely protection 51 watersheds 22 protection priority 68 watersheds 29 restoration 51 watersheds 22 and restoration priorities 67 watersheds 28 were assigned to the 237 sub watersheds in the han river basin as shown in fig 9b most of the regions in the syd and cjd watersheds in the upstream region of the han river basin required protection or protection priority and most regions in the downstream area of the pdd watersheds required restoration or restoration priority the final result is a map that shows the areas with high priority for restoration and more than average resilience fig 9c this approach can be utilized for a number of standard watersheds local communities and regions throughout the han river basin these studies compare the relative likelihoods of recovery and the application of restoration priorities among the restoration group of basins in the case studies below 3 3 case studies application strategy for restoration priorities for watershed management according to the above results the four different types of watersheds and the management goals of recovery and priority presented a flexible interaction between systematic data and analysis and compared management actions of recovery and priority for the watersheds in the han river basin the individual scores for each of the metrics and sub indices can help guide the selection of specific management actions for a given watershed to address more specific objectives figs 10 13 display the detailed component scores for four example watersheds namely the 100414 101301 100609 and 101801 standard watersheds the 100414 watershed was identified as a restoration area low resilience with a low watershed health score 0 18 especially in terms of low green area groundwater and water quality but a relatively high vulnerability score 0 70 especially in terms of changes to impervious land cover and recent land cover changes this result indicates a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves total maximum daily load tmdl implementation and groundwater management and local governments e g reforestation fig 10 the 101301 watershed was identified as a restoration priority high resilience with low watershed health 0 25 and vulnerability scores 0 28 especially in terms of low green areas water quality wetlands and imbalances in domestic industrial and agricultural water use but a relatively high social context score 0 56 these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation and non point source nps pollution management and local governments e g reforestation wetland construction and water transactions fig 11 the 100609 watershed was identified as a restoration area intermediate resilience with a low watershed health score 0 33 especially in terms of low green areas hydrology water quality and biological conditions but a relatively high vulnerability score 0 87 especially in terms of changes to impervious land cover and precipitation changes these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation ecological restoration and drought management and local governments e g reforestation and wetland construction fig 12 finally the 101801 watershed was identified as a restoration priority intermediate resilience with low watershed health 0 25 and vulnerability scores 0 20 especially in terms of low green areas water quality and biological conditions and imbalances in domestic industrial and agricultural water use but a very high social context score 0 96 these results indicate a need for restoration actions by both national e g grassland reserves tmdl implementation and ecological restoration and local governments e g reforestation wetland construction and agricultural diversion point relocation fig 13 by viewing and comparing the health vulnerability and social context scores resilience and priorities for each of the components an understanding of the relative conditions of the assessment components can be used to direct resources to aid in watershed protection and restoration the index scores of this study are planned to be recalculated every five years to meet a comprehensive national water resource plan that incorporates enhanced methods and available data this approach will allow for refinements in our watershed health and vulnerability assessment and the tracking of trends in watershed health over time 4 conclusions this study provides a reference for understanding the amount priority level and location of territories that correspond to watersheds that require conservation and restoration this paper presents the first study of diverse watersheds that incorporates conservation and restoration planning strategies to identify priority areas for conservation and restoration to guide management strategies and actions at the national and regional levels analyses of resilience and protection and restoration priorities were conducted through the quantification of watershed health vulnerability and social context for watershed management strategies in the han river basin resilience screening was conducted to assess the recovery potential of watersheds using the results of integrated capacities watershed hydrological health water quality and ecological conditions stressor exposure watershed vulnerability and social contexts the results of the watershed health and vulnerability assessments can be used to set strategic management priorities at the watershed scale the resilience screening classified the results into three levels namely high 89 watersheds 38 medium 82 watersheds 35 and low 66 watersheds 28 using the sum of ranks method and cluster analysis most of the regions in the syd and cjd watersheds in the upstream region of the han river basin require protection and protection priority while most areas in the downstream region of the pdd watersheds require restoration and restoration priority this approach can be utilized in a number of standard watersheds local communities and regions throughout the han river basin these studies compare the relative likelihoods of recovery and prioritize the application of restoration measures among watersheds in the basin

increasing demand for water karst aquifers have grown more important as a resource modelling the rainfall discharge relationship is an essential step in estimating the sustainable yield of karst aquifers but also in predicting the impacts of climatic or anthropogenic forcing on groundwater resources in the long term even so characterization and modelling of karst aquifers remains a challenging task among the different modelling approaches lumped modelling is recognised as a major tool for analyzing hydrological processes and for managing water resource these models are based on physically sound structures and equations selected by the modeler as representative of the main processes involved together with semi empirical processes abbott and refsgaard 1996 this approach is particularly well suited to karst environments where knowledge of system geometry is usually difficult to gather fleury et al 2009 hartmann et al 2012 the parameters of lumped models cannot be

effective model development practices include careful sensitivity analysis and uncertainty assessment to assess model performance and also model uncertainty and physical realism wagener et al 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 an overview of sensitivity analysis and its link to model calibration and evaluation is provided in pianosi et al 2016 in this paper we propose an adjustable modelling platform karstmod for both the spring discharge simulation at karst outlets and hydrodynamic analysis of the compartments considered in the model karstmod provides a modular user friendly modelling environment

based on model application to the fontaine de vaucluse site of the sno karst network 2 platform overview 2 1 workflow in the first step the user defines the model structure and fluxes using the graphical interface as stated in the introduction lumped models are based on physically sound structures and equations the user may thus use his understanding of the main processes involved to define the model however we recommend a gradual complexification approach with careful assessment of the influence of the selected compartment and fluxes on the resulting model behaviour and equifinality the next step is to specify user defined values of rainfall p evapotranspiration e t and reservoir pumping the user also defines the performance measure and the warm up calibration and validation periods the model can run using user specified parameter values run mode or in an automatic calibration mode most model outputs are available in both run and calibration modes fig 1 the run mode may be especially useful for educational and learning purposes because it allows a direct analysis of the effect of the model parameters on the model results manual calibration may also leave the users e g students facing non linearity of the model response calibration mode provides a systematic exploration of the parameters space the outcomes of this exploration are the selection of the optimal parameter set for a selected performance measure and a set of graphs that allow a first grasp of equifinality issues see section 2 4 2 2 2 model structure and equations karst aquifers can be consensually decomposed into an infiltration and a saturated zone perrin et al 2003 sauter et al 2008 the infiltration zone comprises the soil and epikarst subsystem which may store part of the infiltrated water plus the unsaturated subsystem which connects the epikarst to the phreatic zone by drainage through a vertical network of fissures and conduits it may be locally saturated the saturated sub system is split into a network of high permeability conduits and low permeability volumes with a high storage capacity the relative importance of these compartments in the hydrological functionning of the karst system depends on rock texture and structure and on the karst aquifer genesis history non linearity affects the hydraulic connexions within and between the different compartments labat et al 1999 the modular structure proposed in karstmod is based on this conceptual model a thorough literature review of existing lumped models and consideration of equifinality

area the internal fluxes are detailed in the user s guide 2 3 model calibration warm up calibration and validation periods are controlled entirely by the user the model provides the possibility to calibrate the initial water level in the activated compartments discontinuous calibration and validation periods are allowed the performance criteria proposed in karstmod are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the modified balance error be perrin et al 2001 the user may apply the performance criteria to either the full range of the variable or to values above or below discharge thresholds these functionalities make it possible to limit the influence of high discharge values in the nse and to focus the analysis on either high or low flow periods karstmod allows either single or multi objective calibration approaches the objective function used in the calibration procedure is either one of the performance criteria defined above or an aggregated objective function defined as the weighted sum of two performance criteria in the following we use wobj as a generic notation for the selected objective function the multi objective problem is thus reduced to a scalarized one the model is calibrated using a quasi monte carlo procedure with a sobol sequence sampling of the parameter space sobol 1977 the procedure is stopped when either n m a x parameter sets satisfying wobj greater than the user defined threshold value wobj m i n are collected or when the elapsed simulation time reaches the maximum duration t m a x specified by the user the user specifies both wobj m i n and t m a x the differential model equations 1a 1b 1c 1d and 1e are solved using a fourth order runge kutta scheme and user specified initial water levels in the selected compartments as initial conditions 2 4 model outputs 2 4 1 optimal simulation analysis the optimal parameter set is defined as the parameter set of the sobol sequence sampling that yields the best model performance over the calibration period with respect to the objective function wobj the optimal simulation is the simulation that results from a model run using the optimal parameter set regarding the optimal simulation the following graphs are available i internal and external variables and fluxes as a function of time ii cumulative volumes at the outlet as a function of time iii simulated mass balance per time step iv simulation error as a function of time v q s versus q o b s plot these graphs make it possible to investigate the internal behaviour of the model and to detect possible drifts the q s versus q o b s plot highlights simulation error variability during the simulation period the following analyses are also available i cumulative probability plots for the q s and observed q o b s discharges ii auto correlogram of p iii cross correlogram between p and q s p and q o b s q o b s and q s the discharge cumulative probability plots provide insight into processes that may influence the distribution law of discharge values such as the existence of overflow springs or the extra input or output of water coming from or towards a neighbouring system mangin 1975 marsaud 1996 the simple and cross spectral analyses complete the study of correlogram functions providing information on the regulation time of the system i e its inertia related to the nature of its storage and on the frequency of the phenomena that produce flow variations at the spring mangin 1975 2 4 2 equifinality analysis most environmental problems are ill posed i e encounter issues about the unicity identifiability and stability of the problem solution ebel and loague 2006 as a consequence many different representations of the modelled system may be considered as equally acceptable beven 2006 in karstmod parametric equifinality can be investigated using the following tools dotty plots of the values of the objective function calibration period against the values of the parameters x i for all the parameter sets of the sobol sequence that satisfy wobj wobj m i n these plots provide a preliminary analysis of the distribution of the optimum values of each parameter dotty plot of the values of the performance criteria used to define the aggregated objective function for all the parameter sets of the sobol sequence that satisfy wobj wobj m i n these plots allow to investigate possible conflicts between the performance criteria pareto frontier gupta et al 1998 variance based first order s i and total s t i sensitivity indexes for the model parameters x i these indexes help estimating the influence of the parameters on the model output and thus to detect over parameterization the sensitivity indexes are related to the decomposition of the variance of the calibration variable here the discharge at the outlet into terms either due to each parameter i taken singularly first order indices or to the interactions between parameters saltelli et al 2008 both indexes are calculated using the sobol procedure described in saltelli 2002 karstmod enables to use the simulation results from all parameter sets yielding wobj wobj m i n for the evaluation of the uncertainty on the simulation results the approach is derived from the regional sensitivity analysis rsa hornberger and spear 1981 and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 instead of selecting a unique parameter set as the outcome of the calibration process these methods consider that all parameter sets yielding satisfactory results over the calibration period behavioural parameter sets should be considered in the prediction process the value of wobj over the calibration period is used as a likelihood measure for each behavioural parameter set based on this assumption karstmod produces the following simulation results minimal and maximal discharge values simulated at time t from the behavioural parameter sets they help figure out the spread of the simulation results for the behavioural parameter sets limits for the 90 confidence interval for the simulated discharge at time t the most likely value of the simulated discharge which is estimated considering both the objective function and the threshold value defined by the user to constrain the behavioural parameters set 3 test case the fontaine de vaucluse spring is the only outlet of a 1115 km2 recharge area located south east of france its mean flow rate is one of the highest in europe 18 m3 over the 1966 2016 period a 3 compartments lumped model of the rainfall discharge relationship was proposed by fleury et al 2007 the upper soil compartment feeds two lower compartments that respectively simulate rapid and slow discharges the authors used rainfall and temperature time series from four weather gauging stations to derive the meteorological p and et inputs calibration was performed using the 1995 1996 hydrological year with no warm up period based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency we have been able to successfully reproduce the model structure see fig 3 and results from fleury et al 2007 using karstmod the platform also allows to test the sensitivity to the initial conditions we let all parameters vary across a one order of magnitude range initial water levels were also allowed to vary the calibration range for the initial water levels has been set according to the observed water levels range during simulation we ran the calibration with no warm up period and with a one year warm up fig 4 shows the observed and simulated discharge with the confidence interval for the simulated discharge fig 5 shows the sensitivity indexes when no warm up is used the sensitivity to the initial conditions may be greater than the sensitivity to model parameter k e c which suggests that the calibration result is sensitive to the initial water levels using a one year warm up the spread of the simulated discharge reduces in the first months of the calibration the effect of the initial conditions on the calibration results becomes negligible as compared to the effect of the model parameters as evidenced by the new sensitivity indexes 4 conclusion the platform can be regarded as a useful tool for analyzing the hydrological processes for karst systems and for assessing the impact of management policies for example when pumping is performed directly in the karst network although karstmod has been designed for simulation of spring discharge at karst outlets this platform could obviously be applied to any rainfall runoff relationship modelling purpose thanks to its friendly interface no programming skills are required to run the modelling platform karstmod will therefore prove especially useful for learning and occasional users e g students for research applications karstmod provides a primary analysis easy exploration and comparison of models structures future developments of the platform include i the consideration of the uncertainty on the measured input data in the calibration process ii the proposition of additional transfer functions guinot et al 2015 e g acknowledgements this platform is developed within the framework of the

parameter sets satisfying wobj greater than the user defined threshold value wobj m i n are collected or when the elapsed simulation time reaches the maximum duration t m a x specified by the user the user specifies both wobj m i n and t m a x the differential model equations 1a 1b 1c 1d and 1e are solved using a fourth order runge kutta scheme and user specified initial water levels in the selected compartments as initial conditions 2 4 model outputs 2 4 1 optimal simulation analysis the optimal parameter set is defined as the parameter set of the sobol sequence sampling that yields the best model performance over the calibration period with respect to the objective function wobj the optimal simulation is the simulation that results from a model run using the optimal parameter set regarding the optimal simulation the following graphs are available i internal and external variables and fluxes as a function of time ii cumulative volumes at the outlet as a function of time iii simulated mass balance per time step iv simulation error as a function of time v q s versus q o b s plot these graphs make it possible to investigate the internal behaviour of the model and to detect possible drifts the q s versus q o b s plot highlights simulation error variability during the simulation period the following analyses are also available i cumulative probability plots for the q s and observed q o b s discharges ii auto correlogram of p iii cross correlogram between p and q s p and q o b s q o b s and q s the discharge cumulative probability plots provide insight into processes that may influence the distribution law of discharge values such as the existence of overflow springs or the extra input or output of water coming from or towards a neighbouring system mangin 1975 marsaud 1996 the simple and cross spectral analyses complete the study of correlogram functions providing information on the regulation time of the system i e its inertia related to the nature of its storage and on the frequency of the phenomena that produce flow variations at the spring mangin 1975 2 4 2 equifinality analysis most environmental problems are ill posed i e encounter issues about the unicity identifiability and stability of the problem solution ebel and loague 2006 as a consequence many different representations of the modelled system may be considered as equally acceptable beven 2006 in karstmod parametric equifinality can be investigated using the following tools dotty plots of the values of the objective function calibration period against the values of the parameters x i for all the parameter sets of the sobol sequence that satisfy wobj wobj m i n these plots provide a preliminary analysis of the distribution of the optimum values of each parameter dotty plot of the values of the performance criteria used to define the aggregated objective function for all the parameter sets of the sobol sequence that satisfy wobj wobj m i n these plots allow to investigate possible conflicts between the performance criteria pareto frontier gupta et al 1998 variance based first order s i and total s t i sensitivity indexes for the model parameters x i these indexes help estimating the influence of the parameters on the model output and thus to detect over parameterization the sensitivity indexes are related to the decomposition of the variance of the calibration variable here the discharge at the outlet into terms either due to each parameter i taken singularly first order indices or to the interactions between parameters saltelli et al 2008 both indexes are calculated using the sobol procedure described in saltelli 2002 karstmod enables to use the simulation results from all parameter sets yielding wobj wobj m i n for the evaluation of the uncertainty on the simulation results the approach is derived from the regional sensitivity analysis rsa hornberger and spear 1981 and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 instead of selecting a unique parameter set as the outcome of the calibration process these methods consider that all parameter sets yielding satisfactory results over the calibration period behavioural parameter sets should be considered in the prediction process the value of wobj over the calibration period is used as a likelihood measure for each behavioural parameter set based on this assumption karstmod produces the following simulation results minimal and maximal discharge values simulated at time t from the behavioural parameter sets they help figure out the spread of the simulation results for the behavioural parameter sets limits for the 90 confidence interval for the simulated discharge at time t the most likely value of the simulated discharge which is estimated considering both the objective function and the threshold value defined by the user to constrain the behavioural parameters set 3 test case the fontaine de vaucluse spring is the only outlet of a 1115 km2 recharge area located south east of france its mean flow rate is one of the highest in europe 18 m3 over the 1966 2016 period a 3 compartments lumped model of the rainfall discharge relationship was proposed by fleury et al 2007 the upper soil compartment feeds two lower compartments that respectively simulate rapid and slow discharges the authors used rainfall and temperature time series from four weather gauging stations to derive the meteorological p and et inputs calibration was performed using the 1995 1996 hydrological year with no warm up period based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency we have been able to successfully reproduce the model structure see fig 3 and results from fleury et al 2007 using karstmod the platform also allows to test the sensitivity to the initial conditions we let all parameters vary across a one order of magnitude range initial water levels were also allowed to vary the calibration range for the initial water levels has been set according to the observed water levels range during simulation we ran the calibration with no warm up period and with a one year warm up fig 4 shows the observed and simulated discharge with the confidence interval for the simulated discharge fig 5 shows the sensitivity indexes when no warm up is used the sensitivity to the initial conditions may be greater than the sensitivity to model parameter k e c which suggests that the calibration result is sensitive to the initial water levels using a one year warm up the spread of the simulated discharge reduces in the first months of the calibration the effect of the initial conditions on the calibration results becomes negligible as compared to the effect of the model parameters as evidenced by the new sensitivity indexes 4 conclusion the platform can be regarded as a useful tool for analyzing the hydrological processes for karst systems and for assessing the impact of management policies for example when pumping is performed directly in the karst network although karstmod has been designed for simulation of spring discharge at karst outlets this platform could obviously be applied to any rainfall runoff relationship modelling purpose thanks to its friendly interface no programming skills are required to run the modelling platform karstmod will therefore prove especially useful for learning and occasional users e g students for research applications karstmod provides a primary analysis easy exploration and comparison of models structures future developments of the platform include i the consideration of the uncertainty on the measured input data in the calibration process ii the proposition of additional transfer functions guinot et al 2015 e g acknowledgements this platform is developed within the framework of the

26133,integrated model systems that simulate land use and land cover change lucc and associated changes of ecosystem services es are increasingly important for supporting policies and management

corresponding author 1 introduction mountainous watersheds provide a wide range of essential ecosystem services es to human society most notably through the supply of purified fresh water from upstream headwater catchments ma 2005 teeb 2012 land use and cover change lucc however have altered the capacity of these natural water towers to regulate the hydrologic cycle and to control downstream water quantity and quality allen 2004 bhaduri et al 2000 deforestation and clearance of natural vegetation through agricultural expansion have increased the supply of provisioning es such as food fiber and bioenergy power 2010 zhang et al 2007 but have led to dramatic environmental degradation through losses of major regulating es maes et al 2012 schröter et al 2005 particularly in mountains lucc causes severe soil erosion and water quality degradation through sediments in combination with excessive nutrient exports due to high fertilizer use foley et al 2005 montgomery 2007 because the provision of es is increasingly considered in policy making daily and matson 2008 environmental policies and management programs must therefore take into account the various potential outcomes involved in land use decisions and require a priori balancing of multiple region specific es indicators kremen 2005 viglizzo et al 2012 this requires modeling approaches that integrate both lucc and the associated biophysical processes and impacts on es dynamic lucc models such as cellular automata ca which reflect complex systems of lucc and their spatial and temporal patterns balzter et al 1998 can be coupled with hydrological models to gain insight into the dynamics of lucc due to specific policy programs such as water management plans and their hydrological responses within a landscape deng et al 2015 memarian et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 ca based models are widely used for lucc predictions as they can capture complex emergent behavior using a set of simple transitional rules clarke and hoppen 1997 ca simulates spatio temporal patterns of lucc of grid cells depending on their current status and their interactions with the neighborhood verburg et al 2004 veldkamp and lambin 2001 wu 1996 lucc in an upland catchment does not only impact local es but can have immense consequences for remote water users e g through pollution of downstream drinking water aquifers and reservoirs hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 account for the upstream downstream connectivity within complex watersheds and allow the prediction of lucc impacts on water related es remote from their sources swat is widely used to estimate lucc impacts on water resources arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 and has been coupled with lucc models in different studies e g deng et al 2015 kim et al 2013 marshall and randhir 2008 memarian et al 2014 park et al 2011a zhang et al 2013 2015 2016 zhou et al 2013 these studies assessed the potential hydrological impacts of future lucc deng et al 2015 marshall and randhir 2008 zhou et al 2013 and the combined effects of lucc and climate change kim et al 2013 park et al 2011a zhang et al 2015 2016 however most of these studies use historical trends to predict future lucc and only few consider the role of environmental policies memarian et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 as protection policies and conservation programs are becoming increasingly important as a response to environmental degradation in many regions they constitute a major driver for future lucc different types of policy instruments such as payments for ecosystem services pes e g engel et al 2008 or command and control regulations have shown both positive and negative outcomes and their implementation still raise questions about their efficiency and targeting to achieve the proposed conservation goals engel et al 2008 moreover the impacts of environmental policies can be highly scale dependent and show various impacts for instance at a subbasin level compared to an entire watershed outlet zhou et al 2013 in order to use model outputs to support decision making modeling systems must therefore be sensitive to different management option and policy alternatives and provide insight into the various environmental impacts at different spatial scales mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 we present a modeling procedure that integrates different types of environmental policy instruments and that simulates their consequences on lucc and es through a combination of ca and swat we developed the ca model based on multinomial logistic regression mnl and neighborhood interactions to simulate possible lucc for the next 50 years 2006 2056 under four different types of policy scenarios we combined the output of the ca with swat to simulate the hydrologic responses of the policy induced lucc at the subbasin and watershed scale both the ca and swat model were parameterized by using comprehensive datasets from field studies in order to ensure high data quality and reliability of model outputs mcintosh et al 2011 in addition to previous ca swat modeling frameworks we translated the biophysical output variables of swat into water related es indicators to identify potential synergies and trade offs between provisioning and regulating es and quantified the associated model uncertainties the spatially explicit identification of synergies and trade offs of multiple es by taking account of uncertainties plays a key role for supporting political decisions francesconi et al 2016 volk 2013 although it is beyond the scope of this study to present a new decision support system dss mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 we argue that our modeling procedure can provide an informative and robust basis for the development of a dss that can be used in practice for mountainous watershed where water provisioning and regulation are major concerns of water managers and environmental policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we applied our modeling procedure to the soyang reservoir watershed located in gangwon province in the north eastern mountain range of south korea fig 1 lucc in the watershed through de reforestation agricultural expansion and a steadily growing urbanization has led to severe water quality degradation of the country s largest drinking water reservoir which is the main fresh water provider for half of the population including the seoul metropolitan area kim et al 2000 maharjan et al 2016 therefore several environmental regulation and protection zones have been established such as natural conservation areas around the soyang reservoir and national parks in the seorak and odae mountains fig 1 kim 2006 however to invigorate local economic development and income in the gangwon province highland agriculture especially the production of commercial crops has expanded into mountainous areas due to governmental support lee 1990 water pollution through sediment and nutrient loads originating from agricultural land have been identified as the main source of declining water quality since the 1980s park et al 2010 highland agricultural activities in upstream catchments such as the mandae and jawoon stream watersheds have intensified during the last decades now covering about 54 of the total dry field area fig 1 kim et al 2014a these highland production hotspots are the main contributors of sediment and nutrient loads with substantial impacts on downstream ecosystems and the trophic state of the reservoir park et al 2010 especially for the mandae stream watershed often referred to as haean myeon catchment high erosion rates and nitrogen losses have been reported during heavy rainstorm events during the east asian summer monsoon e g arnhold et al 2013 2014 kettering et al 2012 kim et al 2014b ruidisch et al 2013 after extreme weather events such as typhoon ewiniar in 2006 have caused severe damages through erosion and water supply problems park et al 2011b the korean government implemented a set of comprehensive countermeasure programs including a reforestation program for marginal agricultural lands in 2008 to mitigate water erosion and pollutant exports from highland areas however the long term effects of those programs are difficult to estimate due to the various social economic drivers of lucc thus the ca swat modeling procedure presented here aims at providing insights in the lucc dynamics and the efficiency of different policy scenarios to restore es in the watershed 2 2 conservation policy scenarios among the environmental policy instruments land use zoning is a widely used command and control regulation tool which involves setting zones where lucc is prohibit or promoted le et al 2010 another important instrument aims at providing economic incentives to farmers or other land use actors to change their behavior referred to as payments for environmental services pes engel et al 2008 tomich et al 2004 we assess three possible policy intervention scenarios proposed by the korean government to conserve future es in the watershed a reforestation program through direct payments to farmers ref a forest protection program for high slope areas pro and a combined policy of reforestation and protection r p for a 50 year time period i e from 2006 to 2056 with 10 year time intervals table 1 we compare simulated lucc results of those scenarios with the current development trend assuming the continuation of past lucc patterns from 1995 to 2006 under no policy intervention scenario no under ref the currently ongoing direct payments to farmers for purchasing marginal agricultural land at elevations above 400 m and slopes higher than 15 for reforestation are continued jun and kang 2010 randomly assigned 500 ha per 10 year time interval this policy program has reconverted agricultural areas of up to 50 ha every year due to limited financial resources and farmers participation although pes are efficient tools to conserve es compared to other policy instruments engel et al 2008 they can result in externalities by private actors behaviors jack et al 2008 to complement and or modify this pes policy we also consider command and control regulation as an alternative option forest conversion for land utilization is restricted in steep slope areas higher than 25 currently kim 2015 but the government considers strengthening the pro policy therefore we consider tightened policy that pro restricts marginal forest areas from conversion to agriculture on slopes higher than 15 which have been identified as areas most vulnerable to soil erosion it is a direct regulation policy for forest areas to prevent agricultural conversion and human interventions which can show more efficient results over a long term miteva et al 2012 the r p scenario combines reforestation payments with strict enforcement of forest protection which complement both pes and regulation policies 2 3 modeling lucc with ca ca models simulate the spatial interactions of various lucc processes white and engelen 2000 and endogenous changes of status and numbers of cells for each time step based on cellular dynamics verburg et al 2004 ca models are based on transitional rules that change the state of cells based on the spatial characteristics of the current cells and their interactions with the neighborhood wu 1996 to develop the ca model we applied mnl because it can estimate spatial features of lucc and quantitative coefficients between lucc and their driving factors wu 2002 bishop 2006 liao et al 2016 transition rules in the ca are calculated as transitional probabilities of changing a cell s land cover lc type in the mnl process we calculated the transitional probability of a cell from lc type i to lc type j at time step t as follows feng et al 2011 liao et al 2016 white and engelen 1993 wu 2002 1 s i j t 1 s i j t ω i j t c o n n in the transition function ʃ states of cell ij for the next time period with t 1 s i j t 1 are determined by the states of cell ij during a specific time t s i j t neighborhood function of cell ω i j t lucc constraint factors con and cells number n feng et al 2011 we developed our ca model using the netlogo software ver 5 3 1 fig 2 shows the structure of the ca model and table 2 lists the input parameters used to calculate the transition probabilities we applied 90 by 90 m resolution uniformly for all spatial data to match their resolution with output lc maps lc states of each cell based on local transitional probabilities are calculated from results of a mnl between 1995 and 2007 kim et al 2014a for neighborhood functions we calculated neighborhood enrichment factors proposed by verburg et al 2004 with the neighborhood extent having the strongest neighborhood effect as kim et al 2014a calculated the factors for major lc types urban forest agriculture we adopted the neighborhood extent with the highest enrichment values as neighborhood boundaries spatial ranges of local interactions between neighboring cells are set by these enrichment factors and values are calculated based on white and engelen 2000 we use the circular neighborhood size to calculate neighborhood factors within their radius boundary which is adopted in many ca based lucc models e g barredo et al 2003 chen et al 2002 he et al 2008 li and yeh 2000 mao et al 2013 white and engelen 1993 because the circular neighborhood considers all neighborhood directions equally it can perform neighborhood effects effectively li and yeh 2000 and appropriately reflect clustered lucc chen et al 2002 therefore we applied circular neighborhood interactions since lucc in the watershed have dominantly occurred in riverside and highland agricultural areas kim et al 2014a the neighborhood conversion probability of a cell from interactions with neighboring cells is calculated by the proportion of the sum of specific lc k cells to the total number of cells within the circular neighborhood range r which is adapted from rectangular neighborhood probability functions defined by feng et al 2011 and liu et al 2008 we defined eight lc classes for the watershed forest dry non paddy fields rice paddies grassland residential areas wetland bare soil and water fig 1 however transition was only allowed for six lc classes water bodies and wetland areas are fixed in the model and were not allowed to be converted residential areas are set as constraint areas because urbanization is a common pattern in suburban areas of south korea and reconversion to forest or agriculture is very unlikely to occur when residential areas have been abandoned in isolated rural regions they remained as residential covers because they are inefficient in land uses to other purposes hwang et al 2007 once cells are converted to residential areas they cannot be converted to other lc types anymore constraint factors are also set for forest areas designated as conservation or reforestation areas in these areas lc transition processes are stopped and they maintain their lc type after they are converted by policy effects the model is calibrated and validated to generate optimal simulation results under current parameters and probability functions the calibration of the model was performed by adjusting model parameters and transitional change rules torrens 2011 to reflect urban expansion and remaining large scale farm and forest areas we keep current urban areas and clustered forest and agricultural areas as fixed areas white and engelen 2000 validation of the ca model is conducted by assessing the performance of the output of models quantitatively by assessing location accuracy which estimates the similarity and difference between model outputs and the actual status al ahmadi et al 2013 van vliet et al 2016 to validate the ca model with the location accuracy method we used the three map comparison method which quantifies the model s accuracy in simulating persistence and changes in pixel state pontius et al 2008 this method allows comparisons between the actual map as reference 1 and simulation maps as reference 2 by calculating agreement levels from correctly simulated persistence and changes as well as disagreement levels from errors in persistence and changes pontius and millones 2011 the output quality of lucc simulation models should be carefully assessed before adopting models to real world conditions because of the complex phenomena of lucc processes and the associated high uncertainty van vliet et al 2016 as an additional measure of model performance we calculated the figure of merit which compares observed and simulated changes to estimate the ratio of their intersections pontius et al 2008 once model validation has been performed we simulated four different future lucc trajectories from 2006 to 2056 with 10 year time intervals representing the four policy scenarios no ref pro and r p based on the lc configuration of the year 2006 2 4 modeling changes in es with swat once lucc for the policy scenarios was quantified and its spatial distribution estimated with the ca model the simulated lc maps were used as inputs to the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 to evaluate the restoration potential of water related es swat is a process based simulation model developed to simulate the impact of land use and management on water sediment and agricultural chemicals gassman et al 2007 although swat was not explicitly designed as an es tool it has been demonstrated in several studies that it is suitable to quantify a range of es indicators and to identify potential synergies and trade offs e g duku et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 lautenbach et al 2013 volk 2013 francesconi et al 2016 provide a comprehensive overview of studies that have used swat to assess es and discuss capabilities and limitations of the model with respect to the es concept swat provides a range of output variables that can be directly related to a number of provisioning and regulating es francesconi et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 we computed four biophysical indicators as proxies for fresh water provisioning erosion prevention and waste water treatment services qiu and turner 2013 teeb 2012 water yield sediment yield total nitrogen n and total phosphorus p see below in addition to its capability to quantify multiple es indicators swat was selected because it accounts for the spatial distribution of es production and beneficiary units through the hydrologic connectivity between upstream and downstream areas fisher et al 2009 vigerstol and aukema 2011 a watershed in swat is partitioned into multiple subbasins which are further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that comprise a combination of unique lc soil and management conditions neitsch et al 2011 which means that all areas with the same combination of lc soil and management within each subbasin are lumped together to form an hru rathjens et al 2015 swat first computes the land phase processes including hydrology erosion nutrient cycling and plant growth at the hru level and calculates for each subbasin the amount of water sediment and nutrients transported to the channel neitsch et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 it should be noted that hrus within a subbasin have no spatial representation and all water sediment and nutrients are directly transported into the channel without considering the transport processes on the land phase rathjens et al 2015 only in the routing phase the downstream transport of water sediment and nutrients through the channel network is computed from subbasin to subbasin to the watershed outlet taking into account instream changes and transformation processes neitsch et al 2011 we used the arcswat 2012 interface with swat 2012 rev 622 to set up and parameterize the model for the soyang reservoir watershed using the input datasets listed in table 3 we divided the watershed into 45 subbasins using a drainage threshold value of 3400 ha this threshold resulted in an average subbasin area of approximately 2 of the entire watershed area which was considered adequate for the simulation of sediment n and p arabi et al 2006 jha et al 2004 jha et al 2004 found that further subdivision and smaller subbasin areas below the 2 threshold do not significantly improve the model performance anymore the dam of the soyang reservoir and a monitoring station near the outflow of the dam were added for later model calibration and validation fig 1 to represent the hydrologic conditions of the reservoir we used the following parameter values provided by the korea water resources corporation k water we set the surface area to 65 9 km2 and 61 8 km2 and the water volume to 2900 106 m3 and 2550 106 m3 for the emergency and principal spillway respectively initial water volume at the beginning of the simulation was set to 1483 106 m3 and for reservoir outflow we used observed daily release records after parameterization of the subbasins and the reservoir we further subdivided the watershed into 3270 hrus by overlaying the soil with the lc map of the year 2006 bl scenario without further partitioning into slope classes the full number of hrus was used without threshold definitions and refinements to account for the entire landscape heterogeneity of the watershed once hrus were defined we applied the following management modifications for the different lc types we removed the harvest and kill operation i e default management operation that stops growth of all plants in an hru and removes biomass as yield at the end of the growing season for forest wetland grassland residential and barren land and replaced it with a harvest only operation i e management operation that removes biomass only and allows plants to continue growing for grassland and residential areas for dry non paddy agriculture and rice paddies we created new operation schedules to reflect the typical local agricultural management practices table 4 we selected cabbage as a representative crop for dry agriculture because it covers the largest area of dry fields in the gangwon province after soybean lee et al 2016 in contrast to soybean cabbage with its short growing period and high fertilization requirements reflects also other locally important cash crops such as radish type number and timing of operations listed in table 4 were adopted from shope et al 2014 and maharjan et al 2016 who compiled local management information for different crop types from various sources including interviews field observations published literature and governmental reports fertilizer n and p application rates were calculated from total n fertilizer inputs for local crops reported by kettering et al 2012 and typical n to p ratios of commonly used fertilizers identified from interviews with local farmers berger et al 2013a b kettering et al 2013 to accurately reflect biomass development and crop yields we adjusted the number of heat units to maturity the radiation use efficiency and the harvest index for cabbage and rice biomass and yields were obtained from plot experiments conducted in the study area described by arnhold et al 2014 kettering et al 2012 and lindner et al 2014 observed average aboveground biomass and yields were 8 0 t ha 1 and 5 6 t ha 1 for cabbage and 17 1 t ha 1 and 8 1 t ha 1 for rice arnhold et al 2014 kettering et al 2012 to approximate these values we applied 1200 and 1800 heat units to maturity 34 kg ha 1 mj m 2 and 65 kg ha 1 mj m 2 radiation use efficiency and harvest indices of 0 7 and 0 5 for cabbage and rice respectively another modification made for cabbage was the adjustment of the initial universal soil loss equation usle cover management c factor which was set to 0 13 based on the work of arnhold et al 2014 who studied local vegetation characteristics of cash crops and their impacts on soil erosion for rice we additionally changed the initial scs curve number to 78 and the usle support practice p factor to 0 1 to account for the terrace structure of paddy fields jung et al 2004 kim et al 2008 after setup and parameter adjustments we ran swat for five years from january 2003 to december 2007 with a two year warm up period using daily recorded climate data of 19 precipitation and 6 climate stations located within and surrounding the soyang reservoir watershed fig 1 we performed semi automated model calibration and validation following the procedure given by arnold et al 2012 for this we used the sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 abbaspour et al 2007 optimization algorithm implemented in the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup ver 5 1 6 2 abbaspour 2014 we divided our three year period of interest without warm up into a calibration january 2005 to december 2006 and a validation january to december 2007 period and performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters with respect to discharge sediment total n and p the preselection of the input parameters was based on literature reviews and previous swat exercises in the study area arnold et al 2012 maharjan et al 2016 shope et al 2014 after sensitive parameters had been identified we calibrated the model using recorded daily discharge into the soyang reservoir and measured sediment total n and p at the stream monitoring station near the reservoir outflow fig 1 we performed 500 model simulations for the calibration period 2005 2006 using initial uncertainty estimates for 32 selected input parameters table 5 within these initially defined ranges the sufi 2 optimization algorithm performed latin hypercube sampling and identified the best parameter combinations for a given objective function between observed and simulated datasets abbaspour et al 2007 2015 although it is recommended to use multiple types of performance measures to evaluate model accuracy bennett et al 2013 haas et al 2016 sufi 2 allows only one objective function we used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function as it is the most widely used performance indicator for hydrological models arnold et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 schuol et al 2008 however we simultaneously kept track of two other objective functions the percent bias pbias and the root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 in order to ensure that also those were within acceptable ranges during the calibration process the initial parameters were then iteratively updated to produce narrower uncertainty ranges centered on the best simulation until no further improvements could be achieved abbaspour et al 2007 2015 schuol et al 2008 table 5 lists the 32 parameters that were adjusted during the sufi 2 calibration procedure with their initial and final uncertainty ranges after the optimum parameter ranges had been identified for the calibration period we ran the model again 500 times for the validation period 2007 using the same ranges to evaluate the model performance for both calibration and validation periods we calculated the p factor and r factor for each of the output variables discharge sediment total n and p the p factor describes the percentage of observed data bracketed by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu band and the r factor indicates the average thickness of the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2007 2015 arnold et al 2012 schuol et al 2008 once calibration and validation for the 2006 lc configuration bl had been performed we set up four swat models for the soyang reservoir watershed representing the potential future lc for the four environmental policy scenarios no ref pro and r p for each of the four models we replaced the lc map of the year 2006 with those simulated by the ca model for the year 2056 the hru definition was performed in the same way as for the baseline scenario by overlaying lc and soil maps see description above thus the future lc changes simulated with the ca model caused slightly different numbers of hrus compared to the baseline but resulted primarily in different percentages of the area covered within each subbasin all other input parameters including subbasin and reservoir configuration management schedules and plant parameter modifications were assumed to be identical to the bl scenario and were adopted accordingly see description above the four future models were run with the swat cup sufi 2 algorithm each with 500 simulations using the final input parameter ranges obtained during the calibration procedure for the bl scenario as listed in table 5 for each of the scenarios we computed water yield sediment yield total n and p expressed with their medians and 95ppu bands that were transported into the soyang reservoir as well as the exports from the two agricultural hotspot watersheds mandae and jawoon finally the four output variables were used to estimate es that describe the watershed s capacity to supply fresh water erosion prevention and waste water treatment teeb 2012 a positive change in water yield for 2056 compared to 2006 represents an increase in fresh water provisioning while a negative change indicates a decline negative changes in sediment yield normalized by the upstream contributing area indicate prevented erosion per unit area negative changes of n and p expressed as concentrations represent waste water treatment per volume of water conversely positive changes in sediment n and p can be interpreted as continued soil and water quality degradation or regulating dis services leh et al 2013 3 results 3 1 model validation and performance after lucc driving factors were calibrated from results of mnl as statistical analysis and by the threshold of changes as conditional transitional rules the ca model was validated using a three map comparison method to quantify model outputs for different lc types table 6 results for forest simulation had the highest accuracy values in the ca model in calibration processes while agricultural lands have lower values the ca model simulates rice paddies as persistent areas in contrast to other lc types while their change areas are less correctly simulated dry field areas have higher accuracy in the agreement of pixels due to higher accuracy in change areas although persistent areas are less correctly estimated when accuracy of change prediction is estimated as figure of merit dry fields have higher values with higher prediction accuracy than other lc types while rice paddies have lower prediction accuracy of change areas overall the figure of merit shows values acceptable to other ca models as estimated by pontius et al 2008 although we simulated various lucc processes the swat model shows an overall satisfactory performance as indicated by the p factor r factor and nse values for the different output variables fig 3 the p factor observed data bracketed by the 95ppu should ideally have a value close to 1 indicating that all observed data are captured by the uncertainty range and the r factor thickness of the 95ppu should be near 0 indicating that the simulated data coincide with the observed abbaspour et al 2007 2015 arnold et al 2012 schuol et al 2008 in practice a p factor of 0 7 or greater and r factor of 1 5 or smaller are considered as satisfactory abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 the nse goodness of fit between observed values and best simulation indicates satisfactory model performance when it exceeds a value of 0 5 and very good performance for values greater than 0 75 arnold et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 for both the calibration and the validation period the p factors and r factors in fig 3 indicate reasonable performance for almost all variables except sediment and p where r factors exceed the threshold for validation also the nse indicates satisfactory to very good model performance for both periods and all variables except for sediment validation we attribute the large r factor and low nse mainly to exceptionally high sediment and nutrients records due to typhoon ewiniar hitting the korean peninsula in 2006 arnhold et al 2014 park et al 2011b the high peaks in the summer of 2006 limited the narrowing of the parameter ranges during calibration and resulted in wide uncertainty bands relative to the observed data for the validation period 2007 fig 3 3 2 impact of conservation policies on lucc because of the highly mountainous topography and limited accessibility of a large proportion of the watershed lucc is concentrated primarily in relatively small areas mainly along the rivers and in the lowlands for all policy scenarios we simulated an increase in residential areas and forest regrowth for the year 2056 and a decrease of agricultural area including dry cash crop plantations and rice paddies table 7 fig 4 regardless of environmental policy residential areas will continuously grow until 2056 by about 25 while fallow bare soil and grassland areas will decrease by more than 50 although forest regrowth was simulated for all scenarios its magnitude is clearly controlled by the implemented policy the current trend scenario without intervention no will result in only 0 9 increase while the combined reforestation and protection scenario r p will achieve 2 7 forest regrowth by 2056 forest protection pro shows a much higher efficiency in forest regeneration than the reforestation program ref simulated forest regeneration will occur at the expense of cropland where primarily dry crops show distinct policy effects between only 5 decrease for no and up to 43 for the r p policy rice paddies will lose relatively similar areas under all scenarios between 19 no and 23 r p although the magnitudes of lucc follow a common trajectory towards forest regrowth and cropland contraction under all policy scenarios the spatial distribution reveals more distinct patterns for individual sub regions we found that the currently agriculturally dominated headwater catchments i e the mandae stream and jawoon stream watersheds will show the most pronounced differences between the policies figs 5 and 6 in contrast to simulated lucc in the entire watershed dry non paddy fields in these production hotspots will steadily increase by 18 through expansion of existing farms into neighboring forest and grassland areas if no policy interventions interrupt the current lucc trend no scenario this is especially the case for agricultural areas with high elevations of about 900 m in the jawoon stream watershed fig 6b under these circumstances no forest regeneration will occur and existing natural vegetation may be further degraded on the contrary if reforestation programs are implemented ref scenario dry fields in mandae and jawoon will decrease by 13 until 2056 in combination with strict protection of existing forests r p scenario dry field contractions would increase to 31 while forests will experience up to 10 regeneration forest protection alone pro scenario shows only little effects on cropland areas dry fields will be reduced by only 3 and rice paddies show almost the same pattern as under the no scenario fig 5 however rice paddy areas will decrease under all policy scenarios which is consistent with the results for the whole watershed 3 3 impact of conservation policies on changes in es the simulated lucc did not translate into a considerable change in fresh water provision between 2006 and 2056 regardless of the policy implemented while proxies for regulating es most notably sediment yields show clear differences between scenarios figs 7 and 8 while the median simulated annual water yield of the soyang reservoir fig 7a remains stable at 1988 1989 mm3 yr 1 between 2006 and 2056 across all scenarios median sediment inflow decreases by between 8 no to 48 r p from currently 1104 kt yr 1 these changes correspond to between 0 3 no and 2 0 r p t ha 1 yr 1 of prevented soil erosion in the upstream area of the soyang reservoir fig 8a median total n inflow decreases by between 3 no to 21 r p from currently 2013 t yr 1 and total p inflow shows a slight increase of 1 for no but reductions for the other scenarios of up to 30 under r p from currently 418 t yr 1 the lower n and p inflows are equivalent to 0 03 no to 0 27 r p mg l 1 of nutrient both n and p removal per volume of water throughout the watershed fig 8a median annual discharge of the mandae stream fig 7b and jawoon stream watersheds fig 7c also remain stable while sediment total n and p consistently increase for no and decrease for the three conservation scenarios median sediment outflow of mandae under the no scenario increases by 9 while conservation policies yield reductions of up to 31 under r p the sediment reduction for r p corresponds to 9 7 t ha 1 yr 1 of prevented erosion while the no scenario leads to losses in erosion prevention of 2 9 t ha 1 yr 1 of additional soil loss i e dis service fig 8b total n and p exports increase by 5 and 8 under no respectively which is equivalent to a dis service of 0 5 mg l 1 of additional water pollution fig 8b on the contrary r p reduce total n and p up to 17 and 19 respectively which corresponds to 1 6 mg l 1 of water treatment fig 8b similarly to mandae jawoon experiences increases of 11 6 and 12 without intervention no and reductions of up to 53 44 and 51 under stringent conservation r p for sediment n and p respectively correspondingly the no scenario results in losses of erosion prevention 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 and waste water treatment 0 13 mg l 1 while conservation policies particularly r p prevent erosion 6 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and water pollution 0 78 mg l 1 fig 8c in addition to no ref and pro also show clearly distinct patterns for the agricultural hotspots compared to the entire watershed while sediment and nutrient loads under pro are consistently lower for the total soyang reservoir inflow ref tends to be more efficient for es restoration in the mandae and jawoon stream watersheds the combined policy r p however shows the greatest regulating effects for both hotspots as well as for the whole watershed although the median simulations indicate clear improvements in regulation es for all three conservation scenarios ref pro r p the uncertainty ranges depicted with the 95ppu in fig 7 show large variabilities in sediment and nutrient loads between values close to zero to up to multiples of the medians however fig 7 also illustrates that absolute uncertainty ranges decrease for the conservation policies indicated by a reduction of the upper boundary of the 95ppu band most notably for sediment as well as n and p loads of the jawoon stream watershed fig 7c among the two agricultural hotspots the mandae stream watershed shows consistently higher sediment and nutrient loads than the jawoon stream watershed although it generates only a fraction of the water yield under the bl and no scenarios average annual concentrations of sediment total n and total p in the mandae stream exceed those of jawoon by more than five times and those of the soyang reservoir inflow by between seven total n and ten times sediment and total p monthly sediment and nutrient concentrations show even greater differences between the two watersheds fig 9 during peak events maximum sediment total n and p concentrations indicated by the upper boundary of the 95ppu in the mandae stream can exceed more than ten times those of jawoon fig 9 demonstrates that conservation policies especially combined reforestation and protection r p will reduce sediment and nutrient concentrations remarkably for jawoon compared to no intervention no while values for the mandae stream remain relatively high median concentrations for r p will decrease to less than half of the values for no for the summer monsoon period but also for months of lower precipitation fig 9b it should be noted that pollutant concentrations contrary to the total loads often reach their peaks already during moderate rain events in the early growing season after fertilization and when vegetation cover is still low in addition to the reductions in median concentrations the probability of the occurrence of extreme erosion and water pollution will be substantially lower for jawoon while the differences between no and r p for mandae will be only moderate thus the relative contribution of the mandae stream watershed to the total sediment and nutrient loads of the soyang reservoir will increase although conservation policies generate greater absolute erosion prevention and water treatment services for mandae fig 8b and c they tend to be more efficient for jawoon with regards to overall soil protection and water quality improvement 4 discussion 4 1 efficiency of conservation policies to restore es we found a number of lucc developments that would occur independently of environmental conservation policies namely the continuous decrease of fallow area bare soil and grassland and the steady growth of residential areas in the watershed regardless of the policy instrument the size of residential areas will continuously increase until 2056 while the total population size is stagnating in downstream areas contrary to upstream agricultural areas this development commonly known as urban sprawl have been fostered through rural development initiatives since 2001 by the korean government jeon et al 2013 also rice paddies will continuously decrease and show only relatively small responses to the type of conservation policy because rice cultivation has been traditionally performed primarily on suitable soils in the lowlands and on relatively gentle slopes most paddy areas do not fall under the target area of the conservation policies environmental conservation policies affect primarily dry non paddy fields and forest areas which is not surprising as these are located to a large degree mainly on steep hillslopes at high elevations that match the proposed conservation goals and standards all conservation policies ref pro and r p will result in an increase of forest cover and a contraction of existing dry field areas as a consequence we found that all policies show a clear tendency to enhance future regulating es erosion prevention and waste water treatment in the watershed while conserving fresh water provisioning without considerable trade offs the stable water provision under all policies is not surprising as the total magnitude of forest regrowth even under r p will be too small to considerably alter the watershed s water balance through changes in evapotranspiration in addition the simulated urbanization did not cause any considerable shifts in the reservoir s inflow hydrograph or water balance components however we primarily found strong increases in erosion prevention and water quality regulation only when forest protection was in place pro and r p while reforestation alone ref results in only moderate improvements although ref will cause forest regeneration on sloping land and at forest frontiers due to economic incentives to farmers for instance in agriculturally dominated catchments i e mandae and jawoon cropland loss will be compensated by clearing and conversion of fallow and grassland or other marginal forest areas elsewhere in the watershed thus these leakage effects can only be avoided if reforestation programs are accompanied by stringent protection regulations as simulated for r p in addition we found that the efficiency of the conservation policies is strongly site specific and varies with spatial scale while we simulated a consistent moderate decline of agricultural areas and a forest regrowth for all scenarios including no across the entire watershed our results reveal a strong divergence between the scenarios for the two headwater catchments mandae and jawoon under the development trend without policy intervention no these production hotspots would further lose their erosion prevention and water purification capacities regulating dis services while we identified a high restoration potential of es for the conservation policies in particular for reforestation combined with strict protection r p although prediction uncertainties for the es proxies are relatively high we could show that the likelihood of extreme conditions that would lead to the strongest losses in es i e the upper boundary of the 95ppu will markedly decrease under conservation policies however our results also demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed policy programs is limited and may not necessarily meet the intended goals the mandae stream watershed which is the largest contributor of water quality degradation for the soyang reservoir shows only moderate improvements although erosion prevention and waste water treatment services would be restored the relative impact will still be low compared to the jawoon stream watershed where substantial water quality improvements were simulated the main reason for the low efficiency for mandae is given by the currently limited financial resources available and lower famers participation in the reforestation program which allows only 50 ha per year to be reconverted better targeted and site specific allocation of the available funds for instance through pes programs e g engel et al 2008 which concentrate reforestation incentives particularly in degraded headwater catchments could improve the environmental performance of the conservation policies 4 2 strengths and limitations of the modeling procedure the presented modeling procedure attempts to give insight into the range of consequences of alternative future environmental policies for a set of provisioning and regulating es in the soyang reservoir watershed the validation exercises demonstrate that both model components ca and swat can realistically mirror the observed lucc patterns and water quality changes in the watershed the modeling procedure successfully captures the major drivers and spatial distribution of lucc in headwater catchments and their role for water provisioning and regulation of downstream areas our findings confirm observations of previous studies that indicate the mandae stream watershed as the main contributor of agricultural pollution within the soyang reservoir watershed e g maharjan et al 2016 park et al 2010 we could show that our modeling procedure was able to account for a variety of impacts that can result from environmental policy programs including unintended effects such as leakage it can be used to predict and evaluate performance and efficiency of proposed conservation programs and thus guide decision making processes consequently the quantification of model uncertainty here given by the 95ppu bands abbaspour et al 2007 is essential in particular for decision making our results demonstrate that output uncertainties can be large due to the variability of input parameters and error propagation but provide valuable estimates of the expected ranges of impacts however the presented modeling procedure involves a number of limitations and simplifications lucc simulation was based primarily on historical lucc trajectories and their major driving factors but future lc and management decisions might be driven by more recent socio economic developments in the watershed one of these developments is the replacement of traditional crops by perennials such as fruit orchards and more importantly large scale ginseng cultivations by companies from outside of the watershed jun and kang 2010 seo et al 2014 motivations and drivers of this trend could only be insufficiently captured by our model but may play an important role in shaping the future lc of the watershed moreover besides assumptions of the ca model these different crop types require management practices and scheduling e g fertilization irrigation planting and harvesting that may be entirely different from those assumed in the presented swat setup in addition the diversity of crops in the headwater catchments such as mandae is usually higher lee et al 2016 seo et al 2014 than the assumed rice and cabbage representatives the classification of the presented lc types dry fields in particular must be further refined to account for the variability of cropping systems from monocultures to more complex multiple crop portfolios lee et al 2016 fluctuating crop prices and the elimination of protection policies for domestic rice growers lee et al 2016 will become important driving factors that shape future lucc changing climate will additionally affect crop choice and management decisions but also growth patterns and yields ko et al 2014 and thus the overall future provisioning of es in the watershed in addition to these simplifications the utilized models show a number of weaknesses that may affect the quality of outputs most notably the spatial representation of the hrus in swat as hrus represent only percentages of a subbasin area without any spatial reference swat is not able to simulate transport processes on the land phase between different landscape elements neitsch et al 2011 rathjens et al 2015 moreover hrus are lumped landscape units that can combine even distant areas as long as they have the same lc and soil characteristics rathjens et al 2015 as water quality of the channel is significantly controlled by transport processes over the landscape including sediment deposition and nutrient retention before substances enter the stream future work must address this limitation swat bieger et al 2016 for instance takes into account the spatial connection of hrus when computing transport from the land phase to the channel and would improve the quality and reliability of the model outputs in particular for the presented water quality indicators besides weaknesses in the quality of the models another major limitation of the presented work is that it covers only one provisioning i e fresh water and two regulating services i e erosion prevention and waste water treatment teeb 2012 which are primarily related to water quality of the soyang reservoir however as the watershed is one of the key production areas in the gangwon province future assessments must integrate the role of food provisioning which may reveal a more pronounced trade off with regulating es as in most human dominated landscapes e g maes et al 2012 nelson et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that integrated modeling that combines the dynamics of lucc with biophysical processes within a watershed can successfully predict a variety of impacts that may result from political decisions and allows evaluating the efficiency of conservation instruments the presented modeling approach is based on existing and already implemented policy instruments i e reforestation programs and forest protection uses comprehensive datasets from field studies and quantifies a set of es indicators together with their associated uncertainties although our model procedure in its current form does not describe an environmental decision support system dss mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 it provides a valuable basis for the development of a site specific dss that can be used to guide environmental policies and water management in south korea however the presented modeling approach requires additional improvements and refinements in order to increase the quality of the modeling system volk et al 2010 first model quality particularly the limitations of swat can be improved through the utilization of swat bieger et al 2016 to better represent transport processes and to enhance water quality assessment second data quality can be improved through greater detail of input variables in particular with respect to crop choice and management diversity lee et al 2016 third the modeling procedure should be complemented with additional es indicators most importantly food provisioning to account for a wider range of potential synergies and trade offs that could arise from different policy options nelson et al 2009 nevertheless our modeling procedure has already revealed a number of limitations and weaknesses of the existing environmental policies in the watershed the presented policy scenarios focus primarily on forest protection and recovery in order to restore water regulating es in the watershed however especially the role of cash crop cultivation as the main income source for local residents but also for the region s economy requires stronger consideration as a large proportion of those cash crops in south korea is harvested in the mandae stream watershed jun and kang 2010 cultivation restrictions or their replacement through stringent top down regulations may lead to socio economic problems and increase the resistance of farmers environmental policies should therefore propose a larger catalogue of measures besides reforestation and protection including technical approaches for on farm erosion prevention or nutrient retention further research is required to assess alternative policy options for this region to achieve both environmental and social sustainability for instance through farmers participation future work should also address the effects that locally designed policy programs may cause outside their target areas lucc in one watershed can induce a number of impacts such as market and crop price changes that may trigger lucc in other regions also referred to as telecoupling liu et al 2015 thus the real dimensions of the social ecological consequences of environmental policies can only be assessed if one looks beyond the watershed s boundary and takes into account the full range of lucc drivers acknowledgements this study

foundation krf at the kangwon national university chuncheon south korea 
26133,integrated model systems that simulate land use and land cover change lucc and associated changes of ecosystem services es are increasingly important for supporting policies and management decisions however only few model frameworks exist that consider policy options as drivers of future lucc and es simultaneously we present a modeling procedure that predicts policy induced lucc and es

payments and command and control regulations in mountain watersheds of south korea our approach successfully captures spatial patterns of lucc hydrological processes and the associated gains and

upstream headwater catchments ma 2005 teeb 2012 land use and cover change lucc however have altered the capacity of these natural water towers to regulate the hydrologic cycle and to control downstream water quantity and quality allen 2004 bhaduri et al 2000 deforestation and clearance of natural vegetation through agricultural expansion have increased the supply of provisioning es such as food fiber and bioenergy power 2010 zhang et al 2007 but have led to dramatic environmental degradation through losses of major regulating es maes et al 2012 schröter et al 2005 particularly in mountains lucc causes severe soil erosion and water quality degradation through sediments in combination with excessive nutrient exports due to high fertilizer use foley et al 2005 montgomery 2007 because the provision of es is increasingly considered in policy making daily and matson 2008 environmental policies and management programs must therefore take into account the various potential outcomes involved in land use decisions and require a priori balancing of multiple region specific es indicators kremen 2005 viglizzo et al 2012 this requires modeling approaches that integrate both lucc and the associated biophysical processes and impacts on es dynamic lucc models such as cellular automata ca which reflect complex systems of lucc and their spatial and temporal patterns balzter et al 1998 can be coupled with hydrological models to gain insight into the dynamics of lucc due to specific policy programs such as water management plans and their hydrological responses within a landscape deng et al 2015 memarian et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 ca based models are widely used for lucc predictions as they can capture complex emergent behavior using a set of simple transitional rules clarke and hoppen 1997 ca simulates spatio temporal patterns of lucc of grid cells depending on their current status and their interactions with the neighborhood verburg et al 2004 veldkamp and lambin 2001 wu 1996 lucc in an upland catchment does not only impact local es but can have immense consequences for remote water users e g through pollution of downstream drinking water aquifers and reservoirs hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 account for the upstream downstream connectivity within complex watersheds and allow the prediction of lucc impacts on water related es remote from their sources swat is widely used to estimate lucc impacts on water resources arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 and has been coupled with lucc models in different studies e g deng et al 2015 kim et al 2013 marshall and randhir 2008 memarian et al 2014 park et al 2011a zhang et al 2013 2015 2016 zhou et al 2013 these studies assessed the potential hydrological impacts of future lucc deng et al 2015 marshall and randhir 2008 zhou et al 2013 and the combined effects of lucc and climate change kim et al 2013 park et al 2011a zhang et al 2015 2016 however most of these studies use historical trends to predict future lucc and only few consider the role of environmental policies memarian et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 as protection policies and conservation programs are becoming increasingly important as a response to environmental degradation in many regions they constitute a major driver for future lucc different types of policy instruments such as payments for ecosystem services pes e g engel et al 2008 or command and control regulations have shown both positive and negative outcomes and their implementation still raise questions about their efficiency and targeting to achieve the proposed conservation goals engel et al 2008 moreover the impacts of environmental policies can be highly scale dependent and show various impacts for instance at a subbasin level compared to an entire watershed outlet zhou et al 2013 in order to use model outputs to support decision making modeling systems must therefore be sensitive to different management option and policy alternatives and provide insight into the various environmental impacts at different spatial scales mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 we present a modeling procedure that integrates different types of environmental policy instruments and that simulates their consequences on lucc and es through a combination of ca and swat we developed the ca model based on multinomial logistic regression mnl and neighborhood interactions to simulate possible lucc for the next 50 years 2006 2056 under four different types of policy scenarios we combined the output of the ca with swat to simulate the hydrologic responses of the policy induced lucc at the subbasin and watershed scale both the ca and swat model were parameterized by using comprehensive datasets from field studies in order to ensure high data quality and reliability of model outputs mcintosh et al 2011 in addition to previous ca swat modeling frameworks we translated the biophysical output variables of swat into water related es indicators to identify potential synergies and trade offs between provisioning and regulating es and quantified the associated model uncertainties the spatially explicit identification of synergies and trade offs of multiple es by taking account of uncertainties plays a key role for supporting political decisions francesconi et al 2016 volk 2013 although it is beyond the scope of this study to present a new decision support system dss mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 we argue that our modeling procedure can provide an informative and robust basis for the development of a dss that can be used in practice for mountainous watershed where water provisioning and regulation are major concerns of water managers and environmental policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we applied our modeling procedure to the soyang reservoir watershed located in gangwon province in the north eastern mountain range of south korea fig 1 lucc in the watershed through de reforestation agricultural expansion and a steadily growing urbanization has led to severe water quality degradation of the country s largest drinking water reservoir which is the main fresh water provider for half of the population including the seoul metropolitan area kim et al 2000 maharjan et al 2016 therefore several environmental regulation and protection zones have been established such as natural conservation areas around the soyang reservoir and national parks in the seorak and odae mountains fig 1 kim 2006 however to invigorate local economic development and income in the gangwon province highland agriculture especially the production of commercial crops has expanded into mountainous areas due to governmental support lee 1990 water pollution through sediment and nutrient loads originating from agricultural land have been identified as the main source of declining water quality since the 1980s park et al 2010 highland agricultural activities in upstream catchments such as the mandae and jawoon stream watersheds have intensified during the last decades now covering about 54 of the total dry field area fig 1 kim et al 2014a these highland production hotspots are the main contributors of sediment and nutrient loads with substantial impacts on downstream ecosystems and the trophic state of the reservoir park et al 2010 especially for the mandae stream watershed often referred to as haean myeon catchment high erosion rates and nitrogen losses have been reported during heavy rainstorm events during the east asian summer monsoon e g arnhold et al 2013 2014 kettering et al 2012 kim et al 2014b ruidisch et al 2013 after extreme weather events such as typhoon ewiniar in 2006 have caused severe damages through erosion and water supply problems park et al 2011b the korean government implemented a set of comprehensive countermeasure programs including a reforestation program for marginal agricultural lands in 2008 to mitigate water erosion and pollutant exports from highland areas however the long term effects of those programs are difficult to estimate due to the various social economic drivers of lucc thus the ca swat modeling procedure presented here aims at providing insights in the lucc dynamics and the efficiency of different policy scenarios to restore es in the watershed 2 2 conservation policy scenarios among the environmental policy instruments land use zoning is a widely used command and control regulation tool which involves setting zones where lucc is prohibit or promoted le et al 2010 another important instrument aims at providing economic incentives to farmers or other land use actors to change their behavior referred to as payments for environmental services pes engel et al 2008 tomich et al 2004 we assess three possible policy intervention scenarios proposed by the korean government to conserve future es in the watershed a reforestation program through direct payments to farmers ref a forest protection program for high slope areas pro and a combined policy of reforestation and protection r p for a 50 year time period i e from 2006 to 2056 with 10 year time intervals table 1 we compare simulated lucc results of those scenarios with the current development trend assuming the continuation of past lucc patterns from 1995 to 2006 under no policy intervention scenario no under ref the currently ongoing direct payments to farmers for purchasing marginal agricultural land at elevations above 400 m and slopes higher than 15 for reforestation are continued jun and kang 2010 randomly assigned 500 ha per 10 year time interval this policy program has reconverted agricultural areas of up to 50 ha every year due to limited financial resources and farmers participation although pes are efficient tools to conserve es compared to other policy instruments engel et al 2008 they can result in externalities by private actors behaviors jack et al 2008 to complement and or modify this pes policy we also consider command and control regulation as an alternative option forest conversion for land utilization is restricted in steep slope areas higher than 25 currently kim 2015 but the government considers strengthening the pro policy therefore we consider tightened policy that pro restricts marginal forest areas from conversion to agriculture on slopes higher than 15 which have been identified as areas most vulnerable to soil erosion it is a direct regulation policy for forest areas to prevent agricultural conversion and human interventions which can show more efficient results over a long term miteva et al 2012 the r p scenario combines reforestation payments with strict enforcement of forest protection which complement both pes and regulation policies 2 3 modeling lucc with ca ca models simulate the spatial interactions of various lucc processes white and engelen 2000 and endogenous changes of status and numbers of cells for each time step based on cellular dynamics verburg et al 2004 ca models are based on transitional rules that change the state of cells based on the spatial characteristics of the current cells and their interactions with the neighborhood wu 1996 to develop the ca model we applied mnl because it can estimate spatial features of lucc and quantitative coefficients between lucc and their driving factors wu 2002 bishop 2006 liao et al 2016 transition rules in the ca are calculated as transitional probabilities of changing a cell s land cover lc type in the mnl process we calculated the transitional probability of a cell from lc type i to lc type j at time step t as follows feng et al 2011 liao et al 2016 white and engelen 1993 wu 2002 1 s i j t 1 s i j t ω i j t c o n n in the transition function ʃ states of cell ij for the next time period with t 1 s i j t 1 are determined by the states of cell ij during a specific time t s i j t neighborhood function of cell ω i j t lucc constraint factors con and cells number n feng et al 2011 we developed our ca model using the netlogo software ver 5 3 1 fig 2 shows the structure of the ca model and table 2 lists the input parameters used to calculate the transition probabilities we applied 90 by 90 m resolution uniformly for all spatial data to match their resolution with output lc maps lc states of each cell based on local transitional probabilities are calculated from results of a mnl between 1995 and 2007 kim et al 2014a for neighborhood functions we calculated neighborhood enrichment factors proposed by verburg et al 2004 with the neighborhood extent having the strongest neighborhood effect as kim et al 2014a calculated the factors for major lc types urban forest agriculture we adopted the neighborhood extent with the highest enrichment values as neighborhood boundaries spatial ranges of local interactions between neighboring cells are set by these enrichment factors and values are calculated based on white and engelen 2000 we use the circular neighborhood size to calculate neighborhood factors within their radius boundary which is adopted in many ca based lucc models e g barredo et al 2003 chen et al 2002 he et al 2008 li and yeh 2000 mao et al 2013 white and engelen 1993 because the circular neighborhood considers all neighborhood directions equally it can perform neighborhood effects effectively li and yeh 2000 and appropriately reflect clustered lucc chen et al 2002 therefore we applied circular neighborhood interactions since lucc in the watershed have dominantly occurred in riverside and highland agricultural areas kim et al 2014a the neighborhood conversion probability of a cell from interactions with neighboring cells is calculated by the proportion of the sum of specific lc k cells to the total number of cells within the circular neighborhood range r which is adapted from rectangular neighborhood probability functions defined by feng et al 2011 and liu et al 2008 we defined eight lc classes for the watershed forest dry non paddy fields rice paddies grassland residential areas wetland bare soil and water fig 1 however transition was only allowed for six lc classes water bodies and wetland areas are fixed in the model and were not allowed to be converted residential areas are set as constraint areas because urbanization is a common pattern in suburban areas of south korea and reconversion to forest or agriculture is very unlikely to occur when residential areas have been abandoned in isolated rural regions they remained as residential covers because they are inefficient in land uses to other purposes hwang et al 2007 once cells are converted to residential areas they cannot be converted to other lc types anymore constraint factors are also set for forest areas designated as conservation or reforestation areas in these areas lc transition processes are stopped and they maintain their lc type after they are converted by policy effects the model is calibrated and validated to generate optimal simulation results under current parameters and probability functions the calibration of the model was performed by adjusting model parameters and transitional change rules torrens 2011 to reflect urban expansion and remaining large scale farm and forest areas we keep current urban areas and clustered forest and agricultural areas as fixed areas white and engelen 2000 validation of the ca model is conducted by assessing the performance of the output of models quantitatively by assessing location accuracy which estimates the similarity and difference between model outputs and the actual status al ahmadi et al 2013 van vliet et al 2016 to validate the ca model with the location accuracy method we used the three map comparison method which quantifies the model s accuracy in simulating persistence and changes in pixel state pontius et al 2008 this method allows comparisons between the actual map as reference 1 and simulation maps as reference 2 by calculating agreement levels from correctly simulated persistence and changes as well as disagreement levels from errors in persistence and changes pontius and millones 2011 the output quality of lucc simulation models should be carefully assessed before adopting models to real world conditions because of the complex phenomena of lucc processes and the associated high uncertainty van vliet et al 2016 as an additional measure of model performance we calculated the figure of merit which compares observed and simulated changes to estimate the ratio of their intersections pontius et al 2008 once model validation has been performed we simulated four different future lucc trajectories from 2006 to 2056 with 10 year time intervals representing the four policy scenarios no ref pro and r p based on the lc configuration of the year 2006 2 4 modeling changes in es with swat once lucc for the policy scenarios was quantified and its spatial distribution estimated with the ca model the simulated lc maps were used as inputs to the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 to evaluate the restoration potential of water related es swat is a process based simulation model developed to simulate the impact of land use and management on water sediment and agricultural chemicals gassman et al 2007 although swat was not explicitly designed as an es tool it has been demonstrated in several studies that it is suitable to quantify a range of es indicators and to identify potential synergies and trade offs e g duku et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 lautenbach et al 2013 volk 2013 francesconi et al 2016 provide a comprehensive overview of studies that have used swat to assess es and discuss capabilities and limitations of the model with respect to the es concept swat provides a range of output variables that can be directly related to a number of provisioning and regulating es francesconi et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 we computed four biophysical indicators as proxies for fresh water provisioning erosion prevention and waste water treatment services qiu and turner 2013 teeb 2012 water yield sediment yield total nitrogen n and total phosphorus p see below in addition to its capability to quantify multiple es indicators swat was selected because it accounts for the spatial distribution of es production and beneficiary units through the hydrologic connectivity between upstream and downstream areas fisher et al 2009 vigerstol and aukema 2011 a watershed in swat is partitioned into multiple subbasins which are further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that comprise a combination of unique lc soil and management conditions neitsch et al 2011 which means that all areas with the same combination of lc soil and management within each subbasin are lumped together to form an hru rathjens et al 2015 swat first computes the land phase processes including hydrology erosion nutrient cycling and plant growth at the hru level and calculates for each subbasin the amount of water sediment and nutrients transported to the channel neitsch et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 it should be noted that hrus within a subbasin have no spatial representation and all water sediment and nutrients are directly transported into the channel without considering the transport processes on the land phase rathjens et al 2015 only in the routing phase the downstream transport of water sediment and nutrients through the channel network is computed from subbasin to subbasin to the watershed outlet taking into account instream changes and transformation processes neitsch et al 2011 we used the arcswat 2012 interface with swat 2012 rev 622 to set up and parameterize the model for the soyang reservoir watershed using the input datasets listed in table 3 we divided the watershed into 45 subbasins using a drainage threshold value of 3400 ha this threshold resulted in an average subbasin area of approximately 2 of the entire watershed area which was considered adequate for the simulation of sediment n and p arabi et al 2006 jha et al 2004 jha et al 2004 found that further subdivision and smaller subbasin areas below the 2 threshold do not significantly improve the model performance anymore the dam of the soyang reservoir and a monitoring station near the outflow of the dam were added for later model calibration and validation fig 1 to represent the hydrologic conditions of the reservoir we used the following parameter values provided by the korea water resources corporation k water we set the surface area to 65 9 km2 and 61 8 km2 and the water volume to 2900 106 m3 and 2550 106 m3 for the emergency and principal spillway respectively initial water volume at the beginning of the simulation was set to 1483 106 m3 and for reservoir outflow we used observed daily release records after parameterization of the subbasins and the reservoir we further subdivided the watershed into 3270 hrus by overlaying the soil with the lc map of the year 2006 bl scenario without further partitioning into slope classes the full number of hrus was used without threshold definitions and refinements to account for the entire landscape heterogeneity of the watershed once hrus were defined we applied the following management modifications for the different lc types we removed the harvest and kill operation i e default management operation that stops growth of all plants in an hru and removes biomass as yield at the end of the growing season for forest wetland grassland residential and barren land and replaced it with a harvest only operation i e management operation that removes biomass only and allows plants to continue growing for grassland and residential areas for dry non paddy agriculture and rice paddies we created new operation schedules to reflect the typical local agricultural management practices table 4 we selected cabbage as a representative crop for dry agriculture because it covers the largest area of dry fields in the gangwon province after soybean lee et al 2016 in contrast to soybean cabbage with its short growing period and high fertilization requirements reflects also other locally important cash crops such as radish type number and timing of operations listed in table 4 were adopted from shope et al 2014 and maharjan et al 2016 who compiled local management information for different crop types from various sources including interviews field observations published literature and governmental reports fertilizer n and p application rates were calculated from total n fertilizer inputs for local crops reported by kettering et al 2012 and typical n to p ratios of commonly used fertilizers identified from interviews with local farmers berger et al 2013a b kettering et al 2013 to accurately reflect biomass development and crop yields we adjusted the number of heat units to maturity the radiation use efficiency and the harvest index for cabbage and rice biomass and yields were obtained from plot experiments conducted in the study area described by arnhold et al 2014 kettering et al 2012 and lindner et al 2014 observed average aboveground biomass and yields were 8 0 t ha 1 and 5 6 t ha 1 for cabbage and 17 1 t ha 1 and 8 1 t ha 1 for rice arnhold et al 2014 kettering et al 2012 to approximate these values we applied 1200 and 1800 heat units to maturity 34 kg ha 1 mj m 2 and 65 kg ha 1 mj m 2 radiation use efficiency and harvest indices of 0 7 and 0 5 for cabbage and rice respectively another modification made for cabbage was the adjustment of the initial universal soil loss equation usle cover management c factor which was set to 0 13 based on the work of arnhold et al 2014 who studied local vegetation characteristics of cash crops and their impacts on soil erosion for rice we additionally changed the initial scs curve number to 78 and the usle support practice p factor to 0 1 to account for the terrace structure of paddy fields jung et al 2004 kim et al 2008 after setup and parameter adjustments we ran swat for five years from january 2003 to december 2007 with a two year warm up period using daily recorded climate data of 19 precipitation and 6 climate stations located within and surrounding the soyang reservoir watershed fig 1 we performed semi automated model calibration and validation following the procedure given by arnold et al 2012 for this we used the sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 abbaspour et al 2007 optimization algorithm implemented in the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup ver 5 1 6 2 abbaspour 2014 we divided our three year period of interest without warm up into a calibration january 2005 to december 2006 and a validation january to december 2007 period and performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters with respect to discharge sediment total n and p the preselection of the input parameters was based on literature reviews and previous swat exercises in the study area arnold et al 2012 maharjan et al 2016 shope et al 2014 after sensitive parameters had been identified we calibrated the model using recorded daily discharge into the soyang reservoir and measured sediment total n and p at the stream monitoring station near the reservoir outflow fig 1 we performed 500 model simulations for the calibration period 2005 2006 using initial uncertainty estimates for 32 selected input parameters table 5 within these initially defined ranges the sufi 2 optimization algorithm performed latin hypercube sampling and identified the best parameter combinations for a given objective function between observed and simulated datasets abbaspour et al 2007 2015 although it is recommended to use multiple types of performance measures to evaluate model accuracy bennett et al 2013 haas et al 2016 sufi 2 allows only one objective function we used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function as it is the most widely used performance indicator for hydrological models arnold et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 schuol et al 2008 however we simultaneously kept track of two other objective functions the percent bias pbias and the root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 in order to ensure that also those were within acceptable ranges during the calibration process the initial parameters were then iteratively updated to produce narrower uncertainty ranges centered on the best simulation until no further improvements could be achieved abbaspour et al 2007 2015 schuol et al 2008 table 5 lists the 32 parameters that were adjusted during the sufi 2 calibration procedure with their initial and final uncertainty ranges after the optimum parameter ranges had been identified for the calibration period we ran the model again 500 times for the validation period 2007 using the same ranges to evaluate the model performance for both calibration and validation periods we calculated the p factor and r factor for each of the output variables discharge sediment total n and p the p factor describes the percentage of observed data bracketed by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu band and the r factor indicates the average thickness of the 95ppu abbaspour et al 2007 2015 arnold et al 2012 schuol et al 2008 once calibration and validation for the 2006 lc configuration bl had been performed we set up four swat models for the soyang reservoir watershed representing the potential future lc for the four environmental policy scenarios no ref pro and r p for each of the four models we replaced the lc map of the year 2006 with those simulated by the ca model for the year 2056 the hru definition was performed in the same way as for the baseline scenario by overlaying lc and soil maps see description above thus the future lc changes simulated with the ca model caused slightly different numbers of hrus compared to the baseline but resulted primarily in different percentages of the area covered within each subbasin all other input parameters including subbasin and reservoir configuration management schedules and plant parameter modifications were assumed to be identical to the bl scenario and were adopted accordingly see description above the four future models were run with the swat cup sufi 2 algorithm each with 500 simulations using the final input parameter ranges obtained during the calibration procedure for the bl scenario as listed in table 5 for each of the scenarios we computed water yield sediment yield total n and p expressed with their medians and 95ppu bands that were transported into the soyang reservoir as well as the exports from the two agricultural hotspot watersheds mandae and jawoon finally the four output variables were used to estimate es that describe the watershed s capacity to supply fresh water erosion prevention and waste water treatment teeb 2012 a positive change in water yield for 2056 compared to 2006 represents an increase in fresh water provisioning while a negative change indicates a decline negative changes in sediment yield normalized by the upstream contributing area indicate prevented erosion per unit area negative changes of n and p expressed as concentrations represent waste water treatment per volume of water conversely positive changes in sediment n and p can be interpreted as continued soil and water quality degradation or regulating dis services leh et al 2013 3 results 3 1 model validation and performance after lucc driving factors were calibrated from results of mnl as statistical analysis and by the threshold of changes as conditional transitional rules the ca model was validated using a three map comparison method to quantify model outputs for different lc types table 6 results for forest simulation had the highest accuracy values in the ca model in calibration processes while agricultural lands have lower values the ca model simulates rice paddies as persistent areas in contrast to other lc types while their change areas are less correctly simulated dry field areas have higher accuracy in the agreement of pixels due to higher accuracy in change areas although persistent areas are less correctly estimated when accuracy of change prediction is estimated as figure of merit dry fields have higher values with higher prediction accuracy than other lc types while rice paddies have lower prediction accuracy of change areas overall the figure of merit shows values acceptable to other ca models as estimated by pontius et al 2008 although we simulated various lucc processes the swat model shows an overall satisfactory performance as indicated by the p factor r factor and nse values for the different output variables fig 3 the p factor observed data bracketed by the 95ppu should ideally have a value close to 1 indicating that all observed data are captured by the uncertainty range and the r factor thickness of the 95ppu should be near 0 indicating that the simulated data coincide with the observed abbaspour et al 2007 2015 arnold et al 2012 schuol et al 2008 in practice a p factor of 0 7 or greater and r factor of 1 5 or smaller are considered as satisfactory abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 the nse goodness of fit between observed values and best simulation indicates satisfactory model performance when it exceeds a value of 0 5 and very good performance for values greater than 0 75 arnold et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 for both the calibration and the validation period the p factors and r factors in fig 3 indicate reasonable performance for almost all variables except sediment and p where r factors exceed the threshold for validation also the nse indicates satisfactory to very good model performance for both periods and all variables except for sediment validation we attribute the large r factor and low nse mainly to exceptionally high sediment and nutrients records due to typhoon ewiniar hitting the korean peninsula in 2006 arnhold et al 2014 park et al 2011b the high peaks in the summer of 2006 limited the narrowing of the parameter ranges during calibration and resulted in wide uncertainty bands relative to the observed data for the validation period 2007 fig 3 3 2 impact of conservation policies on lucc because of the highly mountainous topography and limited accessibility of a large proportion of the watershed lucc is concentrated primarily in relatively small areas mainly along the rivers and in the lowlands for all policy scenarios we simulated an increase in residential areas and forest regrowth for the year 2056 and a decrease of agricultural area including dry cash crop plantations and rice paddies table 7 fig 4 regardless of environmental policy residential areas will continuously grow until 2056 by about 25 while fallow bare soil and grassland areas will decrease by more than 50 although forest regrowth was simulated for all scenarios its magnitude is clearly controlled by the implemented policy the current trend scenario without intervention no will result in only 0 9 increase while the combined reforestation and protection scenario r p will achieve 2 7 forest regrowth by 2056 forest protection pro shows a much higher efficiency in forest regeneration than the reforestation program ref simulated forest regeneration will occur at the expense of cropland where primarily dry crops show distinct policy effects between only 5 decrease for no and up to 43 for the r p policy rice paddies will lose relatively similar areas under all scenarios between 19 no and 23 r p although the magnitudes of lucc follow a common trajectory towards forest regrowth and cropland contraction under all policy scenarios the spatial distribution reveals more distinct patterns for individual sub regions we found that the currently agriculturally dominated headwater catchments i e the mandae stream and jawoon stream watersheds will show the most pronounced differences between the policies figs 5 and 6 in contrast to simulated lucc in the entire watershed dry non paddy fields in these production hotspots will steadily increase by 18 through expansion of existing farms into neighboring forest and grassland areas if no policy interventions interrupt the current lucc trend no scenario this is especially the case for agricultural areas with high elevations of about 900 m in the jawoon stream watershed fig 6b under these circumstances no forest regeneration will occur and existing natural vegetation may be further degraded on the contrary if reforestation programs are implemented ref scenario dry fields in mandae and jawoon will decrease by 13 until 2056 in combination with strict protection of existing forests r p scenario dry field contractions would increase to 31 while forests will experience up to 10 regeneration forest protection alone pro scenario shows only little effects on cropland areas dry fields will be reduced by only 3 and rice paddies show almost the same pattern as under the no scenario fig 5 however rice paddy areas will decrease under all policy scenarios which is consistent with the results for the whole watershed 3 3 impact of conservation policies on changes in es the simulated lucc did not translate into a considerable change in fresh water provision between 2006 and 2056 regardless of the policy implemented while proxies for regulating es most notably sediment yields show clear differences between scenarios figs 7 and 8 while the median simulated annual water yield of the soyang reservoir fig 7a remains stable at 1988 1989 mm3 yr 1 between 2006 and 2056 across all scenarios median sediment inflow decreases by between 8 no to 48 r p from currently 1104 kt yr 1 these changes correspond to between 0 3 no and 2 0 r p t ha 1 yr 1 of prevented soil erosion in the upstream area of the soyang reservoir fig 8a median total n inflow decreases by between 3 no to 21 r p from currently 2013 t yr 1 and total p inflow shows a slight increase of 1 for no but reductions for the other scenarios of up to 30 under r p from currently 418 t yr 1 the lower n and p inflows are equivalent to 0 03 no to 0 27 r p mg l 1 of nutrient both n and p removal per volume of water throughout the watershed fig 8a median annual discharge of the mandae stream fig 7b and jawoon stream watersheds fig 7c also remain stable while sediment total n and p consistently increase for no and decrease for the three conservation scenarios median sediment outflow of mandae under the no scenario increases by 9 while conservation policies yield reductions of up to 31 under r p the sediment reduction for r p corresponds to 9 7 t ha 1 yr 1 of prevented erosion while the no scenario leads to losses in erosion prevention of 2 9 t ha 1 yr 1 of additional soil loss i e dis service fig 8b total n and p exports increase by 5 and 8 under no respectively which is equivalent to a dis service of 0 5 mg l 1 of additional water pollution fig 8b on the contrary r p reduce total n and p up to 17 and 19 respectively which corresponds to 1 6 mg l 1 of water treatment fig 8b similarly to mandae jawoon experiences increases of 11 6 and 12 without intervention no and reductions of up to 53 44 and 51 under stringent conservation r p for sediment n and p respectively correspondingly the no scenario results in losses of erosion prevention 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 and waste water treatment 0 13 mg l 1 while conservation policies particularly r p prevent erosion 6 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and water pollution 0 78 mg l 1 fig 8c in addition to no ref and pro also show clearly distinct patterns for the agricultural hotspots compared to the entire watershed while sediment and nutrient loads under pro are consistently lower for the total soyang reservoir inflow ref tends to be more efficient for es restoration in the mandae and jawoon stream watersheds the combined policy r p however shows the greatest regulating effects for both hotspots as well as for the whole watershed although the median simulations indicate clear improvements in regulation es for all three conservation scenarios ref pro r p the uncertainty ranges depicted with the 95ppu in fig 7 show large variabilities in sediment and nutrient loads between values close to zero to up to multiples of the medians however fig 7 also illustrates that absolute uncertainty ranges decrease for the conservation policies indicated by a reduction of the upper boundary of the 95ppu band most notably for sediment as well as n and p loads of the jawoon stream watershed fig 7c among the two agricultural hotspots the mandae stream watershed shows consistently higher sediment and nutrient loads than the jawoon stream watershed although it generates only a fraction of the water yield under the bl and no scenarios average annual concentrations of sediment total n and total p in the mandae stream exceed those of jawoon by more than five times and those of the soyang reservoir inflow by between seven total n and ten times sediment and total p monthly sediment and nutrient concentrations show even greater differences between the two watersheds fig 9 during peak events maximum sediment total n and p concentrations indicated by the upper boundary of the 95ppu in the mandae stream can exceed more than ten times those of jawoon fig 9 demonstrates that conservation policies especially combined reforestation and protection r p will reduce sediment and nutrient concentrations remarkably for jawoon compared to no intervention no while values for the mandae stream remain relatively high median concentrations for r p will decrease to less than half of the values for no for the summer monsoon period but also for months of lower precipitation fig 9b it should be noted that pollutant concentrations contrary to the total loads often reach their peaks already during moderate rain events in the early growing season after fertilization and when vegetation cover is still low in addition to the reductions in median concentrations the probability of the occurrence of extreme erosion and water pollution will be substantially lower for jawoon while the differences between no and r p for mandae will be only moderate thus the relative contribution of the mandae stream watershed to the total sediment and nutrient loads of the soyang reservoir will increase although conservation policies generate greater absolute erosion prevention and water treatment services for mandae fig 8b and c they tend to be more efficient for jawoon with regards to overall soil protection and water quality improvement 4 discussion 4 1 efficiency of conservation policies to restore es we found a number of lucc developments that would occur independently of environmental conservation policies namely the continuous decrease of fallow area bare soil and grassland and the steady growth of residential areas in the watershed regardless of the policy instrument the size of residential areas will continuously increase until 2056 while the total population size is stagnating in downstream areas contrary to upstream agricultural areas this development commonly known as urban sprawl have been fostered through rural development initiatives since 2001 by the korean government jeon et al 2013 also rice paddies will continuously decrease and show only relatively small responses to the type of conservation policy because rice cultivation has been traditionally performed primarily on suitable soils in the lowlands and on relatively gentle slopes most paddy areas do not fall under the target area of the conservation policies environmental conservation policies affect primarily dry non paddy fields and forest areas which is not surprising as these are located to a large degree mainly on steep hillslopes at high elevations that match the proposed conservation goals and standards all conservation policies ref pro and r p will result in an increase of forest cover and a contraction of existing dry field areas as a consequence we found that all policies show a clear tendency to enhance future regulating es erosion prevention and waste water treatment in the watershed while conserving fresh water provisioning without considerable trade offs the stable water provision under all policies is not surprising as the total magnitude of forest regrowth even under r p will be too small to considerably alter the watershed s water balance through changes in evapotranspiration in addition the simulated urbanization did not cause any considerable shifts in the reservoir s inflow hydrograph or water balance components however we primarily found strong increases in erosion prevention and water quality regulation only when forest protection was in place pro and r p while reforestation alone ref results in only moderate improvements although ref will cause forest regeneration on sloping land and at forest frontiers due to economic incentives to farmers for instance in agriculturally dominated catchments i e mandae and jawoon cropland loss will be compensated by clearing and conversion of fallow and grassland or other marginal forest areas elsewhere in the watershed thus these leakage effects can only be avoided if reforestation programs are accompanied by stringent protection regulations as simulated for r p in addition we found that the efficiency of the conservation policies is strongly site specific and varies with spatial scale while we simulated a consistent moderate decline of agricultural areas and a forest regrowth for all scenarios including no across the entire watershed our results reveal a strong divergence between the scenarios for the two headwater catchments mandae and jawoon under the development trend without policy intervention no these production hotspots would further lose their erosion prevention and water purification capacities regulating dis services while we identified a high restoration potential of es for the conservation policies in particular for reforestation combined with strict protection r p although prediction uncertainties for the es proxies are relatively high we could show that the likelihood of extreme conditions that would lead to the strongest losses in es i e the upper boundary of the 95ppu will markedly decrease under conservation policies however our results also demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed policy programs is limited and may not necessarily meet the intended goals the mandae stream watershed which is the largest contributor of water quality degradation for the soyang reservoir shows only moderate improvements although erosion prevention and waste water treatment services would be restored the relative impact will still be low compared to the jawoon stream watershed where substantial water quality improvements were simulated the main reason for the low efficiency for mandae is given by the currently limited financial resources available and lower famers participation in the reforestation program which allows only 50 ha per year to be reconverted better targeted and site specific allocation of the available funds for instance through pes programs e g engel et al 2008 which concentrate reforestation incentives particularly in degraded headwater catchments could improve the environmental performance of the conservation policies 4 2 strengths and limitations of the modeling procedure the presented modeling procedure attempts to give insight into the range of consequences of alternative future environmental policies for a set of provisioning and regulating es in the soyang reservoir watershed the validation exercises demonstrate that both model components ca and swat can realistically mirror the observed lucc patterns and water quality changes in the watershed the modeling procedure successfully captures the major drivers and spatial distribution of lucc in headwater catchments and their role for water provisioning and regulation of downstream areas our findings confirm observations of previous studies that indicate the mandae stream watershed as the main contributor of agricultural pollution within the soyang reservoir watershed e g maharjan et al 2016 park et al 2010 we could show that our modeling procedure was able to account for a variety of impacts that can result from environmental policy programs including unintended effects such as leakage it can be used to predict and evaluate performance and efficiency of proposed conservation programs and thus guide decision making processes consequently the quantification of model uncertainty here given by the 95ppu bands abbaspour et al 2007 is essential in particular for decision making our results demonstrate that output uncertainties can be large due to the variability of input parameters and error propagation but provide valuable estimates of the expected ranges of impacts however the presented modeling procedure involves a number of limitations and simplifications lucc simulation was based primarily on historical lucc trajectories and their major driving factors but future lc and management decisions might be driven by more recent socio economic developments in the watershed one of these developments is the replacement of traditional crops by perennials such as fruit orchards and more importantly large scale ginseng cultivations by companies from outside of the watershed jun and kang 2010 seo et al 2014 motivations and drivers of this trend could only be insufficiently captured by our model but may play an important role in shaping the future lc of the watershed moreover besides assumptions of the ca model these different crop types require management practices and scheduling e g fertilization irrigation planting and harvesting that may be entirely different from those assumed in the presented swat setup in addition the diversity of crops in the headwater catchments such as mandae is usually higher lee et al 2016 seo et al 2014 than the assumed rice and cabbage representatives the classification of the presented lc types dry fields in particular must be further refined to account for the variability of cropping systems from monocultures to more complex multiple crop portfolios lee et al 2016 fluctuating crop prices and the elimination of protection policies for domestic rice growers lee et al 2016 will become important driving factors that shape future lucc changing climate will additionally affect crop choice and management decisions but also growth patterns and yields ko et al 2014 and thus the overall future provisioning of es in the watershed in addition to these simplifications the utilized models show a number of weaknesses that may affect the quality of outputs most notably the spatial representation of the hrus in swat as hrus represent only percentages of a subbasin area without any spatial reference swat is not able to simulate transport processes on the land phase between different landscape elements neitsch et al 2011 rathjens et al 2015 moreover hrus are lumped landscape units that can combine even distant areas as long as they have the same lc and soil characteristics rathjens et al 2015 as water quality of the channel is significantly controlled by transport processes over the landscape including sediment deposition and nutrient retention before substances enter the stream future work must address this limitation swat bieger et al 2016 for instance takes into account the spatial connection of hrus when computing transport from the land phase to the channel and would improve the quality and reliability of the model outputs in particular for the presented water quality indicators besides weaknesses in the quality of the models another major limitation of the presented work is that it covers only one provisioning i e fresh water and two regulating services i e erosion prevention and waste water treatment teeb 2012 which are primarily related to water quality of the soyang reservoir however as the watershed is one of the key production areas in the gangwon province future assessments must integrate the role of food provisioning which may reveal a more pronounced trade off with regulating es as in most human dominated landscapes e g maes et al 2012 nelson et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that integrated modeling that combines the dynamics of lucc with biophysical processes within a watershed can successfully predict a variety of impacts that may result from political decisions and allows evaluating the efficiency of conservation instruments the presented modeling approach is based on existing and already implemented policy instruments i e reforestation programs and forest protection uses comprehensive datasets from field studies and quantifies a set of es indicators together with their associated uncertainties although our model procedure in its current form does not describe an environmental decision support system dss mcintosh et al 2011 volk et al 2010 it provides a valuable basis for the development of a site specific dss that can be used to guide environmental policies and water management in south korea however the presented modeling approach requires additional improvements and refinements in order to increase the quality of the modeling system volk et al 2010 first model quality particularly the limitations of swat can be improved through the utilization of swat bieger et al 2016 to better represent transport processes and to enhance water quality assessment second data quality can be improved through greater detail of input variables in particular with respect to crop choice and management diversity lee et al 2016 third the modeling procedure should be complemented with additional es indicators most importantly food provisioning to account for a wider range of potential synergies and trade offs that could arise from different policy options nelson et al 2009 nevertheless our modeling procedure has already revealed a number of limitations and weaknesses of the existing environmental policies in the watershed the presented policy scenarios focus primarily on forest protection and recovery in order to restore water regulating es in the watershed however especially the role of cash crop cultivation as the main income source for local residents but also for the region s economy requires stronger consideration as a large proportion of those cash crops in south korea is harvested in the mandae stream watershed jun and kang 2010 cultivation restrictions or their replacement through stringent top down regulations may lead to socio economic problems and increase the resistance of farmers environmental policies should therefore propose a larger catalogue of measures besides reforestation and protection including technical approaches for on farm erosion prevention or nutrient retention further research is required to assess alternative policy options for this region to achieve both environmental and social sustainability for instance through farmers participation future work should also address the effects that locally designed policy programs may cause outside their target areas lucc in one watershed can induce a number of impacts such as market and crop price changes that may trigger lucc in other regions also referred to as telecoupling liu et al 2015 thus the real dimensions of the social ecological consequences of environmental policies can only be assessed if one looks beyond the watershed s boundary and takes into account the full range of lucc drivers acknowledgements this study

26134,predicting flood risk is important for climate change adaptation we quantify fluvial flood risk due to changing climate in a mixed use watershed in michigan usa we apply two approaches to project future climate change an ensemble of temperature and precipitation perturbations on the historical record and an ensemble of global and regional climate models we incorporate climate projections into the soil and water assessment tool swat to estimate daily streamflow then quantify flood risk using indices related to flood probability duration magnitude and frequency results indicate rising temperatures may counteract small increases in precipitation likely due to increased evapotranspiration climate model data without bias correction used in swat produced reasonable future streamflow changes similar to the perturbation of historical climate therefore retaining the predicted change in the flood frequency distribution this work advances the application of climate models in swat for flood risk evaluation at watershed scales keywords flood risk climate change swat model software availability the swat program and source code is freely available for download at this website http swat tamu edu matlab and r scripts we used to calculate flood indices and result datasets can be freely downloaded at this github repository https github com yuchenw flood index 1 introduction flooding is one of society s most devastating natural hazards and predicting potential flood risk is an important element of climate change adaptation adger et al 2005 naess et al 2005 wilby et al 2008 statistical analysis of the global historical flooding record shows a trend towards greater flooding over the course of the twentieth century milly et al 2002 and modeling at the global scale suggests a warmer climate carries a greater risk of flooding to continue in the future hirabayashi et al 2013 previous studies have evaluated future flood risk by analyzing climate change trends from the historical climate record milly et al 2002 wilby et al 2008 or used global climate models to assess large scale future risk hirabayashi et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 however global trends can mask the spatial variability of land use and climate change at smaller scales relevant for adaptation adger et al 2005 garner et al 2015 and routing future climate data through watershed scale models can fill this gap towards quantifying flood risk at local to regional scales the soil and water assessment tool swat is one such watershed scale model developed to study watershed hydrology and nutrient cycling in response to agricultural management scenarios land use change and climate arnold et al 1998 and is commonly and increasingly used to estimate the hydrologic influences of climate change however there is no scientific consensus on the most appropriate method to incorporate future climate data to drive watershed models previous studies have applied several methods of integrating future climate information into swat 1 generate climate input as a simple increment of temperature and percentage change of precipitation either by adjusting climate model output fan and shibata 2015 or by adjusting observed station data liu et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015 which avoids the bias in climate models but may not account for changes in climate regime predicted by climate models such as the potential change in frequency intensity and seasonality of precipitation 2 use regional climate models rcm or downscaled general circulation models gcm as the input bouraoui et al 2002 abbaspour et al 2009 deb et al 2015 kharel and kirilenko 2015 which preserves all features of the modeled climate dynamics but is also subject to bias 3 apply statistical transformation on climate model output to correct some bias in distribution of precipitation and or temperature salathe et al 2014 el khoury et al 2015 goldstein and tarhule 2015 carvalho santos et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 which is a compromise between the simple increment method assuming no distribution change and the climate model method assuming distribution change is not biased while bias correction is a common approach to deal with climate model biases for historical conditions the use of this technique may create difficulties when evaluating future climate specifically present day biases may change in the future such that the statistical correction may no longer be applicable it is also important to consider an ensemble of various models since the uncertainty of climate models has been found to be larger than the uncertainty of hydrologic simulation in some cases prudhomme et al 2003 the first goal of this project is to test and provide guidance on the use of future climate data for prediction of streamflow in swat the second goal of this work is to assess multiple indicators of flood risk under future climate using swat modeled streamflow outputs approaches currently used with watershed models to estimate flooding either describe temporal patterns including magnitude of flooding or identify spatial patterns and trends a common approach to describe the temporal pattern of flooding is to calculate the exceedance probability which is the probability of flow rate exceeding a given threshold for instance cheng et al 2013 defined the flood hazard index as the recurrence probability during the entire study period when daily flow rate exceeds the bankfull discharge a more holistic approach to flow management would consider flood characteristics such as flood duration frequency and magnitude postel and richter 2012 researchers focused on ecosystem services and functions have suggested that incorporating multiple indicators may be important for properly assessing flooding regimes richter et al 1996 logsdon and chaubey 2013 logsdon and chaubey 2013 proposed the flood regulation index to quantify flood regulation ecosystem services by combining flood duration frequency and magnitude into one index in this study we separated the components of flood regulation index and flood hazard index to assess flood hazard on four aspects i e recurrence probability frequency duration and magnitude the overall purpose of this study was to evaluate fluvial flooding under future climate change in a mixed use watershed to provide guidance for modelers and managers to test the approach we used multiple methods to estimate future climate change and to assess flood risk we applied a watershed model of the huron river watershed in michigan usa built with swat to estimate daily streamflow drove the model with climate data from both statistically generated climate scenarios and physically based climate models and evaluated four indices to quantify separate aspects of flood risk 2 methods 2 1 study area the huron river is located in southeast michigan and drains to lake erie s western basin its drainage area is 2380 km2 and contains nearly 600 km of stream channel mdnr 2002 among all major rivers draining to lake erie s western basin the huron river is unique in many aspects a large proportion of the watershed falls in the detroit metropolitan area and it contains most of the city of ann arbor therefore over 30 of the watershed is urbanized fig 1 the river has over 100 dams on its main stem and tributaries and numerous artificial and natural lakes cover more than 4 of the watershed the percentage of streamflow coming from baseflow referred to as baseflow index is higher in the huron river watershed 74 bosch et al 2011 than other nearby watersheds draining to western lake erie 10 30 usgs 2003 while it is challenging to build a watershed model for this highly populated watershed with complex hydrology bosch et al 2011 there is a need to evaluate flood risk under future climate among stakeholders in the area extreme rainfall events and flooding in the midwest and around the great lakes region have intensified in the past several decades and these trends are likely to continue pryor et al 2014 nevertheless despite most climate models projecting increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events changes in precipitation and temperature differ seasonally and geographically over the great lakes region bartolai et al 2015 it is thus timely to assess flood risk specifically for this area given the large number of people that could be exposed to future flooding 2 2 study design this study fig 2 builds upon previous work conducted by cheng et al 2013 2017 and was initiated as a portion of the study overviewed in cheng 2016 in this work we go beyond the single flood hazard index in cheng 2016 and assess sensitivity of the watershed model driven by alternative estimates of climate change a swat model was developed and calibrated for the huron river watershed based on daily flow data from 2001 to 2005 then model performance was verified from 1981 to 2010 after calibration and verification we applied two approaches to simulate future climate the first approach was a climate sensitivity analysis that applied step wise temperature and precipitation perturbations to historical station data the second approach used output from an ensemble of global and regional climate models for both approaches we incorporated temperature and precipitation data in swat to simulate daily flow data for each sub basin four flood indices flood exceedance probability flood duration flood frequency and flood magnitude were calculated based on simulated streamflow at every sub basin outlet finally we compared the flood indices of future and historical scenarios to assess future flood risk 2 3 swat model calibration and verification the swat model was set up in arcswat 2012 swat revision 635 for arcgis 10 1 using a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem downloaded from http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the national land cover

flowlines from the national hydrography dataset nhd medium resolution dataset were burned into the dem before stream definition the watershed was divided into 57 sub basins and 1890 hrus using a stream threshold of 4000 ha and including all huc12 outlets as well as usgs flow gages as additional sub basin outlets the average size of a sub basin was 41 8 km2 and using hru definition thresholds of 0 for land use 10 for soils and a single slope the average size of an hru was 1 26 km2 cropland hrus were divided into two rotations of corn soybean and wheat based on the most common rotations determined by overlaying the cropland data layer cdl from 2007 to 2012 si a for six reservoirs on the main stem of the huron river where dam operation information was available from stakeholder surveys dam operations were simulated by maintaining designated reservoir storage volumes parameter starg target storage volume in res files in winter months november to april si b other impoundments were simulated as uncontrolled reservoirs intersecting the stream channel or ponds not intersecting the stream channel si b a swat parameter sensitivity test was run in swat cup to choose the parameters to which streamflow is most sensitive parameters for manual calibration a detailed list of parameters adjusted in calibration and example input files can be found in table s1 considering distinct hydrologic properties of agricultural land compared to forested and urban lands we adjusted three parameters most sensitive to surface runoff in agricultural hrus separately from other land uses initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 maximum canopy storage canmx and surface runoff lag coefficient surlag hru the model was run with swat2012 revision 635 daily streamflow records from usgs flow gage sites 04174500 huron river at ann arbor mi and 04173500 mill creek near dexter mi were used for calibration 2001 2005 and verification 1981 2010 gage 04174500 is the flow gage closest to the basin s outlet draining 80 of the watershed gage 04173500 is close to the outlet of the agriculturally dominated sub watershed draining to mill creek due to availability of flow gage data streamflow at the mill creek gage was only verified from 1995 to 2010 for calibration and verification the correlation coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr statistics were calculated for streamflow at daily and monthly timescales moriasi et al 2007 bennett et al 2013 in addition to quantitative measures of model fit we sought to visually match the flow duration curves of observed and simulated streamflow as the distribution of high flow events is essential in predicting flood risk 2 4 climate sensitivity test and climate model test for climate sensitivity analysis we generated an ensemble of potential climate data from the historical station record 1981 2010 using a bootstrapping method similar to steinschneider and brown 2013 given permutations of a temperature increase of 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 c and precipitation changes of 0 10 and 20 a total of 30 scenarios five precipitation changes multiplied by six temperature changes were generated to produce 55 year time series of daily temperature and precipitation data flood indices were calculated on 51 years of data because the first three years were used to spin up the swat model and use of the water year for data summaries eliminated an additional year from the dataset the scenario with no temperature or precipitation change compared to historical record was used as the baseline condition for comparison within the climate sensitivity datasets climate sensitivity analyses have been widely used around the world including the great lakes region moody and brown 2013 midwestern us steinschneider et al 2015 and south asia yang et al 2016 for uncertainty assessments of climate change impact the set of possible future temperature and precipitation conditions allows us to determine which factors at what range of values affect environmental outcomes pianosi et al 2016 the 30 scenarios were used to drive the huron river swat model to produce daily streamflow time series for the climate model approach an ensemble of climate models including one global cesm1 cam5 two regional crcm cgcm3 rcm3 gfdl and two dynamically downscaled regional rcm4 gfdl rcm4 hadgem climate models were selected for the business as usual emissions scenarios rcp 8 5 or a2 based on their general performance in the region basile et al 2017 table 1 for each model we selected historical 1983 1999 and future 2044 2060 conditions for comparison the five climate models predict that the huron river watershed would see an increase of 1 69 3 32 c in annual average temperature and annual precipitation change of 3 to 12 by the mid 21st century 2044 2060 compared to the historical period 1983 1999 in both future climate approaches we changed only temperature and precipitation inputs and allowed the swat model to automatically generate the other three weather inputs solar radiation relative humidity and windspeed as we had during the historical calibration and verification periods we also did not alter the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in future climate scenarios because it is not a common practice among swat climate modeling studies and a recent study that did change carbon dioxide concentrations in the current swat outlined some of its limitations culbertson et al 2016 2 5 flood indices to quantify flood risk we calculated four indices based on simulated daily flow rate at each sub basin outlet in the swat model specific equations are presented in table 2 a 2 year flood threshold was used in all indices because it has been used as a proxy to bankfull discharge and threshold for flood events in past studies cheng et al 2013 for the two different future climate approaches we calculated 2 year flood values based on the present climate simulation the baseline scenario in the sensitivity test or the historical climate output of each climate model the flow exceedance probability index which is similar to the flood hazard index in cheng et al 2013 is defined as the probability of daily flows above the 2 year flood calculated as the fraction of days with simulated flow above or equal to the 2 year flood in a given water year october september then averaged across the simulation period expressed as a percentage the other three indices were modified from the flood regulation index designed by logsdon and chaubey 2013 which combines duration magnitude and frequency patterns of floods based on daily flow records in this study to further interpret the flood pattern of these individual components we used flood duration flood magnitude and flood frequency separately based on simulated daily flow of each sub basin from the swat model for these indices we defined a flood event as one or more consecutive days when the daily flow rate exceeds a 2 year flood flood duration is defined as the number of consecutive days of flooding in a flood event we averaged the flood duration for all flood events in a water year then calculated the average for all years to derive the flood duration index the flood magnitude index is an indicator of the relative magnitude of flood events compared to the 2 year flood we calculated the average amount of discharge per day for each flood event we then calculated the average discharge of flood events in a water year after that we calculated the average for all years to derive the flood magnitude index the final average is further divided by the 2 year flood for each sub basin to standardize across sub basins with large and small drainage areas finally the flood frequency index is defined as the average number of flood events in a water year across the observation period for the climate sensitivity test we compared the flood indices for each of the 29 climate change scenarios to the 51 year baseline condition for each model in the climate model ensemble we compared the flood indices under future conditions 2044 2060 to the historical conditions 1983 1999 we present findings as a percentage change in flood indices between future and historical conditions to assess if the flood risk of each sub basin increases or decreases under future climate 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model calibration and verification given the difficulty in calibrating to multiple gaging stations and the hydrologic complexity of this mixed use watershed including dozens of impoundments this swat model adequately simulated daily flow rate using observed precipitation and temperature time series as input table 3 and can thus be applied to study climate change induced flood risk change in the huron river watershed daily and monthly flow rate at both gages had satisfactory calibration moriasi et al 2007 and the simulated flow duration curve for both gages matched the observations well figs s1 s4 calibration at two outlets with different dominant land uses demonstrates how spatial heterogeneity in land use interacts with hydrology and further affects flood risk distribution in this watershed generally the swat model showed slight under prediction of flow rate in agricultural lands and slight over prediction from other land uses in calibration the small bias in swat modeled flow rate is insignificant in predicting flood risk change because present and future climate scenario simulations are subject to the same model bias 3 2 flood risk under the baseline condition the spatial distribution of all four flood indices for the baseline case t 0 c p 0 agrees across much of the watershed and generally shows greater flood risk in the northern headwaters of the huron river fig 3 the relatively high flood indices in northern headwaters may be explained by the fact that this area coincides with urbanized lands in this watershed fig 1 urbanized lands are likely to expand the area of impervious surface paul and meyer 2001 which reduces infiltration and increases surface runoff dunne and leopold 1978 many studies have shown that urbanization may alter the stream hydrology leading to increase in flood magnitude white and greer 2006 or frequency moscrip and montgomery 1997 garner et al 2015 the spatial distribution of flood risk under baseline conditions confirms that the swat model captured the impact of urbanized land on stream discharge and the urbanized headwaters of the huron river could be a focus area for flood mitigation despite the overall agreement among the flood indices not all four indices show consistent levels of risk for each sub basin some sub basins had high values in only one or two flood indices but low values for others fig 3 suggesting that these indices are capturing unique components of flooding in different areas for example a sub basin having an elevated flood frequency and a small flood magnitude may have many small flooding events throughout the year and flood mitigation efforts in this sub basin should be focused differently than in an area with low flood frequency and large flood magnitude where there is a disagreement among the four indices the flood magnitude index was often the most distinct from the others pearson correlation analysis on flood indices of all sub basins shows that under baseline conditions flood exceedance probability was positively correlated with flood duration and flood frequency but not correlated with flood magnitude fig s5 correlations between the four indices were all positive in the 30 scenarios from the climate sensitivity test but the correlation between flood exceedance probability and flood magnitude was the lowest fig s6 this is unsurprising given that the equation for flood magnitude index table 2 is indeed different from the others and it is the only index considering the total amount of flow above the 2 year return interval flood duration and magnitude are more related to exceedance probability but sometimes these three indices show different patterns when viewed together these indices paint a more nuanced and complete picture of flood risk and managers may find them more helpful for prioritizing mitigation efforts than relying on a single index 3 3 future flood risk under climate sensitivity testing the climate sensitivity test reveals overall flood risk under different scenarios and areas sensitive to climate change watershed level flood risk for each index was summarized by averaging that index weighted by sub basin area figs s7 s10 as expected all four indices exhibited the highest area weighted average when precipitation increased by 20 with no increase in temperature scenario t 0 c p 20 and all indices increased by over 100 in contrast all four indices were the lowest when precipitation decreased by 20 with a temperature increase of 5 c scenario t 5 c p 20 with many index values near zero there was a gradual change in flood indices between the scenario t 0 c p 20 and the scenario t 5 c p 20 figs s7 s10 generally speaking more precipitation tended to perpetuate flood risk while warmer temperature tended to reduce flood risk additionally this demonstrates the need to evaluate flood risk with respect to both temperature and precipitation change spatial heterogeneity of flood risk change was seen at the sub basin level based on different land use and hydrologic properties figs s11 s14 when precipitation decreased by 10 or 20 flood indices of all sub basins were lower than the baseline scenario however when precipitation increased by 10 or 20 not all sub basins saw flood index increases from the baseline warmer temperatures caused a decrease in water yield which counteracted the increase in precipitation therefore in the sub basins more sensitive to temperature change flood indices were lower compared to the baseline scenario despite precipitation increases for flood exceedance probability and flood duration the headwater area exhibited considerable change when precipitation increased indicating that headwaters were more sensitive to higher precipitation in terms of these two components of flood risk however for flood magnitude and flood frequency the level of change seems to be consistent across the watershed suggesting that precipitation and temperature change have a more consistent impact on flood magnitude and frequency these findings again illustrate the value of applying multiple flood indices to assess flood risk since the response of each individual flood components can be different under the same precipitation and temperature condition the climate sensitivity scenarios showed that when precipitation increased by 0 10 and temperature increased 2 3 c not all sub basins exhibited a consistent direction of change compared to the baseline scenario figs s11 s14 suggesting flooding within the basin is sensitive to the interacting effects of temperature and precipitation as well as land use at the scale of the entire basin this balance suggests a threshold around a 10 increase in precipitation figs s7 s10 above this threshold greater precipitation leads to greater flood risk while below it rising temperature may counteract the influence of increased precipitation 3 4 future flood risk under climate model predictions most of our climate swat model results predicted reduced flood risk in the future tables s2 s5 the five climate models projected precipitation increases of 0 10 and temperature increases of 2 3 c table 1 considering the 10 precipitation increase threshold we identified in the climate sensitivity test it is not surprising that most future flood indices decreased flood exceedance probability and flood duration decreased over the entire watershed with four out of the five climate models rcm4 hadgem was the exception figs 4 and 5 fig s15 the other two flood indices show less certainty about the direction of change flood magnitude differed among the climate models rcm3 gfdl and rcm4 gfdl showed a decrease of 22 between future and historical condition whereas cesm1 cam5 showed a slight increase of 9 and both crcm cgcm3 and rcm4 hadgem showed an increase of 46 fig 6 table s4 fig s15 flood frequency increased for two of the five models among these models rcm4 hadgem showed the largest increase almost 100 fig 7 table s5 and fig s15 spatial patterns of flood indices and their magnitudes of change are similar between the two approaches for projecting future climate in most cases swat results driven by the five climate models align with results driven by scenarios from the sensitivity tests with the closest temperature and precipitation change figs 4 7 however there are also notable exceptions where results using the climate model were considerably different from its closest sensitivity test scenario e g flood exceedance probability from crcm cgcm3 and its closest sensitivity test t 3 c p 10 fig 4 results using climate models also generally showed greater reduction of flood duration than sensitivity test scenarios flood magnitude was more variable in comparison between climate models and sensitivity tests with rcm3 gfdl producing the greatest increase despite a relatively small change in annual precipitation finally there was a marked difference in the spatial patterns of flood frequency among climate models and sensitivity tests with some of the greatest decrease predicted by crcm cgcm3 despite a relatively large increase in precipitation some of the differences in flood risk under climate model simulations may have resulted from different distribution patterns of temperature and precipitation in the models figs s16 s17 for example when comparing future and historical conditions rcm4 hadgem displays the greatest precipitation increase in the spring springtime is generally the beginning of the flooding season in the huron river fig s18 so these precipitation increases may be expected to influence flooding more than precipitation increases occurring at other times of the year differences among climate model scenarios highlight the value of incorporating multiple climate model predictions in swat analyses while climate models produce different future seasonal or spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation statistically generated climate sensitivity tests do not using climate models more likely captures key changes in spatiotemporal patterns of temperature and precipitation using multiple climate models is also valuable because it is not clear which models produce the most accurate futures or where model bias is influencing results while we were not able to tease apart the impact of bias in the climate models the fact that the sensitivity tests produced similar percentage changes and spatial patterns of flood risk suggests that even though the climate models used were not bias corrected they resulted in a similar frequency distribution of streamflow in the hydrologic model there was substantial agreement between sensitivity test scenarios and climate models suggesting that a precipitation increase above 10 will likely increase flood risk sharply for all four flood indices below this 10 precipitation increase temperature rise can balance the precipitation effect this threshold may provide important insight for managers in the huron river watershed in assessing and managing future flood risk 4 conclusions we compared the effects of two approaches to simulating climate change on the swat model using four indices for estimating flood risk across the watershed our findings contribute to the following broader lessons we used four flood indices to identify spatial patterns of flood risk within the watershed and while each flood index produced unique results that paint a more comprehensive picture of flood risk than using one index alone we found that the four indices showed higher risk in urban areas in the headwaters and lower risk in agricultural areas the swat model produced similar patterns of change in flooding due to temperature and precipitation driven either by climate models or sensitivity analysis while passing climate data with known bias through a watershed model that is sensitive to those biases may produce unreasonable results we found that using unaltered climate model data produced reliable predictions of percent changes in flood risk unlike results from many global and regional studies our results suggest this watershed is likely to experience a reduction in flood risk under a future mid century climate as long as the precipitation increase is less than 10 because increased evapotranspiration induced by higher temperatures will balance that precipitation increase above a 20 increase in precipitation flood risk will most likely escalate while these findings shed light on approaches commonly used for implementing climate change research as well as the relationship between climate change and flood risk there are some aspects to consider and expand upon in the future tying the climate and watershed modeling work to a dem based analysis of inundation area would provide local and regional managers with more detailed analysis of projected changes in water level and areas inundated simulation of climate change in swat is not limited to inputs of temperature and precipitation a modeler can also change swat s simulation of solar radiation humidity and wind speed which could influence soil moisture and runoff additionally there is an option to update atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which would alter plant respiration and water requirements few modelers change these settings and more work in this area is needed to more fully capture the hydrologic changes from a future climate while it is common practice to drive a watershed model with climate model output in larger watersheds it would be preferable to couple watershed and climate models so that landscape processes feed back into the climate model as in goodall et al 2013 finally in this study we did not consider human interaction with and impact on future climate change the future climate trajectory could be different if mitigation efforts were taken and shifting land uses could

26134,predicting flood risk is important for climate change adaptation we quantify fluvial flood risk due to changing climate in a mixed use watershed in michigan usa we apply two approaches to project future climate change an ensemble of temperature and precipitation perturbations on the historical record and an ensemble of global and regional climate models we incorporate climate projections into the soil and water assessment tool swat to estimate daily streamflow then quantify flood risk using indices related to flood probability duration magnitude and frequency results indicate rising temperatures may counteract small increases in precipitation likely due to increased evapotranspiration climate model data without bias correction used in swat produced reasonable future streamflow changes similar to the perturbation of historical climate therefore retaining the predicted change in the flood frequency distribution this work advances the application of climate

introduction flooding is one of society s most devastating natural hazards and predicting potential flood risk is an important element of climate change adaptation adger et al 2005 naess et al 2005 wilby et al 2008 statistical analysis of the global historical flooding record shows a trend towards greater flooding over the course of the twentieth century milly et al 2002 and modeling at the global scale suggests a warmer climate carries a greater risk of flooding to continue in the future hirabayashi et al 2013 previous studies have evaluated future flood risk by analyzing climate change trends from the historical climate record milly et al 2002 wilby et al 2008 or used global climate models to assess large scale future risk hirabayashi et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 however global trends can mask the spatial variability of land use and climate change at smaller scales relevant for adaptation adger et al 2005 garner et al 2015 and routing future climate data through watershed scale models can fill this gap towards quantifying flood risk at local to regional scales the soil and water assessment tool swat is one such watershed scale model developed to study watershed hydrology and nutrient cycling in response to agricultural management scenarios land use change and climate arnold et al 1998 and is commonly and increasingly used to estimate the hydrologic influences of climate change however there is no scientific consensus on the most appropriate method to incorporate future climate data to drive watershed models previous studies have applied several methods of integrating future climate information into swat 1 generate climate input as a simple increment of temperature and percentage change of precipitation either by adjusting climate model output fan and shibata 2015 or by adjusting observed station data liu et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015 which avoids the bias in climate models but may not account for changes in climate regime predicted by climate models such as the potential change in frequency intensity and seasonality of precipitation 2 use regional climate models rcm or downscaled general circulation models gcm as the input bouraoui et al 2002 abbaspour et al 2009 deb et al 2015 kharel and kirilenko 2015 which preserves all features of the modeled climate dynamics but is also subject to bias 3 apply statistical transformation on climate model output to correct some bias in distribution of precipitation and or temperature salathe et al 2014 el khoury et al 2015 goldstein and tarhule 2015 carvalho santos et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 which is a compromise between the simple increment method assuming no distribution change and the climate model method assuming distribution change is not biased while bias correction is a common approach to deal with climate model biases for historical conditions the use of this technique may create difficulties when evaluating future climate specifically present day biases may change in the future such that the statistical correction may no longer be applicable it is also important to consider an ensemble of various models since the uncertainty of climate models has been found to be larger than the uncertainty of hydrologic simulation in some cases prudhomme et al 2003 the first goal of this project is to test and provide guidance on the use of future climate data for prediction of streamflow in swat the second goal of this work is to assess multiple indicators of flood risk under future climate using swat modeled streamflow outputs approaches currently used with watershed models to estimate flooding either describe temporal patterns including magnitude of flooding or identify spatial patterns and trends a common approach to describe the temporal pattern of flooding is to calculate the exceedance probability which is the probability of flow rate exceeding a given threshold for instance cheng et al 2013 defined the flood hazard index as the recurrence probability during the entire study period when daily flow rate exceeds the bankfull discharge a more holistic approach to flow management would consider flood characteristics such as flood duration frequency and magnitude postel and richter 2012 researchers focused on ecosystem services and functions have suggested that incorporating multiple indicators may be important for properly assessing flooding regimes richter et al 1996 logsdon and chaubey 2013 logsdon and chaubey 2013 proposed the flood regulation index to quantify flood regulation ecosystem services by combining flood duration frequency and magnitude into one index in this study we separated the components of flood regulation index and flood hazard index to assess flood hazard on four aspects i e recurrence probability frequency duration and magnitude the overall purpose of this study was to evaluate fluvial flooding under future climate change in a mixed use watershed to provide guidance for modelers and managers to test the approach we used multiple methods to estimate future climate change and to assess flood risk we applied a watershed model of the huron river watershed in michigan usa built with swat to estimate daily streamflow drove the model with climate data from both statistically generated climate scenarios and physically based climate models and evaluated four indices to quantify separate aspects of flood risk 2 methods 2 1 study area the huron river is located in southeast michigan and drains to lake erie s western basin its drainage area is 2380 km2 and contains nearly 600 km of stream channel mdnr 2002 among all major rivers draining to lake erie s western basin the huron river is unique in many aspects a large proportion of the watershed falls in the detroit metropolitan area and it contains most of the city of ann arbor therefore over 30 of the watershed is urbanized fig 1 the river has over 100 dams on its main stem and tributaries and numerous artificial and natural lakes cover more than 4 of the watershed the percentage of streamflow coming from baseflow referred to as baseflow index is higher in the huron river watershed 74 bosch et al 2011 than other nearby watersheds draining to western lake erie 10 30 usgs 2003 while it is challenging to build a watershed model for this highly populated watershed with complex hydrology bosch et al 2011 there is a need to evaluate flood risk under future climate among stakeholders in the area extreme rainfall events and flooding in the midwest and around the great lakes region have intensified in the past several decades and these trends are likely to continue pryor et al 2014 nevertheless despite most climate models projecting increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events changes in precipitation and temperature differ seasonally and geographically over the great lakes region bartolai et al 2015 it is thus timely to assess flood risk specifically for this area given the large number of people that could be exposed to future flooding 2 2 study design this study fig 2 builds upon previous work conducted by cheng et al 2013 2017 and was initiated as a portion of the study overviewed in cheng 2016 in this work we go beyond the single flood hazard index in cheng 2016 and assess sensitivity of the watershed model driven by alternative estimates of climate change a swat model was developed and calibrated for the huron river watershed based on daily flow data from 2001 to 2005 then model performance was verified from 1981 to 2010 after calibration and verification we applied two approaches to simulate future climate the first approach was a climate sensitivity analysis that applied step wise temperature and precipitation perturbations to historical station data the second approach used output from an ensemble of global and regional climate models for both approaches we incorporated temperature and precipitation data in swat to simulate daily flow data for each sub basin four flood indices flood exceedance probability flood duration flood frequency and flood magnitude were calculated based on simulated streamflow at every sub basin outlet finally we compared the flood indices of future and historical scenarios to assess future flood risk 2 3 swat model calibration and verification the swat model was set up in arcswat 2012 swat revision 635 for arcgis 10 1 using a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem downloaded from http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the national land cover

flowlines from the national hydrography dataset nhd medium resolution dataset were burned into the dem before stream definition the watershed was divided into 57 sub basins and 1890 hrus using a stream threshold of 4000 ha and including all huc12 outlets as well as usgs flow gages as additional sub basin outlets the average size of a sub basin was 41 8 km2 and using hru definition thresholds

determined by overlaying the cropland data layer cdl from 2007 to 2012 si a for six reservoirs on the main stem of the huron river where dam operation information was available from stakeholder surveys dam operations were simulated by maintaining designated reservoir storage volumes parameter starg target storage volume in res files in winter months november to april si b other impoundments were simulated as uncontrolled reservoirs intersecting the stream channel or ponds not intersecting the stream channel si b a swat parameter sensitivity test was run in swat cup to choose the parameters to which streamflow is most sensitive parameters for manual calibration a detailed list of parameters adjusted in calibration and example input files can be found in table s1 considering distinct hydrologic properties of agricultural land compared to forested and urban lands we adjusted three parameters most sensitive to surface runoff in agricultural hrus separately from other land

streamflow records from usgs flow gage sites 04174500 huron river at ann arbor mi and 04173500 mill creek near dexter mi were used for calibration 2001 2005 and verification 1981 2010 gage 04174500 is the flow gage closest to the basin s outlet draining 80 of the watershed gage 04173500 is close to the outlet of the agriculturally dominated sub watershed draining to mill creek due to availability of flow gage data streamflow at the mill creek gage was only verified from 1995 to 2010 for calibration and verification the correlation coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr statistics were calculated for streamflow at daily and monthly timescales moriasi et al 2007 bennett et al 2013 in addition to quantitative measures of model fit we sought to visually match the flow duration curves of observed and simulated streamflow as the distribution of high flow events is essential in predicting flood risk 2 4 climate sensitivity test and climate model test for climate sensitivity analysis we generated an ensemble of potential climate data from the historical station record 1981 2010 using a bootstrapping method similar to steinschneider and brown 2013 given permutations of a temperature increase of 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 c and precipitation changes of 0 10 and 20 a total of 30 scenarios five precipitation changes multiplied by six temperature changes were generated to produce 55 year time series of daily temperature and precipitation data flood indices were calculated on 51 years of data because the first three years were used to spin up the swat model and use of the water year for data summaries eliminated an additional year from the dataset the scenario with no temperature or precipitation change compared to historical record was used as the baseline condition for comparison within the climate sensitivity datasets climate sensitivity analyses have been widely used around the world including the great lakes region moody and brown 2013 midwestern us steinschneider et al 2015 and south asia yang et al 2016 for uncertainty assessments of climate change impact the set of possible future temperature and precipitation conditions allows us to determine which factors at what range of values affect environmental outcomes pianosi et al 2016 the 30 scenarios were used to drive the huron river swat model to produce daily streamflow time series for the climate model approach an ensemble of climate models including one global cesm1 cam5 two regional crcm cgcm3 rcm3 gfdl and two dynamically downscaled regional rcm4 gfdl rcm4 hadgem climate models were selected for the business as usual emissions scenarios rcp 8 5 or a2 based on their general performance in the region basile et al 2017 table 1 for each model we selected historical 1983 1999 and future 2044 2060 conditions for comparison the five climate models predict that the huron river watershed would see an increase of 1 69 3 32 c in annual average temperature and annual precipitation change of 3 to 12 by the mid 21st century 2044 2060 compared to the historical period 1983 1999 in both future climate approaches we changed only temperature and precipitation inputs and allowed the swat model to automatically generate the other three weather inputs solar radiation relative humidity and windspeed as we had during the historical calibration and verification periods we also did not alter the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in future climate scenarios because it is not a common practice among swat climate modeling studies and a recent study that did change carbon dioxide concentrations in the current swat outlined some of its limitations culbertson et al 2016 2 5 flood indices to quantify flood risk we calculated four indices based on simulated daily flow rate at each sub basin outlet in the swat model specific equations are presented in table 2 a 2 year flood threshold was used in all indices because it has been used as a proxy to bankfull discharge and threshold for flood events in past studies cheng et al 2013 for the two different future climate approaches we calculated 2 year flood values based on the present climate simulation the baseline scenario in the sensitivity test or the historical climate output of each climate model the flow exceedance probability index which is similar to the flood hazard index in cheng et al 2013 is defined as the probability of daily flows above the 2 year flood calculated as the fraction of days with simulated flow above or equal to the 2 year flood in a given water year october september then averaged across the simulation period expressed as a percentage the other three indices were modified from the flood regulation index designed by logsdon and chaubey 2013 which combines duration magnitude and frequency patterns of floods based on daily flow records in this study to further interpret the flood pattern of these individual components we used flood duration flood magnitude and flood frequency separately based on simulated daily flow of each sub basin from the swat model for these indices we defined a flood event as one or more consecutive days when the daily flow rate exceeds a 2 year flood flood duration is defined as the number of consecutive days of flooding in a flood event we averaged the flood duration for all flood events in a water year then calculated the average for all years to derive the flood duration index the flood magnitude index is an indicator of the relative magnitude of flood events compared to the 2 year flood we calculated the average amount of discharge per day for each flood event we then calculated the average discharge of flood events in a water year after that we calculated the average for all years to derive the flood magnitude index the final average is further divided by the 2 year flood for each sub basin to standardize across sub basins with large and small drainage areas finally the flood frequency index is defined as the average number of flood events in a water year across the observation period for the climate sensitivity test we compared the flood indices for each of the 29 climate change scenarios to the 51 year baseline condition for each model in the climate model ensemble we compared the flood indices under future conditions 2044 2060 to the historical conditions 1983 1999 we present findings as a percentage change in flood indices between future and historical conditions to assess if the flood risk of each sub basin increases or decreases under future climate 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model calibration and verification given the difficulty in calibrating to multiple gaging stations and the hydrologic complexity of this mixed use watershed including dozens of impoundments this swat model adequately simulated daily flow rate using observed precipitation and temperature time series as input table 3 and can thus be applied to study climate change induced flood risk change in the huron river watershed daily and monthly flow rate at both gages had satisfactory calibration moriasi et al 2007 and the simulated flow duration curve for both gages matched the observations well figs s1 s4 calibration at two outlets with different dominant land uses demonstrates how spatial heterogeneity in land use interacts with hydrology and further affects flood risk distribution in this watershed generally the swat model showed slight under prediction of flow rate in agricultural lands and slight over prediction from other land uses in calibration the small bias in swat modeled flow rate is insignificant in predicting flood risk change because present and future climate scenario simulations are subject to the same model bias 3 2 flood risk under the baseline condition the spatial distribution of all four flood indices for the baseline case t 0 c p 0 agrees across much of the watershed and generally shows greater flood risk in the northern headwaters of the huron river fig 3 the relatively high flood indices in northern headwaters may be explained by the fact that this area coincides with urbanized lands in this watershed fig 1 urbanized lands are likely to expand the area of impervious surface paul and meyer 2001 which reduces infiltration and increases surface runoff dunne and leopold 1978 many studies have shown that urbanization may alter the stream hydrology leading to increase in flood magnitude white and greer 2006 or frequency moscrip and montgomery 1997 garner et al 2015 the spatial distribution of flood risk under baseline conditions confirms that the swat model captured the impact of urbanized land on stream discharge and the urbanized headwaters of the huron river could be a focus area for flood mitigation despite the overall agreement among the flood indices not all four indices show consistent levels of risk for each sub basin some sub basins had high values in only one or two flood indices but low values for others fig 3 suggesting that these indices are capturing unique components of flooding in different areas for example a sub basin having an elevated flood frequency and a small flood magnitude may have many small flooding events throughout the year and flood mitigation efforts in this sub basin should be focused differently than in an area with low flood frequency and large flood magnitude where there is a disagreement among the four indices the flood magnitude index was often the most distinct from the others pearson correlation analysis on flood indices of all sub basins shows that under baseline conditions flood exceedance probability was positively correlated with flood duration and flood frequency but not correlated with flood magnitude fig s5 correlations between the four indices were all positive in the 30 scenarios from the climate sensitivity test but the correlation between flood exceedance probability and flood magnitude was the lowest fig s6 this is unsurprising given that the equation for flood magnitude index table 2 is indeed different from the others and it is the only index considering the total amount of flow above the 2 year return interval flood duration and magnitude are more related to exceedance probability but sometimes these three indices show different patterns when viewed together these indices paint a more nuanced and complete picture of flood risk and managers may find them more helpful for prioritizing mitigation efforts than relying on a single index 3 3 future flood risk under climate sensitivity testing the climate sensitivity test reveals overall flood risk under different scenarios and areas sensitive to climate change watershed level flood risk for each index was summarized by averaging that index weighted by sub basin area figs s7 s10 as expected all four indices exhibited the highest area weighted average when precipitation increased by 20 with no increase in temperature scenario t 0 c p 20 and all indices increased by over 100 in contrast all four indices were the lowest when precipitation decreased by 20 with a temperature increase of 5 c scenario t 5 c p 20 with many index values near zero there was a gradual change in flood indices between the scenario t 0 c p 20 and the scenario t 5 c p 20 figs s7 s10 generally speaking more precipitation tended to perpetuate flood risk while warmer temperature tended to reduce flood risk additionally this demonstrates the need to evaluate flood risk with respect to both temperature and precipitation change spatial heterogeneity of flood risk change was seen at the sub basin level based on different land use and hydrologic properties figs s11 s14 when precipitation decreased by 10 or 20 flood indices of all sub basins were lower than the baseline scenario however when precipitation increased by 10 or 20 not all sub basins saw flood index increases from the baseline warmer temperatures caused a decrease in water yield which counteracted the increase in precipitation therefore in the sub basins more sensitive to temperature change flood indices were lower compared to the baseline scenario despite precipitation increases for flood exceedance probability and flood duration the headwater area exhibited considerable change when precipitation increased indicating that headwaters were more sensitive to higher precipitation in terms of these two components of flood risk however for flood magnitude and flood frequency the level of change seems to be consistent across the watershed suggesting that precipitation and temperature change have a more consistent impact on flood magnitude and frequency these findings again illustrate the value of applying multiple flood indices to assess flood risk since the response of each individual flood components can be different under the same precipitation and temperature condition the climate sensitivity scenarios showed that when precipitation increased by 0 10 and temperature increased 2 3 c not all sub basins exhibited a consistent direction of change compared to the baseline scenario figs s11 s14 suggesting flooding within the basin is sensitive to the interacting effects of temperature and precipitation as well as land use at the scale of the entire basin this balance suggests a threshold around a 10 increase in precipitation figs s7 s10 above this threshold greater precipitation leads to greater flood risk while below it rising temperature may counteract the influence of increased precipitation 3 4 future flood risk under climate model predictions most of our climate swat model results predicted reduced flood risk in the future tables s2 s5 the five climate models projected precipitation increases of 0 10 and temperature increases of 2 3 c table 1 considering the 10 precipitation increase threshold we identified in the climate sensitivity test it is not surprising that most future flood indices decreased flood exceedance probability and flood duration decreased over the entire watershed with four out of the five climate models rcm4 hadgem was the exception figs 4 and 5 fig s15 the other two flood indices show less certainty about the direction of change flood magnitude differed among the climate models rcm3 gfdl and rcm4 gfdl showed a decrease of 22 between future and historical condition whereas cesm1 cam5 showed a slight increase of 9 and both crcm cgcm3 and rcm4 hadgem showed an increase of 46 fig 6 table s4 fig s15 flood frequency increased for two of the five models among these models rcm4 hadgem showed the largest increase almost 100 fig 7 table s5 and fig s15 spatial patterns of flood indices and their magnitudes of change are similar between the two approaches for projecting future climate in most cases swat results driven by the five climate models align with results driven by scenarios from the sensitivity tests with the closest temperature and precipitation change figs 4 7 however there are also notable exceptions where results using the climate model were considerably different from its closest sensitivity test scenario e g flood exceedance probability from crcm cgcm3 and its closest sensitivity test t 3 c p 10 fig 4 results using climate models also generally showed greater reduction of flood duration than sensitivity test scenarios flood magnitude was more variable in comparison between climate models and sensitivity tests with rcm3 gfdl producing the greatest increase despite a relatively small change in annual precipitation finally there was a marked difference in the spatial patterns of flood frequency among climate models and sensitivity tests with some of the greatest decrease predicted by crcm cgcm3 despite a relatively large increase in precipitation some of the differences in flood risk under climate model simulations may have resulted from different distribution patterns of temperature and precipitation in the models figs s16 s17 for example when comparing future and historical conditions rcm4 hadgem displays the greatest precipitation increase in the spring springtime is generally the beginning of the flooding season in the huron river fig s18 so these precipitation increases may be expected to influence flooding more than precipitation increases occurring at other times of the year differences among climate model scenarios highlight the value of incorporating multiple climate model predictions in swat analyses while climate models produce different future seasonal or spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation statistically generated climate sensitivity tests do not using climate models more likely captures key changes in spatiotemporal patterns of temperature and precipitation using multiple climate models is also valuable because it is not clear which models produce the most accurate futures or where model bias is influencing results while we were not able to tease apart the impact of bias in the climate models the fact that the sensitivity tests produced similar percentage changes and spatial patterns of flood risk suggests that even though the climate models used were not bias corrected they resulted in a similar frequency distribution of streamflow in the hydrologic model there was substantial agreement between sensitivity test scenarios and climate models suggesting that a precipitation increase above 10 will likely increase flood risk sharply for all four flood indices below this 10 precipitation increase temperature rise can balance the precipitation effect this threshold may provide important insight for managers in the huron river watershed in assessing and managing future flood risk 4 conclusions we compared the effects of two approaches to simulating climate change on the swat model using four indices for estimating flood risk across the watershed our findings contribute to the following broader lessons we used four flood indices to identify spatial patterns of flood risk within the watershed and while each flood index produced unique results that paint a more comprehensive picture of flood risk than using one index alone we found that the four indices showed higher risk in urban areas in the headwaters and lower risk in agricultural areas the swat model produced similar patterns of change in flooding due to temperature and precipitation driven either by climate models or sensitivity analysis while passing climate data with known bias through a watershed model that is sensitive to those biases may produce unreasonable results we found that using unaltered climate model data produced reliable predictions of percent changes in flood risk unlike results from many global and regional studies our results suggest this watershed is likely to experience a reduction in flood risk under a future mid century climate as long as the precipitation increase is less than 10 because increased evapotranspiration induced by higher temperatures will balance that precipitation increase above a 20 increase in precipitation flood risk will most likely escalate while these findings shed light on approaches commonly used for implementing climate change research as well as the relationship between climate change and flood risk there are some aspects to consider and expand upon in the future tying the climate and watershed modeling work to a dem based analysis of inundation area would provide local and regional managers with more detailed analysis of projected changes in water level and areas inundated simulation of climate change in swat is not limited to inputs of temperature and precipitation a modeler can also change swat s simulation of solar radiation humidity and wind speed which could influence soil moisture and runoff additionally there is an option to update atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which would alter plant respiration and water requirements few modelers change these settings and more work in this area is needed to more fully capture the hydrologic changes from a future climate while it is common practice to drive a watershed model with climate model output in larger watersheds it would be preferable to couple watershed and climate models so that landscape processes feed back into the climate model as in goodall et al 2013 finally in this study we did not consider human interaction with and impact on future climate change the future climate trajectory could be different if mitigation efforts were taken and shifting land uses could alter hydrologic regime and flood risk in the watershed flood and drought mitigation efforts and technological advances could further reduce the vulnerability of the community acknowledgements this
