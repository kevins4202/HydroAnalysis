10740,water shortages have led farmers within irrigation districts to resort to groundwater resources in this scenario a decrease in those water losses due to improper operational management within the districts may halt the increasing trend of groundwater overexploitation this study aims to examine the impact of improving operational management in irrigation districts both to provide reliable surface water distribution and to reduce groundwater demands therein to this end a set of operational alternatives were investigated including nonstructural approaches structural modification and automatic control systems the potential amount of the reduction in the groundwater demands can be measured under each of the alternative operations for the delivery of water to farmers the study is conducted on the hydrodynamic model of an irrigation canal affected by 20 70 inflow fluctuations which occur due to water shortages at the head source the results of the operational simulation indicate that appropriate management of the water delivery systems within non structural alternatives can lead to a 2 13 improvement in operational performance indicators in comparison with the structural modification accordingly the application of non structural approaches can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 5 352 and 8 428 million cubic metres mcm from deep tube wells and 2 817 and 2 007 mcm from the semi deep tube wells over the period of one water year however when employing automatic control systems operational services to the users undergo a 15 62 enhancement such that groundwater demand drops by 11 561 and 20 39 mcm per year respectively keywords off farm activities operational management irrigation districts groundwater conservation 1 introduction a low efficiency operation of irrigation water distribution systems iwds can lead to the deficient water supply at the farm level playán and mateos 2006 moreover the inefficient operational management of irrigation canals can lead to uneven distribution of water between the upstream and downstream users that might increase the social conflicts lozano et al 2010 rijsberman 2006 and decrease the marginal economic returns of agricultural activities hashemy shahdany et al 2017 medellín azuara et al 2012 pereira et al 2002 accordingly renovation and modernization of irrigation canals are among the essential needs that provide reliable water distribution for farmers in the semi arid regions of the world lopez gunn et al 2012 playán and mateos 2006 irrigation water use efficiency in irrigation districts of iran similar to many other ones in the middle east and north africa reveals that the average of applied water efficiency i e on farm water management scales is about 51 varies from 24 7 55 7 hassani et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the figures mentioned above were obtained with an assumption of 82 5 irrigation water conveyance and delivery efficiency i e off farm scales however the lower conveyance and distribution efficiencies in similar modern networks of other countries are reported for example the efficiency of contemporary irrigation networks in the mediterranean agricultural regions and that of the contemporary irrigation districts built by the fao in ethiopia are respectively 46 8 serra et al 2016 and 74 agide et al 2016 the comparison shows that the presumed efficiency of 82 5 is far from the reality since reported efficiency indicators i e 46 8 and 74 in the latter examples are based on a set of periodic on site measurements conducted within every irrigation seasons therefore improving the off farm water operational management including water conveyance distribution and delivery to the farmers may provide significant improvements not only in the current manual operational activities but also in overall irrigation water use efficiency abdullaev et al 2009 hashemy et al 2018 lecina et al 2010 a growing number of studies examine different operational alternatives through the canal automation mechanisms including decentralized and centralized controllers in different regions lozano et al 2010 tian et al 2017 on demand agricultural water delivery systems lecina et al 2010 inline water storing within the canals hashemy and van overloop 2013 conjunctive operational management of surface and groundwater resources monem et al 2006 singh 2014 participatory water management at main canals abdullaev et al 2009 and performing economic operation within the irrigation districts hashemy shahdany et al 2017 represent the recent operational strategies which have been introduced in the literature implementing modern irrigation canal systems is not feasible in many regions of the world budget limitations social considerations such as vandalism or robbery of the on site equipment and lack of operators knowledge are undeniable obstacles against these projects hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop et al 2014 in these conditions off line methods including optimization techniques li et al 2007 lianhai et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 and off line control systems fele et al 2014 maestre et al 2014 mehdy hashemy shahdany and roozbahani 2016 van overloop et al 2014 can be employed to improve the current manual operational activities in this regard the application of intelligent systems including data mining approaches to provide optimal scheduling for daily water delivery ticlavilca et al 2013 and utilization of off line control systems to determine regular adjustments of water regulating structures are among the recent attempts within iwds for developing practical operational methods this study focuses on investigating the performance improvement of iwds employing a wide range of operational alternatives on the roodasht irrigation district rid located at the tail end of the zayandeh rud river basin in iran this region of iran is suffering from unreliable supply from the river that resulted in extreme inflow fluctuations in the main canal accordingly to provide better services to users of the district different operational alternatives are assessed in this study the non structural alternatives include daily scheduling water distribution and operation based on two strategies of i delivery in proportion to the inflow fluctuations and ii sequential water delivery it is worth noting that implementing all alternatives need a hydrodynamic simulation model the model simulates hydraulic conditions in the canal operated based on the mentioned alternatives in the structural modification alternative the current off take structures in the rid main canal with the discrete adjusting inherent are replaced by a continuous movable type of structure the automation control systems include the application of a decentralized control system and a centralized controller for automatic regulation of the water level in the main canal poor canal operation in rid has shifted the dependency of the farmers from the unreliable surface water to the groundwater resources although aquifer of the region is announced as one of the critical aquifers in the center of iran hashemy shahdany et al 2018 the number of operated semi deep tube wells have increased from 11 000 to 48 000 and deep tube wells have growth from 1070 to 2050 during the last 15 years the more specific objectives of the study are i developing the calibrated icss hydrodynamic simulation model of the test case ii investigating the effects of employing the non structural and structural modification alternatives on the current operation of the test case iii designing a decentralized proportional integral pi controller and a centralized automatic control system employing model predictive control mpc iv testing the developed non structural structural and control methods under severe operational scenario including inflow fluctuation at the canal head gate v investigating the potential of the proposed alternatives to fulfill water demands through the roodasht main canal and reduce groundwater overexploitation within the district 2 methods and materials 2 1 methodology fig 1 is a flowchart showing the developed simulation model i e hydrodynamic model and operational alternatives a1 a5 in this study and the interactions between them details and information on the mentioned models are provided in the following sections the study was conducted in three general steps 1 developing operational alternatives a1 a5 a1 and a2 consist of the improved manual operation called nonstructural alternatives in this study a3 stands for structural modification alternatives and a4 and a5 are representative of control systems 2 developing a hydrodynamic simulation model of the canal test case to be integrated with the operational alternatives mentioned in the previous step it should be clarified that alternatives a1 a3 were performed by the simulation model however as fig 1 shows performing the alternatives a4 a5 needs two way coupling of the operation model matlab in this study and the simulation model 3 computing the potential decrease in the groundwater demands due to employing alternatives a1 a5 the required data for developing the models in each of the mentioned steps were acquired from the roodasht irrigation district rid in southwest esfahan iran 2 2 study area the roodasht irrigation district rid is located in the zayandeh rud river basin in the central part of iran fig 2 a shows the irrigation canal networks and fig 2 b depicts semi deep and deep tube wells black dots scattered within the district this study focuses on the roodasht north branch rnb main canal with a design discharge capacity of 9 cubic meters per second m3 s 1 at the head source the total irrigated area served by this canal is about 20000 ha the rnb main canal consists of 24 canal reaches that is separated by 26 upstream static head long crest weirs duckbill the canal has a longitudinal slope of 0 0003 a manning coefficient of around 0 017 and side slope 1 5 details about the physical information of canal characteristics and geometry parameters used for operational modeling of the test case are listed in table 1 according to the table the storage area refers to the area located upstream of each check structure influenced by the backwater phenomenon also the delay time is travel time of flow from a check structure located at the upstream of a canal reach to the area influenced by the backwater van overloop et al 2010 rid has been dealing with the severe problem of providing a reliable water delivery among the water holders shahdany et al 2016 estimated at least 45 loss of main canal inflow at the study location due to inferior canal operational management within the main canal assessing the daily operational information of water years 2013 2016 collected during this study reveals that an inflow around 4 1 m3 s 1 is supplied at the head source of the canal to meet the total water demands i e cumulative water rights of the off takes supposed to be fulfilled during the daily operation that are equal to 2 3 m3 s 1 rid is the last irrigation district taking water from the zayande rood river the upstream fluctuations on the river generated by the upstream irrigation districts and the numerous industrial parks directly influence this region accordingly extreme inflow fluctuations happen at the head source of the rnb main canal the water shortage during the recent dry seasons has intensified the mentioned inflow fluctuations for both upstream and downstream water users these have shifted the farmer s tendency to use the tube wells to have a secure water resource for the agriculture proposes fig 3 shows the increase in the number of tube wells during recent years these tube wells are extracting groundwater at the individual farm inside the areas covered by the canal networks 2 3 operational alternatives fig 4 demonstrates the proposed operational alternatives a1 to a5 employed in this study according to this figure the options belong to three broader categories of the non structural structural and automatic methods elaborated in the following sections 2 3 1 non structural alternatives in the manual operation a ditch rider regulates and adjusts the inline structures in a canal including checks and off takes once or twice a day by driving along the canal a check structure regulates the canal water surface when the canal is flowing at partial capacity i e less than design capacity off take structures take water from the canal to feed the laterals and secondary canals in the roodasht irrigation district the current operation of the rnb main canal is carried out based on a predefined water delivery schedule regulations of the off takes from the head gate to the downstream one are then performed to fulfill the specified constant water demands at every off take each of the structures is adjusted based on the specific stage discharge curve annually calibrated and verified by the operating experts to improve the currently manual operation schemes non structure alternatives a1 and a2 were proposed and investigated it is worth noting that the non structural alternatives were assigned based on a set of interviews with ditch riders local operators water board authorities and regional water managers several field visits to the study area and a few surveys from the ongoing operational experiences of other irrigation districts in similar semiarid regions 2 3 1 1 a1 predictable inflow fluctuations fig 5 shows a schematic view of the a1 alternative in this alternative the current water delivery scheduling is upgraded considering the magnitude of inflow fluctuations entering the head source of the canal the water level surface and discharge of the flow passing the river are continually measured at the hydrometry stations located along the river and upstream of the canal head source the occurrence of water fluctuation is recognized at the station by comparing discharge flow during the time intervals then all the information is sent to the canal headquarters via a telemetric system then the ditch riders make a new set of adjustments through the main canal considering the upgraded water delivery schedule accordingly water delivery to all off takes decreases or increases equally based on the inflow fluctuations this method is a feasible easy to implement and convenient solution to be employed at different irrigation districts since information related to variation can be easily transmitted from gauging stations along the river 2 3 1 2 a2 on rotation water delivery scheduling the a2 is designed based on a traditional canal operational management at water shortage periods in irrigation districts in some parts of iran regarding this alternative the operational time is divided into two equal sections fig 6 for the first section the upstream off takes receive water and the downstream ones are entirely closed in the next round the downstream off takes have water and the upstream gates are not allowed to receive additional water the main idea behind this approach is to maintain the water level upstream of the off takes close to the target level so that the off takes are functioning correctly during the inflow fluctuations and also during water deficit conditions 2 3 2 a3 structural modification the rnb main canal has type xx2 nyrpic modules off takes the discharges passing through these modules are sensitive to the water level conditions at the upstream side of the structure the stage discharge rating curves of this type of nyrpic modules show that the structures operate reliably only when the upstream water level fluctuates in a range of 0 08 m in the rnb main canal nyrpic modules off takes have discrete inherent adjustment where increasing and decreasing water delivery is possible for a set of predefined discharges on the contrary check off takes are capable of taking various releases from zero to maximum capacity fig 7 shows the inherent difference of the nyrpic module with a regular check off take in discharge adjustment the a3 involves replacing the current nyrpic module off takes with the sluice gates the idea behind this alternative is to provide an adjustment that is more flexible over the off takes based on the inflow fluctuations and water shortage periods the check structure can be easily manufactured by the local blacksmith shops in small towns or villages near the irrigation district on the other hand structural modifications include replacing the existing nyrpic module off take gates since the regulators are fixed long crest weirs 2 3 3 application of canal automation techniques the last alternatives i e a4 and a5 consist of two control system configurations including a decentralized and centralized approach that were designed and tested for the canal test case it is worth mentioning that regardless of the control configuration an automated canal system needs to have controllable water regulating structures to imply an automatic operation system according to this issue in the simulation model shown in fig 1 the current water level regulating structures in the rnb canal is replaced by the controllable structures 2 3 3 1 a4 application of the decentralized controller widespread application of proportional integral pi controllers make it a viable option to modernize irrigation facilities hashemy et al 2013 schuurmans et al 1999 van overloop et al 2005 this configuration commonly constitutes a set of single input single output siso controllers in which each check gate i e water level regulating structure is entirely manipulated through local measurements taken near the structures pi controller uses a sensor located at the upstream side of the check gates to compare water level measurements with a targeted water level to determine the filtered water level error e f fig 8 the sensor employs a low pass filter to provide a filtered water level error time series for the controller to make smooth manipulation of the controlled structure then the controller calculates the controlled flow that is passing through the gate as eq 1 van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k p e f k e f k 1 k i e f k where k is the control time step 300 s k p and k i are respectively proportional and integral gains and δ q k is the controlled discharge passed through a gate 2 3 3 2 alternative five a5 centralized control system using model predictive control this alternative employs a centralized control configuration using the model predictive control mpc mpc is extensively employed for various purposes at different water systems including drainage systems maestre et al 2013 navigation waterways horváth et al 2015 pump stations berkel et al 2018 kallesøe et al 2017 and irrigation canals hashemy et al 2018 van overloop et al 2010 the reason is the reliable performance of this controller in dealing with various optimization objectives uncertainties delays within the water system and physical constraints and system variables considerations in a systematic manner camacho and bordons 2004 to develop a centralized control system in an irrigation canal the mpc employs the current physical status of the canal a hydraulic model called internal model of the mpc and an objective function based on the control objectives in this study integrator delay id model proposed by van overloop 2006 is used as the internal model to represent the rnb canal dynamics also the control objective is to minimize the deviation of the water levels within the rnb canal reaches from the pre defined target levels i e water level error accordingly the objective function of the developed mpc is defined as eq 2 where water level errors of the entire rnb canal reaches are penalized i e the error values are kept close to zero

systems a hydrodynamic simulation model simulates the current daily operation of the rnb canal moreover after developing these operational models for the proposed alternatives a1 a5 theses developed operational models need to be integrated by a hydrodynamic simulation model to investigate the impact of the alternatives in improving water distribution and delivery activities in this study an open source hydrodynamic simulation model of irrigation conveyance system simulation icss is employed the model was firstly developed by manz 1990 and improved by monem and ghodousi 2015 naghaei and monem 2016 the mentioned model is capable of simulating steady and unsteady flow in the irrigation canals with different cross sectional geometry moreover different types of water regulating structures and off take gates can be simulated by icss the modeled canal system of this study contains geometry of the main canal reach shown in table 1 and water level regulating and off take structures regulating and off take structures were assigned as boundaries of the canal reaches for the icss model the hydraulic simulation is carried out based on predefined boundary conditions which are constant for the manual canal operation because the terms are changed just once a day likewise the boundary conditions are dynamic in automatic canal operation due to continuous adjustment of water regulating structures the developed icss model is calibrated and validated based on the operational data for the water years 2014 2015 recruited from different field visits through the study area it is worth noting that the operational data includes measured inflow head gate and the measured delivered flow to the off takes 1 to 26 and the steady water level at the upstream of the water regulating structures at the downstream of the canal reaches almost 70 of the data were employed for the model calibration and the remaining data were used for the model validation two indices of normalized root mean square error nrmse and coefficient of residual mass crm were employed to assess the calibration and validation results the indices are defined as eq s 3 and 4 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 0 5 100 m 4 c r m i 1 n m i i 1 n s i i 1 n m i where n s i m i and m are respectively the off take numbers from 1 to 26 the simulated discharge values delivered to the off takes the measured discharge values and the average measured discharge values two operational scenarios were chosen out of the 52 operational days in the water year 2014 2015 to investigate the impact of applying the proposed operational alternatives these two scenarios are representing inflow fluctuations in the existing operational condition and severe canal operation fig 9 a and 9 b demonstrate a sample of normal and severe volatility for 32 h the normal scenario includes 40 days of the operation periods while the severe scene covers the rest of 12 days typical situation fig 9 a is arranged to show the conventional daily operation in the rnb main canal including inflow fluctuations with the magnitude of 20 30 discharge variations at the canal head source otherwise the severe scenario fig 9 b incorporates fluctuations with magnitude of 40 70 discharge variations at the canal head source 2 5 operational performance evaluation indicator the indicator is a metric that shows the ability of the proposed operational alternatives a1 a5 to meet the adequate water delivery in every off take alongside the main canal in this study the water conveyance and distribution adequacy pa criterion proposed by molden and gates 1990 5 p a 1 t t 1 r r p a where p a q d q r if q d q r otherwise p a 1 where qd qr are delivered and required water to each off take at each time step in this equation t and r represent the time interval and number of off takes in a reach respectively a closer value of pa to one shows a more successful operation from the adequacy perspectives in general the adequacy indicator in a range of 90 100 is known as a reliable water delivery services to the users also the index values of less than 80 are considered poor services 3 results 3 1 simulation model calibration and validation the simulation model calibration and validation were carried out based on the measured data from the rnb main canal in the water year of 2014 2015 the calibration process was performed through iteratively changing the variables of discharge coefficients of the water regulating structures to minimize differences between the measured and simulated data the developed icss model is calibrated after almost 270 iterations the next step after the calibration of the developed icss model of rnb main canal is validation a comparison of the simulated discharge flows diverted to the off takes 1 to 26 with the measured values via employing the indices of nrmse and crm reveals the reasonable accuracy of the simulated model of the study the nrmse values were obtained 3 and 6 and the crm becomes 0 099 and 0 011 respectively for the calibration and the validation 3 1 1 operational performance improvement of rnb canal potential development by using the alternatives a1 a5 in the operational condition of the rnb canal under the first scenario i e the standard operational scenario with about 20 30 discharge variations at the canal head source are shown in this section the adequacy indicator referring to the sufficiency of water delivery to the off takes was employed to assess the performance of the alternatives the average values of the adequacy indicators for the off takes are given in table 2 also the spatial distribution of the adequacy indicators is depicted in fig 10 a according to table 2 the current operation of the entire main canal reaches i e reach 1 to 26 shows poor water distribution within the main canal since the adequacy indicator decreases from 90 for upstream off takes to 61 for the downstream ones in the upstream canal reaches reach 1 to 9 the adequacy indicator represents almost sufficient water delivery based on the agreement between the canal managers and water user associations wuas representatives to meet the farmer s demands at each off take along the main canal however for the rest of the canal reaches reach 10 to 26 the obtained average value is evaluated as an inappropriate water delivery status this poor operating results in uneven water distribution between upstream and downstream off takes this unequal distribution is shown in fig 10 a by different colors along the rnb canal where each color stands for a level of the adequacy indicator although employing the proposed alternatives a1 a5 led to the adequacy indicator enhancement however significant improvement occurred for option a5 where all 26 off takes have received sufficient water regarding the allocated water for each off take also using the decentralized pi control system through the alternative a4 shows a cognitive enhancement in canal operation so that the indicator at the tail end users shows a 27 increase in adequacy indicator using a1 and a2 we have an improvement in the performance of the water system but it is not as significant as a5 and a4 options however the result for employing the a3 alternative that needs structural modifications in the canal shows the least improvements of the adequacy indicator this result indicates that improving the programming water delivery schedules via enhancing the ditch riders activities which occurred in a1 and a2 can lead to better results compared with the structural changes obtained results for assessing capabilities of all alternatives a1 a5 under the second scenario i e a severe operational scenario about 40 70 discharge variations at the canal head source are given in table 3 the obtained results show that the automated canal system has robust capabilities to deal with unconventional operational conditions that occurred in the second scenario also the spatial distribution of the obtained adequacy indicators from the upstream to the downstream canal reaches for the current operation and alternatives a1 a5 are depicted in fig 10 b the simulation results show adequate control of the water level through the canal reaches by the designed automated control systems table 3 due to real time operation update that happens with the alternatives a4 and a5 any deviation of water level from the targeted water level i e 0 08 m xx2 nyrpic module fluctuations sensitivity is controlled by the automated system however the a5 operation deals better with harsh operational conditions in comparison with a4 due to optimization oriented of mpc technique the obtained adequacy indicators in table 3 verify that by employing the centralized controller the off takes received an adequate amount of water during the simulation period fig 10 reveals that both nonstructural and structural alternatives i e a1 to a3 could not provide stable operational conditions in both scenarios although some improvements were obtained by upgrading the canal operation utilizing these three alternatives the middle and downstream off takes have poor water delivery in other words the proposed alternatives a1 to a3 have issues with controlling the water level adequately throughout the main canal due to non movable water level regulating structures 3 2 potential investigation on reducing groundwater demands with upgrading canal operation decreasing water losses through the distribution systems is a practical solution to improve canal operational management in irrigation districts the amount of water conserved is then available to be employed as a source of water for the farmers moreover the conserved surface water can potentially decrease groundwater demands in individual farms therefore the proposed alternatives a1 to a5 depending on their ability to reduce the mentioned losses reduce groundwater demands within the roodasht irrigation district potential reducing of the groundwater demand in the irrigated areas were calculated for the alternatives a1 a5 to investigate the indirect benefits of the surface water operational system enhancement the regions with obtained adequacy indicator value more than 90 and areas with the indicator values of 80 90 are recognized in figs 11 b and 11 a respectively the tube wells located in regions with adequacy indicator value above 90 could be completely shut down since the surface water delivery services are sufficient for farmers fig 11 b for the identified regions in fig 10 b where the average adequacy indicator is in a range of 80 90 the deficit periods during the simulation time i e each time step where the indicator value is less than 90 are recognized by subtracting the deficit periods from the entire simulation time the potential amount of groundwater conservation was calculated for each secondary irrigated unit i e the area irrigated by an off take and given in table 4 and shown in fig 12 comparison of figs 11 a and 11 b reveals the advantages of employing the automation techniques in contrast with the manual approaches in the potential reducing of groundwater demands also the benefits of having centralized control a5 in comparison with the decentralized configuration a4 is easily recognizable inefficient water delivery services of the current operational conditions fig 10 b does not give any other option to farmers other than digging tube wells by comparing sub figures of 11 a and 11 b reveals a relatively small water delivery service enhancement in upstream and middle parts of the canal in the normal scenario however this improvement is not enough to overcome the inflow fluctuations especially for the case of structural modification in a3 the alternatives a4 and a5 by getting the advantages of the real time water level control are the best operation alternatives when the objective of the canal management is reducing groundwater demands by employing a5 the improvement in operational services can be interpreted to the potential reduction of the groundwater demand up to 2 648 and 17 742 mcm year respectively for semi deep and deep tube wells fig 12 a the groundwater could be decreased to 11 561 mcm per year if the water manager utilizes alternative 4 the a1 a2 is showing a potential reduction in groundwater demand around 5 352 mcm year 8 428 from the deep wells and 2 817 mcm year 2 007 from the semi deep tube wells the results show that proper practices and planning of the water distribution could be led to groundwater conservation while fulfilling the irrigation needs of farmers even in the districts where the application of the modern decentralized and centralized control system is limited due to economic considerations implementation of the non structural operational alternatives can be practical 4 conclusion we were employing the proposed alternatives a1 to a5 showing a range of operational improvements a slight enhancement using nonstructural and structural alternatives can be seen by using a1 to a3 options by using the automated alternatives a4 and a5 we can get a more noticeable improvement in water allocation within the district the results of this study can be summarized as follows i although the non automatic approaches a1 and a2 alternatives were not efficient in controlling the harsh and severe operational scenario i e the significant inflow fluctuations under normal operating conditions we can obtain a reasonable improvement in other words non structural alternatives could be a practical solution in irrigation districts where the budget is limited employing a1 a2 has resulted in 4 41 3 57 improvement in the adequacy indicator and therefore water delivery activities moreover using these two alternatives can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 8 168 and 10 434 mcm year 1 respectively also more significant improvements in water efficiency can be achieved by enhancing the ditch rider s schedules the latter is possible in many districts by hiring local workforces leading to more sustainable cooperation between water managers and local farmers ii the non automatic alternatives a1 and a2 show a consistent performance in comparison with the structural modification alternative a3 in improving the water delivery it demonstrates that enhancing programming activities including set timelines for the ditch riders and planning water delivery can result insufficient water delivery to the farms iii application of canal automation a4 and a5 is mandatory to deal with severe operational challenges e g harsh inflow fluctuation in this study with these approaches we can provide optimum agricultural water and decrease environmental concerns the results of this study reveal that employing a centralized mpc system a5 alternative can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 20 390 mcm year 1 the centralized mpc can reduce operational losses because it is a robust system that can provide optimum gate adjustments and stable hydraulic conditions within every single canal reach declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are

10740,water shortages have led farmers within irrigation districts to resort to groundwater resources in this scenario a decrease in those water losses due to improper operational management within the districts may halt the increasing trend of groundwater overexploitation this study aims to examine the impact of improving operational management in irrigation districts both to provide reliable surface water distribution and to reduce groundwater demands therein to this end a set of operational alternatives were investigated including nonstructural approaches structural modification and automatic control systems the potential amount of the reduction in the groundwater demands can be measured under each of the alternative operations for the delivery of water to farmers the study is conducted on the hydrodynamic model of an irrigation canal affected by 20 70 inflow fluctuations which occur due to water shortages at the head source the results of the operational simulation indicate that appropriate management of the water delivery systems within non structural alternatives can lead to a 2 13 improvement in operational performance indicators in comparison with the structural modification accordingly the application of non structural approaches can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 5 352 and 8 428 million cubic metres mcm from deep tube wells and 2 817 and 2 007 mcm from the semi deep tube wells over the period of one water year however when employing automatic control systems operational services to the users undergo a 15 62 enhancement such that groundwater demand drops by 11 561 and 20 39 mcm per year respectively keywords off farm activities operational management irrigation districts groundwater conservation 1 introduction a low efficiency operation of irrigation water distribution systems iwds can lead to the deficient water supply at the farm level playán and mateos 2006 moreover the inefficient operational management of irrigation canals can lead to uneven distribution of water between the upstream and downstream users that might increase the social conflicts lozano et al 2010 rijsberman 2006 and decrease the marginal economic returns of agricultural activities hashemy shahdany et al 2017 medellín azuara et al 2012 pereira et al 2002 accordingly renovation and modernization of irrigation canals are among the essential needs that provide reliable water distribution for farmers in the semi arid regions of the world lopez gunn et al 2012 playán and mateos 2006 irrigation water use efficiency in irrigation districts of iran similar to many other ones in the middle east and north africa reveals that the average of applied water efficiency i e on farm water management scales is about 51 varies from 24 7 55 7 hassani et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the figures mentioned above were obtained with an assumption of 82 5 irrigation water conveyance and delivery efficiency i e off farm

mediterranean agricultural regions and that of the contemporary irrigation districts built by the fao in ethiopia are respectively 46 8 serra et al 2016 and 74 agide et al 2016 the comparison shows that the presumed efficiency of 82 5 is far from the reality since reported efficiency indicators i e 46 8 and 74 in the latter examples are based on a set of periodic on site measurements conducted

considerations such as vandalism or robbery of the on site equipment and lack of operators knowledge are undeniable obstacles against these projects hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop et al 2014 in these conditions off line methods including optimization techniques li et al 2007 lianhai et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 and off line control systems fele et al 2014 maestre et al 2014 mehdy hashemy shahdany and roozbahani 2016 van overloop et al 2014 can be employed to improve the current manual operational activities in this regard the application of intelligent systems including data mining approaches to provide optimal scheduling for daily water delivery ticlavilca et al 2013 and utilization of off line control systems to determine regular adjustments of water regulating structures are among the recent attempts within iwds for developing practical operational methods this study focuses on investigating the performance improvement of iwds employing a wide range of operational alternatives on the roodasht irrigation district rid located at the tail end of the zayandeh rud river basin in iran this region of iran is suffering from unreliable supply from the river that resulted in extreme inflow fluctuations in the main canal accordingly to provide better services to users of the district different operational alternatives are assessed in this study the non structural alternatives include daily scheduling water distribution and operation based on two strategies of i delivery in proportion to the inflow fluctuations and ii sequential water delivery it is worth noting that implementing all alternatives need a hydrodynamic simulation model the model simulates hydraulic conditions in the canal operated based on the mentioned alternatives in the structural modification alternative the current off take structures in the rid main canal with the discrete adjusting inherent are replaced by a continuous movable type of structure the automation control systems include the application of a decentralized control system and a centralized controller for automatic regulation of the water level in the main canal poor canal operation in rid has shifted the dependency of the farmers from the unreliable surface water to the groundwater resources although aquifer of the region is announced as one of the critical aquifers in the center of iran hashemy shahdany et al 2018 the number of operated semi deep tube wells have increased from 11 000 to 48 000 and deep tube wells have growth from 1070 to 2050 during the last 15 years the more specific objectives of the study are i developing the calibrated icss hydrodynamic simulation model of the test case ii investigating the effects of employing the non structural and structural modification alternatives on the current operation of the test case iii designing a decentralized proportional integral pi controller and a centralized automatic control system employing model predictive control mpc iv testing the developed non structural structural and control methods under severe operational scenario including inflow fluctuation at the canal head gate v investigating the potential of the proposed alternatives to fulfill water demands through the roodasht main canal and reduce groundwater overexploitation within the district 2 methods and materials 2 1 methodology fig 1 is a flowchart showing the developed simulation model i e hydrodynamic model and operational alternatives a1 a5 in this study and the interactions between them details and information on the mentioned models are provided in the following sections the study was conducted in three general steps 1 developing operational alternatives a1 a5 a1 and a2 consist of the improved manual operation called nonstructural alternatives in this study a3 stands for structural modification alternatives and a4 and a5 are representative of control systems 2 developing a hydrodynamic simulation model of the canal test case to be integrated with the operational alternatives mentioned in the previous step it should be clarified that alternatives a1 a3 were performed by the simulation model however as fig 1 shows performing the alternatives a4 a5 needs two way coupling of the operation model matlab in this study and the simulation model 3 computing the potential decrease in the groundwater demands due to employing alternatives a1 a5 the required data for developing the models in each of the mentioned steps were acquired from the roodasht irrigation district rid in southwest esfahan iran 2 2 study area the roodasht irrigation district rid is located in the zayandeh rud river basin in the central part of iran fig 2 a shows the irrigation canal networks and fig 2 b depicts semi deep and deep tube wells black dots scattered within the district this study focuses on the roodasht north branch rnb main canal with a design discharge capacity of 9 cubic meters per second m3 s 1 at the head source the total irrigated area served by this canal is about 20000 ha the rnb main canal consists of 24 canal reaches that is separated by 26 upstream static head long crest weirs duckbill the canal has a longitudinal slope of 0 0003 a manning coefficient of around 0 017 and side slope 1 5 details about the physical information of canal characteristics and geometry parameters used for operational modeling of the test case are listed in table 1 according to the table the storage area refers to the area located upstream of each check structure influenced by the backwater phenomenon also the delay time is travel time of flow from a check structure located at the upstream of a canal reach to the area influenced by the backwater van overloop et al 2010 rid has been dealing with the severe problem of providing a reliable water delivery among the water holders shahdany et al 2016 estimated at least 45 loss of main canal inflow at the study location due to inferior canal operational management within the main canal assessing the daily operational information of water years 2013 2016 collected during this study reveals that an inflow around 4 1 m3 s 1 is supplied at the head source of the canal to meet the total water demands i e cumulative water rights of the off takes supposed to be fulfilled during the daily operation that are equal to 2 3 m3 s 1 rid is the last irrigation district taking water from the zayande rood river the upstream fluctuations on the river generated by the upstream irrigation districts and the numerous industrial parks directly influence this region accordingly extreme inflow fluctuations happen at the head source of the rnb main canal the water shortage during the recent dry seasons has intensified the mentioned inflow fluctuations for both upstream and downstream water users these have shifted the farmer s tendency to use the tube wells to have a secure water resource for the agriculture proposes fig 3 shows the increase in the number of tube wells during recent years these tube wells are extracting groundwater at the individual farm inside the areas covered by the canal networks 2 3 operational alternatives fig 4 demonstrates the proposed operational alternatives a1 to a5 employed in this study according to this figure the options belong to three broader categories of the non structural structural and automatic methods elaborated in the following sections 2 3 1 non structural alternatives in the manual operation a ditch rider regulates and adjusts the inline structures in a canal including checks and off takes once or twice a day by driving along the canal a check structure regulates the canal water surface when the canal is flowing at partial capacity i e less than design capacity off take structures take water from the canal to feed the laterals and secondary canals in the roodasht irrigation district the current operation of the rnb main canal is carried out based on a predefined water delivery schedule regulations of the off takes from the head gate to the downstream one are then performed to fulfill the specified constant water demands at every off take each of the structures is adjusted based on the specific stage discharge curve annually calibrated and verified by the operating experts to improve the currently manual operation schemes non structure alternatives a1 and a2 were proposed and investigated it is worth noting that the non structural alternatives were assigned based on a set of interviews with ditch riders local operators water board authorities and regional water managers several field visits to the study area and a few surveys from the ongoing operational experiences of other irrigation districts in similar semiarid regions 2 3 1 1 a1 predictable inflow fluctuations fig 5 shows a schematic view of the a1 alternative in this alternative the current water delivery scheduling is upgraded considering the magnitude of inflow fluctuations entering the head source of the canal the water level surface and discharge of the flow passing the river are continually measured at the hydrometry stations located along the river and upstream of the canal head source the occurrence of water fluctuation is recognized at the station by comparing discharge flow during the time intervals then all the information is sent to the canal headquarters via a telemetric system then the ditch riders make a new set of adjustments through the main canal considering the upgraded water delivery schedule accordingly water delivery to all off takes decreases or increases equally based on the inflow fluctuations this method is a feasible easy to implement and convenient solution to be employed at different irrigation districts since information related to variation can be easily transmitted from gauging stations along the river 2 3 1 2 a2 on rotation water delivery scheduling the a2 is designed based on a traditional canal operational management at water shortage periods in irrigation districts in some parts of iran regarding this alternative the operational time is divided into two equal sections fig 6 for the first section the upstream off takes receive water and the downstream ones are entirely closed in the next round the downstream off takes have water and the upstream gates are not allowed to receive additional water the main idea behind this approach is to maintain the water level upstream of the off takes close to the target level so that the off takes are functioning correctly during the inflow fluctuations and also during water deficit conditions 2 3 2 a3 structural modification the rnb main canal has type xx2 nyrpic modules off takes the discharges passing through these modules are sensitive to the water level conditions at the upstream side of the structure the stage discharge rating curves of this type of nyrpic modules show that the structures operate reliably only when the upstream water level fluctuates in a range of 0 08 m in the rnb main canal nyrpic modules off takes have discrete inherent adjustment where increasing and decreasing water delivery is possible for a set of predefined discharges on the contrary check off takes are capable of taking various releases from zero to maximum capacity fig 7 shows the inherent difference of the nyrpic module with a regular check off take in discharge adjustment the a3 involves replacing the current nyrpic module off takes with the sluice gates the idea behind this alternative is to provide an adjustment that is more flexible over the off takes based on the inflow fluctuations and water shortage periods the check structure can be easily manufactured by the local blacksmith shops in small towns or villages near the irrigation district on the other hand structural modifications include replacing the existing nyrpic module off take gates since the regulators are fixed long crest weirs 2 3 3 application of canal automation techniques the last alternatives i e a4 and a5 consist of two control system configurations including a decentralized and centralized approach that were designed and tested for the canal test case it is worth mentioning that regardless of the control configuration an automated canal system needs to have controllable water regulating structures to imply an automatic operation system according to this issue in the simulation model shown in fig 1 the current water level regulating structures in the rnb canal is replaced by the controllable structures 2 3 3 1 a4 application of the decentralized controller widespread application of proportional integral pi controllers make it a viable option to modernize irrigation facilities hashemy et al 2013 schuurmans et al 1999 van overloop et al 2005 this configuration commonly constitutes a set of single input single output siso controllers in which each check gate i e water level regulating structure is entirely manipulated through local measurements taken near the structures pi controller uses a sensor located at the upstream side of the check gates to compare water level measurements with a targeted water level to determine the filtered water level error e f fig 8 the sensor employs a low pass filter to provide a filtered water level error time series for the controller to make smooth manipulation of the controlled structure then the controller calculates the controlled flow that is passing through the gate as eq 1 van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k p e f k e f k 1 k i e f k where k is the control time step 300 s k p and k i are respectively proportional and integral gains and δ q k is the controlled discharge passed through a gate 2 3 3 2 alternative five a5 centralized control system using model predictive control this alternative employs a centralized control configuration using the model predictive control mpc mpc is extensively employed for various purposes at different water systems including drainage systems maestre et al 2013 navigation waterways horváth et al 2015 pump stations berkel et al 2018 kallesøe et al 2017 and irrigation canals hashemy et al 2018 van overloop et al 2010 the reason is the reliable performance of this controller in dealing with various optimization objectives uncertainties delays within the water system and physical constraints and system variables considerations in a systematic manner camacho and bordons 2004 to develop a centralized control system in an irrigation canal the mpc employs the current physical status of the canal a hydraulic model called internal model of the mpc and an objective function based on the control objectives in this study integrator delay id model proposed by van overloop 2006 is used as the internal model to represent the rnb canal dynamics also the control objective is to minimize the deviation of the water levels within the rnb canal reaches from the pre defined target levels i e water level error accordingly the objective function of the developed mpc is defined as eq 2 where water level errors of the entire rnb canal reaches are penalized i e the error values are kept close to zero

systems a hydrodynamic simulation model simulates the current daily operation of the rnb canal moreover after developing these operational models for the proposed alternatives a1 a5 theses developed operational models need to be integrated by a hydrodynamic simulation model to investigate the impact of the alternatives in improving water distribution and delivery activities in this study an open source hydrodynamic simulation model of irrigation conveyance system simulation icss is employed the model was firstly developed by manz 1990 and improved by monem and ghodousi 2015 naghaei and monem 2016 the mentioned model is capable of simulating steady and unsteady flow in the irrigation canals with different cross sectional geometry moreover different types of water regulating structures and off take gates can be simulated by icss the modeled canal system of this study contains geometry of the main canal reach shown in table 1 and water level regulating and off take structures regulating and off take structures were assigned as boundaries of the canal reaches for the icss model the hydraulic simulation is carried out based on predefined boundary conditions which are constant for the manual canal operation because the terms are changed just once a day likewise the boundary conditions are dynamic in automatic canal operation due to continuous adjustment of water regulating structures the developed icss model is calibrated and validated based on the operational data for the water years 2014 2015 recruited from different field visits through the study area it is worth noting that the operational data includes measured inflow head gate and the measured delivered flow to the off takes 1 to 26 and the steady water level at the upstream of the water regulating structures at the downstream of the canal reaches almost 70 of the data were employed for the model calibration and the remaining data were used for the model validation two indices of normalized root mean square error nrmse and coefficient of residual mass crm were employed to assess the calibration and validation results the indices are defined as eq s 3 and 4 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 0 5 100 m 4 c r m i 1 n m i i 1 n s i i 1 n m i where n s i m i and m are respectively the off take numbers from 1 to 26 the simulated discharge values delivered to the off takes the measured discharge values and the average measured discharge values two operational scenarios were chosen out of the 52 operational days in the water year 2014 2015 to investigate the impact of applying the proposed operational alternatives these two scenarios are representing inflow fluctuations in the existing operational condition and severe canal operation fig 9 a and 9 b demonstrate a sample of normal and severe volatility for 32 h the normal scenario includes 40 days of the operation periods while the severe scene covers the rest of 12 days typical situation fig 9 a is arranged to show the conventional daily operation in the rnb main canal including inflow fluctuations with the magnitude of 20 30 discharge variations at the canal head source otherwise the severe scenario fig 9 b incorporates fluctuations with magnitude of 40 70 discharge variations at the canal head source 2 5 operational performance evaluation indicator the indicator is a metric that shows the ability of the proposed operational alternatives a1 a5 to meet the adequate water delivery in every off take alongside the main canal in this study the water conveyance and distribution adequacy pa criterion proposed by molden and gates 1990 5 p a 1 t t 1 r r p a where p a q d q r if q d q r otherwise p a 1 where qd qr are delivered and required water to each off take at each time step in this equation t and r represent the time interval and number of off takes in a reach respectively a closer value of pa to one shows a more successful operation from the adequacy perspectives in general the adequacy indicator in a range of 90 100 is known as a reliable water delivery services to the users also the index values of less than 80 are considered poor services 3 results 3 1 simulation model calibration and validation the simulation model calibration and validation were carried out based on the measured data from the rnb main canal in the water year of 2014 2015 the calibration process was performed through iteratively changing the variables of discharge coefficients of the water regulating structures to minimize differences between the measured and simulated data the developed icss model is calibrated after almost 270 iterations the next step after the calibration of the developed icss model of rnb main canal is validation a comparison of the simulated discharge flows diverted to the off takes 1 to 26 with the measured values via employing the indices of nrmse and crm reveals the reasonable accuracy of the simulated model of the study the nrmse values were obtained 3 and 6 and the crm becomes 0 099 and 0 011 respectively for the calibration and the validation 3 1 1 operational performance improvement of rnb canal potential development by using the alternatives a1 a5 in the operational condition of the rnb canal under the first scenario i e the standard operational scenario with about 20 30 discharge variations at the canal head source are shown in this section the adequacy indicator referring to the sufficiency of water delivery to the off takes was employed to assess the performance of the alternatives the average values of the adequacy indicators for the off takes are given in table 2 also the spatial distribution of the adequacy indicators is depicted in fig 10 a according to table 2 the current operation of the entire main canal reaches i e reach 1 to 26 shows poor water distribution within the main canal since the adequacy indicator decreases from 90 for upstream off takes to 61 for the downstream ones in the upstream canal reaches reach 1 to 9 the adequacy indicator represents almost sufficient water delivery based on the agreement between the canal managers and water user associations wuas representatives to meet the farmer s demands at each off take along the main canal however for the rest of the canal reaches reach 10 to 26 the obtained average value is evaluated as an inappropriate water delivery status this poor operating results in uneven water distribution between upstream and downstream off takes this unequal distribution is shown in fig 10 a by different colors along the rnb canal where each color stands for a level of the adequacy indicator although employing the proposed alternatives a1 a5 led to the adequacy indicator enhancement however significant improvement occurred for option a5 where all 26 off takes have received sufficient water regarding the allocated water for each off take also using the decentralized pi control system through the alternative a4 shows a cognitive enhancement in canal operation so that the indicator at the tail end users shows a 27 increase in adequacy indicator using a1 and a2 we have an improvement in the performance of the water system but it is not as significant as a5 and a4 options however the result for employing the a3 alternative that needs structural modifications in the canal shows the least improvements of the adequacy indicator this result indicates that improving the programming water delivery schedules via enhancing the ditch riders activities which occurred in a1 and a2 can lead to better results compared with the structural changes obtained results for assessing capabilities of all alternatives a1 a5 under the second scenario i e a severe operational scenario about 40 70 discharge variations at the canal head source are given in table 3 the obtained results show that the automated canal system has robust capabilities to deal with unconventional operational conditions that occurred in the second scenario also the spatial distribution of the obtained adequacy indicators from the upstream to the downstream canal reaches for the current operation and alternatives a1 a5 are depicted in fig 10 b the simulation results show adequate control of the water level through the canal reaches by the designed automated control systems table 3 due to real time operation update that happens with the alternatives a4 and a5 any deviation of water level from the targeted water level i e 0 08 m xx2 nyrpic module fluctuations sensitivity is controlled by the automated system however the a5 operation deals better with harsh operational conditions in comparison with a4 due to optimization oriented of mpc technique the obtained adequacy indicators in table 3 verify that by employing the centralized controller the off takes received an adequate amount of water during the simulation period fig 10 reveals that both nonstructural and structural alternatives i e a1 to a3 could not provide stable operational conditions in both scenarios although some improvements were obtained by upgrading the canal operation utilizing these three alternatives the middle and downstream off takes have poor water delivery in other words the proposed alternatives a1 to a3 have issues with controlling the water level adequately throughout the main canal due to non movable water level regulating structures 3 2 potential investigation on reducing groundwater demands with upgrading canal operation decreasing water losses through the distribution systems is a practical solution to improve canal operational management in irrigation districts the amount of water conserved is then available to be employed as a source of water for the farmers moreover the conserved surface water can potentially decrease groundwater demands in individual farms therefore the proposed alternatives a1 to a5 depending on their ability to reduce the mentioned losses reduce groundwater demands within the roodasht irrigation district potential reducing of the groundwater demand in the irrigated areas were calculated for the alternatives a1 a5 to investigate the indirect benefits of the surface water operational system enhancement the regions with obtained adequacy indicator value more than 90 and areas with the indicator values of 80 90 are recognized in figs 11 b and 11 a respectively the tube wells located in regions with adequacy indicator value above 90 could be completely shut down since the surface water delivery services are sufficient for farmers fig 11 b for the identified regions in fig 10 b where the average adequacy indicator is in a range of 80 90 the deficit periods during the simulation time i e each time step where the indicator value is less than 90 are recognized by subtracting the deficit periods from the entire simulation time the potential amount of groundwater conservation was calculated for each secondary irrigated unit i e the area irrigated by an off take and given in table 4 and shown in fig 12 comparison of figs 11 a and 11 b reveals the advantages of employing the automation techniques in contrast with the manual approaches in the potential reducing of groundwater demands also the benefits of having centralized control a5 in comparison with the decentralized configuration a4 is easily recognizable inefficient water delivery services of the current operational conditions fig 10 b does not give any other option to farmers other than digging tube wells by comparing sub figures of 11 a and 11 b reveals a relatively small water delivery service enhancement in upstream and middle parts of the canal in the normal scenario however this improvement is not enough to overcome the inflow fluctuations especially for the case of structural modification in a3 the alternatives a4 and a5 by getting the advantages of the real time water level control are the best operation alternatives when the objective of the canal management is reducing groundwater demands by employing a5 the improvement in operational services can be interpreted to the potential reduction of the groundwater demand up to 2 648 and 17 742 mcm year respectively for semi deep and deep tube wells fig 12 a the groundwater could be decreased to 11 561 mcm per year if the water manager utilizes alternative 4 the a1 a2 is showing a potential reduction in groundwater demand around 5 352 mcm year 8 428 from the deep wells and 2 817 mcm year 2 007 from the semi deep tube wells the results show that proper practices and planning of the water distribution could be led to groundwater conservation while fulfilling the irrigation needs of farmers even in the districts where the application of the modern decentralized and centralized control system is limited due to economic considerations implementation of the non structural operational alternatives can be practical 4 conclusion we were employing the proposed alternatives a1 to a5 showing a range of operational improvements a slight enhancement using nonstructural and structural alternatives can be seen by using a1 to a3 options by using the automated alternatives a4 and a5 we can get a more noticeable improvement in water allocation within the district the results of this study can be summarized as follows i although the non automatic approaches a1 and a2 alternatives were not efficient in controlling the harsh and severe operational scenario i e the significant inflow fluctuations under normal operating conditions we can obtain a reasonable improvement in other words non structural alternatives could be a practical solution in irrigation districts where the budget is limited employing a1 a2 has resulted in 4 41 3 57 improvement in the adequacy indicator and therefore water delivery activities moreover using these two alternatives can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 8 168 and 10 434 mcm year 1 respectively also more significant improvements in water efficiency can be achieved by enhancing the ditch rider s schedules the latter is possible in many districts by hiring local workforces leading to more sustainable cooperation between water managers and local farmers ii the non automatic alternatives a1 and a2 show a consistent performance in comparison with the structural modification alternative a3 in improving the water delivery it demonstrates that enhancing programming activities including set timelines for the ditch riders and planning water delivery can result insufficient water delivery to the farms iii application of canal automation a4 and a5 is mandatory to deal with severe operational challenges e g harsh inflow fluctuation in this study with these approaches we can provide optimum agricultural water and decrease environmental concerns the results of this study reveal that employing a centralized mpc system a5 alternative can potentially decrease the groundwater demand by 20 390 mcm year 1 the centralized mpc can reduce operational losses because it is a robust system that can provide optimum gate adjustments and stable hydraulic conditions within every single canal reach declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are

management practices using the calibrated and validated decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat model for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa in the violada irrigation district vid northeast spain to reduce the impact of n losses on irrigation return flows quality in total 59 farmers field plots were investigated from 2014 to 2017 crop seasons distributed in the different soil types in the vid in order to assess the current and optimum n fertilization and the combined irrigation and n fertilization management practices considering the whole cultivated crop area in each soil type of the vid and comparing with the current n fertilization results showed that the optimum n management could reduce the no3 n leaching below root zone by 51 and residual no3 n in soil by 58 these reductions could be improved further by 35 and 3 respectively under the combined n fertilization and irrigation optimum management the more vulnerable soils for no3 n leaching shallow and or very permeable soils were also identified as for the impact of individual crops the model identified that both long and short season maize were the most polluting crops 84 of total n leached due to the heavy fertilization applied by the local farmers that exceed crop requirements by more than 50 moreover the recommended irrigation and n fertilization could reduce n2o n emissions by 60 the triple than under the recommended n fertilization alone this study supports the potential of the dssat model to incentivize farmers to adjust their n fertilizer and irrigation

current management practices crop calibration results under real field conditions are more accurate and reliable than experimental plots especially when up scaling to regional and national spatial

studies revealed that excessive fertilizer n is often applied especially for maize 318 453 kg ha 1 yr 1 to avoid risks of yield losses cavero et al 2003 isidoro et al 2006 and large amounts of residual n are left in the soil at crop harvest villar mir et al 2002 more recently jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 reported that because of the intensive and excessive fertilization practices the irrigation return flows in sprinkler irrigated areas carry huge amounts of nitrate reaching 150 kg no3 n ha 1 year 1 and frequently exceed the no3 n concentration threshold limit of 50 mg l 1 established by the european union eu 2000 the recent transformation of over 1 000 000 ha in spain from traditional surface irrigation to pressurized systems opens the door for the intensification of irrigated agriculture higher cropping intensity and introduction of new crops with higher added value that come along with the ongoing increase in animal farming particularly pig farms all these issues entail an advancement in the quality of life of farmers thus contributing to the economic sustainability of irrigated agriculture but they may pose a threat to its environmental sustainability malik and dechmi 2019 reported that optimizing irrigation management alone cannot effectively reduce n leaching in intensive irrigated areas and they highlighted the importance to optimize both n fertilizer and irrigation management simultaneously for potentially reducing nutrient losses and increasing resource efficiency in such areas furthermore this research aimed to evaluate the current and best nf management practices using dssat model for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa under semiarid condition to reduce n losses impact on irrigation return flows

designated as 3 coarse loamy hereafter designated as 4 loamy shallow soils hereafter designated as 5 and loamy skeletal hereafter designated as 6 the prevalent family was fine silty followed by the coarse loamy the texture of the soils in vid was generally fine and high in silt particularly in the deeper horizons horizon b had around 60 of silt on 77 of the vid surface in total the soils in the vid were classified into 13 soil units considering these two criteria where the more extended representative soil units are typic xerofluvent fine silty 955 ha 18 of the total study area and gypsic haploxerept fine silty 946 ha 18 more details about soils characteristics are presented in jiménez aguirre et al 2018 92 of the study area is characterized by remotely controlled sprinkler irrigation systems spacing of 18 m 18 m while only 8 is still under traditional surface irrigation the irrigation season starts at the beginning of march and ends mid october the main irrigated crops during the study years from 2014 to 2015 to 2016 2017 cropping season were maize 36 6 of total area both long season hereafter designated as maize ls and short season hereafter designated as maize ss alfalfa 25 wheat and barley 18 and sunflower 9 on average these main crops represented 88 5 of cultivated areas in the vid during the considered period the high cropping intensity system was pronounced by the double cropping pattern cultivated after winter crops mainly maize and sunflower for instance from 2015 to 2016 the cultivated area increased from 15 to 20 and from 7 to 11 for maize ss and sunflower respectively a total of 59 farmer s field experiments were selected from 2014 to 2015 to 2016 2017 crop seasons in the vid for the main crops maize ls n 14 maize ss n 8 barley n 14 wheat n 6 sunflower n 10 and alfalfa n 7 the field plots selection aimed to represent a maximum spatial combination between the different soil types and crops in the vid during the study years in addition farmers collaboration for the needed soil sampling crop growth monitoring and measurements at their fields was a determinant factor in this selection 2 2 model description and input data the dssat model

all the plots by 0 3 m soil layer depths up to 1 20 m when possible in addition the soil was sampled at the beginning and harvest for each crop season to determine the soil n available form no3 n using colorimetric method organic matter by walkley black method and ph table 2 summarizes the average values of the different plots soil characteristics used in this study soils a4 d4 and b6 are grouped as shallow and or with high permeability 25 of total area while the remaining soil types are grouped as low permeability soils 65 of total area common fertilization management practices were determined through interviews performed with local farmers of the study area including the considered plots used for model simulations in total 75 and 71 interviews were performed during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 crop seasons respectively farmers were asked about the type of nf applied including manure the amounts per unit area and application dates sowing date and density and crop yield at harvest yield sampling of 1 m2 with two repetitions was randomly conducted to determine the grain yield and vegetative biomass for each different crop then a subsamples of grain yield and vegetative biomass were weighed and dried at 60 c to determine the moisture content once dried the subsample was grinded and analyzed to determine the n uptake by combustion truspec cn leco st joseph mi usa for both yield components the irrigation management data date and dose of each irrigation event applied in each plot was provided by the almudévar water user association for each corresponding plot using the remote database registration 2 3 evaluation of management practices scenarios the focus of the management practices in this study was on the cultural practices that most directly affect the n cycle and yield production which are irrigation and nf application for each crop and soil type of the considered plots the model was run considering two fertilization approaches during 2016 for alfalfa and during 2015 and 2016 for the others crops the first n fertilization approach considered was the current fertilization management determined from the local farmers surveys the second n fertilization approach was the recommended n fertilization management determined from the literature for each crop both simulations were performed considering the current farmers irrigation management of each crop and year then a simultaneously combined management of optimal irrigation and recommended n application were conducted as a best management practice bmp for each crop in different soil types in the vid the current farmers irrigation scheduling were obtained from the almudévar water user association for each corresponding plot using the remote database registration while the optimal irrigation was determined by adjusting the irrigation doses and timing to each crop requirement using the automatic irrigation option included in the dssat model and considering a constant maximum soil allowable depletion mad value of 0 5 the farmers irrigation scheduling was detailed and analyzed in malik and dechmi 2019 for maize ls as well as maize ss an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was splitted as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting 100 kg ha 1 in the first sidedress vegetative stage v7 8 and 100 kg n ha 1 in the second sidedress silking stage r1 in the case of wheat and barley the n requirements are on average 30 kg n and 25 kg n per 1000 kg of grain produced respectively marm 2011 so the optimum rate was calculated based on the average yield obtained in the studied years per recommended rate per 1000 kg therefore the corresponding nf amounts were 192 and 198 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 160 and 165 kg n ha 1 for barley in 2015 and 2016 respectively for both crops a 90 kg n ha 1 was applied at sowing with urea and the remaining as a sidedress at stem elongation marm 2011 concerning sunflower the recommended dose is 35 kg n per 1000 kg of produced grain yield thus the total nf amount applied was 98 and 77 kg n ha 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively splitted as 50 at sowing and 50 at vegetative stage v10 marm 2011 concerning alfalfa a 30 kg n ha 1 was applied at sowing to favor establishment in the pre nodulation phase once it has been established alfalfa does not need application of nitrogenous fertilizers marm 2011 for all scenario cases of each considered crop common vid farmers cultural practices were used and eight different soil types e2 d5 d4 c3 c2 c1 b6 and a4 covering 93 of the vid were considered two parameters were used to evaluate n management practices in the vid 1 n uptake efficiency nupe expressed as the ratio between above ground n at harvest n uptake and the nf amount applied per hectare a value close to one suggests that soil fertility will be sustained at a steady state while values well below one suggest avoidable nutrient losses also values greater than one must be regarded as unsustainable because more nutrients are removed with the harvested crop than applied by fertilizer and or manure this is a simplification of a complex process since nutrient removal by erosion leaching and gaseous emissions are not considered nevertheless this index provides qualitative information about the n available to the crops and the environmental impact in terms of n surplus the obtained nupe allows farmers to make comparisons among crops in the same environment and time and to decide which crop or which form of agronomic management is advisable 2 n use efficiency nue expressed as the ratio between crop grain yield and the fertilizer n amount applied per hectare kg kg 1 n for accessing the impact of the different scenarios at the whole vid area scale the total no3 n losses below the root zone in each soil was calculated by considering the tow cropping season average amount of the total no3 n losses simulated in each soil type and under each scenario for each cropping season the amount of total n leached in each soil type was calculated as the sum of the product between the total area of each crop within the considered soil type and the resulted no3 n losses per hectare as following n l e a c h e d i 1 6 x i y i where xi is the no3 n losses per hectare of the crop i and yi is the area in hectares of the crop i within the considered soil type the amount of total n leached in the vid was calculated as the sum of the n leached in all vid soils the same calculation was performed for residual n in soil and for n2o n emissions finally the geographic information system qgis v 2 18 was used to represent the spatial variability of n losses and residual n in soil depending on soil properties in the vid to determine the most affected soil under the different management practices 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed current nitrogen fertilization practices and crop n uptake efficiency table 3 summarizes the mass of manure nf the pre plant and side dress mineral nf applied by farmers to the main cultivated crops in the vid the information includes the mass of nf mean and in parenthesis standard deviation applied on each date and the average dates of each application results indicate that maize ls was the most heavily fertilized crop in both years 2 years average nf applied 402 kg n ha 1 as mineral fertilizer and 226 kg n ha 1 as manure while a recommended dose is 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2012 all farmers applied a mineral pre plant fertilization generally n p k complex in april and 97 of farmers applied a first side dress application in june urea 46 n or 32 n solution a second side dress was given by 67 of farmers and a third by 44 whereas only 11 of farmers performed a fourth side dress application table 3 these side dress applications were given as n32 manure generally pig slurry was applied only by 31 of farmers with an average nf total application of 628 kg n ha 1 only a third part of the total nf amount was taken up by the plant 207 kg n ha 1 relating to maize ss fertilization management was similar to maize ls with 419 kg n ha 1 averaging the two crop seasons except some farmers who did not apply any manure and or less application for third and fourth side dress 19 and 3 5 of farmers respectively in this case the total n uptake was higher than maize ls with 250 kg n ha 1 table 4 for alfalfa all farmers applied on average an amount of 42 kg n ha 1 in april 64 of farmers applied a first side dress application in june 44 kg n ha 1 only in 2015 some farmers applied a second dress nf 92 kg n ha 1 in july prior studies have concluded that maize n fertilization rates in those systems are applied in the order of 300 450 kg n ha 1 sisquella et al 2004 isidoro et al 2006 sorando et al 2019 in other region of spain juan valero et al 2005 reported that maize n fertilization rate is usually up to 300 kg ha 1 under sprinkler irrigation system the 2 years average wheat n fertilization was 193 kg n ha 1 with significant differences between the 2015s and 2016s all farmers applied pre plant 30 kg n ha 1 and first side dress 98 kg n ha 1 in december and february respectively in addition the obtained average n uptake value 206 kg n ha 1 was similar to the n fertilization applied table 4 the nf applied for barley was 315 kg n ha 1 in the 2015s and decreased to 187 kg n ha 1 in the 2016s due to manure applications that accounted for 0 of the total nf applied in the 2015s in the same year 34 and 9 of farmers applied second side dress and third side dress respectively as on average the total n fertilization applied by farmers 251 kg n ha 1 was more than double the amount of the measured total crop n uptake 101 kg n ha 1 during the same period the average nf applied to sunflower was 110 kg n ha 1 82 kg n ha 1 in the 2015s and 139 kg n ha 1 in the 2016s while measured total crop n uptake was 157 kg n ha 1 on average table 3 and 4 in general an over fertilization was identified in the vid for maize ls maize ss barley and alfalfa with a total average fertilization amount of 628 or 427 if including organic fertilization or not 419 251 and 175 kg n ha 1 respectively in the case of wheat and sunflower the n doses were more adequate with a total average fertilization amount of 193 and 140 kg n ha 1 respectively consequently the nupe was below one for maize ls 0 3 and barley 0 4 while for maize ss the nupe was 0 8 indicating avoidable nutrient losses table 4 nevertheless the nupe for wheat and sunflower were 1 1 and 1 9 respectively barros et al 2012 also reported an over fertilization in particular for maize in the same area the n fertilizer amount was 426 kg n ha 1in 1995 1998 period before irrigation district modernization and 332 kg n ha 1 in 2006 2008 after transformation to pressurized system in addition malik et al 2019 indicated that the average of maize n fertilizer amount was 390 kg ha 1 in alconadre irrigation district a sprinkler irrigation area located in huesca spain 3 2 nitrogen fertilization scenarios effect on n leaching residual n and nitrous oxide 3 2 1 grain yields and n uptake modelled the simulated crop yield resulting under the different management scenarios considered current n fertilization applied by farmers recommended n fertilization and combined adjusted irrigation and recommended n fertilization of maize ls maize ss wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa and both study years 2015 and 2016 are presented in figs 2 and 3 considering both crop seasons and averaging all soil types results indicate that for all considered crops there was no significant difference in crop production between the recommended n fertilization and the current fertilization rate applied by local farmers in the vid for maize ls the average crop yield simulated was 12 542 12 520 and 12 709 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization adjusted fertilization and the combined recommended irrigation and n fertilization management respectively these values of crop yield are very common in the ebro valley conditions in the same way the same simulated averages of total n uptake amounts were obtained under the current fertilization 262 kg n ha 1 the recommended fertilization 253 kg n ha 1 and the combined irrigation and fertilization managements 257 kg n ha 1 these simulated values are very similar to that recommended by isla et al 2008 250 kg n ha 1 furthermore the nue was always similar for the recommended fertilization and the combined management 50 kg kg 1 n and higher than the current fertilization practices 30 kg kg 1 n likewise the simulated mean crop yield of maize ss was similar under the adjusted n fertilization 14 726 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization rate 14 731 kg ha 1 and under the combined scenarios 14 697 kg ha 1 on the other hand considering both crop seasons and averaging all soil types the simulated plant n uptake under the current fertilization was slightly higher 306 kg n ha 1 than under both adjusted fertilization 283 kg n ha 1 and combined management 292 kg n ha 1 this higher amount of n uptake under the current fertilization could be explained by the contrasting potential soil n supply with crop n demand as there was n excess with both n fertilization managements n uptake is greater than the model critical threshold n a phenomenon of luxury n consumption was identified for that reason under non n stress condition the n uptake is higher with the current n fertilization for both maize ls and maize ss consequently the nue was similar under the recommended n fertilization and the combined irrigation and n management with 58 kg kg 1 n higher than under the current n fertilization 37 kg kg 1 n in similar conditions malik et al 2019 reported similar nue tendency and values for maize in another irrigated region montañana and almudévar northeast spain in which the nue was 56 kg grain kg 1 n and 36 kg grain kg 1 n for adjusted n fertilization and traditional management respectively in the case of wheat the simulated mean grain yield was higher under the combined irrigation and n fertilization 9244 kg ha 1 than under the recommended fertilization 9147 kg ha 1 and the current fertilization practices 8590 kg ha 1 nevertheless averaging all soils and years the simulated n uptake was slightly higher under the recommended fertilization 206 kg n ha 1 than the current n fertilization with 192 kg n ha 1 these values are similar to the measured value 206 kg n ha 1 therefore the model is accurate in simulating wheat n uptake in addition the current fertilization management data indicated that farmers adequately apply n fertilization rates for wheat crop in the vid table 4 this suggests that most nf applied was taken up by plants and little n fertilizer was left in the soil for other processes like leaching nonetheless the n fertilization timing of the recommended fertilization practices can increase crop yield by 7 without significant differences in leached n and residual n in soil on average nue varied from 41 to 48 kg kg n 1 under the three different managements the highest value was under the combined irrigation and n fertilization scenario in the case of barley the average crop yield was 8637 and 8512 kg ha 1 with the current n fertilization rate and recommended n fertilization respectively similar to the other crops the highest grain yield was observed under the combined irrigation and n fertilization management with 9121 kg ha 1 no significant differences in barley n uptake was observed under the different nf management current n fertilization 217 kg n ha 1 recommended n fertilization 201 kg n ha 1 and combined management 209 kg n ha 1 the nue was double under the recommended n fertilization and combined management 54 kg kg n 1 comparing with the current fertilization 27 kg kg n 1 for sunflower the average grain yield was 4136 and 4154 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization and recommended fertilization respectively nonetheless in 2016 the grain yield was lower under the current fertilization fig 2 averaging all soils the sunflower grain yield was 2505 and 4284 kg ha 1 under the current and recommended fertilization respectively on average recommended n fertilization could improve nue by 25 and 107 for 2015 and 2016 respectively several reasons may explain the grain yield differences between 2015 and 2016 on the one hand the current n fertilization in 2016 was splitted in two while in 2015 n fertilization was applied at one time although in lower n fertilization amount on the other hand the model detected an excess water stress in some soils especially in c2 a4 and c1 that could have resulted in relativereduction in crop yields the results of alfalfa show that there was no difference in harvested alfalfa dry matter between the recommended n fertilization 15 748 kg ha 1 and the current fertilization rate 15 754 kg ha 1 among all soils fig 3 however under the combined recommended irrigation and n fertilization management the harvested dry matter was higher with 18 031 kg ha 1 therefore the nue was 250 kg kg n 1 under the current n fertilization and more than double under the recommended n fertilization 525 kg kg n 1 and the combined irrigation and n management 601 kg kg n 1 3 2 2 no3 n losses by leaching as expected for both maize ls and maize ss no3 n leaching was always higher among the different soil types under the current n fertilization than under the recommended n fertilization and the combined recommended irrigation and n management fig 4 averaging all soil types and cropping seasons for maize ls the recommended n fertilization could reduce no3 n losses by 40 compared to the current n fertilization this reduction increased to 79 under the combined recommended irrigation and n management this effect was more pronounced in 2015 when the average of leached no3 n was reduced from 101 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization to 5 kg n ha 1 under combined optimum management in addition under the current n practices and averaging both cropping seasons no3 n losses were more pronounced in a4 d4 and b6 soils shallow and or with high permeability soils with an average of 119 kg n ha 1 these high no3 n losses could be reduced to 67 kg n ha 1 under the recommended n fertilization and to 14 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management similar amounts of n leaching for maize in a sandy soil were obtained by he et al 2012 who reported that the amount of n leaching increased from 82 to 266 kg n ha 1 when the n application level increased from 196 to 561 kg n ha 1 conversely in the soils characterized by low permeability such as e2 c1 c2 c3 and d5 no3 n losses were lower 24 kg n ha 1 compared with the shallow and or high permeability soils in this soil category leached no3 n could be reduced to 11 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization and to 1 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management likewise model simulation results for maize ss show similar tendency as for maize ls compared to the current n practices and averaging all soil types in both cropping seasons no3 n losses could be reduced by 59 under the recommended n fertilization and by 96 under the combined irrigation and n management malik et al 2019 reported similar results where the adjusted irrigation under mediterranean conditions could reduce the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction in maize grain yield regarding soil types no3 n losses were more pronounced in shallow and or with high permeability soils a4 d4 and b6 soils with an average of 94 kg n ha 1 this no3 n loss in these soils could be reduced to 39 kg n ha 1 under the recommended n fertilization and to 4 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management conversely in the soils characterized by low permeability such as e2 c1 c2 c3 and d5 soils no3 n losses were lower compared with the other soil group under the current n fertilization 12 kg n ha 1 recommended n fertilization could also reduce no3 n losses to 11 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization and completely reduce it under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management for this same soil category for wheat as well as barley the leached no3 n did not exceed 12 kg n ha 1 over soil types and n fertilization scenarios averaging all soil types and both study years the leached no3 n was 5 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization for both winter crops becausethe current n fertilization rate was similar to crop n requirements consequently most nf amount applied by farmers was taken up by plants and there was little nf left in the soil for other processes like n leaching no3 n losses amounts were higher for both crops under the recommended n fertilization and the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization 6 kg n ha 1 than under current fertilization practices schroder et al 1998 and sexton et al 1996 reported that applying nf at a rate less than optimal and or using a variable deficit irrigation scheduling regime can reduce no3 n leaching for both crops no3 n leaching was relatively higher in shallow and or with high permeability soils b6 a4 and d4 soils in the case of sunflower and considering both cropping seasons the leached no3 n was more pronounced in shallow and or high permeability soils a4 d4 and b6 with an average of 66 kg n ha 1 while an average of 5 kg n ha 1 was calculated for the remaining low permeability soils under the same current n fertilization management the leached no3 n amounts were similar under both recommended and current n fertilization scenarios since the n amounts applied under both n fertilization managements were also similar 110 vs 82 kg ha 1 under current and recommend n fertilization respectively nonetheless leached no3 n during 2016 crop season was lower than that obtained during the previous crop season due to the difference in n applicationsunder the current n fertilization in fact as previously mentioned the current n application in 2016 was splitted in two applications while one application was simulated in 2015 crop season consequently this difference in n fertilization timing may explain the different results between 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons furthermore the effect of the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization was more pronounced in 2015 when no3 n leaching could be reduced by 67 with respect to the current fertilization this reduction is mainly due to the optimum irrigation effect since the n fertilization management was similar under both current n practices and combined irrigation and n management finally for alfalfa crop there was no differences in no3 n losses averaging all soils and both study years between the current n fertilization and the recommended n fertilization fig 3 in addition the no3 n losses were negligible under both managements 0 3 kg ha 1 however under the combined irrigation and n management the no3 n loss was absent for all soil types considering these results there were no direct environmental impact due to no3 n losses however applying the recommended n fertilization 33 of the current nf rate could be saved which could be economically beneficial to farmers profit 3 2 3 residual no3 n in soil for maize ls the average of residual no3 n in soil among all soils and years was 200 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization management while under the recommended n rate was 68 kg n ha 1 however under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization management the average of residual no3 n was slightly higher 74 kg n ha 1 than the recommended n fertilization among the different soil types the residual no3 n was higher under the current fertilization for both seasons especially in d5 soil fig 5 this residual n is prone to leach during the intercrop period october april and at the start of the following maize growing season when the crop n uptake is low and maize roots are not deep in the soil profile thus excessive fertilizer n is often applied and large amounts of residual n are left in the soil at crop harvest which is in concordance with villar mir et al 2002 the recommended n fertilization could reduce the residual n by 65 and 82 in 2015 and 2016 respectively for maize ss the residual no3 n in soil under the adjusted fertilization ranged between 16 and 57 kg n ha 1 in 2015 meanwhile the residual no3 n in soil under the current farmers n fertilization ranged between 56 kg n ha 1 d4 soil and 168 kg n ha 1 d5 soil during the same period similar trends were observed in 2016 when the residual no3 n in soils ranged between 51 kg n ha 1 d4 soil and 140 kg n ha 1 d5 soil however under the combined irrigation and n management the highest residual n in soil was observed in b6 with 68 kg n ha 1 and 56 kg n ha 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively averaging across soil types and years the recommended n fertilization rate could reduce the simulated residual no3 n by 74 compared to the current n fertilization this reduction increased to 80 under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization for wheat in both study years the residual no3 n in soil was slightly lower under the recommended fertilization than the current fertilization among the different soils averaging all soils and years the difference between in residual no3 n in the soil was negligible under the current and recommended n fertilization practices in both seasons fig 5 nevertheless the combined irrigation and recommended n fertilization management could reduce the residual n in soil by 59 averaging all soils and years in the same way for barley averaging all soils and both years the residual no3 n in soil could be reduced by 51 and 44 under the recommended n fertilization rates and the combined irrigation and n fertilization management compared to the current n fertilization respectively for sunflower the residual no3 n in soil averaging all soils types in both crop seasons was 45 kg n ha 1 31 kg n ha 1 and 17 kg n ha 1 under the current n fertilization recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and n recommended n fertilization respectively the residual no3 n in soil during 2015 was lower than that obtained in 2016 season due to the high no3 n losses that occurred in 2015 furthermore compared with the current n fertilization the residual no3 n in soil could be reduced by 30 and 62 under the recommended n fertilization and the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization respectively in the case of alfalfa the residual no3 n in soil was low with an average of 8 kg n ha 1 under both current n fertilization and recommended n fertilization managements considering all soil types fig 3 however under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization the residual no3 n in soil was slightly lower compared to the other n fertilization management with an average of 5 kg n ha 1 3 2 4 nitrous oxide n2o n emission the dssat model simulates the nitrous oxide n2o n emission one of the harmful greenhouse gases only for maize maize ls and maize ss and alfalfa results show that averaging all soil types and years for maize ls the n2o n emission was higher 0 7 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization than with the recommended fertilization 0 5 kg n ha 1 the lowest n2o n value was observed under the combined recommended management with 0 4 kg n ha 1 the n2o n emission was pronounced in a4 d4 b6 and c3 soils where nitrate lixiviation was high fig 6 for maize ss the average of n2o n emission under the current fertilization management was also higher 0 83 kg n ha 1 than under the recommended fertilization rate 0 66 kg n ha 1 the lowest n2o n emission average was obtained under the combined irrigation and recommended n fertilization with 0 26 kg n ha 1 in the case of alfalfa crop n2o n emission was the same under the recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and n management 0 11 kg n ha 1 and slightly higher under the current n fertilization 0 12 kg n ha 1 fig 3 3 3 general impact in the vid 3 3 1 nitrate leaching the total no3 n losses estimated under the current management practices are 122 mg average of two crop seasons summing all the no3 n losses of the cultivated crops in the whole vid this value corresponds to more than one sixth of the total n fertilization applied on average among all vid soil types and crops 810 mg of both mineral and organic n fertilization on average about 61 mg 51 of total no3 n losses can be saved under the recommended n fertilization rate while 105 mg 86 of total no3 n losses can be saved under the combined optimal irrigation and n fertilization regardless soil types and considering only crops during the two seasons maize ls and maize ss showed the highest total no3 n losses 93 2 mg for both maize vs 20 5 mg for the remaining crops and the most important tendency to reduce no3 n losses when recommended nf and the combined optimal management were considered fig 7 a from the total leached no3 n by all maize ls plots 71 mg about 67 0 mg of leached no3 n could be saved on average 65 of the total leached n reduction in the whole vid area under optimal irrigation and fertilization in the case of maize ss that presents 29 4 mg of no3 n losses under current practices the reduction of leached no3 n amount under the recommended nf and the combined optimal management was 17 1 and 28 5 mg respectively therefore about 27 of the total amount of leached no3 n could be saved on average in the whole vid area when combined optimal irrigation and n fertilization scenario was considered for maize ss this means that if farmers adopt both optimal fertilization and irrigation management for maize crop up to 92 of leached no3 n could be reduced in the study area on average for sunflower the total amount of no3 n losses decreased by 0 1 0 07 mg when recommended n rate was considered and 8 8 mg under the combined optimal management nevertheless different behavior was obtained for wheat and barley where the leached no3 n was increased by 0 1 of the total no3 n in the whole vid area under both practices recommended n rates and combined optimal management comparing to the current n fertilization owing to reduced n fertilization applied by farmers crops however for alfalfa the total of the amount of no3 n leached under current management practice 0 37 mg could be reduced when optimal irrigation and fertilization were considered together fig 8 a represents the spatial distribution of no3 n losses under the different scenarios considered current irrigation and n fertilization current irrigation and recommended n fertilization and optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization results indicate that under current management practices a great variation of no3 n losses was observed with very high values especially in b6 soil type about 35 9 mg the soil types a4 and d4 also presented high no3 n losses in comparison with the rest of the soils 18 6 mg and 14 9 mg respectively when optimal irrigation and fertilization was considered the no3 n amount losses decrease considerably in the whole vid area in this case the leached no3 n values varied from 0 0 mg soil d5 to 5 0 mg soil a4 under the cropping distribution and current fertilization in the vid of the considered year the maximum no3 n losses per unit area were reached in b6 112 kg no3 n ha 1 a1 109 kg no3 n ha 1 a3 65 kg no3 n ha 1 a6 61 kg no3 n ha 1 d3 55 kg no3 n ha 1 d4 51 kg no3 n ha 1 and a4 41 kg no3 n ha 1 so under the two years cropping system in the vid those soils can be considered as the most vulnerable soils in the remaining soils values ranged from 3 3 kg no3 n ha 1 d5 soil to 22 kg no3 n ha 1 d2 soil 3 3 2 residual n in soil the dssat simulation results under the current fertilization show that the maize ls followed by maize ss are the main crops with the highest residual n amounts with 202 and 52 mg considering all the cultivated area respectively however both crops presented the highest reduction percentage of residual n in soil under optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization management the total residual n in soil reduction was 76 7 for maize ls and 20 7 for maize ss respectively about 146 5 mg for maize ls and 39 6 mg for maize ss could be reduced under the combined irrigation and n management practices fig 7b fig 8b that presents the total reduction distribution of such variable under the current irrigation and n fertilization current irrigation and recommended n fertilization and optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization indicate a high variability between soil types and practices according to the model under the cropping distribution and current fertilization in the vid of the considered years the maximum residual n per unit area reached highest values of 161 and 108 kg n ha 1 in a1 and d3 soils respectively those high values represent a risk for n losses especially during the intercrop period martínez et al 2015 reported high values of residual n in soil 0 9 m depth before maize sowing reaching 218 kg n ha 1 under similar conditions in addition de haan et al 2017 reported an average residual no3 n content in the soil 1 80 m depth of about 134 kg ha 1 for continuous maize with a cereal rye cover crop in the remaining soils residual n values ranged from 96 kg n ha 1 a6 soil to 44 kg n ha 1 d2 soil compared to the current n fertilization the recommended n management could reduce residual n in soil by 58 while with the combined optimal management it could be reduced by 61 in agreement with these results dssat simulations indicated that the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n management was more effective in reducing n losses than soil residual n dssat simulations identified that under the combined recommended irrigation and n management the c2 20 4 e2 19 and d4 12 4 are the soils with the highest reduction percentage considering the total residual n reduction in the vid this is very relevant because they were mainly cultivated to maize ls and maize ss highly over fertilized crop by local farmers effectively the model simulations show that under the current fertilization maize ls followed by maize ss are the crops with the highest residual n with 202 4 and 52 2 mg respectively however both crops represent the highest reduction percentage of residual n in soil considering the total reduction in the vid with 76 7 and 20 7 for maize ls and maize ss respectively 3 3 3 nitrous oxide emissions in the same way the n2o n emissions were calculated in the whole vid using the methodology applied for no3 n losses by leaching and n soil residual fig 8c only results corresponding to maize ls maize ss and alfalfa crops were considered because the othermodules of the dssat model do not include such variable under current n fertilization the total n2o n emission was 1640 kg n average of two crop seasons this amount could be reduced by 19 under the recommended n fertilization and by 60 under the combined irrigation and n fertilization management in terms of soils the b6 soil type produces the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the vid with 622 kg of n2o n emission however this value could be highly decreased under the combined irrigation and n management by 214 kg in addition b6 and c3 soils presented more than 100 kg of n2o n emission reduction from the current to the combined irrigation and n management practice alfalfa crop contributed by 0 7 to the total n2o n emission reduction the remaining reductions were 64 1 and 35 2 for maize ls and maize ss respectively however the amount of simulated n2o n emission should be carefully interpreted because of multiple sources of model uncertainty and therefore calibration of n2o fluxes against measured data would be important 4 conclusion the dssat model calibrated and validated in the semiarid intensively irrigated area of vid was used as a tool to explore possible irrigation and n fertilization best management practices for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa this study clearly demonstrated that applying the right n amount required by the crop and optimizing the timing of n application could result in an economic gain for farmers because of a significant reduction of n fertilization requirement additionally the n losses could be reduced substantially through the efficient use of the irrigation water and n management practices together in general results indicate that the no3 n losses below the root zone were affected by crop type soil type and the current management practices used in the vid farms on soils with low water holding properties as a4 and d4 soils or with shallow depths as b6 soils should be targeted to improve their management in order to minimize no3 n leaching to drainage waters in terms of crops the maize both maize ls and maize ss followed by sunflower were responsible for most of the no3 n losses below the root zone current n application rates exceeded actual crop requirements more than 50 for maize resulting in high no3 n leaching during the cropping season for alfalfa the current n management could be considered acceptable as there was no potential improvement on no3 n losses residual no3 n in soil and n2o n emission when the recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization were considered for maize the recommended n fertilization management could reduce no3 n losses by 51 of the total losses under the current fertilization for the whole area while maintaining high crop yields moreover this reduction could be increased by 35 under the combined optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization management regarding the residual n in soil the model showed that the recommended n fertilization could reduce residual n in soil by 58 while the combined irrigation and n management could reduce it up to 61 considering all the cultivated area in the vid moreover the recommended irrigation and n fertilization could reduce n2o n emissions by 60 the triple than under the recommended n fertilization this study supports the potential of the dssat model to incentivize farmers to adjust their nf and irrigation practices to crop requirements and soil properties to ensure high production while improving the economic and environmental sustainability of the intensive irrigated agriculture systems also this result can be considered as a starting point for future work to provide useful guidelines and rules in order to limit the n pollution additional strategies of n and water optimization should be considered that could help to manage the spatial and temporal variability of n losses and their impact on water quality at the integral hydrologic system scale this information will be important for farm decision making and environmental policies acknowledgements this work was funded by the ministry of economy

10741,in intensive agricultural systems irrigation and nitrogen n fertilizer are the most important factors that influence crop production and n losses this work aimed to evaluate the n best management practices using the calibrated and validated decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat model for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa in the violada irrigation district vid northeast spain to reduce the impact of n losses on irrigation return flows quality in total 59 farmers field plots were investigated from 2014 to 2017 crop seasons distributed in the different soil types in the vid in order to assess the current and optimum n fertilization and the combined irrigation and n fertilization management practices considering the whole cultivated crop area in each soil type of the vid and comparing with the current n fertilization results showed that the optimum n management could reduce the no3 n leaching below root zone by 51 and residual no3 n in soil by 58 these reductions could be improved further by 35 and 3 respectively under the combined n fertilization and irrigation optimum management the more vulnerable soils for no3 n leaching shallow and or very permeable soils were also identified as for the impact of individual crops the model identified that both long and short season maize were the most polluting crops 84 of total n leached due to the heavy fertilization applied by the local farmers that exceed crop requirements by more than 50 moreover the recommended irrigation and n fertilization could reduce n2o n emissions by 60 the triple than under the recommended n fertilization alone this study supports the potential of the dssat model to incentivize farmers to adjust their n fertilizer and irrigation

quemada et al 2013 and planting patterns plaza bonilla et al 2015 are responsible for affecting nitrate leaching controlling no3 n leaching in irrigated areas can be a challenge for farmers because it requires simultaneous management of two essentials of plant growth which are nf and irrigation water quantification of the interactive effects of n and water on no3 n loss provides an important

in addition malik and dechmi 2019 reported good dssat model performance for maize wheat barley and sunflower calibrated using data from field experiments performed in farmer s plots and under their current management practices crop calibration results under real field conditions are more accurate and reliable than experimental plots especially when up scaling to regional and national spatial scales applications in the majority of european member states the agricultural sector contributes over 50 of the total no3 n leaching to surface and groundwater d haene et al 2014 in spain several studies revealed that excessive fertilizer n is often applied especially for maize 318 453 kg ha 1 yr 1 to avoid risks of yield losses cavero et al 2003 isidoro et al 2006 and large amounts of residual n are left in the soil at crop harvest villar mir et al 2002 more recently jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 reported that because of the intensive and excessive fertilization practices the irrigation return flows in sprinkler irrigated areas carry huge amounts of nitrate reaching 150 kg no3 n ha 1 year 1 and frequently exceed the no3 n concentration threshold limit of 50 mg l 1 established by the european union eu 2000 the recent transformation of over 1 000 000 ha in spain from traditional surface irrigation to pressurized systems opens the door for the intensification of irrigated agriculture higher cropping intensity and introduction of new crops with higher added value that come along with the ongoing increase in animal farming particularly pig farms all these issues entail an advancement in the quality of life of farmers thus contributing to the economic sustainability of irrigated agriculture but they may pose a threat to its environmental sustainability malik and dechmi 2019 reported that optimizing irrigation management alone cannot effectively reduce n leaching in intensive irrigated areas and they highlighted the importance to optimize both n fertilizer and irrigation management simultaneously for potentially reducing nutrient losses and increasing resource efficiency in such areas furthermore this research aimed to evaluate the current and best nf management practices using dssat model for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa under semiarid condition to reduce n losses impact on irrigation return flows quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description and field experiments the violada irrigation district vid located in the ebro river basin northeast spain was considered as the representative semiarid study area in this work the vid belongs to alto aragon irrigation scheme area with a total cultivated area of 5324 ha fig 1 the vid is characterized by mediterranean semiarid climate with annual average maximum and minimum daily air temperatures of 27 and 1 4 c respectively the annual average precipitation is 325 mm and the annual average reference evapotranspiration is 1227 mm meteorological data corresponding to the study period are summarized in table 1 five soil taxonomy subgroups were defined considering the soil survey staff 2014 classification typic calcixerept hereafter designated as a petrocalcic calcixerept hereafter designated as b gypsic haploxerept hereafter designated as c typic xerorthent hereafter designated as d and typic xerofluvent

designated as 3 coarse loamy hereafter designated as 4 loamy shallow soils hereafter designated as 5 and loamy skeletal hereafter designated as 6 the prevalent family was fine silty followed by the coarse loamy the texture of the soils in vid was generally fine and high in silt particularly in the deeper horizons horizon b had around 60 of silt on 77 of the vid surface in total the soils in the vid were classified into 13 soil units considering these two criteria where the more extended representative soil units are typic xerofluvent fine silty 955 ha 18 of the total study area and gypsic haploxerept fine silty 946 ha 18 more details about soils characteristics are presented in jiménez aguirre et al 2018 92 of the study area is characterized by remotely controlled sprinkler irrigation systems spacing of 18 m 18 m while only 8 is still under traditional surface irrigation the irrigation season starts at the beginning of march and ends mid october the main irrigated crops during the study years from 2014 to 2015 to 2016 2017 cropping season were maize 36 6 of total area both long season hereafter designated as maize ls and short season hereafter designated as maize ss alfalfa 25 wheat and barley 18 and sunflower 9 on average these main crops represented 88 5 of cultivated areas in the vid during the considered period the high cropping intensity system was pronounced by the double cropping pattern cultivated after winter crops mainly maize and sunflower for instance from 2015 to 2016 the cultivated area increased from 15 to 20 and from 7 to 11 for maize ss and sunflower respectively a total of 59 farmer s field experiments were selected from 2014 to 2015 to 2016 2017 crop seasons in the vid for the main crops maize ls n 14 maize ss n 8 barley n 14 wheat n 6 sunflower n 10 and alfalfa n 7 the field plots selection aimed to represent a maximum spatial combination between the different soil types and crops in the vid during the study years in addition farmers collaboration for the needed soil sampling crop growth monitoring and measurements at their fields was a determinant factor in this selection 2 2 model description and input data the dssat model

malik et al 2018 the dssat model demonstrated good fit between simulated and observed mean crop yields obtained during the calibration and validation processes of maize wheat barley and sunflower crops malik and dechmi 2019 for maize ls and maize ss the normalized root mean square error nrmse for calibration and validation was lower than 8 for phenological parameters anthesis and physiological

all the plots by 0 3 m soil layer depths up to 1 20 m when possible in addition the soil was sampled at the beginning and harvest for each crop season to determine the soil n available form no3 n using colorimetric method organic matter by walkley black method and ph table 2 summarizes the average values of the different plots soil characteristics used in this study soils a4 d4 and b6 are grouped as shallow and or with high permeability 25 of total area while the remaining soil types are grouped as low permeability soils 65 of total area common fertilization management practices were determined through interviews performed with local farmers of the study area including the considered plots used for model simulations in total 75 and 71 interviews were performed during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 crop seasons respectively farmers were asked about the type of nf applied including manure the amounts per unit area and application dates sowing date and density and crop yield at harvest yield sampling of 1 m2 with two repetitions was randomly conducted to determine the grain yield and vegetative biomass for each different crop then a subsamples of grain yield and vegetative biomass were weighed and dried at 60 c to determine the moisture content once dried the subsample was grinded and analyzed to determine the n uptake by combustion truspec cn leco st joseph mi usa for both yield components the irrigation management data date and dose of each irrigation event applied in each plot was provided by the almudévar water user association for each corresponding plot using the remote database registration 2 3 evaluation of management practices scenarios the focus of the management practices in this study was on the cultural practices that most directly affect the n cycle and yield production which are irrigation and nf application for each crop and soil type of the considered plots the model was run considering two fertilization approaches during 2016 for alfalfa and during 2015 and 2016 for the others crops the first n fertilization approach considered was the current fertilization management determined from the local farmers surveys the second n fertilization approach was the recommended n fertilization management determined from the literature for each crop both simulations were performed considering the current farmers irrigation management of each crop and year then a simultaneously combined management of optimal irrigation and recommended n application were conducted as a best management practice bmp for each crop in different soil types in the vid the current farmers irrigation scheduling were obtained from the almudévar water user association for each corresponding plot using the remote database registration while the optimal irrigation was determined by adjusting the irrigation doses and timing to each crop requirement using the automatic irrigation option included in the dssat model and considering a constant maximum soil allowable depletion mad value of 0 5 the farmers irrigation scheduling was detailed and analyzed in malik and dechmi 2019 for maize ls as well as maize ss an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was splitted as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting 100 kg ha 1 in the first sidedress vegetative stage v7 8 and 100 kg n ha 1 in the second sidedress silking stage r1 in the case of wheat and barley the n requirements are on average 30 kg n and 25 kg n per 1000 kg of grain produced respectively marm 2011 so the optimum rate was calculated based on the average yield obtained in the studied years per recommended rate per 1000 kg therefore the corresponding nf amounts were 192 and 198 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 160 and 165 kg n ha 1 for barley in 2015 and 2016 respectively for both crops a 90 kg n ha 1 was applied at sowing with urea and the remaining as a sidedress at stem elongation marm 2011 concerning sunflower the recommended dose is 35 kg n per 1000 kg of produced grain yield thus the total nf amount applied was 98 and 77 kg n ha 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively splitted as 50 at sowing and 50 at vegetative stage v10 marm 2011 concerning alfalfa a 30 kg n ha 1 was applied at sowing to favor establishment in the pre nodulation phase once it has been established alfalfa does not need application of nitrogenous fertilizers marm 2011 for all scenario cases of each considered crop common vid farmers cultural practices were used and eight different soil types e2 d5 d4 c3 c2 c1 b6 and a4 covering 93 of the vid were considered two parameters were used to evaluate n management practices in the vid 1 n uptake efficiency nupe expressed as the ratio between above ground n at harvest n uptake and the nf amount applied per hectare a value close to one suggests that soil fertility will be sustained at a steady state while values well below one suggest avoidable nutrient losses also values greater than one must be regarded as unsustainable because more nutrients are removed with the harvested crop than applied by fertilizer and or manure this is a simplification of a complex process since nutrient removal by erosion leaching and gaseous emissions are not considered nevertheless this index provides qualitative information about the n available to the crops and the environmental impact in terms of n surplus the obtained nupe allows farmers to make comparisons among crops in the same environment and time and to decide which crop or which form of agronomic management is advisable 2 n use efficiency nue expressed as the ratio between crop grain yield and the fertilizer n amount applied per hectare kg kg 1 n for accessing the impact of the different scenarios at the whole vid area scale the total no3 n losses below the root zone in each soil was calculated by considering the tow cropping season average amount of the total no3 n losses simulated in each soil type and under each scenario for each cropping season the amount of total n leached in each soil type was calculated as the sum of the product between the total area of each crop within the considered soil type and the resulted no3 n losses per hectare as following n l e a c h e d i 1 6 x i y i where xi is the no3 n losses per hectare of the crop i and yi is the area in hectares of the crop i within the considered soil type the amount of total n leached in the vid was calculated as the sum of the n leached in all vid soils the same calculation was performed for residual n in soil and for n2o n emissions finally the geographic information system qgis v 2 18 was used to represent the spatial variability of n losses and residual n in soil depending on soil properties in the vid to determine the most affected soil under the different management practices 3 results

the main cultivated crops in the vid the information includes the mass of nf mean and in parenthesis standard deviation applied on each date and the average dates of each application results indicate that maize ls was the most heavily fertilized crop in both years 2 years average nf applied 402 kg n ha 1 as mineral fertilizer and 226 kg n ha 1 as manure while a recommended dose is 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2012 all farmers applied a mineral pre plant fertilization generally n p k complex in april and 97 of farmers applied a first side dress application in june urea 46 n or 32 n solution a second side dress was given by 67 of farmers and a third by 44 whereas only 11 of farmers performed a fourth side dress application table 3 these side dress applications were given as n32 manure generally pig slurry was applied only by 31 of farmers with an average nf total application of 628 kg n ha 1 only a third part of the total nf amount was taken up by the plant 207 kg n ha 1 relating to maize ss fertilization management was similar to maize ls with 419 kg n ha 1 averaging the two crop seasons except some farmers who did not apply any manure and or less application for third and fourth side dress 19 and 3 5 of farmers respectively in this case the total n uptake was higher than maize ls with 250 kg n ha 1 table 4 for alfalfa all farmers applied on average an amount of 42 kg n ha 1 in april 64 of farmers applied a first side dress application in june 44 kg n ha 1 only in 2015 some farmers applied a second dress nf 92 kg n ha 1 in july prior studies have concluded that maize n fertilization rates in those systems are applied in the order of 300 450 kg n ha 1 sisquella et al 2004 isidoro et al 2006 sorando et al 2019 in other region of spain juan valero et al 2005 reported that maize n fertilization rate is usually up to 300 kg ha 1 under sprinkler irrigation system the 2 years average wheat n fertilization was 193 kg n ha 1 with significant differences between the 2015s and 2016s all farmers applied pre plant 30 kg n ha 1 and first side dress 98 kg n ha 1 in december and february respectively in addition the obtained average n uptake value 206 kg n ha 1 was similar to the n fertilization applied table 4 the nf applied for barley was 315 kg n ha 1 in the 2015s and decreased to 187 kg n ha 1 in the 2016s due to manure applications that accounted for 0 of the total nf applied in the 2015s in the same year 34 and 9 of farmers applied second side dress and third side dress respectively as on average the total n fertilization applied by farmers 251 kg n ha 1 was more than double the amount of the measured total crop n uptake 101 kg n ha 1 during the same period the average nf applied to sunflower was 110 kg n ha 1 82 kg n ha 1 in the 2015s and 139 kg n ha 1 in the 2016s while measured total crop n uptake was 157 kg n ha 1 on average table 3 and 4 in general an over fertilization was identified in the vid for maize ls maize ss barley and alfalfa with a total average fertilization amount of 628 or 427 if including organic fertilization or not 419 251 and 175 kg n ha 1 respectively in the case of wheat and sunflower the n doses were more adequate with a total average fertilization amount of 193 and 140 kg n ha 1 respectively consequently the nupe was below one for maize ls 0 3 and barley 0 4 while for maize ss the nupe was 0 8 indicating avoidable nutrient losses table 4 nevertheless the nupe for wheat and sunflower were 1 1 and 1 9 respectively barros et al 2012 also reported an over fertilization in particular for maize in the same area the n fertilizer amount was 426 kg n ha 1in 1995 1998 period before irrigation district modernization and 332 kg n ha 1 in 2006 2008 after transformation to pressurized system in addition malik et al 2019 indicated that the average of maize n fertilizer amount was 390 kg ha 1 in alconadre irrigation district a sprinkler irrigation area located in huesca spain 3 2 nitrogen fertilization scenarios effect on n leaching residual n and nitrous oxide 3 2 1 grain yields and n uptake modelled the simulated crop yield resulting under the different management scenarios considered current n fertilization applied by farmers recommended n fertilization and combined adjusted irrigation and recommended n fertilization of maize ls maize ss wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa and both study years 2015 and 2016 are presented in figs 2 and 3 considering both crop seasons and averaging all soil types results indicate that for all considered crops there was no significant difference in crop production between the recommended n fertilization and the current fertilization rate applied by local farmers in the vid for maize ls the average crop yield simulated was 12 542 12 520 and 12 709 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization adjusted fertilization and the combined recommended irrigation and n fertilization management respectively these values of crop yield are very common in the ebro valley conditions in the same way the same simulated averages of total n uptake amounts were obtained under the current fertilization 262 kg n ha 1 the recommended fertilization 253 kg n ha 1 and the combined irrigation and fertilization managements 257 kg n ha 1 these simulated values are very similar to that recommended by isla et al 2008 250 kg n ha 1 furthermore the nue was always similar for the recommended fertilization and the combined management 50 kg kg 1 n and higher than the current fertilization practices 30 kg kg 1 n likewise the simulated mean crop yield of maize ss was similar under the adjusted n fertilization 14 726 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization rate 14 731 kg ha 1 and under the combined scenarios 14 697 kg ha 1 on the other hand considering both crop seasons and averaging all soil types the simulated plant n uptake under the current fertilization was slightly higher 306 kg n ha 1 than under both adjusted fertilization 283 kg n ha 1 and combined management 292 kg n ha 1 this higher amount of n uptake under the current fertilization could be explained by the contrasting potential soil n supply with crop n demand as there was n excess with both n fertilization managements n uptake is greater than the model critical threshold n a phenomenon of luxury n consumption was identified for that reason under non n stress condition the n uptake is higher with the current n fertilization for both maize ls and maize ss consequently the nue was similar under the recommended n fertilization and the combined irrigation and n management with 58 kg kg 1 n higher than under the current n fertilization 37 kg kg 1 n in similar conditions malik et al 2019 reported similar nue tendency and values for maize in another irrigated region montañana and almudévar northeast spain in which the nue was 56 kg grain kg 1 n and 36 kg grain kg 1 n for adjusted n fertilization and traditional management respectively in the case of wheat the simulated mean grain yield was higher under the combined irrigation and n fertilization 9244 kg ha 1 than under the recommended fertilization 9147 kg ha 1 and the current fertilization practices 8590 kg ha 1 nevertheless averaging all soils and years the simulated n uptake was slightly higher under the recommended fertilization 206 kg n ha 1 than the current n fertilization with 192 kg n ha 1 these values are similar to the measured value 206 kg n ha 1 therefore the model is accurate in simulating wheat n uptake in addition the current fertilization management data indicated that farmers adequately apply n fertilization rates for wheat crop in the vid table 4 this suggests that most nf applied was taken up by plants and little n fertilizer was left in the soil for other processes like leaching nonetheless the n fertilization timing of the recommended fertilization practices can increase crop yield by 7 without significant differences in leached n and residual n in soil on average nue varied from 41 to 48 kg kg n 1 under the three different managements the highest value was under the combined irrigation and n fertilization scenario in the case of barley the average crop yield was 8637 and 8512 kg ha 1 with the current n fertilization rate and recommended n fertilization respectively similar to the other crops the highest grain yield was observed under the combined irrigation and n fertilization management with 9121 kg ha 1 no significant differences in barley n uptake was observed under the different nf management current n fertilization 217 kg n ha 1 recommended n fertilization 201 kg n ha 1 and combined management 209 kg n ha 1 the nue was double under the recommended n fertilization and combined management 54 kg kg n 1 comparing with the current fertilization 27 kg kg n 1 for sunflower the average grain yield was 4136 and 4154 kg ha 1 under the current fertilization and recommended fertilization respectively nonetheless in 2016 the grain yield was lower under the current fertilization fig 2 averaging all soils the sunflower grain yield was 2505 and 4284 kg ha 1 under the current and recommended fertilization respectively on average recommended n fertilization could improve nue by 25 and 107 for 2015 and 2016 respectively several reasons may explain the grain yield differences between 2015 and 2016 on the one hand the current n fertilization in 2016 was splitted in two while in 2015 n fertilization was applied at one time although in lower n fertilization amount on the other hand the model detected an excess water stress in some soils especially in c2 a4 and c1 that could have resulted in relativereduction in crop yields the results of alfalfa show that there was no difference in harvested alfalfa dry matter between the recommended n fertilization 15 748 kg ha 1 and the current fertilization rate 15 754 kg ha 1 among all soils fig 3 however under the combined recommended irrigation and n fertilization management the harvested dry matter was higher with 18 031 kg ha 1 therefore the nue was 250 kg kg n 1 under the current n fertilization and more than double under the recommended n fertilization 525 kg kg n 1 and the combined irrigation and n management 601 kg kg n 1 3 2 2 no3 n losses by leaching as expected for both maize ls and maize ss no3 n leaching was always higher among the different soil types under the current n fertilization than under the recommended n fertilization and the combined recommended irrigation and n management fig 4 averaging all soil types and cropping seasons for maize ls the recommended n fertilization could reduce no3 n losses by 40 compared to the current n fertilization this reduction increased to 79 under the combined recommended irrigation and n management this effect was more pronounced in 2015 when the average of leached no3 n was reduced from 101 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization to 5 kg n ha 1 under combined optimum management in addition under the current n practices and averaging both cropping seasons no3 n losses were more pronounced in a4 d4 and b6 soils shallow and or with high permeability soils with an average of 119 kg n ha 1 these high no3 n losses could be reduced to 67 kg n ha 1 under the recommended n fertilization and to 14 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management similar amounts of n leaching for maize in a sandy soil were obtained by he et al 2012 who reported that the amount of n leaching increased from 82 to 266 kg n ha 1 when the n application level increased from 196 to 561 kg n ha 1 conversely in the soils characterized by low permeability such as e2 c1 c2 c3 and d5 no3 n losses were lower 24 kg n ha 1 compared with the shallow and or high permeability soils in this soil category leached no3 n could be reduced to 11 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization and to 1 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management likewise model simulation results for maize ss show similar tendency as for maize ls compared to the current n practices and averaging all soil types in both cropping seasons no3 n losses could be reduced by 59 under the recommended n fertilization and by 96 under the combined irrigation and n management malik et al 2019 reported similar results where the adjusted irrigation under mediterranean conditions could reduce the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction in maize grain yield regarding soil types no3 n losses were more pronounced in shallow and or with high permeability soils a4 d4 and b6 soils with an average of 94 kg n ha 1 this no3 n loss in these soils could be reduced to 39 kg n ha 1 under the recommended n fertilization and to 4 kg n ha 1 under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management conversely in the soils characterized by low permeability such as e2 c1 c2 c3 and d5 soils no3 n losses were lower compared with the other soil group under the current n fertilization 12 kg n ha 1 recommended n fertilization could also reduce no3 n losses to 11 kg n ha 1 under recommended n fertilization and completely reduce it under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization management for this same soil category for wheat as well as barley the leached no3 n did not exceed 12 kg n ha 1 over soil types and n fertilization scenarios averaging all soil types and both study years the leached no3 n was 5 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization for both winter crops becausethe current n fertilization rate was similar to crop n requirements consequently most nf amount applied by farmers was taken up by plants and there was little nf left in the soil for other processes like n leaching no3 n losses amounts were higher for both crops under the recommended n fertilization and the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization 6 kg n ha 1 than under current fertilization practices schroder et al 1998 and sexton et al 1996 reported that applying nf at a rate less than optimal and or using a variable deficit irrigation scheduling regime can reduce no3 n leaching for both crops no3 n leaching was relatively higher in shallow and or with high permeability soils b6 a4 and d4 soils in the case of sunflower and considering both cropping seasons the leached no3 n was more pronounced in shallow and or high permeability soils a4 d4 and b6 with an average of 66 kg n ha 1 while an average of 5 kg n ha 1 was calculated for the remaining low permeability soils under the same current n fertilization management the leached no3 n amounts were similar under both recommended and current n fertilization scenarios since the n amounts applied under both n fertilization managements were also similar 110 vs 82 kg ha 1 under current and recommend n fertilization respectively nonetheless leached no3 n during 2016 crop season was lower than that obtained during the previous crop season due to the difference in n applicationsunder the current n fertilization in fact as previously mentioned the current n application in 2016 was splitted in two applications while one application was simulated in 2015 crop season consequently this difference in n fertilization timing may explain the different results between 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons furthermore the effect of the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization was more pronounced in 2015 when no3 n leaching could be reduced by 67 with respect to the current fertilization this reduction is mainly due to the optimum irrigation effect since the n fertilization management was similar under both current n practices and combined irrigation and n management finally for alfalfa crop there was no differences in no3 n losses averaging all soils and both study years between the current n fertilization and the recommended n fertilization fig 3 in addition the no3 n losses were negligible under both managements 0 3 kg ha 1 however under the combined irrigation and n management the no3 n loss was absent for all soil types considering these results there were no direct environmental impact due to no3 n losses however applying the recommended n fertilization 33 of the current nf rate could be saved which could be economically beneficial to farmers profit 3 2 3 residual no3 n in soil for maize ls the average of residual no3 n in soil among all soils and years was 200 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization management while under the recommended n rate was 68 kg n ha 1 however under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization management the average of residual no3 n was slightly higher 74 kg n ha 1 than the recommended n fertilization among the different soil types the residual no3 n was higher under the current fertilization for both seasons especially in d5 soil fig 5 this residual n is prone to leach during the intercrop period october april and at the start of the following maize growing season when the crop n uptake is low and maize roots are not deep in the soil profile thus excessive fertilizer n is often applied and large amounts of residual n are left in the soil at crop harvest which is in concordance with villar mir et al 2002 the recommended n fertilization could reduce the residual n by 65 and 82 in 2015 and 2016 respectively for maize ss the residual no3 n in soil under the adjusted fertilization ranged between 16 and 57 kg n ha 1 in 2015 meanwhile the residual no3 n in soil under the current farmers n fertilization ranged between 56 kg n ha 1 d4 soil and 168 kg n ha 1 d5 soil during the same period similar trends were observed in 2016 when the residual no3 n in soils ranged between 51 kg n ha 1 d4 soil and 140 kg n ha 1 d5 soil however under the combined irrigation and n management the highest residual n in soil was observed in b6 with 68 kg n ha 1 and 56 kg n ha 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively averaging across soil types and years the recommended n fertilization rate could reduce the simulated residual no3 n by 74 compared to the current n fertilization this reduction increased to 80 under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization for wheat in both study years the residual no3 n in soil was slightly lower under the recommended fertilization than the current fertilization among the different soils averaging all soils and years the difference between in residual no3 n in the soil was negligible under the current and recommended n fertilization practices in both seasons fig 5 nevertheless the combined irrigation and recommended n fertilization management could reduce the residual n in soil by 59 averaging all soils and years in the same way for barley averaging all soils and both years the residual no3 n in soil could be reduced by 51 and 44 under the recommended n fertilization rates and the combined irrigation and n fertilization management compared to the current n fertilization respectively for sunflower the residual no3 n in soil averaging all soils types in both crop seasons was 45 kg n ha 1 31 kg n ha 1 and 17 kg n ha 1 under the current n fertilization recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and n recommended n fertilization respectively the residual no3 n in soil during 2015 was lower than that obtained in 2016 season due to the high no3 n losses that occurred in 2015 furthermore compared with the current n fertilization the residual no3 n in soil could be reduced by 30 and 62 under the recommended n fertilization and the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization respectively in the case of alfalfa the residual no3 n in soil was low with an average of 8 kg n ha 1 under both current n fertilization and recommended n fertilization managements considering all soil types fig 3 however under the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization the residual no3 n in soil was slightly lower compared to the other n fertilization management with an average of 5 kg n ha 1 3 2 4 nitrous oxide n2o n emission the dssat model simulates the nitrous oxide n2o n emission one of the harmful greenhouse gases only for maize maize ls and maize ss and alfalfa results show that averaging all soil types and years for maize ls the n2o n emission was higher 0 7 kg n ha 1 under the current fertilization than with the recommended fertilization 0 5 kg n ha 1 the lowest n2o n value was observed under the combined recommended management with 0 4 kg n ha 1 the n2o n emission was pronounced in a4 d4 b6 and c3 soils where nitrate lixiviation was high fig 6 for maize ss the average of n2o n emission under the current fertilization management was also higher 0 83 kg n ha 1 than under the recommended fertilization rate 0 66 kg n ha 1 the lowest n2o n emission average was obtained under the combined irrigation and recommended n fertilization with 0 26 kg n ha 1 in the case of alfalfa crop n2o n emission was the same under the recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and n management 0 11 kg n ha 1 and slightly higher under the current n fertilization 0 12 kg n ha 1 fig 3 3 3 general impact in the vid 3 3 1 nitrate leaching the total no3 n losses estimated under the current management practices are 122 mg average of two crop seasons summing all the no3 n losses of the cultivated crops in the whole vid this value corresponds to more than one sixth of the total n fertilization applied on average among all vid soil types and crops 810 mg of both mineral and organic n fertilization on average about 61 mg 51 of total no3 n losses can be saved under the recommended n fertilization rate while 105 mg 86 of total no3 n losses can be saved under the combined optimal irrigation and n fertilization regardless soil types and considering only crops during the two seasons maize ls and maize ss showed the highest total no3 n losses 93 2 mg for both maize vs 20 5 mg for the remaining crops and the most important tendency to reduce no3 n losses when recommended nf and the combined optimal management were considered fig 7 a from the total leached no3 n by all maize ls plots 71 mg about 67 0 mg of leached no3 n could be saved on average 65 of the total leached n reduction in the whole vid area under optimal irrigation and fertilization in the case of maize ss that presents 29 4 mg of no3 n losses under current practices the reduction of leached no3 n amount under the recommended nf and the combined optimal management was 17 1 and 28 5 mg respectively therefore about 27 of the total amount of leached no3 n could be saved on average in the whole vid area when combined optimal irrigation and n fertilization scenario was considered for maize ss this means that if farmers adopt both optimal fertilization and irrigation management for maize crop up to 92 of leached no3 n could be reduced in the study area on average for sunflower the total amount of no3 n losses decreased by 0 1 0 07 mg when recommended n rate was considered and 8 8 mg under the combined optimal management nevertheless different behavior was obtained for wheat and barley where the leached no3 n was increased by 0 1 of the total no3 n in the whole vid area under both practices recommended n rates and combined optimal management comparing to the current n fertilization owing to reduced n fertilization applied by farmers crops however for alfalfa the total of the amount of no3 n leached under current management practice 0 37 mg could be reduced when optimal irrigation and fertilization were considered together fig 8 a represents the spatial distribution of no3 n losses under the different scenarios considered current irrigation and n fertilization current irrigation and recommended n fertilization and optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization results indicate that under current management practices a great variation of no3 n losses was observed with very high values especially in b6 soil type about 35 9 mg the soil types a4 and d4 also presented high no3 n losses in comparison with the rest of the soils 18 6 mg and 14 9 mg respectively when optimal irrigation and fertilization was considered the no3 n amount losses decrease considerably in the whole vid area in this case the leached no3 n values varied from 0 0 mg soil d5 to 5 0 mg soil a4 under the cropping distribution and current fertilization in the vid of the considered year the maximum no3 n losses per unit area were reached in b6 112 kg no3 n ha 1 a1 109 kg no3 n ha 1 a3 65 kg no3 n ha 1 a6 61 kg no3 n ha 1 d3 55 kg no3 n ha 1 d4 51 kg no3 n ha 1 and a4 41 kg no3 n ha 1 so under the two years cropping system in the vid those soils can be considered as the most vulnerable soils in the remaining soils values ranged from 3 3 kg no3 n ha 1 d5 soil to 22 kg no3 n ha 1 d2 soil 3 3 2 residual n in soil the dssat simulation results under the current fertilization show that the maize ls followed by maize ss are the main crops with the highest residual n amounts with 202 and 52 mg considering all the cultivated area respectively however both crops presented the highest reduction percentage of residual n in soil under optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization management the total residual n in soil reduction was 76 7 for maize ls and 20 7 for maize ss respectively about 146 5 mg for maize ls and 39 6 mg for maize ss could be reduced under the combined irrigation and n management practices fig 7b fig 8b that presents the total reduction distribution of such variable under the current irrigation and n fertilization current irrigation and recommended n fertilization and optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization indicate a high variability between soil types and practices according to the model under the cropping distribution and current fertilization in the vid of the considered years the maximum residual n per unit area reached highest values of 161 and 108 kg n ha 1 in a1 and d3 soils respectively those high values represent a risk for n losses especially during the intercrop period martínez et al 2015 reported high values of residual n in soil 0 9 m depth before maize sowing reaching 218 kg n ha 1 under similar conditions in addition de haan et al 2017 reported an average residual no3 n content in the soil 1 80 m depth of about 134 kg ha 1 for continuous maize with a cereal rye cover crop in the remaining soils residual n values ranged from 96 kg n ha 1 a6 soil to 44 kg n ha 1 d2 soil compared to the current n fertilization the recommended n management could reduce residual n in soil by 58 while with the combined optimal management it could be reduced by 61 in agreement with these results dssat simulations indicated that the combined optimum irrigation and recommended n management was more effective in reducing n losses than soil residual n dssat simulations identified that under the combined recommended irrigation and n management the c2 20 4 e2 19 and d4 12 4 are the soils with the highest reduction percentage considering the total residual n reduction in the vid this is very relevant because they were mainly cultivated to maize ls and maize ss highly over fertilized crop by local farmers effectively the model simulations show that under the current fertilization maize ls followed by maize ss are the crops with the highest residual n with 202 4 and 52 2 mg respectively however both crops represent the highest reduction percentage of residual n in soil considering the total reduction in the vid with 76 7 and 20 7 for maize ls and maize ss respectively 3 3 3 nitrous oxide emissions in the same way the n2o n emissions were calculated in the whole vid using the methodology applied for no3 n losses by leaching and n soil residual fig 8c only results corresponding to maize ls maize ss and alfalfa crops were considered because the othermodules of the dssat model do not include such variable under current n fertilization the total n2o n emission was 1640 kg n average of two crop seasons this amount could be reduced by 19 under the recommended n fertilization and by 60 under the combined irrigation and n fertilization management in terms of soils the b6 soil type produces the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the vid with 622 kg of n2o n emission however this value could be highly decreased under the combined irrigation and n management by 214 kg in addition b6 and c3 soils presented more than 100 kg of n2o n emission reduction from the current to the combined irrigation and n management practice alfalfa crop contributed by 0 7 to the total n2o n emission reduction the remaining reductions were 64 1 and 35 2 for maize ls and maize ss respectively however the amount of simulated n2o n emission should be carefully interpreted because of multiple sources of model uncertainty and therefore calibration of n2o fluxes against measured data would be important 4 conclusion the dssat model calibrated and validated in the semiarid intensively irrigated area of vid was used as a tool to explore possible irrigation and n fertilization best management practices for maize short and long season wheat barley sunflower and alfalfa this study clearly demonstrated that applying the right n amount required by the crop and optimizing the timing of n application could result in an economic gain for farmers because of a significant reduction of n fertilization requirement additionally the n losses could be reduced substantially through the efficient use of the irrigation water and n management practices together in general results indicate that the no3 n losses below the root zone were affected by crop type soil type and the current management practices used in the vid farms on soils with low water holding properties as a4 and d4 soils or with shallow depths as b6 soils should be targeted to improve their management in order to minimize no3 n leaching to drainage waters in terms of crops the maize both maize ls and maize ss followed by sunflower were responsible for most of the no3 n losses below the root zone current n application rates exceeded actual crop requirements more than 50 for maize resulting in high no3 n leaching during the cropping season for alfalfa the current n management could be considered acceptable as there was no potential improvement on no3 n losses residual no3 n in soil and n2o n emission when the recommended n fertilization and combined optimum irrigation and recommended n fertilization were considered for maize the recommended n fertilization management could reduce no3 n losses by 51 of the total losses under the current fertilization for the whole area while maintaining high crop yields moreover this reduction could be increased by 35 under the combined optimal irrigation and recommended n fertilization management regarding the residual n in soil the model showed that the recommended n fertilization could reduce residual n in soil by 58 while the combined irrigation and n management could reduce it up to 61 considering all the cultivated area in the vid moreover the recommended irrigation and n fertilization could reduce n2o n emissions by 60 the triple than under the recommended n fertilization this study supports the potential of the dssat model to incentivize farmers to adjust their nf and irrigation practices to crop requirements and soil properties to ensure high production while improving the economic and environmental sustainability of the intensive irrigated agriculture systems also this result can be considered as a starting point for future work to provide useful guidelines and rules in order to limit the n pollution additional strategies of n and water optimization should be considered that could help to manage the spatial and temporal variability of n losses and their impact on water

10742,to address the water shortage caused by various natural conditions and ineffective irrigation water management in the zhanghe irrigation district zid of the yangtze river basin in china a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp model is developed under uncertainty derived through incorporating fuzzy credibility constrained programming into the jensen model optimization framework fficnp can not only address intervals single uncertainty and fuzzy interval sets dual uncertainties in the model objectives and double sided constraints but also reflect nonlinear responsive relationships between the crop yields and irrigation levels by introducing the crop water production functions cwpfs under different growth stages moreover an expected value based evb approach is introduced to solve the fficnp model the fficnp model is then applied to the case study of irrigation water allocation in the zid for demonstrating its applicability optimal solutions can be generated from the fficnp model for solving the irrigation water allocation problem under uncertainty the results indicate that a lower credibility level corresponds to a higher level of system benefits and system efficiency the system benefits of zid in a wet year are 17 72 24 23 109 cny when λ 1 0 and 17 79 25 03 109 cny when λ 0 6 these findings from the fficnp model can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among irrigation water allocation schemes system benefits and credibility levels and thus contribute to the effectiveness of irrigation water management under various inflow levels and complex uncertainties keywords irrigation water allocation jensen model nonlinear fuzzy interval sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming 1 introduction sustainable and efficient water resources management is a significant concern in many countries particularly in the backdrop of burgeoning population urbanization expansion and global water shortage crisis singh 2014 in china the biggest water use sector is agriculture which consumes around 62 3 of the total water use ministry of water resources p r o c 2017 agricultural water management thus becomes one of the cores for helping sustainable regional development and ensuring livelihood security therefore many previous researches have targeted to enhance the agricultural water use efficiency and water productivity especially in arid and semi arid areas characterized by high evaporation and low rainfall li et al 2015 niu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 however many wet regions of southern china also suffer from serious water shortage crisis caused by various natural conditions and ineffective water management the zhanghe irrigation district zid which is located in the yangtze river basin of china is facing the same challenge of water scarcity it is of great significance to study the rational irrigation water allocation of the zid as a typical case in the process of irrigation water management crop water production functions cwpfs play important roles in reflecting the relationship between the crop yields and crop water requirements zhang and oweis 1999 cai et al 2003 georgiou and papamichail 2008 tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016a as one of the cwpfs jensen model jensen 1968 has advantages of not only reflecting the relationship between crop yields and the water applied during different crop growth stages but also expressing the difference when the same amount of water is supplied following different schedules shangguan et al 2002 guo et al 2014a sadati et al 2014 zhang and guo 2016 yue et al 2018 however a general jensen model cannot tackle fluctuation and variability of input parameters such as hydrological elements water requirements and market prices posing an obstacle in practical water allocation problems thereupon to address the issue an enhanced jensen model taking uncertainty techniques into consideration is desired uncertain programming methods proved to be a kind of effective tools to handle complex inexactness randomness and vagueness to address different types of uncertainties stochastic mathematical programming smp interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp have been widely applied to the field of agricultural water management li et al 2010 lu et al 2011 nematian 2016 xie et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhang and guo 2018 ren et al 2019 considering the quality of data and computational efficiency ipp is a better choice to handle uncertain parameters that can be expressed as interval values with known lower and upper bounds but with unknown membership or distribution functions wang et al 2018 however in many real world problems a number of parameters may be more complicated which can hardly be manipulated as a form of single uncertainty e g interval value fuzzy sets or stochastic probability distribution for example the environmental capacity e g available water associated with the vagueness of human judgment yu et al 2016 can be expressed as a certain triangular fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 is the least possible value a 2 is the middle value and a 3 is the highest possible value however it is still difficult to obtain the deterministic and crisp membership function of fuzzy sets in many cases moreover each value e g a 1 a 2 and a 3 may be specified as a range between the upper bound and the lower bound without knowing distributions it is necessary to introduce the fuzzy interval sets fis a type of dual uncertainties see fig 1 to address such a complexity previously zhang et al 2018a introduced the fuzzy interval membership functions to an irrigation water allocation model to deal with both intervals single uncertainty and fis dual uncertainties within a general jensen model optimization framework for the first time however this method cannot tackle intervals and fis simultaneously existed in the optimization objectives and both sides of model constraints so that it cannot deal with the complexities associated with the violation of system constraints in fact in real world water allocation problems of the zid dual uncertainties need to be reflected in both objectives and double sided constraints of the optimization models to further address this issue the fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp liu and iwamura 1998 can be introduced to effectively tackle the violation of system constraints however the general fccp models can only handle fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints while imprecise parameters in the left hand side constraints being presented as interval numbers pishvaee et al 2012 guo et al 2013 zeng et al 2014 therefore this study aims to develop a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp model for tackling both single uncertainty and dual uncertainties existing in the objective function and double sided constraints simultaneously since the α cut method and credibility measure proposed in previous studies guo et al 2014b zhang and guo 2018 cannot be used for solving the fficnp model an expected value based evb method based on credibility measure and expected value theory heilpern 1992 is integrated with the ipp solving method based on such a novel solving method the fficnp model can be transformed into two deterministic ones consisting of upper bound submodel and lower bound submodel with predetermined credibility levels thus the fficnp can be solved and generate flexible solutions for irrigation water management this study will apply the proposed fficnp approach to a real world case study of irrigation water allocation under uncertainty in the zid for demonstrating its applicability the framework of study system is shown in fig 2 as the first attempt of integrating intervals fuzzy interval sets and fccp within a general jensen model optimization framework the fficnp model has four distinct advantages 1 it can accurately reflect the relationship between water demands and crop yields during different growth stages 2 it can address precipitation variabilities and imprecise water demands as well as multiple uncertainties expressed as intervals single uncertainty and fuzzy interval sets dual uncertainties in both objectives and constraints of the water allocation models 3 it can help analyze the tradeoffs between economic benefits and risk of violation constraints under different risk aversion levels 4 it can generate a set of decision alternatives under different hydrological years and credibility levels to further help local water managers identify the optimal management strategies 2 overview of the study area the zhanghe irrigation district zid fig 3 is located in the yangtze river basin of china and covers three cities of hubei province jingmen jm jingzhou jz and dangyang dy this area is one of the most important agriculture bases of grain production in the province it features a subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 922 2 mm during the years of 1952 2016 although the annual rainfall of zid is high droughts frequently occur due to the unbalanced rainfall conditions among different months and years chen et al 2016 approximately 82 6 of the yearly rainfall occurs between april and october the difference among inter annual distribution is up to 2 2 times 432 8 mm in 1981 and 1190 6 mm in 1983 when precipitation is insufficient in zid irrigation is needed to meet the water requirements of crop growth the main crops in zid are rice winter rape and winter wheat however irrigation water is not required for winter rape or winter wheat because their water demand can be fully satisfied by rainfall and groundwater thus rice is the only irrigation water consumer due to its high water demands in zid rice is primarily irrigated by water from general reservoirs ponds and the zhanghe reservoir in this paper the total water volume from general reservoirs and ponds is defined by internal water while water from the zhanghe reservoir is called reservoir water in reality general reservoirs and ponds are operated independently following decentralized management guided by subarea managers and farmers they could provide flexible supplies and allow farmers to gain water on demand thus internal water has been prioritized by subarea managers and farmers to meet crop water demands timely and easily in addition when internal water availability is insufficient the zhanghe reservoir acts as a complementary water source to cope with the water shortages during crop growth periods the zhanghe reservoir built in a tributary of the yangtze river can be operated for multipurpose uses including irrigation flood control domestic water supply industrial use and hydropower generation during recent years the increased water demands of other water users and limited water supplies have exacerbated the agricultural water shortages thence how to optimally allocate the limited irrigation water resources and thus to improve agricultural water productivity have become a growing urgent issue for the sustainable development of local agriculture the problem is more compounded by a plenty of uncertainties existing in the agricultural water management systems including market conditions precipitation and evapotranspiration characteristics and stream flows in addition the uncertainty of available water supplies may be influenced by extreme weather conditions thus creating a baffle to the water resources allocation hu et al 2016a b besides the different preferences of decision makers due to cognitive vagueness and the various requirements of crop yields along growth stages make it more complicated to obtain appropriate water allocation schemes therefore in response to above issues of the zid it is crucial to develop a comprehensive systematic approach of agricultural water resources allocation under uncertainty in this study irrigation water allocation needs to be planned for four growth stages which include the tillering stage booting stage heading stage and milky stage the data of growth period division water sensitivity and potential crop production are obtained from the previous field researches zhang et al 2001 and chen et al 2017 as presented in table 1 the crop water requirement under each growth stage is computed according to the method recommended by allen et al 1997 the daily reference of crop evapotranspiration is obtained by applying the fao 56 penman monteith method to the meteorological data from 1988 to 2017 of tuanlin meteorological station located at the middle and upper reaches of zid the total crop potential evapotranspiration in each growth stage can be calculated by summing up the daily values within that growth stage the t distribution is used to estimate the range of interval parameters where the 95 confidence level of lower and upper bounds are respectively adopted as the lower and upper values of interval parameters furthermore these subareas are assumed to have same soil properties and same hydrological or meteorological conditions so that they can also use the same crop water production function rainfall in each period follows a pearson type iii distribution fig 4 which can further be divided into three hydrological levels based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016b namely the levels of wet year p 25 normal year 25 p 75 and dry year p 75 environmental capacity e g available water is subject to human judgments xu and qin 2010 and difficult to be defined by its accurate characteristics which can better be expressed as fuzzy interval sets fis with fuzzy interval membership functions thus the rainfall and water supply availability are represented as fis shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively crop planting area is also characterized as fis in both objective function and left hand constraints because of irregular changes and statistical inaccuracy table 4 presents some basic data provided by the hubei zhanghe project administration bureau including crop planting area market price cultivation expense and water use efficiency 3 mathematical model development this section is to develop a fficnp model for the case study of zid it emphasizes on 1 how to couple multiple uncertainties associated with credibility constraints within a general nonlinear optimization framework and build a fficnp model 2 how to use the developed model to balance the constraint violation risks and the system benefits under various complexities and uncertainties 3 how to solve this fficnp model through the evb method and generate effective crop water allocation schemes 3 1 full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp in order to accurately reflect the impact of water supply on crop productivity during different growth stages this study needs to establish a crop water production function cwpf for the irrigation water allocation system of zid according to zhang et al 2001 the jensen model is considered to be superior to other cwpfs for describing rice growth in hubei province to better address the uncertain characteristics of the zid this study requires the integration of multiple uncertain programming techniques veiseh et al 2018 to deal with parameters expressed as the fuzzy interval sets fis e g effective precipitation planting area and available water supply or intervals e g crop price crop yield in the model objective and double sided constraints besides this study desires to reflect the complexities associated with the violation of system constraints therefore a fficnp model can be formulated as follows to tackle all these issues in the irrigation water management of zid 1a m a x f i 1 i b ω i a i y m j 1 j w j i w j e p j e t c j λ j i 1 i a i d i 1 i j 1 j a i c 1 w j c 2 i w j where f is the net system benefit

multiple uncertainties existing in both the objective function and the constraints in a nonlinear programming framework furthermore the fficnp model can generate flexible solutions and support in depth analysis under various scenarios by introducing different credibility levels a new solving method based on the evb method in zhang 2011 and the ipp method is also proposed for solving the fficnp model which entails the steps being summarized as follows step 1 after formulating the fficnp model transform the fis in the objective function into their expected values for example the expected value heilpern 1992 of ξ is defined as 2a e v ξ 0 c r ξ r d r 0 c r ξ r d r step 2 convert double sided fuzzy interval credibility constraints into ordinary interval ones for example the calculation formula of c r i 1 i a i x i b λ can be denoted as follows 2b c r i 1 i a i x i b 1 i f i 1 i a i 3 x i b 1 2 b 2 b 1 2 i 1 i a i 2 x i i 1 i a i 3 x i 2 b 2 b 1 i 1 i a i 2 x i i 1 i a i 3 x i i f i

in the constraints violation the significant credibility level should be greater than 0 5 based on step 1 the fficnp model can be transformed to a typical interval programming model as follows 2c m a

two submodels through the interactive algorithm huang et al 1992 miao et al 2014 xie et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b 2019 because the objective function is to maximize f the upper bound submodel should be solved firstly step 4 solve the upper bound submodel and obtain corresponding alternatives under different given credibility levels step 5 solve the lower bound submodel based on the solutions obtained from step 4 to obtain the corresponding solutions step 6 combine solutions from steps 4 and 5 to generate the final solutions under each given level 4 results analysis 4 1 optimal irrigation ratio flexible water allocation schemes responsive to different levels of water scarcity can be generated from the fficnp model by adjusting the irrigation ratio fig 5 presents the optimization results of irrigation ratio for each subarea under different scenarios it can be seen that the irrigation ratio of each subarea decreases to varying degrees with the decreasing inflows as shown in fig 5a the irrigation ratio of each subarea is 1 which means complete irrigation it is indicated that available water supply can fully meet the crop water demand in wet year in normal year the irrigation ratio in jz city increases sharply when credibility level declines from 1 to 0 8 it means that the decreasing of available irrigation water has remarkably affected the irrigation ratio when the credibility level is more than 0 8 the optimization results are conservative for guiding actual activities due to the low irrigation ratio it is important to set proper credibility levels for flexible solution alternatives and meaningful decision support in dry year the total irrigation area decreases significantly comparing to that of the other hydrological years the irrigation ratio of each subarea maintains the steady upward trend along with decreasing credibility level the results are 0 40 0 45 for jm 0 07 0 10 for jz and 0 08 0 09 for dy respectively the irrigated ratio of jm city is much larger than the other two subareas it can be speculated that this may be directly related to the planting area in this study it is assumed that the cwpf of rice has no spatial variability in three subareas thus the model is likely to satisfy water requirement in jm city firstly due to its larger planting area than the other two subareas even though the irrigation ratio in jm city is less than half of the total cultivated area in other words when the extreme drought occurs most crops will not be irrigated resulting in egregious production loss thereby how to tackle drought problems efficiently and allocate limited water optimally is worthy of attention it is necessary to transfer water from other regions to ensure the local food security additionally the large inter annual differences in inflows have seriously affected the actual agricultural production and socio economic development enhancing water resources reserve and regulation capacity in the irrigation district may buffer the negative impacts caused by extreme droughts 4 2 optimal irrigation water allocation fig 6 depicts the optimal results of total irrigation water allocation under different hydrological years and credibility levels the gap between total water distribution and total water supply varies under different scenarios it can be seen that internal water supply is almost exhausted in each hydrological year because the price of internal water is set slightly lower than reservoir water the available reservoir water is mostly used in normal year and dry year while it accounts for approximately 70 100 of the total water supply in wet year it means that there is plenty of water surplus after meeting the basic needs of crop irrigation in wet year additional economic benefits can be achieved if the remaining water is stored or transferred to other water sectors fig 7 depicts the optimized water allocation effective rainfall and crop water demand of each growth stage under a compromised credibility of 0 8 the results are presented as interval values in jm city crop water demand in the heading stage can be well met by irrigation and precipitation followed by the tilling stage and booting stage it indicates that water shortage in the milk stage has a smaller impact than that in other stages which coincides with the expectations considering the sensitive index distribution of middle rice irrigation water allocated to each growth stage increases with decreasing rainfall and reaches a peak in dry year the actual water supply to each growth stage decreases firstly and then increases while the scenario varies from wet year to dry year it indicates that proper deficit irrigation with large cultivation area is better in normal year while the crop water demand needs to be satisfied to the greatest extent in dry year because the production loss by deficit irrigation can be compensated through large area being irrigated in normal year however less than half of the total cultivation area can be irrigated in dry year resulting in different water allocation policy similar to jm city water scarcity in jz city and dy city is the largest in the milk stage followed by the booting stage while water requirement targets are always satisfied in the heading stage the results also show that less water is allocated to the tilling stage even though it has the largest water requirement which is directly related to the rainfall the rainfall has a grand impact on irrigation water allocation and has a downward trend from the tilling stage to the milky stage in three types of hydrological years it can also be seen that the tilling stage and heading stage have stronger sensitivity to water scarcity the production loss due to water scarcity in these two key growth stages is difficult to compensate through more irrigation in the other growth stages hence irrigation water should be given priority to the tilling stage and heading stage among that the heading stage has a shorter growth period and less water requirement than the tilling stage which is more likely to be satisfied therefore several suggestions can be proposed as follows 1 rainfall during the early growth period can be an indicator to judge the inflow level of the whole growth period because it decreases from the tilling stage to the milky stage 2 crop water requirement during the heading stage july 27 to august 5 must be satisfied under all scenarios 3 optimal schemes obtained from the fficnp model provide better choices to guarantee system benefits when irrigation supply is insufficient furthermore the optimal results can help generate reasonable irrigation water allocation and mitigate water scarcity caused by large inter annual differences in inflows 4 3 net system benefits generally crop water and irrigation area are allocated through solving the fficnp model thus the net system benefits can be obtained under different hydrological years and credibility levels the solution alternatives and the corresponding economic benefits are different the solutions are presented as interval values due to the uncertainty of inputs parameters fig 8 shows the system net benefits along with the change of the hydrological years and credibility levels the system benefits have a deceasing trend from the wet year to the dry year for both lower bound and upper bound that is because more water can be supplied to the crops under a larger amount of inflows which leads to the higher crop production also there is a downward trend from λ 0 6 to λ 1 which is mainly driven by a tight decision space in credibility constraints in general the higher credibility level corresponds to the better constraints satisfaction and the higher confidence level of model results thus the credibility level can be regarded as an indicator of how reliable the optimization results would be additionally it is obvious that hydrological years have far more influences on the decision making than credibility levels when the credibility level reaches 1 the system benefits achieve 17 72 24 23 109 cny in wet year 8 43 11 21 109 cny in normal year and 1 51 3 99 109 cny in dry year respectively the difference of system benefits between different scenarios is substantial it indicates that there is a necessity to tackle the water allocation problem under different scenarios furthermore it proves that the amount of irrigation water resources is a vital factor to develop local agricultural economy more practically the storage capacity of agricultural water resources in the zid should be enhanced meanwhile more attention should be paid on how to efficiently allocate limited water resources under low inflows 4 4 system efficiency the system efficiency defined as the total economic benefits per unit water supply or water productivity is an important index to incarnate the optimality of water allocation results fig 9 depicts the system efficiency by subarea under different scenarios it is found that a higher credibility level corresponds to lower benefits per unit water supply take the normal year scenario as an example when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 1 the benefits per unit water supply varies from 2 35 2 97 cny m3 to 2 19 2 78 cny m3 it demonstrates that the credibility level has more significant and direct influence on economic benefits than water allocation as shown in fig 9b the lowest water productivity is in jz city which may be driven by the low crop production and the low irrigation ratio besides the results suggest that the credibility level has a slight impact on the water productivity decreasing credibility level would improve the water productivity especially from 0 8 to 0 6 however under some scenarios the water productivity reaches the lowest value when λ is 0 8 theoretically the conservative estimate of water allocation would not only contribute to more net benefits but also lead to higher system efficiency the results can help managers choose the appropriate credibility level based on their own preferences for example a decision maker would choose a compromised credibility level less than 0 8for a high system efficiency furthermore the results demonstrate that the fficnp model is applicable for tackling this water management problem of zid 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with the inp model to better summarize the characteristics and advantages of the fficnp model an interval nonlinear programming inp model is introduced into the study for comparison the objective function of inp model is to maximize the net system economic benefits with the discrete interval parameters without introducing the irrigation ratio and credibility constraints fig 10 depicts the comparison of the net system benefit and water productivity of two models in different scenarios as shown in fig 10a the differences between the upper bound and lower bound of inp model results are substantial in each hydrological year which lead to a lower practicality than the fficnp model results it also indicates that the fis dual uncertainty would help reflect parameter uncertainties better than the general intervals single uncertainty additionally the inp model leads to higher economic benefits than the fficnp model in normal year which is mainly determined by input parameters in dry year the net system benefits obtained from inp model are negative which means huge economic loss will be faced by the farmers however this situation can be effectively avoided through using the fficnp model with consideration of irrigation ratio taking the jm city as an example the water productivity of two models can be seen in fig 10b the water productivity results obtained from the fficnp model are greater than those of the inp model which can be interpreted by the large amount of irrigation water resources consumed additionally the inp model can only provide simple interval solutions with lower bound and upper bound while more flexible solutions can be generated by the fficnp model under different risk levels of constraints violation in summary the developed fficnp model is superior to an inp model in its applicability and performance on providing flexible and effective schemes for irrigation water allocation in the zid 5 2 effect of input parameters in order to further explore how the key input parameters would affect the outputs the following 13 settings with different inputs for three key parameters are tested which include a four settings of the internal water storage capacities 0 8iq 1 2iq 1 6iq and 2 0iq where iq denotes the actual internal water storage capacity b four settings of the cultivation areas 0 8a 1 2a 1 6a and 2 0a where a is the actual crop cultivation area of three subareas c five settings of the minimum irrigation ratio 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 all these 13 settings above were simulated by fficnp model and the corresponding results under λ 0 8 are shown in fig 11 the results illustrate that three parameters have different effects on output results as displayed in fig 11a the system economic benefit remains stable in wet year while it climbs along with increasing water storage capacity in normal year and dry year on the one hand it indicates that the internal water storage capacity is completely sufficient and there is no need to expand it in wet year on the other hand increasing the water storage capacity is a sensible way to improve food production in normal year and dry year in the zid it can be speculated that improving the water supply availability of other sources including reservoir water and transferring water from other regions has a similar effect on system economic benefits as presented in fig 11b the economic benefits can be improved remarkably along with the increased crop cultivation area in wet year on the contrary increasing planting areas has a serious negative influence on economic benefits in other hydrological years which is caused by the increase of crop planting cost without corresponding income as shown in fig 11c net system benefits have a little sensitivity to the minimum irrigation ratio thence expanding the planting area is a key factor for economic development in wet year while reducing the cultivation area is necessary in normal year and dry year furthermore engineering measures including increasing water storage capacity transferring water from other regions and improving the canal water use efficiency are urgent for improving crop production and system economic benefits when low inflow level occurs 6 conclusions a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp approach has been developed for supporting irrigation water allocation along crop growth stages under uncertainty the developed fficnp model can deal with multiple uncertain parameters characterized as intervals or fuzzy interval sets in the objective function and double sided constraints it can also support in depth analysis on tradeoffs among the solutions credibility level and maximum system benefits furthermore a novel solving method based on the evb and ipp methods is proposed for solving the fficnp model the fficnp model has been applied to a real word case study of irrigation water allocation in the zhanghe irrigation district yangtze river basin of china three types of hydrological years and five credibility levels have been considered for the case study the obtained results have provided effective decision making support for the local irrigation water management the results indicate that 1 rainfalls and available water supplies have stronger impacts on crop water allocation and production than the credibility levels 2 a lower credibility level corresponds to higher levels of net benefits and system efficiency and abundant optimal water allocation schemes can help decision makers formulate appropriate policies 3 transferring external water and enhancing water storage capacity are effective measures to address water shortage in terms of shrinking inflows this study has formulated a framework to address irrigation water allocation problems under multiple uncertainties the research has provided a new perspective for precision enhancement of crop water allocation system characterization by introducing multi fold uncertainty technique into a jensen model framework both the model development and practical application in the zid have formed the foundation for future research of agricultural water management under uncertainty the model framework and solving method could also be applied to other similar regions to help develop better water allocation schemes and improve the effectiveness of agricultural water management however the corresponding solving method is worthy of continual exploration in our future studies through taking spatial variability of rainfall into account declaration of competing interest the authors declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted acknowledgements this research was supported by the national key

10742,to address the water shortage caused by various natural conditions and ineffective irrigation water management in the zhanghe irrigation district zid of the yangtze river basin in china a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp model is developed under uncertainty derived through incorporating fuzzy credibility constrained programming into the jensen model optimization framework fficnp can not only address intervals single uncertainty and fuzzy interval sets dual uncertainties in the model objectives and double sided constraints but also reflect nonlinear responsive relationships between the crop yields and irrigation levels by introducing the crop water production functions cwpfs under different growth stages moreover an expected value based evb approach is introduced to solve the fficnp model the fficnp model is then applied to the case study of irrigation water allocation in the zid for demonstrating its applicability optimal solutions can be generated from the fficnp model for solving the irrigation water allocation problem under uncertainty the results indicate that a lower credibility level corresponds to a higher level of system benefits and system efficiency the system benefits of zid in a wet year are 17 72 24 23 109 cny when λ 1 0 and 17 79 25 03 109 cny when λ 0 6 these findings from the fficnp model can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among irrigation water allocation schemes system benefits and credibility levels and thus contribute to the effectiveness of irrigation water management under various inflow levels and complex uncertainties keywords irrigation water allocation jensen model nonlinear fuzzy interval sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming 1 introduction sustainable and efficient water resources management is a significant concern in many countries particularly in the backdrop of burgeoning population urbanization expansion and global water shortage crisis singh 2014 in china the biggest water use sector is agriculture which consumes around 62 3 of the total water use ministry of water resources p r o c 2017 agricultural water management thus becomes one of the cores for helping sustainable regional development and ensuring livelihood security therefore many previous researches have targeted to enhance the agricultural water use efficiency and water productivity especially in arid and semi arid areas characterized by high evaporation and low rainfall li et al 2015 niu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 however many wet regions of southern china also suffer from serious water shortage crisis caused by various natural conditions and ineffective water management the zhanghe irrigation district zid which is located in the yangtze river basin of china is facing the same challenge of water scarcity it is of great significance to study the rational irrigation water allocation of the zid as a typical case in the process of irrigation water management crop water production functions cwpfs play important roles in reflecting the relationship between the crop yields and crop water requirements zhang and oweis 1999 cai et al 2003 georgiou and papamichail 2008 tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016a as one of the cwpfs jensen model jensen 1968 has advantages of not only reflecting the relationship between crop yields and the water applied during different crop growth stages but also expressing the difference when the same amount of water is supplied following different schedules shangguan et al 2002 guo et al 2014a sadati et al 2014 zhang and guo 2016 yue et al 2018 however a general jensen model cannot tackle fluctuation and variability of input parameters such as hydrological elements water requirements and market prices posing an obstacle in practical water allocation problems thereupon to address the issue an enhanced jensen model taking uncertainty techniques into consideration is desired uncertain programming methods proved to be a kind of effective tools to handle complex inexactness randomness and vagueness to address different types of uncertainties stochastic mathematical programming smp interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp have been widely applied to the field of agricultural water management li et al 2010 lu et al 2011 nematian 2016 xie et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhang and guo 2018 ren et al 2019 considering the quality of data and computational efficiency ipp is a better choice to handle uncertain parameters that can be expressed as interval values with known lower and upper bounds but with unknown membership or distribution functions wang et al 2018 however in many real world problems a number of parameters may be more complicated which can hardly be manipulated as a form of single uncertainty e g interval value fuzzy sets or stochastic probability distribution for example the environmental capacity e g available water associated with the vagueness of human judgment yu et al 2016 can be expressed as a certain triangular fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 is the least possible value a 2 is the middle value and a 3 is the highest possible value however it is still difficult to obtain the deterministic and crisp membership function of fuzzy sets in many cases moreover each value e g a 1 a 2 and a 3 may be specified as a range between the upper bound and the lower bound without knowing distributions it is necessary to introduce the fuzzy interval sets fis a type of dual uncertainties see fig 1 to address such a complexity previously zhang et al 2018a introduced the fuzzy interval membership functions to an irrigation water allocation model to deal with both intervals single uncertainty and fis dual uncertainties within a general jensen model optimization framework for the first time however this method cannot tackle intervals and fis simultaneously existed in the optimization objectives and both sides of model constraints so that it cannot deal with the complexities associated with the violation of system constraints in fact in real world water allocation problems of the zid dual uncertainties need to be reflected in both objectives and double sided constraints of the optimization models to further address this issue the fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp liu and iwamura 1998 can be introduced to effectively tackle the violation of system constraints however the general fccp models can only handle fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints while imprecise parameters in the left hand side constraints being presented as interval numbers pishvaee et al 2012 guo et al 2013 zeng et al 2014 therefore this study aims to develop a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp model for tackling both single uncertainty and dual uncertainties existing in the objective function and double sided constraints simultaneously since the α cut method and credibility measure proposed in previous studies guo et al 2014b zhang and guo 2018 cannot be used for solving the fficnp model an expected value based evb method based on credibility measure and expected value theory heilpern 1992 is integrated with the ipp solving method based on such a novel solving method the fficnp model can be transformed into two deterministic ones consisting of upper bound submodel and lower bound submodel with predetermined credibility levels thus the fficnp can be solved and generate flexible solutions for irrigation water management this study will apply the proposed fficnp approach to a real world case study of irrigation water allocation under uncertainty in the zid for demonstrating its applicability the framework of study system is shown in fig 2 as the first attempt of integrating intervals fuzzy interval sets and fccp within a general jensen model optimization framework the fficnp model has four distinct advantages 1 it can accurately reflect the relationship between water demands and crop yields during different growth stages 2 it can address precipitation variabilities and imprecise water demands as well as multiple uncertainties expressed as intervals single uncertainty and fuzzy interval sets dual uncertainties in both objectives and constraints of the water allocation models 3 it can help analyze the tradeoffs between economic benefits and risk of violation constraints under different risk aversion levels 4 it can generate a set of decision alternatives under different hydrological years and credibility levels to further help local water managers identify the optimal management strategies 2 overview of the study area the zhanghe irrigation district zid fig 3 is located in the yangtze river basin of china and covers three cities of hubei province jingmen jm jingzhou jz and dangyang dy this area is one of the most important agriculture bases of grain production in the province it features a subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 922 2 mm during the years of 1952 2016 although the annual rainfall of zid is high droughts frequently occur due to the unbalanced rainfall conditions among different months and years chen et al 2016 approximately 82 6 of the yearly rainfall occurs between april and october the difference among inter annual distribution is up to 2 2 times 432 8 mm in 1981 and 1190 6 mm in 1983 when precipitation is insufficient in zid irrigation is needed to meet the water requirements of crop growth the main crops in zid are rice winter rape and winter wheat however irrigation water is not required for winter rape or winter wheat because their water demand can be fully satisfied by rainfall and groundwater thus rice is the only irrigation water consumer due to its high water demands in zid rice is primarily irrigated by water from general reservoirs ponds and the zhanghe reservoir in this paper the total water volume from general reservoirs and ponds is defined by internal water while water from the zhanghe reservoir is called reservoir water in reality general reservoirs and ponds are operated independently following decentralized management guided by subarea managers and farmers they could provide flexible supplies and allow farmers to gain water on demand thus internal water has been prioritized by subarea managers and farmers to meet crop water demands timely and easily in addition when internal water availability is insufficient the zhanghe reservoir acts as a complementary water source to cope with the water shortages during crop growth periods the zhanghe reservoir built in a tributary of the yangtze river can be operated for multipurpose uses including irrigation flood control domestic water supply industrial use and hydropower generation during recent years the increased water demands of other water users and limited water supplies have exacerbated the agricultural water shortages thence how to optimally allocate the limited irrigation water resources and thus to improve agricultural water productivity have become a growing urgent issue for the sustainable development of local agriculture the problem is more compounded by a plenty of uncertainties existing in the agricultural water management systems including market conditions precipitation and evapotranspiration characteristics and stream flows in addition the uncertainty of available water supplies may be influenced by extreme weather conditions thus creating a baffle to the water resources allocation hu et al 2016a b besides the different preferences of decision makers due to cognitive vagueness and the various requirements of crop yields along growth stages make it more complicated to obtain appropriate water allocation schemes therefore in response to above issues of the zid it is crucial to develop a comprehensive systematic approach of agricultural water resources allocation under uncertainty in this study irrigation water allocation needs to be planned for four growth stages which include the tillering stage booting stage heading stage and milky stage the data of growth period division water sensitivity and potential crop production are obtained from the previous field researches zhang et al 2001 and chen et al 2017 as presented in table 1 the crop water requirement under each growth stage is computed according to the method recommended by allen et al 1997 the daily reference of crop evapotranspiration is obtained by applying the fao 56 penman monteith method to the meteorological data from 1988 to 2017 of tuanlin meteorological station located at the middle and upper reaches of zid the total crop potential evapotranspiration in each growth stage can be calculated by summing up the daily values within that growth stage the t distribution is used to estimate the range of interval parameters where the 95 confidence level of lower and upper bounds are respectively adopted as the lower and upper values of interval parameters furthermore these subareas are assumed to have same soil properties and same hydrological or meteorological conditions so that they can also use the same crop water production function rainfall in each period follows a pearson type iii distribution fig 4 which can further be divided into three hydrological levels based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016b namely the levels of wet year p 25 normal year 25 p 75 and dry year p 75 environmental capacity e g available water is subject to human judgments xu and qin 2010 and difficult to be defined by its accurate characteristics which can better be expressed as fuzzy interval sets fis with fuzzy interval membership functions thus the rainfall and water supply availability are represented as fis shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively crop planting area is also characterized as fis in both objective function and left hand constraints because of irregular changes and statistical inaccuracy table 4 presents some basic data provided by the hubei zhanghe project administration bureau including crop planting area market price cultivation expense and water use efficiency 3 mathematical model development this section is to develop a fficnp model for the case study of zid it emphasizes on 1 how to couple multiple uncertainties associated with credibility constraints within a general nonlinear optimization framework and build a fficnp model 2 how to use the developed model to balance the constraint violation risks and the system benefits under various complexities and uncertainties 3 how to solve this fficnp model through the evb method and generate effective crop water allocation schemes 3 1 full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp in order to accurately reflect the impact of water supply on crop productivity during different growth stages this study needs to establish a crop water production function cwpf for the irrigation water allocation system of zid according to zhang et al 2001 the jensen model is considered to be superior to other cwpfs for describing rice growth in hubei province to better address the uncertain characteristics of the zid this study requires the integration of multiple uncertain programming techniques veiseh et al 2018 to deal with parameters expressed as the fuzzy interval sets fis e g effective precipitation planting area and available water supply or intervals e g crop price crop yield in the model objective and double sided constraints besides this study desires to reflect the complexities associated with the violation of system constraints therefore a fficnp model can be formulated as follows to tackle all these issues in the irrigation water management of zid 1a m a x f i 1 i b ω i a i y m j 1 j w j i w j e p j e t c j λ j i 1 i a i d i 1 i j 1 j a i c 1 w j c 2 i w j where f is the net system benefit

multiple uncertainties existing in both the objective function and the constraints in a nonlinear programming framework furthermore the fficnp model can generate flexible solutions and support in depth analysis under various scenarios by introducing different credibility levels a new solving method based on the evb method in zhang 2011 and the ipp method is also proposed for solving the fficnp model which entails the steps being summarized as follows step 1 after formulating the fficnp model transform the fis in the objective function into their expected values for example the expected value heilpern 1992 of ξ is defined as 2a e v ξ 0 c r ξ r d r 0 c r ξ r d r step 2 convert double sided fuzzy interval credibility constraints into ordinary interval ones for example the calculation formula of c r i 1 i a i x i b λ can be denoted as follows 2b c r i 1 i a i x i b 1 i f i 1 i a i 3 x i b 1 2 b 2 b 1 2 i 1 i a i 2 x i i 1 i a i 3 x i 2 b 2 b 1 i 1 i a i 2 x i i 1 i a i 3 x i i f i

in the constraints violation the significant credibility level should be greater than 0 5 based on step 1 the fficnp model can be transformed to a typical interval programming model as follows 2c m a

two submodels through the interactive algorithm huang et al 1992 miao et al 2014 xie et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b 2019 because the objective function is to maximize f the upper bound submodel should be solved firstly step 4 solve the upper bound submodel and obtain corresponding alternatives under different given credibility levels step 5 solve the lower bound submodel based on the solutions obtained from step 4 to obtain the corresponding solutions step 6 combine solutions from steps 4 and 5 to generate the final solutions under each given level 4 results analysis 4 1 optimal irrigation ratio flexible water allocation schemes responsive to different levels of water scarcity can be generated from the fficnp model by adjusting the irrigation ratio fig 5 presents the optimization results of irrigation ratio for each subarea under different scenarios it can be seen that the irrigation ratio of each subarea decreases to varying degrees with the decreasing inflows as shown in fig 5a the irrigation ratio of each subarea is 1 which means complete irrigation it is indicated that available water supply can fully meet the crop water demand in wet year in normal year the irrigation ratio in jz city increases sharply when credibility level declines from 1 to 0 8 it means that the decreasing of available irrigation water has remarkably affected the irrigation ratio when the credibility level is more than 0 8 the optimization results are conservative for guiding actual activities due to the low irrigation ratio it is important to set proper credibility levels for flexible solution alternatives and meaningful decision support in dry year the total irrigation area decreases significantly comparing to that of the other hydrological years the irrigation ratio of each subarea maintains the steady upward trend along with decreasing credibility level the results are 0 40 0 45 for jm 0 07 0 10 for jz and 0 08 0 09 for dy respectively the irrigated ratio of jm city is much larger than the other two subareas it can be speculated that this may be directly related to the planting area in this study it is assumed that the cwpf of rice has no spatial variability in three subareas thus the model is likely to satisfy water requirement in jm city firstly due to its larger planting area than the other two subareas even though the irrigation ratio in jm city is less than half of the total cultivated area in other words when the extreme drought occurs most crops will not be irrigated resulting in egregious production loss thereby how to tackle drought problems efficiently and allocate limited water optimally is worthy of attention it is necessary to transfer water from other regions to ensure the local food security additionally the large inter annual differences in inflows have seriously affected the actual agricultural production and socio economic development enhancing water resources reserve and regulation capacity in the irrigation district may buffer the negative impacts caused by extreme droughts 4 2 optimal irrigation water allocation fig 6 depicts the optimal results of total irrigation water allocation under different hydrological years and credibility levels the gap between total water distribution and total water supply varies under different scenarios it can be seen that internal water supply is almost exhausted in each hydrological year because the price of internal water is set slightly lower than reservoir water the available reservoir water is mostly used in normal year and dry year while it accounts for approximately 70 100 of the total water supply in wet year it means that there is plenty of water surplus after meeting the basic needs of crop irrigation in wet year additional economic benefits can be achieved if the remaining water is stored or transferred to other water sectors fig 7 depicts the optimized water allocation effective rainfall and crop water demand of each growth stage under a compromised credibility of 0 8 the results are presented as interval values in jm city crop water demand in the heading stage can be well met by irrigation and precipitation followed by the tilling stage and booting stage it indicates that water shortage in the milk stage has a smaller impact than that in other stages which coincides with the expectations considering the sensitive index distribution of middle rice irrigation water allocated to each growth stage increases with decreasing rainfall and reaches a peak in dry year the actual water supply to each growth stage decreases firstly and then increases while the scenario varies from wet year to dry year it indicates that proper deficit irrigation with large cultivation area is better in normal year while the crop water demand needs to be satisfied to the greatest extent in dry year because the production loss by deficit irrigation can be compensated through large area being irrigated in normal year however less than half of the total cultivation area can be irrigated in dry year resulting in different water allocation policy similar to jm city water scarcity in jz city and dy city is the largest in the milk stage followed by the booting stage while water requirement targets are always satisfied in the heading stage the results also show that less water is allocated to the tilling stage even though it has the largest water requirement which is directly related to the rainfall the rainfall has a grand impact on irrigation water allocation and has a downward trend from the tilling stage to the milky stage in three types of hydrological years it can also be seen that the tilling stage and heading stage have stronger sensitivity to water scarcity the production loss due to water scarcity in these two key growth stages is difficult to compensate through more irrigation in the other growth stages hence irrigation water should be given priority to the tilling stage and heading stage among that the heading stage has a shorter growth period and less water requirement than the tilling stage which is more likely to be satisfied therefore several suggestions can be proposed as follows 1 rainfall during the early growth period can be an indicator to judge the inflow level of the whole growth period because it decreases from the tilling stage to the milky stage 2 crop water requirement during the heading stage july 27 to august 5 must be satisfied under all scenarios 3 optimal schemes obtained from the fficnp model provide better choices to guarantee system benefits when irrigation supply is insufficient furthermore the optimal results can help generate reasonable irrigation water allocation and mitigate water scarcity caused by large inter annual differences in inflows 4 3 net system benefits generally crop water and irrigation area are allocated through solving the fficnp model thus the net system benefits can be obtained under different hydrological years and credibility levels the solution alternatives and the corresponding economic benefits are different the solutions are presented as interval values due to the uncertainty of inputs parameters fig 8 shows the system net benefits along with the change of the hydrological years and credibility levels the system benefits have a deceasing trend from the wet year to the dry year for both lower bound and upper bound that is because more water can be supplied to the crops under a larger amount of inflows which leads to the higher crop production also there is a downward trend from λ 0 6 to λ 1 which is mainly driven by a tight decision space in credibility constraints in general the higher credibility level corresponds to the better constraints satisfaction and the higher confidence level of model results thus the credibility level can be regarded as an indicator of how reliable the optimization results would be additionally it is obvious that hydrological years have far more influences on the decision making than credibility levels when the credibility level reaches 1 the system benefits achieve 17 72 24 23 109 cny in wet year 8 43 11 21 109 cny in normal year and 1 51 3 99 109 cny in dry year respectively the difference of system benefits between different scenarios is substantial it indicates that there is a necessity to tackle the water allocation problem under different scenarios furthermore it proves that the amount of irrigation water resources is a vital factor to develop local agricultural economy more practically the storage capacity of agricultural water resources in the zid should be enhanced meanwhile more attention should be paid on how to efficiently allocate limited water resources under low inflows 4 4 system efficiency the system efficiency defined as the total economic benefits per unit water supply or water productivity is an important index to incarnate the optimality of water allocation results fig 9 depicts the system efficiency by subarea under different scenarios it is found that a higher credibility level corresponds to lower benefits per unit water supply take the normal year scenario as an example when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 1 the benefits per unit water supply varies from 2 35 2 97 cny m3 to 2 19 2 78 cny m3 it demonstrates that the credibility level has more significant and direct influence on economic benefits than water allocation as shown in fig 9b the lowest water productivity is in jz city which may be driven by the low crop production and the low irrigation ratio besides the results suggest that the credibility level has a slight impact on the water productivity decreasing credibility level would improve the water productivity especially from 0 8 to 0 6 however under some scenarios the water productivity reaches the lowest value when λ is 0 8 theoretically the conservative estimate of water allocation would not only contribute to more net benefits but also lead to higher system efficiency the results can help managers choose the appropriate credibility level based on their own preferences for example a decision maker would choose a compromised credibility level less than 0 8for a high system efficiency furthermore the results demonstrate that the fficnp model is applicable for tackling this water management problem of zid 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with the inp model to better summarize the characteristics and advantages of the fficnp model an interval nonlinear programming inp model is introduced into the study for comparison the objective function of inp model is to maximize the net system economic benefits with the discrete interval parameters without introducing the irrigation ratio and credibility constraints fig 10 depicts the comparison of the net system benefit and water productivity of two models in different scenarios as shown in fig 10a the differences between the upper bound and lower bound of inp model results are substantial in each hydrological year which lead to a lower practicality than the fficnp model results it also indicates that the fis dual uncertainty would help reflect parameter uncertainties better than the general intervals single uncertainty additionally the inp model leads to higher economic benefits than the fficnp model in normal year which is mainly determined by input parameters in dry year the net system benefits obtained from inp model are negative which means huge economic loss will be faced by the farmers however this situation can be effectively avoided through using the fficnp model with consideration of irrigation ratio taking the jm city as an example the water productivity of two models can be seen in fig 10b the water productivity results obtained from the fficnp model are greater than those of the inp model which can be interpreted by the large amount of irrigation water resources consumed additionally the inp model can only provide simple interval solutions with lower bound and upper bound while more flexible solutions can be generated by the fficnp model under different risk levels of constraints violation in summary the developed fficnp model is superior to an inp model in its applicability and performance on providing flexible and effective schemes for irrigation water allocation in the zid 5 2 effect of input parameters in order to further explore how the key input parameters would affect the outputs the following 13 settings with different inputs for three key parameters are tested which include a four settings of the internal water storage capacities 0 8iq 1 2iq 1 6iq and 2 0iq where iq denotes the actual internal water storage capacity b four settings of the cultivation areas 0 8a 1 2a 1 6a and 2 0a where a is the actual crop cultivation area of three subareas c five settings of the minimum irrigation ratio 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 all these 13 settings above were simulated by fficnp model and the corresponding results under λ 0 8 are shown in fig 11 the results illustrate that three parameters have different effects on output results as displayed in fig 11a the system economic benefit remains stable in wet year while it climbs along with increasing water storage capacity in normal year and dry year on the one hand it indicates that the internal water storage capacity is completely sufficient and there is no need to expand it in wet year on the other hand increasing the water storage capacity is a sensible way to improve food production in normal year and dry year in the zid it can be speculated that improving the water supply availability of other sources including reservoir water and transferring water from other regions has a similar effect on system economic benefits as presented in fig 11b the economic benefits can be improved remarkably along with the increased crop cultivation area in wet year on the contrary increasing planting areas has a serious negative influence on economic benefits in other hydrological years which is caused by the increase of crop planting cost without corresponding income as shown in fig 11c net system benefits have a little sensitivity to the minimum irrigation ratio thence expanding the planting area is a key factor for economic development in wet year while reducing the cultivation area is necessary in normal year and dry year furthermore engineering measures including increasing water storage capacity transferring water from other regions and improving the canal water use efficiency are urgent for improving crop production and system economic benefits when low inflow level occurs 6 conclusions a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming fficnp approach has been developed for supporting irrigation water allocation along crop growth stages under uncertainty the developed fficnp model can deal with multiple uncertain parameters characterized as intervals or fuzzy interval sets in the objective function and double sided constraints it can also support in depth analysis on tradeoffs among the solutions credibility level and maximum system benefits furthermore a novel solving method based on the evb and ipp methods is proposed for solving the fficnp model the fficnp model has been applied to a real word case study of irrigation water allocation in the zhanghe irrigation district yangtze river basin of china three types of hydrological years and five credibility levels have been considered for the case study the obtained results have provided effective decision making support for the local irrigation water management the results indicate that 1 rainfalls and available water supplies have stronger impacts on crop water allocation and production than the credibility levels 2 a lower credibility level corresponds to higher levels of net benefits and system efficiency and abundant optimal water allocation schemes can help decision makers formulate appropriate policies 3 transferring external water and enhancing water storage capacity are effective measures to address water shortage in terms of shrinking inflows this study has formulated a framework to address irrigation water allocation problems under multiple uncertainties the research has provided a new perspective for precision enhancement of crop water allocation system characterization by introducing multi fold uncertainty technique into a jensen model framework both the model development and practical application in the zid have formed the foundation for future research of agricultural water management under uncertainty the model framework and solving method could also be applied to other similar regions to help develop better water allocation schemes and improve the effectiveness of agricultural water management however the corresponding solving method is worthy of continual exploration in our future studies through taking spatial variability of rainfall into account declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10743,recent studies have shown that the permanent wilting point is influenced by soil properties and plant drought tolerance mechanisms this study was designed to evaluate the soil matric potential at which the biological wilting point bwpplant of wheat and barley cultivars occurs compared to the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa for soils pwpsoil with contrasting textures the study was performed under greenhouse conditions with the experiment arranged in a completely randomised design in a double factorial scheme with three soil textures sandy loam sl sandy clay loam scl and clay c and four plants two crops wheat and barley and two cultivars for each crop the 95 confidence intervals were used to compare treatment means the results revealed that bwpplant could occur at matric potential values 15 000 hpa i e wetter conditions than for the classical pwpsoil plants cultivated in clay soils withered at lower matric potentials than those in sandy soils which could be related to a hydraulic cut off that occurs at higher matric potentials in sandy soils barley plants were more sensitive to water deficits than wheat plants the bwpplant for barley plants could occur at matric potentials values 15 000 hpa independently of soil texture whereas wheat plants wilted at matric potentials 15 000 hpa only in sandy soils e g 1 637 to 2 417 hpa our results suggest that wilting depends on soil texture with an occurrence of wilting at higher matric potentials i e at wetter soil conditions for sandy soils than for clay soils furthermore plants cultivars exhibit various tolerance mechanisms to drought and wheat is able to take up water at considerably lower matric potentials at dryer soil conditions than barley thus the wilting matric potential threshold across various species and cultivars is not uniform keywords soil water deficit plant wilting hydraulic cut off soil water retention 1 introduction the production of wheat and barley in brazil is concentrated in the southern region both represent important grain cereals that are the nutritional basis of humans and animals worldwide giraldo et al 2019 in southern brazil these crops are cultivated in soils with contrasting textures both crops can be grown in a wide range of climatic conditions but drought stress associated with limitations in water availability sallam et al 2019 makes water management one of the main challenges of modern agriculture in large cultivated fields wu et al 2007 these challenges are even more acute due to and the warming climate and the predicted associated increase in drought occurrence sallam et al 2019 as well as because of the requirements of a more sustainable agro food system kaab et al 2019 soil is the main source of water uptake by plant roots and microorganisms hosseini et al 2016 and governs the water storage for the sustainability of ecosystems for many years the lowest available water content limit for plants has been considered the so called permanent wilting point e g silva et al 1994 asgarzadeh et al 2014 lima et al 2016 which refers to the soil water content at which the leaves of a plant growing in the soil reach an irrecoverable wilting even under saturated atmospheric conditions furr and reeve 1945 tolk 2003 this classical concept is derived from the pioneering studies of briggs and shantz 1912 veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 and richards and weaver 1943 who determined the wilting points for a wide range plant species grown in different soils and concluded that different species of plants withered at similar matric potentials independent of soil texture after the advances in the understanding of the relationship between plant wilting and soil water content the study of richards and weaver 1943 was crucial to the adoption of the now classic wilting point concept used by soil scientists which defines the permanent wilting point as the water content retained in the soil under a matric potential ψ of 15 000 hpa soil wilting point pwpsoil this concept is therefore related to soil water energy and considered independent of soil texture due to the difficulty of applying the concept described by tolk 2003 in plant wilting studies for determining a biological permanent wilting point which involves plant monitoring and devices for maintaining saturated atmospheric conditions the pwpsoil was accepted by many scientists e g silva et al 1994 groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2010 2014 lima et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 to designate the lower limit of soil available water content for plants experimental results on the soil matric potential at the onset of wilting show a rather high variability this matric potential ranged from 15 000 hpa for cotton gossypium hirsutum l field conditions and sorghum sorghum bicolor l greenhouse conditions savage et al 1996 22 000 to 30 000 hpa for maize zea mays l hsieh et al 1972 and 37 000 hpa for pepper capsicum spp rawlins et al 1968 angus and herwaarden 2001 found that wheat plants could grow at a matric potential between 30 000 and 50 000 hpa cabelguenne and debaeke 1998 report that plants can absorb water from soil at potentials much lower than 15 000 hpa whereas savage et al 1996 concluded that a soil water potential of 15 000 hpa is appropriate and corresponds closely to the lower limit of soil water availability angus and herwaarden 2001 argue that these results impinge on the long running debate about the generality of a permanent wilting point threshold at which plants could not maintain normal growth in a recent study dexter et al 2012 discussed the occurrence of a hydraulic cut off point which may occur at values of ψ 15 000 hpa the authors defined the hydraulic cut off point as the point related to water content and soil matric potential at which the water flow ceases even under a pressure gradient at this point the soil hydraulic conductivity becomes low enough that the water flow could be considered negligible groenevelt et al 2001 dexter et al 2012 and water uptake by the plants is no longer physically possible czyż and dexter 2012 reported that the absence of flow in porous media due to the hydraulic cut off could be the explanation for the findings of briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 who suggested that plants of different species tended to wilt at similar water contents in the same soil this hydraulic cut off is a specific soil property dependent on texture czyż and dexter 2012 dexter et al 2012 determined that the hydraulic cut off occurred at lower matric potentials in clay soils in addition to evidence that the values of ψ for permanent wilting point are dependent on soil properties and not on a fixed value e g 15 000 hpa plants exhibit various tolerance resistance mechanisms to water deficit in relation with a variety of morphological and physiological processes e g clark and hiller 1973 de jong van lier et al 2006 hosseini et al 2016 the classic gardner s model 1960 indicates how plants with high root density reduce the water transport distance between roots and thus facilitate the flow of water to the surface of the roots de jong van lier et al 2006 suggested that the lower limit of water availability for plants is dependent on soil hydraulic functions and root density which act as important components in the control of transpiration rates hosseini et al 2016 verified that fungal endophytes show a higher ability to absorb water at lower soil matric potentials due to drought tolerance mechanisms their study indicated that the permanent wilting point was both soil and plant dependent these recent studies by dexter et al 2012 czyż and dexter 2012 and hosseini et al 2016 have demonstrated that factors related to soil properties and mechanisms of plant tolerance to water deficits interact to determine plant wilting but experimental investigations are still scarce and therefore the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at 15 000 hpa is still widely accepted in this study we hypothesise that the water conditions at which the biological wilt of the plants occurs would be different from that obtained at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa and is governed by soil texture characteristics and plant tolerance mechanisms to water deficits therefore we evaluated the water content and soil matric potentials at which biological wilting of wheat and barley cultivars occurred in comparison to the water content measured using the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa for soils with contrasting textures 2 material and methods 2 1 soil characterisation three oxisols classified as haplorthox in the usa soil taxonomy

experiment is given in table 2 2 3 experimental details plastic pots were used for setting up the experimental units first the soil was naturally air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve pots 0 20 m in height and 0 10 m in diameter were filled with 3 60 kg of soil reaching a mean bulk density of 1 20 mg m 3 for all soils the soil was compacted within the pot in three layers to obtain uniformity for the overall bulk density to avoid soil loss during the experiment a fine plastic mesh was placed at the bottom of each pot another plastic cover was placed at top of the pot to avoid excessive evaporation an irrigation system was initially tested and then installed to allow continuous water supply to the plants under the same matric potential a ceramic filter triple action type stefani 5 cm in diameter and 7 cm in height was installed in the middle of the pots fig 1 a carefully covered with soil and connected to a pipe fig 1b medici et al 2010 the pipe connected to the filter within the pots was also connected to a water reservoir placed at exactly 0 5 m below the pot fig 1c the irrigation system allowed the maintenance of the soil matric potential at 50 hpa during the experiment 2 4 plant species soil fertilisation seeding and experimental design in this study a combination of two crops and two cultivars was used for each soil texture wheat triticum aestivum cv nobre and triticum aestivum cv mestre and barley hordeum vulgare cv brs brau and hordeum vulgare cv anag 01 nutritional needs for the crops were calculated according to the fertilizer and liming guide cqfs rs sc 2004 each pot received solids fertilisers mixed with soil about 150 mg dm 3 300 kg ha 1 of p 20 of p2o5 in single superphosphate 80 mg dm 3 of k 60 of k2o in potassium chloride and 40 mg dm 3 80 kg ha 1 of n 20 of n in ammonium sulphate based on the previous soil chemical analysis seeds of wheat cultivars nobre and mestre and barley brs brau and anag 01 were sown at a depth of 0 02 m within the pots five per pot on the 14th day four plants were removed and only one most developed was kept the experiment was arranged in a completely randomised design in a double factorial scheme with three soil texture classes and four plants two species and two cultivars with 10 replicates totalling 120 experimental units 3 4 10 i e 120 plastic pots see fig 1d the irrigation system remained operational during the whole experimental period to maintain a constant water supply to the soil fig 1a b and c after 45 d the water supply was cut off and additional plastic sheets were placed on top of the pots to avoid water loss by evaporation fig 1e during the experiment temperature and relative humidity were monitored the average temperature recorded in the greenhouse was 25 7 c with an average humidity of 75 3 8 2 5 determination of the matric potential at the biological wilting point and water retention curve after cutting off the water supply we waited for the first signs of biological wilting e g leaf wilting the plants with wilting signs were placed in a special dark house saturated using a portable nebuliser with an air saturation close to 100 for 12 h the plants that recovered their turgor after 12 h in the dark saturated room were again placed in the greenhouse this procedure was repeated until the plant did not recover turgor anymore the plants that did not reach turgor were considered biologically unrecoverable reichardt 1988 at that time we assumed this unrecoverable physiological condition as the biological wilting point bwpplant following the concept given by furr and reeve 1945 and tolk 2003 see introduction section after determining the bwpplant the surface sealing i e the plastic was removed from the top of the pots the plant was cut and about 0 030 kg of soil was sampled from the pots approximately 0 015 kg of soil was weighed and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h in order to determine the gravimetric water content w at the biological wilting point pwpplant the other 0 015 kg of soil was saturated in small rings of known volume and subjected to a matric potential of 15 000 hpa in a pressure plate apparatus in order to measure the soil water content at the classical permanent wilting point of the soil pwpsoil within the pots soil cores were sampled with rings 0 05 m in height and diameter packed and carefully conditioned for transportation to the lab the cores were saturated by capillary rise and equilibrated to one of the following matric potentials 10 20 40 60 80 or 100 hpa using a tension table and 3 000 5 000 7000 or 15 000 hpa using the pressure plate apparatus after equilibration cores were weighed and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h for the determination of the gravimetric water content 2 6 calculations soil water retention curve data for all soil texture classes were fitted using the genuchten model van genuchten 1980 eq 1 expressed as a function of water content subsequently we applied eq 1 and estimated the matric potential ψ in eq 1 at the soil water content corresponding to the biological wilting point bwpplant which was measured when the plants had reached biological wilting see section 2 4 eq 1 1 ψ 1 α θ θ r θ s θ r n 1 n 1 1 n where θ is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 inputted herein as the water content at the biological wilting point θs is the volumetric water content at saturation m3 m 3 θr is the residual water content m3 m 3 and α along with n are the shape fitted parameters of the soil water retention curve the θr was found numerically to provide the same values of the measured water content at 15 000 hpa θ15 000 thus θr and θ15 000 present different values see table 3 but eq 1 provides θr θ15 000 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance was fitted to the experimental data in a completely randomised design with a double factorial scheme 3 4 with 10 replicates the factors consisted of three soil textural classes sandy loam soil sandy clay loam and clay soil and four plant species cultivars wheat cv nobre wheat cv mestre barley cv brs brau and barley cv anag 01 confidence intervals of 95 were used for comparing treatment means the statistical procedures were performed using the r package expdes available for the r software r core team 2018 3 results the parameters of the soil water retention curve wrc which were fitted to a van genuchten model 1980 to establish the relationship between volumetric water content θ and matric potential ψ are shown in table 3 the wrc values for c scl and sl soils fitted by the genuchten model are shown in fig 2 as expected the estimated θr extracted at 15 000 hpa from the wrc as well as the measured water content at 15 000 hpa θ15 000 herein assumed to be the permanent wilting point of soil pwpsoil were higher for the soil with higher clay content and decreased in the sequence clay c sandy clay loam scl sandy loam sl although there was a full description of the wrc and the perception of contrast among the textural classes c scl and sl for the curve shape differences in α and n between soils we emphasise that in this study we have special interest in the dry zone of the curve because our study focuses on low water content low matric potential and wilting point which is strongly influenced by soil textural porosity dexter 2004 there were differences in the absolute values of θ for c scl and sl at the dry zone e g from 1 000 to 15 000 hpa but only a slight variation of θ from 1 000 to 15 000 hpa within each soil as is typical of the expected variation of soil water content under low matric potentials dexter 2004 dexter et al 2012 analysis of variance of the water content at the biological wilting point bwpplant showed no significant interaction for the textural classes and plants statistically only the soil texture effect was significant figs 3 and 4 show the distribution of the average values of the bwpplant and 95 confidence interval for the effects of textural classes and plants respectively as well as the corresponding matric potential calculated using bwpplant averages and the confidence interval range overall water content at the bwpplant was higher than water content at the pwpsoil in all textural classes fig 3a indicating that the plants withered at wetter soil water conditions than pwpsoil this effect can also be visualised in terms of the matric potential for which bwpplant averages were higher than 15 000 hpa fig 3b for the scl soil some plants wilted at a matric potential 15 000 hpa fig 4a shows the means and respective confidence intervals 95 for θ at the bwpplant of the mestre m and nobre n cultivar wheat plants and for the anag 01 a and brs brau b cultivar barley plants the horizontal red line represents the value of θ at 15 000 hpa i e pwpsoil values of θ at the wilting of the two wheat cultivars were similar to the pwpsoil indicated by the overlapping confidence intervals for θ at the pwpsoil fig 4a also shows the θ at the bwpplant for barley plants in all soils and for both cultivars θ was higher for bwpplant than for pwpsoil i e θ at the bwpplant θ at the pwpsoil although there was a slight overlap of the confidence intervals for cultivar anag 01 in clay soil fig 4b shows the ψ estimated as a function of θ at the bwpplant using the genuchten model eq 1 the red horizontal line represents the theoretical value of the pwpsoil at 15 000 hpa differently from what was found for the values of θ between bwpplant and pwpsoil shown in fig 4a for the wheat crop there was a strong variation in ψ depending on soil and cultivar due to differences promoted by the high variation of the matric potential for a small variation of water content at the dry zone of the water retention curve for the c soil the mean bwpplant was close to the theoretical pwpsoil 15 000 hpa with an overlap of the 95 confidence interval ranging from 8 469 to 38 027 hpa for the nobre cultivar in the scl soil the soil matric potential corresponding to the mean bwpplant was 42 413 hpa and lower than pwpsoil reflecting drier soil conditions beyond the pwpsoil however for the slc soil the mean matric potential at bwpplant for the mestre cv was equivalent to 15 000 hpa but with a high variability in the 4 446 to 118 753 hpa range for the sl soil the mean bwpplant of both wheat cultivars mestre 1 637 hpa nobre 2 417 hpa reached the highest values of ψ fig 4b the bwpplant was significantly higher than 15 000 hpa at the 95 confidence interval which indicates that the bwpplant occurred at wetter soil conditions than the pwpsoil fig 4b for all soils both barley cultivars reached the mean bwpplant at wetter soil conditions than the pwpsoil additionally the barley plants reached the mean bwpplant first in the sl soil anag 01 909 hpa brs brau 459 hpa then in the scl soil anag 01 3 492 hpa brs brau 2 871 hpa and finally in the c soil anag 01 11 140 hpa brs brau 3703 hpa although there was no statistical difference due to the overlapping of the confidence intervals the plants of the brs brau cultivar reached the mean pwpplant at wetter conditions than the anag 01 plants fig 4a a summary of the averages of θ and ψ at the bwpplant as well as the upper and lower limits is given in table 4 4 discussion variations in water content at the pwpsoil among soils with different textures resulted in scenarios with considerable differences in the retained water content under the same retention energy fig 2 higher water contents were observed for the soils with higher clay contents at pwpsoil fig 3 since the clay fraction contributes to the formation of micropores dexter 2004 zaffar and sheng gao 2015 which increases the volume of capillary pores and the specific surface area tuller et al 1999 on the other hand the results showed a strong variation for θ and ψ at the bwpplant while the values of θ were relatively close between bwpplant and pwpsoil the estimated ψ values were quite different at the dry zone of the wrc small variations of θ resulted in large variations of ψ this makes θ a less sensitive and poor measure to detect water energy changes in soils with an extremely low matric potential however ψ may extensively vary showing that the matric potential may be a better measure than the water content to verify the threshold at which bwpplant occurs although from a practical point of view the water content would be more easily estimated the mean matric potential at plant wilting decreased fig 3 from soils with lower clay to those with higher clay contents i e the wilting point occurred at lower matric potentials for clay soils than for sandy soils this means that the clay content interfered considerably with the water supply for plants under high energy conditions dexter et al 2012 argued that after the drainage of the structural porosity the pore network through which water can flow by a difference in water potential is quite limited highly reducing the hydraulic conductivity in dry soil conditions the authors then suggested that a hydraulic cut off occurs when the flow of water in the soil virtually ceases even under a significant potential gradient water flow at water contents lower than those at which the hydraulic cut occurs i e under drier soil conditions would only occur by vapor diffusion processes since under these conditions the water would be retained by adsorption forces and remain as water film on the surface of the soil particles tuller et al 1999 this means that water supply to roots would be halted after the hydraulic cut off the concept of hydraulic cut off has been discussed by dexter et al 2012 based on the principles of hydraulic equilibrium the concept of hydraulic equilibrium is usually related to the concept of the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil since it corresponds to the water content at which the hydraulic conductivity of the soil becomes sufficiently small so that the flow of water can be considered negligible groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2014 dexter et al 2012 in this sense dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 related the hydraulic cut off to the clay content and indicated that the water flow in the pores ceases at higher ψ values in sandy soils which is consistent with our results they suggest that for soils with approximately 20 28 clay the hydraulic cut off would occur close to the classical value of the pwpsoil in terms of the matric potential fig 5 shows the empirical equations obtained by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 and our experimental matric potential at the bwpplant which describes the relation of the hydraulic cut off as a function of the clay content and the matric potential of soil for biological wilting of wheat and barley the distribution of bwpplant as a function of the clay content shows that except for the wheat nobre cultivar in the scl soil barley and wheat plants withered at a matric potential much smaller than those obtained by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 fig 5 however if the magnitude of water potential differs the trend of plants to wither at a lower matric potential for a lower clay content follows the empirical trend of the hydraulic cut off from dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 this demonstrates that in addition to the soil textural effect plant drought tolerance mechanisms of particular species and cultivars may have a considerable importance in plant wilting stating what angus and herwaarden 2001 have found in this study it was not our objective to relate the absolute values estimated by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 with the bwpplant but rather to show through a soil plant system experiment based on the hydraulic cut off theory that the water flow will be interrupted at higher matric potentials i e higher ψ in sandy soils than in clay soils based on this evidence the soil water flow has first ceased for the sl soil then for the scl soil and finally for the c soil in such a way that the plants reached the bwpplant in response to the hydraulic cut off besides the positive relationship between clay content and bwpplant plant species and cultivars showed distinct responses to the hydraulic cut off this means that clay soils had a greater ability to provide water to plants under high retention energy i e dry soil conditions but on the other hand plants have individual abilities to uptake the water retained at these low matric potentials to this respect wheat plants had a greater ability to resist the water deficit while barley plants were more sensitive however the nobre wheat and anag 01 barley cultivars were more resistant in that the bwpplant occurred under lower matric potential values a sequence of the plants ability to resist to the water deficit based on our findings could be as follows wheat nobre mestre barley anag 01 brs brau the results of this study differ from those obtained in the pioneering studies of briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 because our findings do not suggest a single matric potential regardless of the soil texture for which plants wither they found that for different plant species grown on different soils plants withered under similar retention energies supporting the concept of a permanent wilting point as a physical soil property that established the lower limit of water availability for plants these studies provided strong evidence that the permanent wilting point was functionally defined by soil characteristics while our results indicate that the ability of the plant to continue to uptake water retained at low matric potentials was also a determinant for the biological wilting point of the plants used in this study when plants are exposed to drought stress they can more or less adapt to tolerate this stress which induces morphological biochemical physiological and molecular changes beudez et al 2013 sallam et al 2019 this includes physiological and genetics parameters which were however not the scope of this study in addition to the genetic characteristics reductions in uptake and translocation of macro nutrients have been reported in various plant species which are affected by the decrease in the soil matric potential i e as the soil dries angus and herwaarden 2001 found an additional water extraction beyond 15 000 hpa in response to n fertilisation sallam et al 2019 argue that when the water content in the soil decreases nutrients in soil mobility decrease moreover a low water content reduces the active transport and membrane permeability of cations thus resulting in decreased absorption of these cations via roots this means that the nutritional requirement of each crop variety also results in resistance to water stress which makes an understanding of the reaction of wheat and barley cultivars to low matric potentials more complex however what seems clear is that barley plants were less tolerant to water stress the ability of plants to take up water under conditions of water stress can also be influenced by soil matrix salinity and pathogens czyż and dexter 2012 tolk 2003 observed that in the same soil corn plants withered at higher water contents than sorghum plants she attributed these results to the growth of sorghum roots which allowed water uptake at greater depths hosseini et al 2016 argued that biological interactions such as the interaction of roots and fungi could lead plants to draw water under high retention energies by testing the physiological parameters for six barley cultivars under different water stress conditions santos et al 2008 found that one of the cultivars was able to maintain the highest water content in the leaf tissues when submitted to a water deficit based on the evidence that there was an influence of soil plant interactions on water uptake czyż and dexter 2012 concluded that the wilting of plants under water deficit i e low matric potential resulted from a complex interaction between soil and plant conditions physiological mechanisms see sallam et al 2019 which were not investigated in this study can contribute to the plants not showing signs of wilting even under hydraulic cut off of the soil water flow for example santos et al 2008 found that drought conditioned wheat plants during previous events had greater resistance to leaf transpiration when compared to those not previously exposed to water deficits the authors concluded that these plants had developed a protection system to reduce water loss this means that physiological morphological and adaptive mechanisms can condition plants to resist wilting under water deficits supporting the observations of czyż and dexter 2012 that the permanent wilting point results from a complex interaction between soil and plant conditions for which the soil has a texture dependent hydraulic cut off value overall our results show that soil texture and crop species have a relevant effect on determining the lower available water content limit for plants this may have considerable implications for agricultural water management since the accuracy of soil water balance models which can use water retention parameters is important for efficient water management and for simulating crop performance usually these models calculate the difference between the upper and lower water contents in the plant root zone savage et al 1996 argue that there is more uncertainty in the upper limit determination but based on our findings a lower limit will be a challenge for water management when soil texture and varied crops are considered 5 conclusions in this study we experimentally evaluated the soil water contents and matric potentials at which wheat and barley cultivars wilted and compared those values to the classical permanent wilting point considered to be 15 000 hpa of soils with contrasting textures the results revealed that the biological wetting of plants can occur at matric potentials values 15 000 hpa i e under wetter conditions than the theoretical reference matric potential given by the conceptual permanent wilting point plants grown in clay soils withered at lower matric potentials i e drier soil conditions than in sandy soils and this is compatible with a hydraulic cut off this suggests that the water flow in porous media may nearly cease under low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity conditions occurring at higher matric potentials i e wetter soil conditions for soils with lower clay contents our results suggest that barley plants may be more sensitive to water deficits than wheat plants the permanent wilting point for barley plants may occur at matric potential values 15 000 hpa independently of the soil textural class while wheat plants can wilt at matric potential values 15 000 hpa only in sandy soils e g 1 637 to 2 417 hpa generally wheat plants may be able to better adapt under water deficits our results suggest that wilting depends on soil texture with an occurrence of wilting at higher matric potentials i e at wetter soil conditions for sandy soils than for clay soils furthermore plants cultivars exhibit various tolerance mechanisms to drought and it is shown here that wheat is able to take up water at a considerably lower matric potential at dryer soil conditions than barley thus the wilting matric potential threshold across the various species and cultivars is not uniform future studies could focus on other plant species and soils in temperate regions to improve our understanding of soil plant relationships at lower water contents

10743,recent studies have shown that the permanent wilting point is influenced by soil properties and plant drought tolerance mechanisms this study was designed to evaluate the soil matric potential at which the biological wilting point bwpplant of wheat and barley cultivars occurs compared to the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa for soils pwpsoil with contrasting textures the study was performed under greenhouse conditions with the experiment arranged in a completely randomised design in a double factorial scheme with three soil textures sandy loam sl sandy clay loam scl and clay c and four plants two crops wheat and barley and two cultivars for each crop the 95 confidence intervals were used to compare treatment means the results revealed that bwpplant could occur at matric potential values 15 000 hpa i e wetter conditions than for the classical pwpsoil plants cultivated in clay soils withered at lower matric potentials than those in sandy soils which could be related to a hydraulic cut off that occurs at higher matric potentials in sandy soils barley plants were more sensitive to water deficits than wheat plants the bwpplant for barley plants could occur at matric potentials values 15 000 hpa independently of soil texture whereas wheat plants wilted at matric potentials 15 000 hpa only in sandy soils e g 1 637 to 2 417 hpa our results suggest that wilting depends on soil texture with an occurrence of wilting at higher matric potentials i e at wetter soil conditions for sandy soils than for clay soils furthermore plants cultivars exhibit various tolerance mechanisms to drought and wheat is able to take up water at considerably lower matric potentials at dryer soil conditions than barley thus the wilting matric potential threshold across various species and cultivars is not uniform keywords soil water deficit plant wilting hydraulic cut off soil water retention 1 introduction the production of wheat and barley in brazil is concentrated in the southern region both represent important grain cereals that are the nutritional basis of humans and animals worldwide giraldo et al 2019 in southern brazil these crops are cultivated in soils with contrasting textures both crops can be grown in a wide range of climatic conditions but drought stress associated with limitations in water availability sallam et al 2019 makes water management one of the main challenges of modern agriculture in large cultivated fields wu et al 2007 these challenges are even more acute due to and the warming climate and the predicted associated increase in drought occurrence sallam et al 2019 as well as because of the requirements of a more sustainable agro food system kaab et al 2019 soil is the main source of water uptake by plant roots and microorganisms hosseini et al 2016 and governs the water storage for the sustainability of ecosystems for many years the lowest available water content limit for plants has been considered the so called permanent wilting point e g silva et al 1994 asgarzadeh et al 2014 lima et al 2016 which refers to the soil water content at which the leaves of a plant growing in the soil reach an irrecoverable wilting even under saturated atmospheric conditions furr and reeve 1945 tolk 2003 this classical concept is derived from the pioneering studies of briggs and shantz 1912 veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 and richards and weaver 1943 who determined the wilting points for a wide range plant species grown in different soils and concluded that different species of plants withered at similar matric potentials independent of soil texture after the advances in the understanding of the relationship between plant wilting and soil water content the study of richards and weaver 1943 was crucial to the adoption of the now classic wilting point concept used by soil scientists which defines the permanent wilting point as the water content retained in the soil under a matric potential ψ of 15 000 hpa soil wilting point pwpsoil this concept is therefore related to soil water energy and considered independent of soil texture due to the difficulty of applying the concept described by tolk 2003 in plant wilting studies for determining a biological permanent wilting point which involves plant monitoring and devices for maintaining saturated atmospheric conditions the pwpsoil was accepted by many scientists e g silva et al 1994 groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2010 2014 lima et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 to designate the lower limit of soil available water content for plants experimental results on the soil matric potential at the onset of wilting show a rather high variability this matric potential ranged from 15 000 hpa for cotton gossypium hirsutum l field conditions and sorghum sorghum bicolor l greenhouse conditions savage et al 1996 22 000 to 30 000 hpa for maize zea mays l hsieh et al 1972 and 37 000 hpa for pepper capsicum spp rawlins et al 1968 angus and herwaarden 2001 found that wheat plants could grow at a matric potential between 30 000 and 50 000 hpa cabelguenne and debaeke 1998 report that plants can absorb water from soil at potentials much lower than 15 000 hpa whereas savage et al 1996 concluded that a soil water potential of 15 000 hpa is appropriate and corresponds closely to the lower limit of soil water availability angus and herwaarden 2001 argue that these results impinge on the long running debate about the generality of a permanent wilting point threshold at which plants could not maintain normal growth in a recent study dexter et al 2012 discussed the occurrence of a hydraulic cut off point which may occur at values of ψ 15 000 hpa the authors defined the hydraulic cut off point as the point related to water content and soil matric potential at which the water flow ceases even under a pressure gradient at this point the soil hydraulic conductivity becomes low enough that the water flow could be considered negligible groenevelt et al 2001 dexter et al 2012 and water uptake by the plants is no longer physically possible czyż and dexter 2012 reported that the absence of flow in porous media due to the hydraulic cut off could be the explanation for the findings of briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 who suggested that plants of different species tended to wilt at similar water contents in the same soil this hydraulic cut off is a specific soil property dependent on texture czyż and dexter 2012 dexter et al 2012 determined that the hydraulic cut off occurred at lower matric potentials in clay soils in addition to evidence that the values of ψ for permanent wilting point are dependent on soil properties and not on a fixed value e g 15 000 hpa plants exhibit various tolerance resistance mechanisms to water deficit in relation with a variety of morphological and physiological processes e g clark and hiller 1973 de jong van lier et al 2006 hosseini et al 2016 the classic gardner s model 1960 indicates how plants with high root density reduce the water transport distance between roots and thus facilitate the flow of water to the surface of the roots de jong van lier et al 2006 suggested that the lower limit of water availability for plants is dependent on soil hydraulic functions and root density which act as important components in the control of transpiration rates hosseini et al 2016 verified that fungal endophytes show a higher ability to absorb water at lower soil matric potentials due to drought tolerance mechanisms their study indicated that the permanent wilting point was both soil and plant dependent these recent studies by dexter et al 2012 czyż and dexter 2012 and hosseini et al 2016 have demonstrated that factors related to soil properties and mechanisms of plant tolerance to water deficits interact to determine plant wilting but experimental investigations are still scarce and therefore the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at 15 000 hpa is still widely accepted in this study we hypothesise that the water conditions at which the biological wilt of the plants occurs would be different from that obtained at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa and is governed by soil texture characteristics and plant tolerance mechanisms to water deficits therefore we evaluated the water content and soil matric potentials at which biological wilting of wheat and barley cultivars occurred in comparison to the water content measured using the classic concept of the permanent wilting point at a matric potential of 15 000 hpa for soils with contrasting textures 2 material and methods 2 1 soil characterisation three oxisols classified as haplorthox in the usa soil taxonomy

temperature of 18 7 c 2 2 soil sampling and characterisation disturbed soil samples were sampled for each soil textural class and the fractions sand silt and clay were quantified according to the hydrometer method as described by gee and or 2002 soil organic matter som was obtained using the walkley black method in accordance with the procedure described by teixeira et al 2017 chemical

the base sum bs k ca2 mg2 the cation exchange capacity cec h al3 bs and the base saturation of cec v bs cec were calculated finally the ph in water ph was determined by the electrochemical measurement of the effective concentration of h ions in the soil solution using a combined electrode inserted in a 1 2 5 soil water solution the summary of the chemical properties of the soils used in the experiment is given in table 2 2 3 experimental details plastic pots were used for setting up the experimental units first the soil was naturally air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve pots 0 20 m in height and 0 10 m in diameter were filled with 3 60 kg of soil reaching a mean bulk density of 1 20 mg m 3 for all soils the soil was compacted within the pot in three layers to obtain uniformity for the overall bulk density to avoid soil loss during the experiment a fine plastic mesh was placed at the bottom of each pot another plastic cover was placed at top of the pot to avoid excessive evaporation an irrigation system was initially tested and then installed to allow continuous water supply to the plants under the same matric potential a ceramic filter triple action type stefani 5 cm in diameter and 7 cm in height was installed in the middle of the pots fig 1 a carefully covered with soil and connected to a pipe fig 1b medici et al 2010 the pipe connected to the filter within the pots was also connected to a water reservoir placed at exactly 0 5 m below the pot fig 1c the irrigation system allowed the maintenance of the soil matric potential at 50 hpa during the experiment 2 4

each pot received solids fertilisers mixed with soil about 150 mg dm 3 300 kg ha 1 of p 20 of p2o5 in single superphosphate 80 mg dm 3 of k 60 of k2o in potassium chloride and 40 mg dm 3 80 kg ha 1 of n 20 of n in ammonium sulphate based on the previous soil chemical analysis seeds of wheat cultivars nobre and mestre and barley brs brau and anag 01 were sown at a depth of 0 02 m within the pots five per pot on the 14th day four plants were removed and only one most developed was kept the experiment was arranged in a completely randomised design in a double factorial scheme with three soil texture classes and four plants two species and two cultivars with 10 replicates totalling 120 experimental units 3 4 10 i e 120 plastic pots see fig 1d the irrigation system remained operational during the whole experimental period to maintain a constant water supply to the soil fig 1a b and c after 45 d the water supply was cut off and additional plastic sheets were placed on top of the pots to avoid water loss by evaporation fig 1e during the experiment temperature and relative humidity were monitored the average temperature recorded in the greenhouse was 25 7 c with an average humidity of 75 3 8 2 5 determination of the matric potential at the biological wilting point and water retention curve after cutting off the water supply we waited for the first signs of biological wilting e g leaf wilting the plants with wilting signs were placed in a special dark house saturated using a portable nebuliser with an air saturation close to 100 for 12 h the plants that recovered their turgor after 12 h in the dark saturated room were again placed in the greenhouse this procedure was repeated until the plant did not recover turgor anymore the plants that did not reach turgor were considered biologically unrecoverable reichardt 1988 at that time we assumed this unrecoverable physiological condition as the biological wilting point bwpplant following the concept given by furr and reeve 1945 and tolk 2003 see introduction section after determining the bwpplant the surface sealing i e the plastic was removed from the top of the pots the plant was cut and about 0 030 kg of soil was sampled from the pots approximately 0 015 kg of soil was weighed and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h in order to determine the gravimetric water content w at the biological wilting point pwpplant the other 0 015 kg of soil was saturated in small rings of known volume and subjected to a matric potential of 15 000 hpa in a pressure plate apparatus in order to measure the soil water content at the classical permanent wilting point of the soil pwpsoil within the pots soil cores were sampled with rings 0 05 m in height and diameter packed and carefully conditioned for transportation to the lab the cores were saturated by capillary rise and equilibrated to one of the following matric potentials 10 20 40 60 80 or 100 hpa using a tension table and 3 000 5 000 7000 or 15 000 hpa using the pressure plate apparatus after equilibration cores were weighed and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h for the determination of the gravimetric water content 2 6 calculations soil water retention curve data for all soil texture classes were fitted using the genuchten model van genuchten 1980 eq 1 expressed as a function of water content subsequently we applied eq 1 and estimated the matric potential ψ in eq 1 at the soil water content corresponding to the biological wilting point bwpplant which was measured when the plants had reached biological wilting see section 2 4 eq 1 1 ψ 1 α θ θ r θ s θ r n 1 n 1 1 n where θ is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 inputted herein as the water content at the biological wilting point θs is the volumetric water content at saturation m3 m 3 θr is the residual water content m3 m 3 and α along with n are the shape fitted parameters of the soil water retention curve the θr was found numerically to provide the same values of the measured water content at 15 000 hpa θ15 000 thus θr and θ15 000 present different values see table 3 but eq 1 provides θr θ15 000 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance was fitted to the experimental data in a completely randomised design with a double factorial scheme 3 4 with 10 replicates the factors consisted of three soil textural classes sandy loam soil sandy clay loam and clay soil and four plant species cultivars wheat cv nobre wheat cv mestre barley cv brs brau and barley cv anag 01 confidence intervals of 95 were used for comparing treatment means the statistical procedures were performed using the r package expdes available for the r software r core team 2018 3 results the parameters of the soil water retention curve wrc which were fitted to a van genuchten model 1980 to establish the relationship between volumetric water content θ and matric potential ψ are shown in table 3 the wrc values for c scl and sl soils fitted by the genuchten model are shown in fig 2 as expected the estimated θr extracted at 15 000 hpa from the wrc as well as the measured water content at 15 000 hpa θ15 000 herein assumed to be the permanent wilting point of soil pwpsoil were higher for the soil with higher clay content and decreased in the sequence clay c sandy clay loam scl sandy loam sl although there was a full description of the wrc and the perception of contrast among the textural classes c scl and sl for the curve shape differences in α and n between soils we emphasise that in this study we have special interest in the dry zone of the curve because our study focuses on low water content low matric potential and wilting point which is strongly influenced by soil textural porosity dexter 2004 there were differences in the absolute values of θ for c scl and sl at the dry zone e g from 1 000 to 15 000 hpa but only a slight variation of θ from 1 000 to 15 000 hpa within each soil as is typical of the expected variation of soil water content under low matric potentials dexter 2004 dexter et al 2012 analysis of variance of the water content at the biological wilting point bwpplant showed no significant interaction for the textural classes and plants statistically only the soil texture effect was significant figs 3 and 4 show the distribution of the average values of the bwpplant and 95 confidence interval for the effects of textural classes and plants respectively as well as the corresponding matric potential calculated using bwpplant averages and the confidence interval range overall water content at the bwpplant was higher than water content at the pwpsoil in all textural classes fig 3a indicating that the plants withered at wetter soil water conditions than pwpsoil this effect can also be visualised in terms of the matric potential for which bwpplant averages were higher than 15 000 hpa fig 3b for the scl soil some plants wilted at a matric potential 15 000 hpa fig 4a shows the means and respective confidence intervals 95 for θ at the bwpplant of the mestre m and nobre n cultivar wheat plants and for the anag 01 a and brs brau b cultivar barley plants the horizontal red line represents the value of θ at 15 000 hpa i e pwpsoil values of θ at the wilting of the two wheat cultivars were similar to the pwpsoil indicated by the overlapping confidence intervals for θ at the pwpsoil fig 4a also shows the θ at the bwpplant for barley plants in all soils and for both cultivars θ was higher for bwpplant than for pwpsoil i e θ at the bwpplant θ at the pwpsoil although there was a slight overlap of the confidence intervals for cultivar anag 01 in clay soil fig 4b shows the ψ estimated as a function of θ at the bwpplant using the genuchten model eq 1 the red horizontal line represents the theoretical value of the pwpsoil at 15 000 hpa differently from what was found for the values of θ between bwpplant and pwpsoil shown in fig 4a for the wheat crop there was a strong variation in ψ depending on soil and cultivar due to differences promoted by the high variation of the matric potential for a small variation of water content at the dry zone of the water retention curve for the c soil the mean bwpplant was close to the theoretical pwpsoil 15 000 hpa with an overlap of the 95 confidence interval ranging from 8 469 to 38 027 hpa for the nobre cultivar in the scl soil the soil matric potential corresponding to the mean bwpplant was 42 413 hpa and lower than pwpsoil reflecting drier soil conditions beyond the pwpsoil however for the slc soil the mean matric potential at bwpplant for the mestre cv was equivalent to 15 000 hpa but with a high variability in the 4 446 to 118 753 hpa range for the sl soil the mean bwpplant of both wheat cultivars mestre 1 637 hpa nobre 2 417 hpa reached the highest values of ψ fig 4b the bwpplant was significantly higher than 15 000 hpa at the 95 confidence interval which indicates that the bwpplant occurred at wetter soil conditions than the pwpsoil fig 4b for all soils both barley cultivars reached the mean bwpplant at wetter soil conditions than the pwpsoil additionally the barley plants reached the mean bwpplant first in the sl soil anag 01 909 hpa brs brau 459 hpa then in the scl soil anag 01 3 492 hpa brs brau 2 871 hpa and finally in the c soil anag 01 11 140 hpa brs brau 3703 hpa although there was no statistical difference due to the overlapping of the confidence intervals the plants of the brs brau cultivar reached the mean pwpplant at wetter conditions than the anag 01 plants fig 4a a summary of the averages of θ and ψ at the bwpplant as well as the upper and lower limits is given in table 4 4 discussion variations in water content at the pwpsoil among soils with different textures resulted in scenarios with considerable differences in the retained water content under the same retention energy fig 2 higher water contents were observed for the soils with higher clay contents at pwpsoil fig 3 since the clay fraction contributes to the formation of micropores dexter 2004 zaffar and sheng gao 2015 which increases the volume of capillary pores and the specific surface area tuller et al 1999 on the other hand the results showed a strong variation for θ and ψ at the bwpplant while the values of θ were relatively close between bwpplant and pwpsoil the estimated ψ values were quite different at the dry zone of the wrc small variations of θ resulted in large variations of ψ this makes θ a less sensitive and poor measure to detect water energy changes in soils with an extremely low matric potential however ψ may extensively vary showing that the matric potential may be a better measure than the water content to verify the threshold at which bwpplant occurs although from a practical point of view the water content would be more easily estimated the mean matric potential at plant wilting decreased fig 3 from soils with lower clay to those with higher clay contents i e the wilting point occurred at lower matric potentials for clay soils than for sandy soils this means that the clay content interfered considerably with the water supply for plants under high energy conditions dexter et al 2012 argued that after the drainage of the structural porosity the pore network through which water can flow by a difference in water potential is quite limited highly reducing the hydraulic conductivity in dry soil conditions the authors then suggested that a hydraulic cut off occurs when the flow of water in the soil virtually ceases even under a significant potential gradient water flow at water contents lower than those at which the hydraulic cut occurs i e under drier soil conditions would only occur by vapor diffusion processes since under these conditions the water would be retained by adsorption forces and remain as water film on the surface of the soil particles tuller et al 1999 this means that water supply to roots would be halted after the hydraulic cut off the concept of hydraulic cut off has been discussed by dexter et al 2012 based on the principles of hydraulic equilibrium the concept of hydraulic equilibrium is usually related to the concept of the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil since it corresponds to the water content at which the hydraulic conductivity of the soil becomes sufficiently small so that the flow of water can be considered negligible groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2014 dexter et al 2012 in this sense dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 related the hydraulic cut off to the clay content and indicated that the water flow in the pores ceases at higher ψ values in sandy soils which is consistent with our results they suggest that for soils with approximately 20 28 clay the hydraulic cut off would occur close to the classical value of the pwpsoil in terms of the matric potential fig 5 shows the empirical equations obtained by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 and our experimental matric potential at the bwpplant which describes the relation of the hydraulic cut off as a function of the clay content and the matric potential of soil for biological wilting of wheat and barley the distribution of bwpplant as a function of the clay content shows that except for the wheat nobre cultivar in the scl soil barley and wheat plants withered at a matric potential much smaller than those obtained by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 fig 5 however if the magnitude of water potential differs the trend of plants to wither at a lower matric potential for a lower clay content follows the empirical trend of the hydraulic cut off from dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 this demonstrates that in addition to the soil textural effect plant drought tolerance mechanisms of particular species and cultivars may have a considerable importance in plant wilting stating what angus and herwaarden 2001 have found in this study it was not our objective to relate the absolute values estimated by dexter et al 2012 and czyż and dexter 2012 with the bwpplant but rather to show through a soil plant system experiment based on the hydraulic cut off theory that the water flow will be interrupted at higher matric potentials i e higher ψ in sandy soils than in clay soils based on this evidence the soil water flow has first ceased for the sl soil then for the scl soil and finally for the c soil in such a way that the plants reached the bwpplant in response to the hydraulic cut off besides the positive relationship between clay content and bwpplant plant species and cultivars showed distinct responses to the hydraulic cut off this means that clay soils had a greater ability to provide water to plants under high retention energy i e dry soil conditions but on the other hand plants have individual abilities to uptake the water retained at these low matric potentials to this respect wheat plants had a greater ability to resist the water deficit while barley plants were more sensitive however the nobre wheat and anag 01 barley cultivars were more resistant in that the bwpplant occurred under lower matric potential values a sequence of the plants ability to resist to the water deficit based on our findings could be as follows wheat nobre mestre barley anag 01 brs brau the results of this study differ from those obtained in the pioneering studies of briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 because our findings do not suggest a single matric potential regardless of the soil texture for which plants wither they found that for different plant species grown on different soils plants withered under similar retention energies supporting the concept of a permanent wilting point as a physical soil property that established the lower limit of water availability for plants these studies provided strong evidence that the permanent wilting point was functionally defined by soil characteristics while our results indicate that the ability of the plant to continue to uptake water retained at low matric potentials was also a determinant for the biological wilting point of the plants used in this study when plants are exposed to drought stress they can more or less adapt to tolerate this stress which induces morphological biochemical physiological and molecular changes beudez et al 2013 sallam et al 2019 this includes physiological and genetics parameters which were however not the scope of this study in addition to the genetic characteristics reductions in uptake and translocation of macro nutrients have been reported in various plant species which are affected by the decrease in the soil matric potential i e as the soil dries angus and herwaarden 2001 found an additional water extraction beyond 15 000 hpa in response to n fertilisation sallam et al 2019 argue that when the water content in the soil decreases nutrients in soil mobility decrease moreover a low water content reduces the active transport and membrane permeability of cations thus resulting in decreased absorption of these cations via roots this means that the nutritional requirement of each crop variety also results in resistance to water stress which makes an understanding of the reaction of wheat and barley cultivars to low matric potentials more complex however what seems clear is that barley plants were less tolerant to water stress the ability of plants to take up water under conditions of water stress can also be influenced by soil matrix salinity and pathogens czyż and dexter 2012 tolk 2003 observed that in the same soil corn plants withered at higher water contents than sorghum plants she attributed these results to the growth of sorghum roots which allowed water uptake at greater depths hosseini et al 2016 argued that biological interactions such as the interaction of roots and fungi could lead plants to draw water under high retention energies by testing the physiological parameters for six barley cultivars under different water stress conditions santos et al 2008 found that one of the cultivars was able to maintain the highest water content in the leaf tissues when submitted to a water deficit based on the evidence that there was an influence of soil plant interactions on water uptake czyż and dexter 2012 concluded that the wilting of plants under water deficit i e low matric potential resulted from a complex interaction between soil and plant conditions physiological mechanisms see sallam et al 2019 which were not investigated in this study can contribute to the plants not showing signs of wilting even under hydraulic cut off of the soil water flow for example santos et al 2008 found that drought conditioned wheat plants during previous events had greater resistance to leaf transpiration when compared to those not previously exposed to water deficits the authors concluded that these plants had developed a protection system to reduce water loss this means that physiological morphological and adaptive mechanisms can condition plants to resist wilting under water deficits supporting the observations of czyż and dexter 2012 that the permanent wilting point results from a complex interaction between soil and plant conditions for which the soil has a texture dependent hydraulic cut off value overall our results show that soil texture and crop species have a relevant effect on determining the lower available water content limit for plants this may have considerable implications for agricultural water management since the accuracy of soil water balance models which can use water retention parameters is important for efficient water management and for simulating crop performance usually these models calculate the difference between the upper and lower water contents in the plant root zone savage et al 1996 argue that there is more uncertainty in the upper limit determination but based on our findings a lower limit will be a challenge for water management when soil texture and varied crops are considered 5 conclusions in this study we experimentally evaluated the soil water contents and matric potentials at which wheat and barley cultivars wilted and compared those values to the classical permanent wilting point considered to be 15 000 hpa of soils with contrasting textures the results revealed that the biological wetting of plants can occur at matric potentials values 15 000 hpa i e under wetter conditions than the theoretical reference matric potential given by the conceptual permanent wilting point plants grown in clay soils withered at lower matric potentials i e drier soil conditions than in sandy soils and this is compatible with a hydraulic cut off this suggests that the water flow in porous media may nearly cease under low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity conditions occurring at higher matric potentials i e wetter soil conditions for soils with lower clay contents our results suggest that barley plants may be more sensitive to water deficits than wheat plants the permanent wilting point for barley plants may occur at matric potential values 15 000 hpa independently of the soil textural class while wheat plants can wilt at matric potential values 15 000 hpa only in sandy soils e g 1 637 to 2 417 hpa generally wheat plants may be able to better adapt under water deficits our results suggest that wilting depends on soil texture with an occurrence of wilting at higher matric potentials i e at wetter soil conditions for sandy soils than for clay soils furthermore plants cultivars exhibit various tolerance mechanisms to drought and it is shown here that wheat is able to take up water at a considerably lower matric potential at dryer soil conditions than barley thus the wilting matric potential threshold across the various species and cultivars is not uniform future studies could focus on other plant species and soils in temperate regions to improve our understanding of soil plant relationships at lower water contents

10744,co2 fertilization has been widely used in greenhouse cultivation of tomato solanum lycopersicum to enhance fruit yield its effects on fruit quality remain largely elusive yet particularly in combination with reduced irrigation regimes to explore the response of tomato to the co2 fertilization under reduced irrigation tomato cv zhou si dun plants were grown under ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and elevated co2 e co2 800 ppm environment respectively and subjected to three irrigation levels since anthesis i1 irrigated to 90 95 water holding capacity of the mixture in the pot whc i2 irrigated to 70 75 whc and i3 irrigated to 50 55 whc the results showed that fruit yield was significantly higher in plants with i1 than those with i3 moreover the e co2 enhanced the number of fruit and decreased the percentage of small fruit 70 g resulting in higher fruit yield as compared to a co2 leaf area la fruit dry weight fdw water use efficiency wue as well as harvest index hi were increased under e co2 whereas irrigation regime had no influence on fdw wue or hi both reduced irrigation and e co2 increased total soluble solid vitamin c and lycopene content while decreased nitrate content in fruit the results of pca principal component analysis indicated that there was a significant improvement in the comprehensive performance of plants with reduced irrigation at e co2 environment it can be concluded that reduced irrigation combined with co2 fertilization could be a promising strategy to enhance fruit quality in greenhouse tomato production under water limited conditions keywords co2 fertilization reduced irrigation greenhouse production water use efficiency fruit quality 1 introduction tomato is tasty and nutritional and constitutes an important source of minerals vitamins and antioxidants that are essential for human health to obtain acceptable yield the crop requires substantial amount of irrigation water chapagain and orr 2009 while climate change has led to water scarcity in many parts of the world hanjra and qureshi 2010 resulting in grievous limitation on the production of tomatoes therefore it is essential to develop irrigation strategies to enhance water use efficiency wue without compromising yield and fruit quality deficit irrigation which uses less water compared with full crop evapotranspiration requirement fereres and soriano 2007 is widely practiced in many areas with limited water resources pereira et al 2002 as a water saving irrigation strategy deficit irrigation has been applied in many crops among others tomato wang et al 2015 potato liu et al 2008 and wheat mugabe and nyakatawa 2000 besides deficit irrigation could not only reduce the amount of irrigation water fereres and soriano 2007 but also enhance the wue kang et al 2000 and water productivity geerts and raes 2009 moreover earlier studies have indicated that reduced irrigation improves fruit quality including hardness contents of total soluble sugar vitamin c vc patanè and cosentino 2010 and mineral nutrients in fruit juice of tomatoes wei et al 2018 carbon dioxide co2 a primary molecule driving plant photosynthetic process has a direct impact on vegetative growth as well as crop yield burkey et al 2012 for the past few years rising co2 concentration in the atmosphere has received increasing global concern particularly in the field of agricultural science most researches carried out in greenhouse have focused on the effect of co2 enrichment or called co2 fertilization on improving the growth and biomass of crop long et al 2004 for a wider range of crop species a common consensus has been that co2 elevation increases leaf photosynthetic rate while reducing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate leakey et al 2009 resulting in an improvement of wue pazzagli et al 2016 furthermore it has been evidenced that tomato yield significantly increased with co2 fertilization korres et al 2016 enhanced growth and yield of plants grown under elevated co2 environment has been found in many crop species which however are often accompanied by a reduced crop nutritive quality myers et al 2014 elevated co2 decreases carotenoids and lycopene content in tomato mamatha et al 2014 and reduces the content of several micronutrients in lettuce and spinach giri et al 2016 this negative effect of elevated co2 on crop quality has led to the conclusion that it potentially exacerbates the prevalence of the hidden hunger for human nutrition loladze 2014 thus it is important to investigate if co2 fertilization would negatively affect tomato fruit quality in greenhouse production and whether such effect could be eliminated by reduced irrigation therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the combined effect of irrigation regimes and co2 fertilization on tomato yield and quality and to explore the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in the climate controlled greenhouse of northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the tomato cv zhou si dun were grown in either ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm or elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm respectively at day night air temperature of 23 16 2 c relative humidity of 60 65 and under long day 16 h of light at 500 μmol m 2 s 1 8 h of dark conditions from july to november 2018 tomato seedlings obtained from breeding center of yangling were transplanted into 13 liter pots in the greenhouse filled with peat substrate and sand mixture 5 1 in volume the substrate contained 90 organic matter with a ph of 5 9 the mixture had a water holding capacity of 25 in volumetric water content 2 0 g n as ammonium sulfate 1 6 g p and 2 0 g k as monopotassium phosphate were applied with irrigation water after transplanting 2 2 treatments the tomato seedlings were placed in two greenhouse chambers of a co2 and e co2 respectively each growth chamber was equipped with a co2 monitor which controlled the co2 concentrations over the experimental period by connecting with an automated co2 adjustable valve installed on a special high pressure gas cylinder tomato seedlings were well watered to 90 of the water holding capacity of the mixture in the pot whc over the first three weeks then three irrigation treatments were imposed from the fourth week after transplanting these included i1 plants irrigated with 90 95 of whc i e 4 86 5 13 kg i2 plants irrigated with 70 75 of whc i e 3 78 4 05 kg i3 plants irrigated with 50 55 of whc i e 2 70 2 97 kg for minimizing the evaporation losses perlite was used to cover the soil surface before onset of the irrigation regimes each treatment had four replicates pots the pots were weighed daily in the afternoon at 15 00 and watered daily by hand with tap water and the volume of water used for irrigation was recorded the irrigation treatments were lasted for 40 days until the fruits from the first truss reached red mature 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant growth and development at onset of the irrigation treatment four pots from each co2 growth environment were harvested and the shoot dry matter dm 0 001 g of plant and the soil water content in the pot were determined after 40 days onset of the irrigation treatments the above ground plants were harvested with four pots per treatment leaf area la 0 01 cm2 fruit number fn fruit fresh weight fw 0 01 g and dry weight dw 0 001 g of each plant were determined after harvest la was measured with a portable leaf area meter li 3000c li cor usa the dw was registered after drying at 75 c in an oven to constant weight the average single fruit fresh weight sfw 0 01 g was calculated as the ratio between fw and fn harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of fruit dw fdw to the total dw tdw above the ground 2 3 2 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was estimated using the following formula wue δdm wu where δdm is total dry matter accumulated from the first harvest to the final harvest and wu is plant water use during the irrigation treatment period which is calculated as the total volume of irrigation water used during the irrigation treatment period plus the soil water changes between the onset and the end of the irrigation treatment in the pot 2 3 3 fruit quality at final harvest red matured fruits from the first truss four replicates per irrigation treatment at both co2 growth conditions were collected for quality analysis vitamin c vc lycopene nitrate total soluble solid tss contents and fruit hardness were determined vc lycopene and

their interactions co2 irri on the measured variables using the spss statistics software version 18 0 ibm electronics according to wang et al 2015 the principal component analysis pca was performed for tomato yield wue and fruit quality attributes to assess the comprehensive effects of different treatments on crop performance 3 results 3 1 fruit yield at the final harvest the fruit number of i3 treatment decreased by an average of 17 7 compared with i1 treatment while i2 plants had similar fruit number to the i1 plants moreover there was an average of 8 7 increase of the fruit number due to the co2 enrichment regardless of irrigation regimes though the differences were not statistically significant p 0 45 fig 1 a the proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g was significantly affected by co2 p 0 001 and irri p 0 001 as well as co2 irri p 0 05 i3 treatment enhanced the ratio of small fruits 70 g with an average 13 5 increase relatively to i1 and e co2 significantly lowered the proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g compare to a co2 the combination of i2 and e co2 treatment resulted in the least proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g fig 1b single fruit fresh weight sfw was not affected by the irrigation treatment while it was significantly p 0 05 affected by co2 growth environment where e co2 increased sfw in relation to a co2 fig 1c e co2 slightly increased the fruit fresh weight even if the differences were not statistically significant whereas i3 significantly p 0 05 reduced it as compared to i1 and i2 treatments fig 1d 3 2 leaf area water use water use efficiency and harvest index leaf area la of tomato plants was significantly affected by co2 p 0 05 and irri p 0 001 under e co2 growth environment la increased by 3 3 compared with the treatment with a co2 growth environment moreover compared with i1 both i2 and i3 decreased la table 1 total dry matter accumulation from the first to the final harvest δdm was only significantly p 0 05 affected by irri and i3 had 16 7 lower δdm than i1 during the irrigation treatment period plant water use wu was affected significantly by irri p 0 001 and co2 irri p 0 05 wu in plants grown under i2 and i3 were

a co2 compared to i1 and i2 i3 plants had greater wue although the difference was not significant fruit dry weight fdw was significantly p 0 05 affected by co2 whereas the total dry weight of plant tdw were significantly p 0 05 affected by irri plants grown under e co2 increased fdw by 25 1 than those grown under a co2 while e co2 had non significant impact on tdw i2 and i3 had decreased tdw by 5 5 and 14 4 relatively to i1 respectively table 1 regarding hi a significant p 0 05 increase was noticed by e co2 in relation to a co2 whereas irrigation had no effect on hi 3 3 fruit quality the fruit quality attributes were analyzed in the red matured fruit from the first truss as the phenological development of the tomato plants was not influenced by any of the treatments the setting time of those fruits were quite similar thus it would not affect the fruit quality the responses of tomato quality to irrigation regimes under e co2 and a co2 are shown in figs 2 and 3 fruit hardness was affected only by irrigation management p 0 05 fig 2 i3 treatment resulted in the greatest fruit hardness at both co2 growth environments being 25 higher than that measured in the i1 treatment vc content was affected by co2 irri as well as co2 irri with the differences at significant level p 0 001 the fruits grown at e co2 had greater vc content than those grown at a co2 among the irrigation regimes i3 led to significantly higher vc content in tomato fruit as compared to i1 and i2 treatments fig 3a e co2 significantly p 0 001 increased the lycopene content while reduced irrigation i3 also enhanced the content of lycopene in tomato fruit fig 3b both co2 and irrigation regimes significantly p 0 001 affected tss in tomato fruit plants grown at e co2 had significantly greater tss than those grown at a co2 and tss increased with declining in the irrigation volume fig 3c in addition fruit nitrate content was also significantly affected by all factors both e co2 and reduced irrigation decreased fruit nitrate content with highly significant level p 0 001 furthermore e co2 associated with i3 treatment resulted in the lowest nitrate content in tomato fruit fig 3d 3 4 principal component analysis pca for comprehensive performance evaluation pca was conducted using seven different variables namely fruit yield wue and fruit quality attributes the results showed that the first two principal components explained 88 95 of total variance so pc1 and pc2 were extracted in the data set the loading plots for different variables fig 4 a showed that pc1 mainly integrated the quality parameters of tomato the vc lycopene and tss were found positive deviation distribution while nitrate located in the lower left indicating that the bigger pc1 accompanied with higher tomato quality furthermore pc2 focused on integrating the fw and wue of tomato and these two parameters located on the top half of the scatterplot suggesting that fw and wue increased with the enhancement of pc2 the pca scores for the results of tomato under irrigation regimes i1 i2 i3 in both co2 growth environments in the final harvest on pc1 and pc2 fig 4b intuitively reflected the relationship between treatments and pc1 pc2 the treatment 800 i3 was situated in the upper right corner of the plot alone indicating that plants of i3 under e co2 possessed higher yield and quality as compared with those grown under other treatments the treatment 400 i1 was found in the lower left quarter of the plot illustrating that the yield and quality of this treatment have been negatively affected by the treatment moreover the ranking of the treatments based on comprehensive score of pca is shown in table 2 which directly manifested the priority of the comprehensive impact of different treatments on plants the 800 i3 treatment topped the list followed by 400 i3 800 i2 800 i1 400 i2 and 400 i1 treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of reduced irrigation regimes on tomato yield and quality tomato as a water intensive crop chapagain and orr 2009 showed a decreased la table 1 fn and size of individual fruit under reduced irrigation regimes fig 1a and 1b even the decrease of the fn and fruit size were only noticed in i3 treatment consequently the fruit yield significantly p 0 05 decreased with the lowest irrigation volume treatment fig 1d in accordance with this numerous studies have demonstrated that reduction of irrigation volume at certain levels constrained fruit number and yield coyago cruz et al 2019 kirda et al 2004 favati et al 2009 patanè and cosentino 2010 while the average fruit number and yield of i2 treatment was not reduced in relation to i1 treatment disregarding the co2 concentration in addition the yield of i2 was slightly higher than that in i1 under e co2 fig 1d which could be attributed to the following reasons 1 irrigating the plants to a soil water content 25 less than the whc in i2 did not really impose drought stress on tomato plants 2 e co2 could attenuate the negative impact of drought by stimulating photosynthesis robredo et al 2007 hereby sustaining the fruit yield deficit irrigation is an effective strategy for water saving under conditions of water scarcity earlier studies have demonstrated that reduced irrigation regimes could decrease wu and enhance wue with a certain degree of yield loss in tomato plants akhtar et al 2014 the increased wue has been mainly attributed to the role of the root to shoot aba abscisic acid signaling inducing partial stomatal closure which curtails the transpiration rate while sustaining the photosynthetic rates liu et al 2005 here i2 treatment did not lead to an increase in wue of plants as compared to i1 treatment though the wu was significantly reduced by the decrease of irrigation volume table 1 the reasons behind this unexpected changes in wue under i2 were unknown could be due to the cultivar used in the current experiment differed from those used in other studies where an increase of wue was observed under reduced irrigation treatments wang et al 2010 furthermore the cultivar used in this experiment showed a larger decrease in δdm than wu of the i2 treatment as compared to the i1 treatment owing to this the wue of i2 was lower than i1 irrigation treatment not only influences tomato yield but also affects fruit quality favati et al 2009 chen et al 2013 coyago cruz et al 2019 in the present study fruit quality attributes of tomato including hardness tss vc and lycopene contents were increased by reduced irrigation regimes figs 2 and 3 most interestingly under both co2 growth conditions i3 treatment brought about a great improvement in the quality parameters as exemplified by the ranking of the comprehensive score of pca table 2 in line with this patanè and cosentino 2010 reported that reduced irrigation led to an increase of fruit hardness which benefited for fruit storage tss is a pivotal factor for fruit quality as it involves all dissolved solids including sugars acids amino acids minerals and other soluble substance balibrea et al 2006 chen et al 2013 noted that the increased tss content was due to reduced water uptake which caused a lower dilution of solutes in the fruits under reduced irrigation it was also observed that reduced irrigation was beneficial for vc accumulation which was likely attributed to the rise of sugar content consequently stimulating vc synthesis of tomato fruit during the maturation period additionally reduced irrigation regime could depress plant vegetative growth increasing the exposure of fruits to light which was also beneficial for the accumulation of vc gautier et al 2009 lycopene is a determinant factor in facilitating red color formation of tomato fruit and its content could be greatly affected by irrigation management favati et al 2009 found that tomatoes grown under reduced irrigation had an increased lycopene content which was in good agreement with the results of the present study fig 3b this may be due to higher ethylene production in fruits under reduced irrigation as ethylene promotes ripening and boosts lycopene accumulation pulupol et al 1996 with respect to nitrate content in tomato fruit i1 treated plants resulted in the highest value as compared with the reduced irrigation regimes fig 3d nitrate could convert into nitrites and which may be detrimental for human health ward et al 2018 in this respect reduced irrigation is preferable for reducing nitrate content in tomato fruits in relation to full irrigation treatment 4 2 effects of elevated co2 on fruit yield and quality the response of crop plants to e co2 has been intensively researched burkey et al 2012 fang et al 2019 in general e co2 enhances crop yield but depresses crop quality particularly in cereals myers et al 2014 in tomato plants here the study found that e co2 led to greater fn and lower percent of small fruits as compared with plants grown at a co2 fig 1a and b in line with the findings by pazzagli et al 2016 in addition e co2 significantly improved la wue and hi table 1 increase of la and wue under e co2 is consistent with results reported in previous studies which has been attributed to the enhanced photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance and transpration rate liu et al 2019 leakey et al 2009 on the other hand the effect of co2 enrichment on hi was not consistent as indicated by li et al 2018 who reported that e co2 had no markable effects on hi when considering the hardness there was a controversial effect of e co2 on tomato fruit farneti et al 2013 stated that higher co2 levels enhanced fruit hardness however klieber et al 1996 found e co2 had no effect on fruit hardness in this study a slight decrease in hardeness of tomato fruit was observed when grown under e co2 fig 2 hardness is mainly relevant to maturity stage and air temperature zheng et al 2013 it is widely accepted that ethylene is crucial in fruit ripening and e co2 promoted the production of ethylene zhang et al 2014 therefore e co2 resulted in greater maturity of tomato fruit compared with a co2 which probably induced the reduction of hardness unlike findings reported in cereals myers et al 2014 in the present study a beneficial effect of e co2 on fruit quality in terms of tss vc and lycopene content was observed fig 3 the achieved results were in good agreement with other study on tomato bisbis et al 2018 who also reported increased tss and vc content in tomato fruits grown under e co2 compared with a co2 e co2 generated greater soluble sugar even in leaf which could be translocated into fruit leading to an increase of tss dong et al 2018 vc is an important antioxidant for human health and co2 enrichment increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the vc content mamatha et al 2014 resulting in a better nutritive value and quality of tomato zhang et al 2014 regarding the lycopene controversial effects of e co2 have been reported in contrast to the finding of this study helyes et al 2011 found that e co2 decreased lycopene content in fruit of tomato in cultivar korall and uno on the contrary and in line with the results of this study zhang et al 2014 documented that lycopene content in cultivar jinpeng increased by co2 enrichment the discrepancy among the aforementioned studies could be due to the different tomato cultivars to the maturity stage of the tested fruits or to the temperature difference of growth environment as lycopene content of tomato is largely dependent on the cultivar climate conditions management regimes and maturity stage helyes et al 2011 becatti et al 2009 indicated that lycopene was positively correlated with ethylene apart from this zhang et al 2014 suggested that e co2 advanced ethylene production during the maturity stage of tomato hence the lycopene content in tomato fruit was increased under e co2 moreover collins et al 2006 reported that potassium k and phosphorus p are necessary for lycopene biosynthesis and an increase of k and p to some extent could lead to improve the lycopene content a recent study revealed that e co2 increases the uptake of k and p in tomato fruit wei et al 2018 which might have contributed to the increase in lycopene content furthermore we observed that e co2 was favorable to reduce the nitrate content of tomato fruit fig 3d it is known that a proper increase of air co2 concentration sitimulates the activity of nitrate reductase hofmann et al 2013 and this is likely the reason for the lowered nitrate content in tomato furit under e co2 the response of tomato quality to e co2 is complicated and merits further investigations 4 3 effects of reduced irrigation combined with elevated co2 on fruit yield and quality in the present study there was no interactive effects of reduced irrigation and co2 on tomato fruit yield fig 1d wue table 1 hardness fig 2 lycopene fig 3b and tss content fig 3c nevertheless vc and nitrate contents were strongly affected by the interaction of reduced irrigation and co2 where plants treated with i3 together with e co2 had greater vc and less nitrate content without impairing lycopene or tss helyes et al 2011 suggested that tomato plants grown at e co2 could cope better with moderate drought which might be responsible for the increase of tomato fruit quality under e co2 coupled with reduced irrigation pca a credible statistical approach has been used to evaluate the comprehensive response to irrigation regimes in tomato plants wang et al 2015 wei et al 2018 as shown in table 2 treatment 800 i3 took the first place among the six treatments indicating that tomato plants grown at e co2 and reduced irrigation had the best comprehensive performance table 2 therefore for greenhouse tomato production where co2 fertilization is used reduced irrigation could be recommended as a good strategy to enhance fruit quality as well as crop wue 5 conclusions the present study suggested that reduced irrigation under elevated co2 growth environment can increase fruit quality including nutritional quality total soluble solid vitamin c and lycopene and health quality nitrate however the water use efficiency was not enhanced by reduced irrigation as expected which might be dependent on the specific cultivar on the other hand elevated co2 could enhance leaf area fruit yield quality as well as water use efficiency of tomato which ameliorates the detrimental effect of reduced irrigation in short co2 as a gas fertilizer associated with reduced irrigation is a great tactic for quality

10744,co2 fertilization has been widely used in greenhouse cultivation of tomato solanum lycopersicum to enhance fruit yield its effects on fruit quality remain largely elusive yet particularly in combination with reduced irrigation regimes to explore the response of tomato to the co2 fertilization under reduced irrigation tomato cv zhou si dun plants were grown under ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and elevated co2 e co2 800 ppm environment respectively and subjected to three irrigation levels since anthesis i1 irrigated to 90 95 water holding capacity of the mixture in the pot whc i2 irrigated to 70 75 whc and i3 irrigated to 50 55 whc the results showed that fruit yield was significantly higher in plants with i1 than those with i3 moreover the e co2 enhanced the number of fruit and decreased the percentage of small fruit 70 g resulting in higher fruit yield as compared to a co2 leaf area la fruit dry weight fdw water use efficiency wue as well as harvest index hi were increased under e co2 whereas irrigation regime had no influence on fdw wue or hi both reduced irrigation and e co2 increased total soluble solid vitamin c and lycopene content while decreased nitrate content in fruit the results of pca principal component analysis indicated that there was a significant improvement in the comprehensive performance of plants with reduced irrigation at e co2 environment it can be concluded that reduced irrigation combined with co2 fertilization could be a promising strategy to enhance fruit quality in greenhouse tomato production under water limited conditions keywords co2 fertilization reduced irrigation greenhouse production water use efficiency fruit quality 1 introduction tomato is tasty and nutritional and constitutes an important source of minerals vitamins and antioxidants that are essential for human health to obtain acceptable yield the crop requires substantial amount of irrigation water chapagain and orr 2009 while climate change has led to water scarcity in many parts of the world hanjra and qureshi 2010 resulting in grievous limitation on the production of tomatoes therefore it is essential to develop irrigation strategies to enhance water use efficiency wue without compromising yield and fruit quality deficit irrigation which uses less water compared with full crop evapotranspiration requirement fereres and soriano 2007 is widely practiced in many areas with limited water resources pereira et al 2002 as a water saving irrigation strategy deficit irrigation has been applied in many crops among others tomato wang et al 2015 potato liu et al 2008 and wheat mugabe and nyakatawa 2000 besides deficit irrigation could not only reduce the amount of irrigation water fereres and soriano 2007 but also enhance the wue kang et al 2000 and water productivity geerts and raes 2009 moreover earlier studies have indicated that reduced irrigation improves fruit quality including hardness contents of total soluble sugar vitamin c vc patanè and cosentino 2010 and mineral nutrients in fruit juice of tomatoes wei et al 2018 carbon dioxide co2 a primary molecule driving plant photosynthetic process has a direct impact on vegetative growth as well as crop yield burkey et al 2012 for the past few years rising co2 concentration in the atmosphere has received increasing global concern particularly in the field of agricultural science most researches carried out in greenhouse have focused on the effect of co2 enrichment or called co2 fertilization on improving the growth and biomass of crop long et al 2004 for a wider range of crop species a common consensus has been that co2 elevation increases leaf photosynthetic rate while reducing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate leakey et al 2009 resulting in an improvement of wue pazzagli et al 2016 furthermore it has been evidenced that tomato yield significantly increased with co2 fertilization korres et al 2016 enhanced growth and yield of plants grown under elevated co2 environment has been found in many crop species which however are often accompanied by a reduced crop nutritive quality myers et al 2014 elevated co2 decreases carotenoids and lycopene content in tomato mamatha et al 2014 and reduces the content of several micronutrients in lettuce and spinach giri et al 2016 this negative effect of elevated co2 on crop quality has led to the conclusion that it potentially exacerbates the prevalence of the hidden hunger for human nutrition loladze 2014 thus it is important to investigate if co2 fertilization would negatively affect tomato fruit quality in greenhouse production and whether such effect could be eliminated by reduced irrigation therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the combined effect of irrigation regimes and co2 fertilization on tomato yield and quality and to explore the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in the climate controlled greenhouse of northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the tomato cv zhou si dun were grown in either ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm or elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm respectively at day night air temperature of 23 16 2 c relative humidity of 60 65 and under long day 16 h of light at 500 μmol m 2 s 1 8 h of dark conditions from july to november 2018 tomato seedlings obtained from breeding center of yangling were transplanted into 13 liter pots in the greenhouse filled with peat substrate and sand mixture 5 1 in volume the substrate contained 90 organic matter with a ph of 5 9 the mixture had a water holding capacity of 25 in volumetric water content 2 0 g n as ammonium sulfate 1 6 g p and 2 0 g k as monopotassium phosphate were applied with irrigation water after transplanting 2 2 treatments the tomato seedlings were placed in two greenhouse chambers of a co2 and e co2 respectively each growth chamber was equipped with a co2 monitor which controlled the co2 concentrations over the experimental period by connecting with an automated co2 adjustable valve installed on a special high pressure gas cylinder tomato seedlings were well watered to 90 of the water holding capacity of the mixture in the pot whc over the first three weeks then three irrigation treatments were imposed from the fourth week after transplanting these included i1 plants irrigated with 90 95 of whc i e 4 86 5 13 kg i2 plants irrigated with 70 75 of whc i e 3 78 4 05 kg i3 plants irrigated with 50 55 of whc i e 2 70 2 97 kg for minimizing the evaporation losses perlite was used to cover the soil surface before onset of the irrigation regimes each treatment had four replicates pots the pots were weighed daily in the afternoon at 15 00 and watered daily by hand with tap water and the volume of water used for irrigation was recorded the irrigation treatments were lasted for 40 days until the fruits from the first truss reached red mature 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant growth and development at onset of the irrigation treatment four pots from each co2 growth environment were harvested and the shoot dry matter dm 0 001 g of plant and the soil water content in the pot were determined after 40 days onset of the irrigation treatments the above ground plants were harvested with four pots per treatment leaf area la 0 01 cm2 fruit number fn fruit fresh weight fw 0 01 g and dry weight dw 0 001 g of each plant were determined after harvest la was measured with a portable leaf area meter li 3000c li cor usa the dw was registered after drying at 75 c in an oven to constant weight the average single fruit fresh weight sfw 0 01 g was calculated as the ratio between fw and fn harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of fruit dw fdw to the total dw tdw above the ground 2 3 2 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was estimated using the following formula wue δdm wu where δdm is total dry matter accumulated from the first harvest to the final harvest and wu is plant water use during the irrigation treatment period which is calculated as the total volume of irrigation water used during the irrigation treatment period plus the soil water changes between the onset and the end of the irrigation treatment in the pot 2 3 3 fruit quality at final harvest red matured fruits from the first truss four replicates per irrigation treatment at both co2 growth conditions were collected for quality analysis vitamin c vc lycopene nitrate total soluble solid tss contents and fruit hardness were determined vc lycopene and nitrate contents were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer thermo fisher usa tss was estimated by a digital refractometer link co ltd fruit hardness was tested with fruit hardness tester at 20 c gy 3 apli china 2 4 statistical analysis all data were expressed as mean standard error two way anova was applied to reveal the effects of co2 concentration co2 and irrigation regime irri as well as their interactions co2 irri on the measured variables using the spss statistics software version 18 0 ibm electronics according to wang et al 2015 the principal component analysis pca was performed for tomato yield wue and fruit quality attributes to assess the comprehensive effects of different treatments on crop performance 3 results 3 1 fruit yield at the final harvest the fruit number of i3 treatment decreased by an average of 17 7 compared with i1 treatment while i2 plants had similar fruit number to the i1 plants moreover there was an average of 8 7 increase of the fruit number due to the co2 enrichment regardless of irrigation regimes though the differences were not statistically significant p 0 45 fig 1 a the proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g was significantly affected by co2 p 0 001 and irri p 0 001 as well as co2 irri p 0 05 i3 treatment enhanced the ratio of small fruits 70 g with an average 13 5 increase relatively to i1 and e co2 significantly lowered the proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g compare to a co2 the combination of i2 and e co2 treatment resulted in the least proportion of fruit weight lower than 70 g fig 1b single fruit fresh weight sfw was not affected by the irrigation treatment while it was significantly p 0 05 affected by co2 growth environment where e co2 increased sfw in relation to a co2 fig 1c e co2 slightly increased the fruit fresh weight even if the differences were not statistically significant whereas i3 significantly p 0 05 reduced it as compared to i1 and i2 treatments fig 1d 3 2 leaf area water use water use efficiency and harvest index leaf area la of tomato plants was significantly affected by co2 p 0 05 and irri p 0 001 under e co2 growth environment la increased by 3 3 compared with the treatment with a co2 growth environment moreover compared with i1 both i2 and i3 decreased la table 1 total dry matter accumulation from the first to the final harvest δdm was only significantly p 0 05 affected by irri and i3 had 16 7 lower δdm than i1 during the irrigation treatment period plant water use wu was affected significantly by irri p 0 001 and co2 irri p 0 05 wu in plants grown under i2 and i3 were 5 8 and 17 1 lower than that the corresponding obtained in i1 respectively table 1 wue was only affected by co2 and plants grown at e co2 resulted in greater wue than that obtained for plants grown at a co2 compared to i1 and i2 i3 plants had greater wue although the difference was not significant fruit dry weight fdw was significantly p 0 05 affected by co2 whereas the total dry weight of plant tdw were significantly p 0 05 affected by irri plants grown under e co2 increased fdw by 25 1 than those grown under a co2 while e co2 had non significant impact on tdw i2 and i3 had decreased tdw by 5 5 and 14 4 relatively to i1 respectively table 1 regarding hi a significant p 0 05 increase was noticed by e co2 in relation to a co2 whereas irrigation had no effect on hi 3 3 fruit quality the fruit quality attributes were analyzed in the red matured fruit from the first truss as the phenological development of the tomato plants was not influenced by any of the treatments the setting time of those fruits were quite similar thus it would not affect the fruit quality the responses of tomato quality to irrigation regimes under e co2 and a co2 are shown in figs 2 and 3 fruit hardness was affected only by irrigation management p 0 05 fig 2 i3 treatment resulted in the greatest fruit hardness at both co2 growth environments being 25 higher than that measured in the i1 treatment vc content was affected by co2 irri as well as co2 irri with the differences at significant level p 0 001 the fruits grown at e co2 had greater vc content than those grown at a co2 among the irrigation regimes i3 led to significantly higher vc content in tomato fruit as compared to i1 and i2 treatments fig 3a e co2 significantly p 0 001 increased the lycopene content while reduced irrigation i3 also enhanced the content of lycopene in tomato fruit fig 3b both co2 and irrigation regimes significantly p 0 001 affected tss in tomato fruit plants grown at e co2 had significantly greater tss than those grown at a co2 and tss increased with declining in the irrigation volume fig 3c in addition fruit nitrate content was also significantly affected by all factors both e co2 and reduced irrigation decreased fruit nitrate content with highly significant level p 0 001 furthermore e co2 associated with i3 treatment resulted in the lowest nitrate content in tomato fruit fig 3d 3 4 principal component analysis pca for comprehensive performance evaluation pca was conducted using seven different variables namely fruit yield wue and fruit quality attributes the results showed that the first two principal components explained 88 95 of total variance so pc1 and pc2 were extracted in the data set the loading plots for different variables fig 4 a showed that pc1 mainly integrated the quality

increase of air co2 concentration sitimulates the activity of nitrate reductase hofmann et al 2013 and this is likely the reason for the lowered nitrate content in tomato furit under e co2 the response of tomato quality to e co2 is complicated and merits further investigations 4 3 effects of reduced irrigation combined with elevated co2 on fruit yield and quality in the present study there was no interactive effects of reduced irrigation and co2 on tomato fruit yield fig 1d wue table 1 hardness fig 2 lycopene fig 3b and tss content fig 3c nevertheless vc and nitrate contents were strongly affected by the interaction of reduced irrigation and co2 where plants treated with i3 together with e co2 had greater vc and less nitrate content without impairing lycopene or tss helyes et al 2011 suggested that tomato plants grown at e co2 could cope better with moderate drought which might be responsible for the increase of tomato fruit quality under e co2 coupled with reduced irrigation pca a credible statistical approach has been used to evaluate the comprehensive response to irrigation regimes in tomato plants wang et al 2015 wei et al 2018 as shown in table 2 treatment 800 i3 took the first place among the six treatments indicating that tomato plants grown at e co2 and reduced irrigation had the best comprehensive performance table 2 therefore for greenhouse tomato production where co2 fertilization is used reduced irrigation could be recommended as a good strategy to enhance fruit quality as well as crop wue 5 conclusions the present study suggested that reduced irrigation under elevated co2 growth environment can increase fruit quality including nutritional quality total soluble solid vitamin c and lycopene and health quality nitrate however the water use efficiency was not enhanced by reduced irrigation as expected which might be dependent on the specific cultivar on the other hand elevated co2 could enhance leaf area fruit yield quality as well as water use efficiency of tomato which ameliorates the detrimental effect of reduced irrigation in short co2 as a gas fertilizer associated with reduced irrigation is a great tactic for quality
