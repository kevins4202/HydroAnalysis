the interactions between anammox and denitrification at different c s ratios and 3 the microbial community changes under different c s ratios this study provides insight into the simultaneous treatment of sewage containing nitrogen sulfides and carbon sources by utilizing the deamox process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor and inoculum an up anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor working volume 2 1 l height 50 cm inner diameter 7 cm was operated for the coupling system and was first set up to enrich anammox bacteria for 120 days before being integrated with the mature sulfide driven denitrification culture the denitrification sludge was collected from a sulfide and nitrate reducing bioreactor that had been continuously operated for one month in our lab the anammox sludge 500 ml was mixed with the denitrification sludge at a ratio of 1 1 v v and the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss of the sludge were 10 4 g l 1 and 9 9 g l 1 respectively to prevent damage from light the reactor was covered with a black shading cloth finally the reactor was set at room temperature the mixotrophic deamox process was operated for 48 days and the hydraulic retention time hrt was fixed at 7 h throughout all experimental periods influents containing nitrogen and sulfide were prepared separately in forms of na2s 9h2o nh4cl and nano3 glucose was used as the carbon source to

reaction tests 2 2 1 performance tests at the end of each stage the biological reaction test without sulfur addition was carried out to explore the biological synergistic competition between heterotrophic denitrification and anammox when glucose was used as an electron donor kept the hrt unchanged and changed the influent substrate to evaluate the nitrogen removal efficiency under different glucose concentrations of the process 2 2 2 batch experiments six groups of batch tests were implemented according to the experimental conditions sulfide nitrate and ammonium concentrations were all 50 mg l 1 and the c s ratios were adjusted according to the experimental conditions batch tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of c s on nitrogen removal performance mixed liquor was obtained from the uasb reactor batch tests were conducted in 340 ml serum bottles in which sludge occupied 50 ml and the substrate occupied 200 ml the bottle was treated with nitrogen to remove

respectively camx no2 n and camx no3 n are the theoretical ratios of nitrite and nitrate reduced and produced by anammox respectively cinf tn and ceff tn are the influent and effluent of total

sludge was taken out at the end of the operation and washed with deionized water to clean the surface the sludge taken from the reactor at the end of operation and filtrated the water on surface 2 5 microbial community analysis three sludge samples with c s ratios of 0 1 6 and 2 were collected from the reactor and named c0 c1 6 and c2 respectively these samples represented the microbial community of the three c s ratios sludge was taken and stored at 20 c before dna extraction all bacteria dna was extracted from the sludge using mn nucleospin 96 soil mo bio laboratories usa following the

process are shown in fig 1 the effluent nitrate concentrations were high when sulfide was used as an electron donor specifically in phase i the average nitrate concentration in the effluent was 21 65 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 52 79 in phase ii after supplying with electron donors from an organic carbon source the average nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased to 17 92 mg l 1 with a nitrate removal of 65 38 when the organic carbon and sulfide were both electron donor the sulfide was used first 21 increasing the c s ratio achieved a high nitrate removal efficiency of 97 45 in phase iii and maintained effective nitrate removal efficiency finally the nitrate removal efficiency was maintained at 98 19 in phase vi the ammonium removal efficiency improved with increasing c s ratios specifically in phase i the ammonium removal efficiency was only 48 09 with an effluent ammonium concentration of 31 74 mg l 1 glucose addition did not have an obvious effect on the effluent ammonium concentration but decreased further in the case of higher c s ratios in phase v the ammonium concentration decreased further to 10 99 mg l 1 in the effluent achieving a removal efficiency of 76 48 this is because the carbon source enhanced nitrite production when heterotrophic denitrification synergism with anammox 13 28 a stable ammonium removal efficiency of 76 99 was achieved in phase vi glucose promoted the removal of ammonium by anammox because organic might increase the relative abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in anammox 29 which contributes to the reduction of ammonium in the effluent during all six phases the nitrite level in the effluent was insignificant 0 98 4 7 mg l 1 as c s ratios increased the tn removal efficiency increased in a stepwise manner fig 1b the tn removal efficiency was 53 28 at a c s ratio of 0 after adding glucose the maximum tn removal efficiency reached 87 86 in phase v when mixotrophic and autotrophic denitrification was synergetic with anammox mixotrophic had a shorter nitrogen pathway showing a higher transfer efficiency of substrate among different microorganisms 23 with attribution to ammonium removal the best performance occurred during phase v which had the maximum tn removal efficiency and the nitrate removal efficiency of averaged 99 23 this showed that a c s of 1 6 achieved higher nitrogen removal efficiency in the reactor indicating a good synergistic reaction between organic and inorganic microbial in deamox process 3 1 2 contribution of nitrogen removal via anammox and denitrification the contributions of anammox and denitrification during nitrogen removal in the deamox process were evaluated using eqs 3 and 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 2 without an organic carbon source anammox was the predominant process for nitrite consumption and the ntr value was max the ntr is connected with the anammox contribution and it has been shown that the organic source significantly accelerates denitrification 18 then the anammox contribution to nitrogen removal fluctuated from 92 29 to 84 08 with carbon source addition the denitrification electron donor increased with c s ratios notably decreasing the anammox contribution and this value was raised to 87 19 at the end of the operation anammox process contributed 80 90 of the nitrogen removal with sulfide or glucose as electron donor 25 30 which was consistent with this study two kinds of electron donors could be suitable electron donor in the coupling of mixotrophic denitrification and anammox and nitrogen could be efficiency removed via anammox pathway anammox activity was important in the deamox process because the anammox played a crucial role in nitrogen performance than denitrification and the effluent nitrogen were ammonium mostly 31 3 2 reaction tests 3 2 1 performance tests the nitrogen performance of the performance tests is shown in table 2 when organic carbon was the main electron donor the nitrogen removal efficiency was lower than mixotrophic denitrification in fig 1 on the one hand the removal of nitrate was the same as in each stage and both achieved a higher removal effect with increasing c s ratios on the other hand the performance of ammonium was the opposite the ammonium removal efficiency decreased as the ratio of c s greater than 1 2 compared to the mixotrophic system the removal efficiency of ammonium by anammox was gradually increased suggesting that the ratio of substrate affected the nitrogen reaction by anammox therefore according to the performance it could be inferred that the sulfide driven denitrification affects the anammox reaction significantly 3 2 2 batch experiments the key c s parameters of reactant and product in the deamox process were determined from the batch experiments fig 3 shows the nitrogen performance under different c s ratios in the batch experiments as shown in fig 3 the nitrate concentration steadily decreased indicating that the degradation rate of nitrate via denitrification was much higher than the generation rate of anammox which improved the accumulation of nitrite the ammonium removal rate in the first hour improved concomitantly with the increased glucose concentration when c s increased from 0 to 1 2 the ammonium removal rate increased from 1 5 mg l h 1 to 3 3 mg l h 1 notably the ammonium removal rate reached 7 7 mg l h 1 at a c s of 2 which was 5 times that of 1 5 mg l h 1 otherwise it was effective in improving nitrite accumulation and the accumulation rate in the first hour increased at high c s ratios the rates changed from 1 4 mg l h 1 to 5 3 mg l h 1 at c s ratios of 0 and 2 respectively a higher c s ratio in the influent enabled more nitrite to be produced via partial denitrification in heterotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox system nitrite accumulation was observed 32 moreover the removal rate of tn was increased too which means that nitrogen performance improved and promoted the rate of nitrite accumulation with increasing c s ratios endogenous carbon sources such as acetate and glucose jointly facilitated nitrite production 33 in other words glucose in the influent enhanced the transformation of nitrate to nitrite which improved anammox further the carbon source was more conducive to the occurrence of denitrification with more nitrite accumulation and batch experiments demonstrated that glucose promoted the formation of nitrite which agrees with the previous study 32 3 3 morphology of sponge and sludge granular sludge changed from reddish brown to black fig 4a and was covered with some white substrate on the surface which was considered to be the sulfur sulfide is first oxidized to sulfur then further convert to sulfate 34 so that there would be much sulfur remained and adhered to sludge previous studies had shown that the color of sludge and the content of heme c could be used as indicators of anammox activity 35 36 in terms of reaction effect anammox wasn t affected by the sulfur and maintained good activity the sludge morphology at the end of operation was observed the sludge had many orange substrates adhered to it while the middle sludge which was gray and covered with numerous white substrates according to the morphology the sludge contained a lot of sulfur inside which adhered to the sludge and could not be washed out indicating that sulfur was sticking to the sludge and would be difficult to use 3 4 microbial communities the effect of different c s ratios on the microbial community of deamox was revealed by illumina high throughput sequencing the relative abundance of the microbial communities at the phylum and genus levels are illustrated in fig 5 results showed that 20 of the bacteria were associated with the phylum proteobacteria which was predominant during the whole operation fig 5a the other identified phyla included planctomycetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi the abundance of proteobacteria fluctuated from 27 43 to 45 19 with increasing c s ratios the phylum planctomycetes was capable of anammox and assumed to contribute to ammonium reduction in the system and accounted for 9 12 in c2 which accounted for 21 3 on c0 patescibacteria is a newly defined super phylum 37 the coexistence of sulfide oxidizing and anammox bacteria was confirmed at the genus level fig 5b the most abundant genus was found to be thiobacillus belonging to proteobacteria which was the foremost taxon using sulfide as energy in the deamox process and it increased from 7 64 to 22 22 in c1 6 and 23 90 in c2 according to a previous study thiobacillus possibly played a key role in oxidizing sulfide with nitrogen as an electron acceptor and was not inhibited by organic 38 39 this suggested that thiobacillus was mainly responsible for partial denitrification in the deamox process sulfurimonas was the second most abundant sulfide using microorganism in the deamox process the relative abundance of sulfurimonas was 0 57 in c0 and then it increased to 2 07 in c1 6 finally decreasing to 1 23 at the end of the operation thauera increased from 0 33 to 0 91 and then 1 2 which was consistent with the results of the deamox process for the high strength carbon resource this showed that thauera played a key role in partial denitrification with a high accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction 8 40 thus the abundance corroborated the enrichment of thauera under increasing reactant concentrations resulting in relatively stable nitrite accumulation by partial denitrification conversely the genus denitratisoma decreased from 5 93 to 1 52 which was previously confirmed to directly convert nitrite into nitrogen gas 41 this genus was a heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium contributing to nitrogen removal 9 the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria during operation revealed the potentially symbiotic contribution rather than a competitive inhibition relationship that was vital to the operation of the system with acetate as energy in the system thauera predominantly contributed to organic carbon utilization 42 two consortia of anammox bacterium were detected in all three phase samples candiatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were detected as anammox genera while candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus throughout the operation accounting for 15 85 in c0 and declining slightly to 11 65 and 7 40 in c1 6 and c2 respectively in addition the percentage of candiatus brocadia was 3 64 during the initial phase but it was only 0 34 at the end of the operation this illustrates that candidatus kuenenia was more competitive than the other anammox bacteria in the presence of glucose it has been confirmed that the candidatus kuenenia was enhanced by acetate and had mixotrophic characteristics 43 4 discussion the study investigated six gradients of glucose for developing mixotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox with increasing c s ratios the tn and ammonium removal efficiency gradually increased with the most effective c s ratio being 1 6 the incomplete removal of ammonium might be due to the low no3 n to nh4 n ratio which could not provide sufficient nitrite so the ratio could be higher than 1 compared with the ammonium performance in all phases the removal efficiency of ammonium showed a downward trend in performance tests it showed that the sulfur autotrophic denitrification in the system had a positive effect on the anammox reaction and could not be replaced by heterotrophic denitrification in batch experiments the accumulation rate of nitrite and the degradation rate of ammonium gradually increased so it could suspect that glucose was beneficial to the production of nitrite thereby promoting nitrogen removal by anammox it could also be inferred from the nitrogen contribution between anammox and denitrification increasing c s ratios promoted the contribution of anammox after phase iii in this system fig 2 meanwhile ntr showed an upward trend which corresponded to nitrite accumulation and the degradation rate of ammonium in batch experiments the activity of anammox was not eliminated by carbon source and that was because the concentration of glucose during the mixotrophic deamox process was below 100 mg l 1 24 and anammox activity never lost despite the addition of high strength carbon source 44 sulfide driven autotrophic bacteria were dominant in all phases and widely distributed to sulfide removal indicating that carbon source input had an insignificant effect on the microorganism glucose addition was accompanied by the increase in autotrophic denitrification bacteria 41 thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the dominant microorganisms that facilitate oxidation of sulfide by sulfur oxidizing bacteria and could relieve the toxic effects of sulfide on anammox during the deamox process 20 an amount of sulfur accumulated in the system and attached to the granular sludge this was probably because of the enrichment of thiobacillus which is well known to couple the oxidation of elemental sulfur in organic sulfur compounds 45 the increase in the relative abundance of thiobacillus indicated that the increase of c s ratios promoted the growth of this microorganism glucose accelerated thauera growth which might promote nitrite accumulation and consume the organic matter the abundance of genus denitratisoma decreased demonstrated that nitrite was used by anammox so that anammox contribution increased with high c s ratios the most abundant anammox microorganism was candidatus kuenenia and the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia declined showing that anammox was inhibited under mixotrophic conditions however anammox still had a significant effect on nitrogen removal because the anammox removal efficiency increased and this result agreed with previous studies 46 it might be concluded that the increase of c s ratios in the mixotrophic system promoted the growth of thiobacillus and the generation of nitrite thereby improving the performance of anammox and the nitrogen removal efficiency 5 conclusions in this study a mixotrophic deamox process was verified to examine the effects of c s ratios on nitrogen performance and the microbial change the most suitable ratio was 1 6 which achieved a tn removal efficiency of 87 86 and partial denitrification with anammox formed an ideal cooperative environment addition of glucose promoted further nitrite reduction and increased the intensity of the anammox the mixotrophic partial denitrification thiobacillus and thauera produced nitrite to anammox candidatus kuenenia and maintained synergistic cooperation in deamox anammox was the dominant pathway for nitrogen removal in this

nitrogen in the deamox process respectively 2 4 sludge morphology stereomicroscopy was utilized to observe the morphology of the sludge before integration and at the end of the operation the granular sludge was taken out at the end of the operation and washed with deionized water to clean the surface the sludge taken from the reactor at the end of operation and filtrated the water on surface 2 5 microbial community analysis three sludge samples with c s ratios of 0 1 6 and 2 were collected from the reactor and named c0 c1 6 and c2 respectively these samples represented the microbial community of the three c s ratios sludge was taken and stored at 20 c before dna extraction all bacteria dna was extracted from the sludge using mn nucleospin 96 soil mo bio laboratories usa following the manufacturer s instructions the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr using the forward primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and the reverse 806r 5

for 7 min pcr amplificons were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 3 results 3 1 performance of deamox process 3 1 1 performance of nitrogen removal the nitrogen performance results in the deamox process are shown in fig 1 the effluent nitrate concentrations were high when sulfide was used as an electron donor specifically in phase i the average nitrate concentration in the effluent was 21 65 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 52 79 in phase ii after supplying with electron donors from an organic carbon source the average nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased to 17 92 mg l 1 with a nitrate removal of 65 38 when the organic carbon and sulfide were both electron donor the sulfide was used first 21 increasing the c s ratio achieved a high nitrate removal efficiency of 97 45 in phase iii and maintained effective nitrate removal efficiency finally the nitrate removal efficiency was maintained at 98 19 in phase vi the ammonium removal efficiency improved with increasing c s ratios specifically in phase i the ammonium removal efficiency was only 48 09 with an effluent ammonium concentration of 31 74 mg l 1 glucose addition did not have an obvious effect on the effluent ammonium concentration but decreased further in the case of higher c s ratios in phase v the ammonium concentration decreased further to 10 99 mg l 1 in the effluent achieving a removal efficiency of 76 48 this is because the carbon source enhanced nitrite production when heterotrophic denitrification synergism with anammox 13 28 a stable ammonium removal efficiency of 76 99 was achieved in phase vi glucose promoted the removal of ammonium by anammox because organic might increase the relative abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in anammox 29 which contributes to the reduction of ammonium in the effluent during all six phases the nitrite level in the effluent was insignificant 0 98 4 7 mg l 1 as c s ratios increased the tn removal efficiency increased in a stepwise manner fig 1b the tn removal efficiency was 53 28 at a c s ratio of 0 after adding glucose the maximum tn removal efficiency reached 87 86 in phase v when mixotrophic and autotrophic denitrification was synergetic with anammox mixotrophic had a shorter nitrogen pathway showing a higher transfer efficiency of substrate among different microorganisms 23 with attribution to ammonium removal the best performance occurred during phase v which had the maximum tn removal efficiency and the nitrate removal efficiency of averaged 99 23 this showed that a c s of 1 6 achieved higher nitrogen removal efficiency in the reactor indicating a good synergistic reaction between organic and inorganic microbial in deamox process 3 1 2 contribution of nitrogen removal via anammox and denitrification the contributions of anammox and denitrification during nitrogen removal in the deamox process were evaluated using eqs 3 and 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 2 without an organic carbon source anammox was the predominant process for nitrite consumption and the ntr value was max the ntr is connected with the anammox contribution and it has been shown that the organic source significantly accelerates denitrification 18 then the anammox contribution to nitrogen removal fluctuated from 92 29 to 84 08 with carbon source addition the denitrification electron donor increased with c s ratios notably decreasing the anammox contribution and this value was raised to 87 19 at the end of the operation anammox process contributed 80 90 of the nitrogen removal with sulfide or glucose as electron donor 25 30 which was consistent with this study two kinds of electron donors could be suitable electron donor in the coupling of mixotrophic denitrification and anammox and nitrogen could be efficiency removed via anammox pathway anammox activity was important in the deamox process because the anammox played a crucial role in nitrogen performance than denitrification and the effluent nitrogen were ammonium mostly 31 3 2 reaction tests 3 2 1 performance tests the nitrogen performance of the performance tests is shown in table 2 when organic carbon was the main electron donor the nitrogen removal efficiency was lower than mixotrophic denitrification in fig 1 on the one hand the removal of nitrate was the same as in each stage and both achieved a higher removal effect with increasing c s ratios on the other hand the performance of ammonium was the opposite the ammonium removal efficiency decreased as the ratio of c s greater than 1 2 compared to the mixotrophic system the removal efficiency of ammonium by anammox was gradually increased suggesting that the ratio of substrate affected the nitrogen reaction by anammox therefore according to the performance it could be inferred that the sulfide driven denitrification affects the anammox reaction significantly 3 2 2 batch experiments the key c s parameters of reactant and product in the deamox process were determined from the batch experiments fig 3 shows the nitrogen performance under different c s ratios in the batch experiments as shown in fig 3 the nitrate concentration steadily decreased indicating that the degradation rate of nitrate via denitrification was much higher than the generation rate of anammox which improved the accumulation of nitrite the ammonium removal rate in the first hour improved concomitantly with the increased glucose concentration when c s increased from 0 to 1 2 the ammonium removal rate increased from 1 5 mg l h 1 to 3 3 mg l h 1 notably the ammonium removal rate reached 7 7 mg l h 1 at a c s of 2 which was 5 times that of 1 5 mg l h 1 otherwise it was effective in improving nitrite accumulation and the accumulation rate in the first hour increased at high c s ratios the rates changed from 1 4 mg l h 1 to 5 3 mg l h 1 at c s ratios of 0 and 2 respectively a higher c s ratio in the influent enabled more nitrite to be produced via partial denitrification in heterotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox system nitrite accumulation was observed 32 moreover the removal rate of tn was increased too which means that nitrogen performance improved and promoted the rate of nitrite accumulation with increasing c s ratios endogenous carbon sources such as acetate and glucose jointly facilitated nitrite production 33 in other words glucose in the influent enhanced the transformation of nitrate to nitrite which improved anammox further the carbon source was more conducive to the occurrence of denitrification with more nitrite accumulation and batch experiments demonstrated that glucose promoted the formation of nitrite which agrees with the previous study 32 3 3 morphology of sponge and sludge granular sludge changed from reddish brown to black fig 4a and was covered with some white substrate on the surface which was considered to be the sulfur sulfide is first oxidized to sulfur then further convert to sulfate 34 so that there would be much sulfur remained and adhered to sludge previous studies had shown that the color of sludge and the content of heme c could be used as indicators of anammox activity 35 36 in terms of reaction effect anammox wasn t affected by the sulfur and maintained good activity the sludge morphology at the end of operation was observed the sludge had many orange substrates adhered to it while the middle sludge which was gray and covered with numerous white substrates according to the morphology the sludge contained a lot of sulfur inside which adhered to the sludge and could not be washed out indicating that sulfur was sticking to the sludge and would be difficult to use 3 4 microbial communities the effect of different c s ratios on the microbial community of deamox was revealed by illumina high throughput sequencing the relative abundance of the microbial communities at the phylum and genus levels are illustrated in fig 5 results showed that 20 of the bacteria were associated with the phylum proteobacteria which was predominant during the whole operation fig 5a the other identified phyla included planctomycetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi the abundance of proteobacteria fluctuated from 27 43 to 45 19 with increasing c s ratios the phylum planctomycetes was capable of anammox and assumed to contribute to ammonium reduction in the system and accounted for 9 12 in c2 which accounted for 21 3 on c0 patescibacteria is a newly defined super phylum 37 the coexistence of sulfide oxidizing and anammox bacteria was confirmed at the genus level fig 5b the most abundant genus was found to be thiobacillus belonging to proteobacteria which was the foremost taxon using sulfide as energy in the deamox process and it increased from 7 64 to 22 22 in c1 6 and 23 90 in c2 according to a previous study thiobacillus possibly played a key role in oxidizing sulfide with nitrogen as an electron acceptor and was not inhibited by organic 38 39 this suggested that thiobacillus was mainly responsible for partial denitrification in the deamox process sulfurimonas was the second most abundant sulfide using microorganism in the deamox process the relative abundance of sulfurimonas was 0 57 in c0 and then it increased to 2 07 in c1 6 finally decreasing to 1 23 at the end of the operation thauera increased from 0 33 to 0 91 and then 1 2 which was consistent with the results of the deamox process for the high strength carbon resource this showed that thauera played a key role in partial denitrification with a high accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction 8 40 thus the abundance corroborated the enrichment of thauera under increasing reactant concentrations resulting in relatively stable nitrite accumulation by partial denitrification conversely the genus denitratisoma decreased from 5 93 to 1 52 which was previously confirmed to directly convert nitrite into nitrogen gas 41 this genus was a heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium contributing to nitrogen removal 9 the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria during operation revealed the potentially symbiotic contribution rather than a competitive inhibition relationship that was vital to the operation of the system with acetate as energy in the system thauera predominantly contributed to organic carbon utilization 42 two consortia of anammox bacterium were detected in all three phase samples candiatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were detected as anammox genera while candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus throughout the operation accounting for 15 85 in c0 and declining slightly to 11 65 and 7 40 in c1 6 and c2 respectively in addition the percentage of candiatus brocadia was 3 64 during the initial phase but it was only 0 34 at the end of the operation this illustrates that candidatus kuenenia was more competitive than the other anammox bacteria in the presence of glucose it has been confirmed that the candidatus kuenenia was enhanced by acetate and had mixotrophic characteristics 43 4 discussion the study investigated six gradients of glucose for developing mixotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox with increasing c s ratios the tn and ammonium removal efficiency gradually increased with the most effective c s ratio being 1 6 the incomplete removal of ammonium might be due to the low no3 n to nh4 n ratio which could not provide sufficient nitrite so the ratio could be higher than 1 compared with the ammonium performance in all phases the removal efficiency of ammonium showed a downward trend in performance tests it showed that the sulfur autotrophic denitrification in the system had a positive effect on the anammox reaction and could not be replaced by heterotrophic denitrification in batch experiments the accumulation rate of nitrite and the degradation rate of ammonium gradually increased so it could suspect that glucose was beneficial to the production of nitrite thereby promoting nitrogen removal by anammox it could also be inferred from the nitrogen contribution between anammox and denitrification increasing c s ratios promoted the contribution of anammox after phase iii in this system fig 2 meanwhile ntr showed an upward trend which corresponded to nitrite accumulation and the degradation rate of ammonium in batch experiments the activity of anammox was not eliminated by carbon source and that was because the concentration of glucose during the mixotrophic deamox process was below 100 mg l 1 24 and anammox activity never lost despite the addition of high strength carbon source 44 sulfide driven autotrophic bacteria were dominant in all phases and widely distributed to sulfide removal indicating that carbon source input had an insignificant effect on the microorganism glucose addition was accompanied by the increase in autotrophic denitrification bacteria 41 thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the dominant microorganisms that facilitate oxidation of sulfide by sulfur oxidizing bacteria and could relieve the toxic effects of sulfide on anammox during the deamox process 20 an amount of sulfur accumulated in the system and attached to the granular sludge this was probably because of the enrichment of thiobacillus which is well known to couple the oxidation of elemental sulfur in organic sulfur compounds 45 the increase in the relative abundance of thiobacillus indicated that the increase of c s ratios promoted the growth of this microorganism glucose accelerated thauera growth which might promote nitrite accumulation and consume the organic matter the abundance of genus denitratisoma decreased demonstrated that nitrite was used by anammox so that anammox contribution increased with high c s ratios the most abundant anammox microorganism was candidatus kuenenia and the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia declined showing that anammox was inhibited under mixotrophic conditions however anammox still had a significant effect on nitrogen removal because the anammox removal efficiency increased and this result agreed with previous studies 46 it might be concluded that the increase of c s ratios in the mixotrophic system promoted the growth of thiobacillus and the generation of nitrite thereby improving the performance of anammox and the nitrogen removal efficiency 5 conclusions in this study a mixotrophic deamox process was verified to examine the effects of c s ratios on nitrogen performance and the microbial change the most suitable ratio was 1 6 which achieved a tn removal efficiency of 87 86 and partial denitrification with anammox formed an ideal cooperative environment addition of glucose promoted further nitrite reduction and increased the intensity of the anammox the mixotrophic partial denitrification thiobacillus and thauera produced nitrite to anammox candidatus kuenenia and maintained synergistic cooperation in deamox anammox was the dominant pathway for nitrogen removal in this

13106,this review aims to evaluate the efficiency and the application of moringa oleifera in water treatment to remove emerging contaminants heavy metals pesticides pharmaceuticals and dyes a systematic search was performed in four databases where 51 eligible articles published between 2010 and 2021 were found for this review to confirm the efficiency of moringa oleifera as a biosorbent the adsorbent modifications kinetic and thermodynamic studies mechanism involved in adsorptive process and maximum adsorption capacity were observed in each article in batch adsorption studies the best fit of experimental data using langmuir isotherm was noted 74 5 n 38 and the best model applied in kinetic studied was pseudo second order 90 2 n 46 also only two articles were found that performed fixed bed column studies in addition to batch adsorption the authors chose to carry out adsorbent modifications e g activated carbon chemical functionalization esterification composite synthesis that enhanced the adsorption capacity of material characterized by analytical techniques as infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction however the raw material can present high values of adsorption capacity confirming the efficiency of moringa as a biosorbent the main mechanisms in adsorbent adsorbate interactions observed was electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces which can vary according to the chemical or physical nature of adsorption although it has been widely used for adsorption of heavy metals and dyes m oleifera can be still explored in adsorption studies of pesticides and pharmaceutical given the low number of articles found in this systematic search graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption moringa oleifera emerging contaminants water treatment low cost adsorbent 1 introduction water is an essential resource for a good quality of life and extremely important for world socioeconomic development as water resources surface water groundwater and water reserves are intrinsic to a different productive industrial and agricultural sector the multiples roles assigned to the use of water resources such as food production and drinking water supply for population highlight its great importance and the need to stablish the water quality management furthermore the proper treatment of water resources promotes reduction of water contaminants and safety to the population 1 2 the inappropriate disposal of industrial effluents generates a significant increase in the concentration levels of contaminants which are highly toxic and contribute to bioaccumulation and contamination of aquatic environment 3 heavy metals present high toxicity and can cause contamination to humans and consequently mutagenic carcinogenic and or teratogenic effects which can lead to death when a person is exposed to high concentrations of these metals 4 5 also pesticides are emerging pollutants resulting mainly from dispersion of active principles in agricultural production many of these compounds have high water and soil mobility contaminating water resources including drinking water which are directly related to the contamination of the exposed population 6 7 dyes are widely used in the textile paper pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries producing a great amount of effluents causing an ecological imbalance in aquatic environment 8 pharmaceutical residues also stand out because for presenting molecules with low biodegradability and low removal in the treatment of industrial effluents the presence of these compounds in the environment has harmful effects on human health including mutagenic effects and endocrine disruption 9 10 a lot of studies has been developed on water resources remediation through adsorption studies and decreasing of the environmental impact caused by several compounds 11 13 a suitable solution is the use of biosorbents e g biochar nanotubes since they are lignocellulosic materials that show themselves as an ecological cheap and rugged alternative for water treatment observing that the use of commercial activated carbon is restricted due to the high costs therefore all plant residue is considered lignocellulosic material and can be used as biosorbent 14 moringa oleifera lamarck is a plant of moringaceae family originally found in india and sub himalayan regions but currently it can be found in tropical regions as american continent 15 moringa oleifera has been reported as food and medicinal plant due to its high nutritional level as a source of beta carotene proteins vitamin c calcium and potassium and due to its pharmacological activity being a source of antimicrobial and antioxidant substances 2 furthermore the study realized by kayode e afolayan 16 revealed that the essential oils of moringa oleifera are considered nontoxic and can be used on pharmaceutical products food preservatives and antioxidant agents development besides its medicinal properties analytical techniques such a scanning electronic microscopy sem show that several parts of moringa oleifera e g seed leaf bark are potential biosorbents as they have favorable superficial area and porosity in their morphological structure for adsorption of contaminants 17 therefore previous studies have already shown the use of this plant in adsorptive process for heavy metal pesticides volatile organic compounds pharmaceuticals residues and dye removal from water aqueous solution mostly obtaining satisfactory results and high values of adsorption capacity 8 18 19 to verify these results it is important to understand the adsorption phenomenon that occurs on adsorbent surface through kinetic and thermodynamic studies to explain the nature of adsorption chemical or physical 14 therefore the aim of this review is to evaluate the use and efficiency of various parts of moringa oleifera e g seeds wood bark leaves in the bioremediation of water contaminated by pollutants that cause high negative impact on the environment and human health such as heavy metals pesticides dyes and pharmaceuticals residues providing a detailed review on adsorption studies including mechanisms as well as characterization and modifications of the adsorbent present in studies developed in the last decade 2 systematic search several parts of moringa oleifera have been reported as biosorbents in water treatment and removal of contaminants from aqueous solution mostly due to its low cost high adsorption capacity and high compound removal efficiency 20 to understand the efficiency of this plant as biosorbent a systematic search was made to evaluate the research articles in this scope a systematic search was performed in four databases sciencedirect scopus springer e web of science to find potential articles using moringa oleifera in water treatment for this purpose the terms adsorption water moringa oleifera heavy metal pesticide drug pharmaceutical dye and their combination were used including boolean operators e g and no near and the search for the term moringa oleifera in title abstract and keyword of the articles eligible

review articles opinion papers letters to editor case studies short communications theses and dissertations also research articles that includes only fixed bed column studies were not included the absence of kinetic thermodynamic and adsorption isotherms studies were used as exclusion criteria as well as the use of moringa oleifera or its extracts as coagulant flocculant desorption studies reusability studies were not considered as eligibility criteria the study selection was made through rayyan http rayyan qcri org a free website and app to carry out systematic search which allows the initial visualization of titles and abstracts using a semi automatic process 21 after the initial search of eligible articles carried out on june 26 2021 all duplicated articles were removed followed by the title and abstract screening to choose potential articles for this review then the articles were submitted to full text reading to find studies that met the acceptance criteria eligible article

were read in full to match the acceptance or exclusion criteria at last 51 article were included in acceptance criteria and considered eligible for this review the other 36 article were excluded for the following reasons not presenting adsorption studies or the mechanism involved in adsorption process not presenting adsorbate in the scope of this review presenting studies with other species of moringa e g moringa stenopetala use only the extract of moringa oleifera in adsorption studies presenting only fixed bed column studies in fig 1b among the eligible articles 47 1 n 24 used heavy metals as adsorbate 29 4 n 15 presenting dye removal studies 13 7 n 7 presenting studies involving pharmaceutical residues and 9 8 n 5 involving pesticides adsorption therefore in addition to being a plant extensively employed in heavy metal and dye adsorption moringa oleifera still can be further explored regarding the removal of pesticides and drugs from water considering the damage caused to the environment by these compounds and the scarcity of articles studying these contaminants in this context 3 moringa oleifera as biosorbent main characteristics moringa oleifera lam is originally from india but was easily adapted to tropical regions and currently can be found in west asia sub saharan africa central and south america 61 moringa oleifera belongs to the moringaceae family which has only one genus with 14 known species with large production of leaves flowers and seeds which present several applications such as nutritional pharmaceutical medicinal cosmetic biodiesel production 8 20 various studies investigated the coagulation and flocculation processes using moringa oleifera since its ability as a natural and ecological coagulant 62 64 moreover several parts of moringa oleifera have been verified both in natura and thermic chemically modified for the removal of emerging contaminants from water 65 to assess the use of moringa oleifera as an adsorbent it is essential to analyze the physicochemical and structural characteristics of the biosorbent in order to identify the influence of these characteristics on the adsorptive process 20 therefore analytical techniques have been employed to study morphological characteristics and functional groups present in the adsorbent such as scanning electronic microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd 3 1 seeds and pods moringa oleifera seeds have heterogenous morphological characteristics with high asymmetric porosity it is a fibrous material rich in cellulose and lignin due to the its heterogenous surface the good adsorption capacity of this material is attributed to the pores of the adsorbent surface these available spaces facilitate the adsorptive process as they provide a high internal surface of the material 8 it is also possible to conclude from the chemical characteristics of moringa oleifera seeds that chemisorption phenomenon ionic adsorption can occur due to the protein groups present in the adsorbent 12 besides using the raw material the articles performed chemical and physical modification in the adsorbent to enhance its adsorptive capacity the degradation of organic matter through thermic treatment favors the breakdown of the lignin and cellulose structure allowing an increase in the number and size of the pores which leads to an increase in the specific internal area 20 this can be seen in the study by quesada et al 9 which assesses the presence of large pores on the surface of moringa oleifera seed husks obtained from the adsorption desorption of n2 method thus the morphological characteristics of adsorbent material can be estimated by bet isotherm brunauer emmett teller which considers the amount of gas used to create a monolayer as well as the dimension and the number of adsorbed molecules 66 the thermal and chemical modification resulted in the pore development since has an increase of micropore volume from 0 0004 cm3 g 1 in natura to 0 002 cm3 g 1 modified and of mesopores from 0 002 cm3 g 1 in natura to 0 01 cm3 g 1 modified 9 the observed improvement is associated to the removal of organic matter caused by the bond breaking of functional groups present on the surface 20 it is noteworthy that the efficiency of adsorption is enhanced by the presence of larger sizes of mesopores and micropores since the adsorbent does not offer resistance to contaminant access to pore regions 67 however this factor does not guarantee a good retention of pollutants as access to internal pores can be a limitation of the adsorptive process 9 the study by coldebella et al 44 compared the efficiency of removing atrazine herbicide from water using moringa oleifera seed pods as an adsorbent the thermically treated material presented maximum adsorption capacity of 7 47 mg g 1 compared to 0 63 mg g 1 of the unmodified adsorbent and 1 58 mg g 1 of the chemically treated material meoh 1 5 v v and hno3 0 1 m these results are directly related to the total surface area of the adsorbents because the thermically treated material showed the largest bet area 70 54 m2 g 1 while the unmodified adsorbent and chemically treated material had respectively 3 728 and 19 802 m2 g 1 of total surface area the adsorption phenomenon is not only influenced by morphological characteristics such as dimensions and quantities of pores it is also important to evaluate the chemical composition of the adsorbent surface 12 ft ir analyses have been essential to identify functional groups present in the material s structure specifically several proteins lipid and polysaccharide structures containing amine hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups are found in moringa oleifera seed common in lignocellulosic materials 50 54 functional groups can be fundamental for contaminant removal as seen in the removal of reactive red 120 rr 120 from water where the presence of amine amide and carbonyl were significant in the chemisorption of the adsorptive process 8 in addition to the use of moringa oleifera seed studies show efficient results when using seed husks seed pods and pod husks which similarly to the seed itself are cellulosic materials that present fibrous structures and heterogenous morphology 10 28 42 in the study by wuana et al 60 pod husks were used in the adsorption of norfloxacin where the adsorbent was subjected to chemical treatment nh4cl and pyrolysis the material treated only chemically presented lower maximum adsorption capacity 1 517 mg g 1 when compared to the adsorbent that was then submitted to pyrolysis 2 033 mg g 1 it is part of the adsorption studies to investigate the functional and morphological characteristics of the adsorbent since due to the nature of the adsorbate certain types of compounds can be efficiently removed in a recent study the removal of diuron herbicide using three different unmodified adsorbents was compared moringa oleifera seeds husks and pods showed maximum adsorption capacity respectively of 2 290 5 784 3 761 mg g 1 with greater affinity of the pesticide with moringa oleifera husks 43 3 2 leaves in the studies present in tables 1 4 moringa oleifera leaves were mostly applied in the adsorption processes of heavy metals in general plant biomass including leaves is composed of a large amount of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin containing on its surface several functional groups which provide great interaction with heavy metals the chemical structure of the material can be modified providing a greater interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate as in the study by reddy et al 36 that performed a citric acid treatment on moringa oleifera leaves observing through ft ir analyses the degradation of lignin cellulose and hemicellulose it can also be observed that in the modified material there was an interaction between the adsorbates cd2 cu2 ni and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups present in the modified material these modifications whether physical and or chemical can influence the adsorption efficiency since at low adsorbate concentrations in this context moringa oleifera leaves in natura employed in the adsorption of pb ii provide a maximum adsorption capacity of 45 83 mg g 1 27 while the adsorbent after citric acid modification presented a value of 209 54 mg g 1 also for pb ii adsorption 39 regarding morphological characteristics scanning electronic microscopy sem analyses revealed that the moringa oleifera leaves have a porous and irregular surface and after binding with adsorbate become less heterogenous 27 3 3 wood and bark from the systematic search only four articles used moringa oleifera wood as adsorbent and in all four articles the authors performed adsorption studies of heavy metals it is noteworthy that only one article used moringa oleifera wood while the rest employed moringa oleifera bark as an adsorbent the study by kalavathy and miranda 38 proposed the development of an activated carbon from moringa oleifera wood for adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions it was noted that the modified material has a large bet surface area 787 34 m2 g 1 when compared to the raw material favoring a high adsorption capacity of metallic ions this is confirmed by sem analysis which showed a high porosity and the presence of cylindrical structures of different diameters in activated carbon in detriment of an irregular structure without pores on the surface of the raw moringa oleifera regarding the moringa oleifera bark it is possible to observe a significant amount of amorphous material due to the presence of tannins and lignin ft ir analysis indicated a complex nature of this material facilitating its choice as a potential adsorbent in its structure the presence of hydroxyl primary and secondary amides sulfamides and carboxyl acids stands out the same analysis after adsorption process confirms that the co functional groups are related to the interaction with metallic ions cd2 cu2 e pb2 36 2010b thus confirming the need to understand the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent to comprehend the mechanisms present in the adsorption process 4 adsorption studies using moringa oleifera for water treatment 4 1 batch adsorption studies 4 1 1 kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption adsorption kinetic studies are extremely important in the adsorption of pollutants as they show the rates of adsorbate removal in fluid phase with respect to the time this process can be carried out through external mass transfer internal diffusion i e diffusion of molecules inside the pores and surface diffusion in this way the experiments are performed to examine the rate controlling step of adsorption process also explain the mechanism involved 10 38 39 furthermore through kinetic studies it is possible to verify the residual time for the adsorption process 28 to assess the kinetic mechanism the experimental data obtained are analyzed by using different models further to identify in which model the experimental data fit best among the best known are pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren 68 pseudo second order model proposed by ho and mckay 69 and intraparticle diffusion model by weber and morris 70 the kinetic studies can also explain whether adsorption is chemical or physical in nature in the study by tavares et al 3 moringa oleifera pods were used for lead removal from water however two adsorbents were used the first with acid functionalization and the second with basic functionalization the application of the pseudo second order model resulted the best fit for the experimental data for both adsorbent but the material with basic functionalization presented a chemisorption nature in adsorption process and the material with acid treatment presented physisorption nature a similar result was noted in the study of tavares et al 29 which had chemical adsorption for pb ii using moringa oleifera seeds and husks as adsorbent and physical adsorption when moringa oleifera pods were used as the nature of adsorption can be physical or chemical the kinetic mechanism found in the articles explain the adsorption kinetics by electrostatic interactions 20 32 44 ion exchange 39 mass transfer 52 hydrogen bonds 9 and intraparticle diffusion 10 it is important to highlight that among eligible article for this review all articles that performed kinetic studies have their experimental values well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model with the exception of the studies realized by reck et al 52 quesada et al 9 hamadeen et al 41 kannan et al 55 e al kind e al haidari 2021 whose the data present better adjustment following the pseudo first ordem model and the study by escobar et al 46 where the avrami fractional order kinetic model best described the kinetic sorption this model on the other hand considers that the adsorption rates as a function of initial concentration and adsorption time can change during the adsorptive process moreover allowing the determination of fractional kinetic orders 71 in thermodynamic studies the temperature influence is evaluated in a specific range in the adsorptive process based on the data from adsorption isotherms from these data the following parameters will be determined enthalpy variation δh entropy variation δs gibbs free energy δg and equilibrium constant k these parameters need to be correctly estimated as they evaluate the spontaneity of the process indicate the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent explain the nature of the adsorption process chemical or physical and define if there is more enthalpic or entropic contribution to the adsorption process from the gibbs free energy it is possible to estimate the spontaneity of the adsorption where δg 0 indicates a spontaneous process 29 on the other hand an increase in temperature associated with an increase in δg allows the process to be more energetically favorable at higher temperatures 9 42 where the amounts of contaminants adsorbed in equilibrium also will be larger concluding that it is an endothermic process δh 0 35 it is well known that enthalpy determines the heat involve in the reaction where positive values indicate endothermic processes and negative values exothermic processes therefore in a thermodynamic study the endothermic adsorptions will be more favored with increasing temperature 9 the nature of the adsorption can also be verified from the enthalpy data which can indicate whether there is predominance of chemisorption when the adsorption results in chemical bonding or physisorption when the adsorptions occurs through weak interactions such as london dispersion forces 14 60 entropy deals with the randomness of the interaction low and positive values of δs show more affinity of the adsorbate with the bioadsorbent and more randomness of interaction on the surface of the adsorbent solid solution interaction 5 18 low entropy values confirm that there are no significantly changes in the adsorption process and consequently there is the existence of a reversible process 9 for negative entropy values there is a decrease of randomness i e increase in system organization in the interaction between the adsorbate particles on the surface of the adsorbent 3 2017 however it is needs to explain that the spontaneity of the adsorptive process is not directly related to its endothermic or exothermic nature and may vary according to the nature of the adsorbent in the study by souza et al 43 three different adsorbent were used moringa oleifera seed bark and pods for the removal of herbicide diuron although thermodynamic studies show that the process is feasible for all adsorbents an endothermic process was obtained using only seeds as adsorbents it is also necessary to mention there are situations in which gibbs free energy values are higher than zero however the adsorption is still considered spontaneous observing the studied temperature range if there is a decrease in the free energy value with an increase in the temperature value then the process can be considered feasible 35 2013a 4 1 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacity is the adsorbed mass of contaminant per unit e g mass of absorbent used and the values of adsorption capacity for a specific material as well as the adsorbate adsorbent ratio can be described by adsorption isotherms 25 34 the obtention of isotherm curves is fundamental to comprehend and correctly interpret the data obtained from adsorption process since they are an important criterion to optimize the use of the adsorbent the isotherms also indicate if the adsorption process is favorable and present the tendency of the process for monolayer formation 40 72 for these analyses several empirical models aim to assess the best fit of adsorption data among them the most used are the langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich d r and sips isotherms 28 59 the langmuir model assumes that there are a fixed number of active binding sites which are of equal energy and where molecules do not compete in this model the adsorption takes places in a monolayer on homogenous surfaces with no more than one adsorbed molecule per adsorption site and showing the formation of ionic or covalent bonds between the contaminant and the adsorbent 25 28 73 the dimensionless constant rl present in langmuir model known as separation factor expresses in terms of equilibrium parameters if the adsorptive process is favorable or not based on data acquired from the langmuir isotherm 39 the values of rl can stablish the favorable isotherms 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 and irreversible rl 0 36 from the adsorption studies carried out to remove pollutants from water using moringa oleifera it is noted that a significant number of articles with experimental data had a better fit with the langmuir isotherm 74 5 n 38 and with relevant results in the study by ranote et al 19 the maximum adsorption capacity of hg ii using a moringa oleifera gum modified via acryloylation reaction was 840 34 mg g 1 even using unmodified moringa oleifera raw material it is possible to observe greater values of mca as in the study developed by çelekli et al 8 using moringa oleifera seed for rr 120 adsorption which resulted in an mca of 412 32 mg g 1 and in the study by escobar et al 46 where an mca equal to 694 2 mg g 1 was observed using moringa oleifera seed pulp in the adsorption of the dye acid blue 9 the model proposed by freundlich is an empirical equation used to explain the adsorption on heterogenous surfaces applied in the adsorption of organic and inorganic compounds in several types of adsorbents even biosorbents therefore this isotherm assumes that there is a multilayer interaction in a non ideal adsorptive process in various types of adsorption sites which have different adsorption energies 59 74 furthermore it is considered that the strongest binding sites are occupied first so that the bonding forces weaken as the occupation of actives site increase the constant n in freundlich model relates to the reactivity of the adsorbents in the active sites adsorption is favorable when the values of n range from 1 to 10 that is the higher the value of n the greater the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate nevertheless in case n is equal to 1 the adsorption is linear so the energies of the adsorption sites are identical 25 52 temkin isotherm considers that there is an effect on the indirect interactions that occur between the adsorbent and the adsorbate i e uniform distribution of binding energies then the heat of adsorption of all molecules and ions in the layer do not decrease logarithmically but linearly as there is a adsorbent surface coverage 14 38 the dubinin radushkevich d r equilibrium isotherm is generally used to analyze whether the nature of adsorption is physical or chemical this model does not assume that the surface homogeneity of the adsorbent surface or the adsorption potential of sites is constant being therefore a more general model than the langmuir isotherm in this way the adsorption mechanism is defined from the energy distribution on a heterogeneous surface 27 75 the d r model has been employed to determine the mean free energy of adsorption which can be used to identify chemical and physical adsorption if the value of this energy calculated by e 1 2 k is lower than 8 kj mol 1 it is considered a physisorption however a chemical adsorption or ion exchange is recognized when the mean free energy vary between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 8 27 the sips isotherm is an empirical model that can be considered a combination of the characteristics presenting in the langmuir and freundlich models 28 when the adsorption occurs on a heterogenous layer in cases of low concentrations of adsorbate the sips model is like the freundlich isotherm whilst in multilayer adsorptions with high concentrations of adsorbate this model shows characteristics of langmuir isotherm the adsorption capacity obtained from the sips isotherm may be more realistic than the value obtained from the langmuir model because it is assumed that the sips adsorption occurs first in a monolayer followed by a multilayer adsorption 42 4 2 fixed bed column studies the batch adsorption studies have been widely employed to initially verify the efficiency of removal of a contaminant by an adsorbent establishing a maximum quantity of adsorbate that can be removed however this initial process is limited to a low volumes of solution not ensuring this efficiency in a continuous flow and or in large scale adsorptive process 14 therefore in this context it is important to consider the fixed bed column studies which allow a better design of the adsorptive process in addition to presenting low operating costs 76 from these studies it is possible to estimate the adsorption capacity in a continuous flow and the adsorption desorption cycles ideal for a large volume of effluents furthermore it is essential that there are also batch adsorption studies to verify initially the use of a specific material as a potential adsorbent moreover among the eligible articles for this review only 2 two articles performed in addition to batch adsorption studies the fixed bed column studies kannan et al 55 realized a adsorption study of the anionic blue ffs dye using an adsorbent synthesized from the moringa oleifera seeds and calcium alginate the fixed bed tests were carried out at two different columns sizes and at three flow rates where it was observed based on the thomas model a maximum adsorption capacity of 1543 mg g 1 considerably higher than the values obtained by langmuir isotherm 76 92 mg g 1 in another study solutions of naphthol blue black and cr vi at three different concentrations were evaluated in a fixed bed study at three flow rates where it was confirmed the influence of both parameters concentration and flow on the exhaustion time of the column 28 column saturation may be a result of the less transfer resistance due to the increase of adsorbate concentration 77 moreover the decrease in flow rate contributes to the increase in the contact time also increasing the interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 28 4 3 desorption studies reusability in desorption studies it is important to ensure the regeneration capacity of the adsorbent i e the reversibility of the adsorptive process and then to confirm its applicability this step is more necessary when dealing with a high cost adsorbent since in this way the number of cycles which the adsorption process continues to be efficient is evaluated 11 the reusability studies are generally performed through the batch experiments where different solvents can be used to understand the greatest efficiency of solvent recovery although reusability studies were not an eligibility criterion about 47 of the eligible articles had desorption studies n 24 which confirms the need for these studies to assess the reliability of the adsorbent observing its cost effectiveness and reuse in the study carried out by kalavathy e miranda 2010 the adsorption efficiency using various solvents was compared where h2so4 and edta presented the highest percentage of adsorbent recovery efficiency 99 for the three metallic cations studied cu zn and ni in general an acid treatment for biosorbent reusability using hcl is efficient for metal desorption 27 however desorption efficiency can also be evaluated using other solvents such as distilled water in the adsorption of atrazine 18 nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the adsorption of diclofenac 59 and an ethanol water solution 50 v v in the adsorption of tartrazine 52 the recovery efficiency and the number of adsorption desorption cycles which the adsorbent remains efficient is very variable as it depends on several factors nature of the adsorbent chemical physical modification performed on the adsorbent nature of the adsorbate solvent of desorption solvent concentration 5 conclusion in the last decade adsorption studies have proven the efficiency of moringa oleifera in removing emerging contaminants from water since moringa oleifera is a lignocellulosic material with physicochemical properties favorable to the adsorption of several compounds raw moringa oleifera can be used as a low cost material that provides high values of maximum adsorption capacity however several authors have carried out adsorbent modifications such as activated carbon preparation chemical functionalization acidic or basic synthesis of composites or organic reactions e g esterification acryloylation to increase the adsorption capacity of moringa furthermore from this review it was possible to understand the main mechanisms that act in the adsorbent adsorbate interaction essential to verify the feasibility of the adsorption process and the efficiency in water treatment it is also observed that among the eligible articles only two studies presented fixed bed column studies a fundamental step to assesses employability of the adsorbent on large scale and with large volumes of solution finally it is noteworthy that in recent years several parts of moringa oleifera have been used to remove dyes and heavy metals from water however due to the chemical and morphological characteristics of this plant moringa oleifera can still be explored in adsorptive processes of pesticides and pharmaceutical residues as few articles had this focus in the last decade and knowing the problems associated with the contamination of water resources by these substances declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13106,this review aims to evaluate the efficiency and the application of moringa oleifera in water treatment to remove emerging contaminants heavy metals pesticides pharmaceuticals and dyes a systematic search was performed in four databases where 51 eligible articles published between 2010 and 2021 were found for this review to confirm the efficiency of moringa oleifera as a biosorbent the adsorbent modifications kinetic and thermodynamic studies mechanism involved in adsorptive process and maximum adsorption capacity were observed in each article in batch adsorption studies the best fit of experimental data using langmuir isotherm was noted 74 5 n 38 and the best model applied in kinetic studied was pseudo second order 90 2 n 46 also only two articles were found that performed fixed bed column studies in addition to batch adsorption the authors chose to carry out adsorbent modifications e g activated carbon chemical functionalization esterification composite synthesis that enhanced the adsorption capacity of material characterized by analytical techniques as infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction however the raw material can present high values of adsorption capacity confirming the efficiency of moringa as a biosorbent the main mechanisms in adsorbent adsorbate interactions observed was electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces which can vary according to the chemical or physical nature of adsorption although it has been widely used for adsorption of heavy metals and dyes m oleifera can be still explored in adsorption studies of pesticides and pharmaceutical given the low number of articles found in this systematic search graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption moringa oleifera emerging contaminants water treatment low cost adsorbent 1 introduction water is an essential resource for a good quality of life and extremely important for world socioeconomic development as water resources surface water groundwater and water reserves are intrinsic to a different productive industrial and agricultural sector the multiples roles assigned to the use of water resources such as food production and drinking water supply for population highlight its great importance and the need to stablish the water quality management furthermore the proper treatment of water resources promotes reduction of water contaminants and safety to the population 1 2 the inappropriate disposal of industrial effluents generates a significant increase in the concentration levels of contaminants which are highly toxic and contribute to bioaccumulation and contamination of aquatic environment 3 heavy metals present high toxicity and can cause contamination to humans and consequently mutagenic carcinogenic and or teratogenic effects which can lead to death when a person is exposed to high concentrations of these metals 4 5 also pesticides are emerging pollutants resulting mainly from dispersion of active principles in agricultural production many of these compounds have high water and soil mobility contaminating water resources including drinking water which are directly related to the contamination of the exposed population 6 7 dyes are widely used in the textile paper pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries producing a great amount of effluents causing an ecological imbalance in aquatic environment 8 pharmaceutical residues also stand out because for presenting molecules with low biodegradability and low removal in the treatment of industrial effluents the presence of these compounds in the environment has harmful effects on human health including mutagenic effects and endocrine disruption 9 10 a lot of studies has been developed on water resources remediation through adsorption studies and decreasing of the environmental impact caused by several compounds 11 13 a suitable solution is the use of biosorbents e g biochar nanotubes since they are lignocellulosic materials that show themselves as an ecological cheap and rugged alternative for water treatment observing that the use of commercial activated carbon is restricted due to the high costs therefore all plant residue is considered lignocellulosic material and can be used as biosorbent 14 moringa oleifera lamarck is a plant of moringaceae family originally found in india and sub himalayan regions but currently it can be found in tropical regions as american continent 15 moringa oleifera has been reported as food and medicinal plant due to its high nutritional level as a source of beta carotene proteins vitamin c calcium and potassium and due to its pharmacological activity being a source of antimicrobial and antioxidant substances 2 furthermore the study realized by kayode e afolayan 16 revealed that the essential oils of moringa oleifera are considered nontoxic and can be used on pharmaceutical products food preservatives and antioxidant agents development besides its medicinal properties analytical techniques such a scanning electronic microscopy sem show that several parts of moringa oleifera e g seed leaf bark are potential biosorbents as they have favorable superficial area and porosity in their morphological structure for adsorption of contaminants 17 therefore previous studies have already shown the use of this plant in adsorptive process for heavy metal pesticides volatile organic compounds pharmaceuticals residues and dye removal from water aqueous solution mostly obtaining satisfactory results and high values of adsorption capacity 8 18 19 to verify these results it is important to understand the adsorption phenomenon that occurs on adsorbent surface through kinetic and thermodynamic studies to explain the nature of adsorption chemical or physical 14 therefore the aim of this review is to evaluate the use and efficiency of various parts of moringa oleifera e g seeds wood bark leaves in the bioremediation of water contaminated by pollutants that cause high negative impact on the environment and human health such as heavy metals pesticides dyes and pharmaceuticals residues providing a detailed review on adsorption studies including mechanisms as well as characterization and modifications of the adsorbent present in studies developed in the last decade 2 systematic search several parts of moringa oleifera have been reported as biosorbents in water treatment and removal of contaminants from aqueous solution mostly due to its low cost high adsorption capacity and high compound removal efficiency 20 to understand the efficiency of this plant as biosorbent a systematic search was made to evaluate the research articles in this scope a systematic search was performed in four databases sciencedirect scopus springer e web of science to find potential articles using moringa oleifera in water treatment for this purpose the terms adsorption water moringa oleifera heavy metal pesticide drug pharmaceutical dye and their combination were used including boolean operators e g and no near and the search for the term moringa oleifera in title abstract and keyword of the articles eligible

aqueous solution or effluents published between 2010 and 2021 written in english acceptance criteria include discussion of adsorption mechanism in the research article it was excluded from this study review articles opinion papers letters to editor case studies short communications theses and dissertations also research articles that includes only fixed bed column studies were not included the absence of kinetic thermodynamic and adsorption isotherms studies were used as exclusion criteria as well as the use of moringa oleifera or its extracts as coagulant flocculant desorption studies reusability studies were not considered as eligibility criteria the study selection was made through rayyan http rayyan qcri org a free website and app to carry out systematic search which allows the initial visualization of titles and abstracts using a semi automatic process 21 after the initial search of eligible articles carried out on june 26 2021 all duplicated articles were removed followed by the title and abstract screening to choose potential articles for this review then the articles were submitted to full text reading to find studies that met the acceptance criteria eligible article had their citations and reference list scanned to identify potential articles for this review therefore after the search the following information were extracted from each paper adsorbate used part of the moringa oleifera adsorbent modifications analytical techniques for adsorbent characterization adsorption isotherm maximum adsorption capacity thermodynamic adsorption mechanism kinetic adsorption and experimental conditions such as ph phpzc adsorbate concentration adsorbate dosage contact time and temperature all mentioned information has been listed in tables 1 4 2 1 search results the result of initial search is found in fig 1a this search resulted in 788 publications found in four databases sciencedirect n 117 14 8 scopus n 333 42 3 springer n 258 32 7 web of science n 80 10 2 after removing duplicates n 167 621 publications remained which were submitted to title and abstract screening to find potential article for this review at the end of this step 87 articles remained that were read in full to match the acceptance or exclusion criteria at last 51 article were included in acceptance criteria and considered eligible for this review the other 36 article were excluded for the following reasons not presenting adsorption studies or the mechanism involved in adsorption process not presenting adsorbate in the scope of this review presenting studies with other species of moringa e g moringa stenopetala use only the extract of moringa oleifera in adsorption studies presenting only fixed bed column studies in fig 1b among the eligible articles 47 1 n 24 used heavy metals as adsorbate 29 4 n 15 presenting dye removal studies 13 7 n 7 presenting studies involving pharmaceutical residues and 9 8 n 5 involving pesticides adsorption therefore in addition to being a plant extensively employed in heavy metal and dye adsorption moringa oleifera still can be further explored regarding the removal of pesticides and drugs from water considering the damage caused to the environment by these compounds and the scarcity of articles studying these contaminants in this context 3 moringa oleifera as biosorbent main characteristics moringa oleifera lam is originally from india but was easily adapted to tropical regions and currently can be found in west asia sub saharan africa central and south america 61 moringa oleifera belongs to the moringaceae family which has only one genus with 14 known species with large production of leaves flowers and seeds which present several applications such as nutritional pharmaceutical medicinal cosmetic biodiesel production 8 20 various studies investigated the coagulation and flocculation processes using moringa oleifera since its ability as a natural and ecological coagulant 62 64 moreover several parts of moringa oleifera have been verified both in natura and thermic chemically modified for the removal of emerging contaminants from water 65 to assess the use of moringa oleifera as an adsorbent it is essential to analyze the physicochemical and structural characteristics of the biosorbent in order to identify the influence of these characteristics on the adsorptive process 20 therefore analytical techniques have been employed to study morphological characteristics and functional groups present in the adsorbent such as scanning electronic microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd 3 1 seeds and pods moringa oleifera seeds have heterogenous morphological characteristics with high asymmetric porosity it is a fibrous material rich in cellulose and lignin due to the its heterogenous surface the good adsorption capacity of this material is attributed to the pores of the adsorbent surface these available spaces facilitate the adsorptive process as they provide a high internal surface of the material 8 it is also possible to conclude from the chemical characteristics of moringa oleifera seeds that chemisorption phenomenon ionic adsorption can occur due to the protein groups present in the adsorbent 12 besides using the raw material the articles performed chemical and physical modification in the adsorbent to enhance its adsorptive capacity the degradation of organic matter through thermic treatment favors the breakdown of the lignin and cellulose structure allowing an increase in the number and size of the pores which leads to an increase in the specific internal area 20 this can be seen in the study by quesada et al 9 which assesses the presence of large pores on the surface of moringa oleifera seed husks obtained from the adsorption desorption of n2 method thus the morphological characteristics of adsorbent material can be estimated by bet isotherm brunauer emmett teller which considers the amount of gas used to create a monolayer as well as the dimension and the number of adsorbed molecules 66 the thermal and chemical modification resulted in the pore development since has an increase of micropore volume from 0 0004 cm3 g 1 in natura to 0 002 cm3 g 1 modified and of mesopores from 0 002 cm3 g 1 in natura to 0 01 cm3 g 1 modified 9 the observed improvement is associated to the removal of organic matter caused by the bond breaking of functional groups present on the surface 20 it is noteworthy that the efficiency of adsorption is enhanced by the presence of larger sizes of mesopores and micropores since the adsorbent does not offer resistance to contaminant access to pore regions 67 however this factor does not guarantee a good retention of pollutants as access to internal pores can be a limitation of the adsorptive process 9 the study by coldebella et al 44 compared the efficiency of removing atrazine herbicide from water using moringa oleifera seed pods as an adsorbent the thermically treated material presented maximum adsorption capacity of 7 47 mg g 1 compared to 0 63 mg g 1 of the unmodified adsorbent and 1 58 mg g 1 of the chemically treated material meoh 1 5 v v and hno3 0 1 m these results are directly related to the total surface area of the adsorbents because the thermically treated material showed the largest bet area 70 54 m2 g 1 while the unmodified adsorbent and chemically treated material had respectively 3 728 and 19 802 m2 g 1 of total surface area the adsorption phenomenon is not only influenced by morphological characteristics such as dimensions and quantities of pores it is also important to evaluate the chemical composition of the adsorbent surface 12 ft ir analyses have been essential to identify functional groups present in the material s structure specifically several proteins lipid and polysaccharide structures containing amine hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups are found in moringa oleifera seed common in lignocellulosic materials 50 54 functional groups can be fundamental for contaminant removal as seen in the removal of reactive red 120 rr 120 from water where the presence of amine amide and carbonyl were significant in the chemisorption of the adsorptive process 8 in addition to the use of moringa oleifera seed studies show efficient results when using seed husks seed pods and pod husks which similarly to the seed itself are cellulosic materials that present fibrous structures and heterogenous morphology 10 28 42 in the study by wuana et al 60 pod husks were used in the adsorption of norfloxacin where the adsorbent was subjected to chemical treatment nh4cl and pyrolysis the material treated only chemically presented lower maximum adsorption capacity 1 517 mg g 1 when compared to the adsorbent that was then submitted to pyrolysis 2 033 mg g 1 it is part of the adsorption studies to investigate the functional and morphological characteristics of the adsorbent since due to the nature of the adsorbate certain types of compounds can be efficiently removed in a recent study the removal of diuron herbicide using three different unmodified adsorbents was compared moringa oleifera seeds husks and pods showed maximum adsorption capacity respectively of 2 290 5 784 3 761 mg g 1 with greater affinity of the pesticide with moringa oleifera husks 43 3 2 leaves in the studies present in tables 1 4 moringa oleifera leaves were mostly applied in the adsorption processes of heavy metals in general plant biomass including leaves is composed of a large amount of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin containing on its surface several functional groups which provide great interaction with heavy metals the chemical structure of the material can be modified providing a greater interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate as in the study by reddy et al 36 that performed a citric acid treatment on moringa oleifera leaves observing through ft ir analyses the degradation of lignin cellulose and hemicellulose it can also be observed that in the modified material there was an interaction between the adsorbates cd2 cu2 ni and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups present in the modified material these modifications whether physical and or chemical can influence the adsorption efficiency since at low adsorbate concentrations in this context moringa oleifera leaves in natura employed in the adsorption of pb ii provide a maximum adsorption capacity of 45 83 mg g 1 27 while the adsorbent after citric acid modification presented a value of 209 54 mg g 1 also for pb ii adsorption 39 regarding morphological characteristics scanning electronic microscopy sem analyses revealed that the moringa oleifera leaves have a porous and irregular surface and after binding with adsorbate become less heterogenous 27 3 3 wood and bark from the systematic search only four articles used moringa oleifera wood as adsorbent and in all four articles the authors performed adsorption studies of heavy metals it is noteworthy that only one article used moringa oleifera wood while the rest employed moringa oleifera bark as an adsorbent the study by kalavathy and miranda 38 proposed the development of an activated carbon from moringa oleifera wood for adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions it was noted that the modified material has a large bet surface area 787 34 m2 g 1 when compared to the raw material favoring a high adsorption capacity of metallic ions this is confirmed by sem analysis which showed a high porosity and the presence of cylindrical structures of different diameters in activated carbon in detriment of an irregular structure without pores on the surface of the raw moringa oleifera regarding the moringa oleifera bark it is possible to observe a significant amount of amorphous material due to the presence of tannins and lignin ft ir analysis indicated a complex nature of this material facilitating its choice as a potential adsorbent in its structure the presence of hydroxyl primary and secondary amides sulfamides and carboxyl acids stands out the same analysis after adsorption process confirms that the co functional groups are related to the interaction with metallic ions cd2 cu2 e pb2 36 2010b thus confirming the need to understand the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent to comprehend the mechanisms present in the adsorption process 4 adsorption studies using moringa oleifera for water treatment 4 1 batch adsorption studies 4 1 1 kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption adsorption kinetic studies are extremely important in the adsorption of pollutants as they show the rates of adsorbate removal in fluid phase with respect to the time this process can be carried out through external mass transfer internal diffusion i e diffusion of molecules inside the pores and surface diffusion in this way the experiments are performed to examine the rate controlling step of adsorption process also explain the mechanism involved 10 38 39 furthermore through kinetic studies it is possible to verify the residual time for the adsorption process 28 to assess the kinetic mechanism the experimental data obtained are analyzed by using different models further to identify in which model the experimental data fit best among the best known are pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren 68 pseudo second order model proposed by ho and mckay 69 and intraparticle diffusion model by weber and morris 70 the kinetic studies can also explain whether adsorption is chemical or physical in nature in the study by tavares et al 3 moringa oleifera pods were used for lead removal from water however two adsorbents were used the first with acid functionalization and the second with basic functionalization the application of the pseudo second order model resulted the best fit for the experimental data for both adsorbent but the material with basic functionalization presented a chemisorption nature in adsorption process and the material with acid treatment presented physisorption nature a similar result was noted in the study of tavares et al 29 which had chemical adsorption for pb ii using moringa oleifera seeds and husks as adsorbent and physical adsorption when moringa oleifera pods were used as the nature of adsorption can be physical or chemical the kinetic mechanism found in the articles explain the adsorption kinetics by electrostatic interactions 20 32 44 ion exchange 39 mass transfer 52 hydrogen bonds 9 and intraparticle diffusion 10 it is important to highlight that among eligible article for this review all articles that performed kinetic studies have their experimental values well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model with the exception of the studies realized by reck et al 52 quesada et al 9 hamadeen et al 41 kannan et al 55 e al kind e al haidari 2021 whose the data present better adjustment following the pseudo first ordem model and the study by escobar et al 46 where the avrami fractional order kinetic model best described the kinetic sorption this model on the other hand considers that the adsorption rates as a function of initial concentration and adsorption time can change during the adsorptive process moreover allowing the determination of fractional kinetic orders 71 in thermodynamic studies the temperature influence is evaluated in a specific range in the adsorptive process based on the data from adsorption isotherms from these data the following parameters will be determined enthalpy variation δh entropy variation δs gibbs free energy δg and equilibrium constant k these parameters need to be correctly estimated as they evaluate the spontaneity of the process indicate the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent explain the nature of the adsorption process chemical or physical and define if there is more enthalpic or entropic contribution to the adsorption process from the gibbs free energy it is possible to estimate the spontaneity of the adsorption where δg 0 indicates a spontaneous process 29 on the other hand an increase in temperature associated with an increase in δg allows the process to be more energetically favorable at higher temperatures 9 42 where the amounts of contaminants adsorbed in equilibrium also will be larger concluding that it is an endothermic process δh 0 35 it is well known that enthalpy determines the heat involve in the reaction where positive values indicate endothermic processes and negative values exothermic processes therefore in a thermodynamic study the endothermic adsorptions will be more favored with increasing temperature 9 the nature of the adsorption can also be verified from the enthalpy data which can indicate whether there is predominance of chemisorption when the adsorption results in chemical bonding or physisorption when the adsorptions occurs through weak interactions such as london dispersion forces 14 60 entropy deals with the randomness of the interaction low and positive values of δs show more affinity of the adsorbate with the bioadsorbent and more randomness of interaction on the surface of the adsorbent solid solution interaction 5 18 low entropy values confirm that there are no significantly changes in the adsorption process and consequently there is the existence of a reversible process 9 for negative entropy values there is a decrease of randomness i e increase in system organization in the interaction between the adsorbate particles on the surface of the adsorbent 3 2017 however it is needs to explain that the spontaneity of the adsorptive process is not directly related to its endothermic or exothermic nature and may vary according to the nature of the adsorbent in the study by souza et al 43 three different adsorbent were used moringa oleifera seed bark and pods for the removal of herbicide diuron although thermodynamic studies show that the process is feasible for all adsorbents an endothermic process was obtained using only seeds as adsorbents it is also necessary to mention there are situations in which gibbs free energy values are higher than zero however the adsorption is still considered spontaneous observing the studied temperature range if there is a decrease in the free energy value with an increase in the temperature value then the process can be considered feasible 35 2013a 4 1 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacity is the adsorbed mass of contaminant per unit e g mass of absorbent used and the values of adsorption capacity for a specific material as well as the adsorbate adsorbent ratio can be described by adsorption isotherms 25 34 the obtention of isotherm curves is fundamental to comprehend and correctly interpret the data obtained from adsorption process since they are an important criterion to optimize the use of the adsorbent the isotherms also indicate if the adsorption process is favorable and present the tendency of the process for monolayer formation 40 72 for these analyses several empirical models aim to assess the best fit of adsorption data among them the most used are the langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich d r and sips isotherms 28 59 the langmuir model assumes that there are a fixed number of active binding sites which are of equal energy and where molecules do not compete in this model the adsorption takes places in a monolayer on homogenous surfaces with no more than one adsorbed molecule per adsorption site and showing the formation of ionic or covalent bonds between the contaminant and the adsorbent 25 28 73 the dimensionless constant rl present in langmuir model known as separation factor expresses in terms of equilibrium parameters if the adsorptive process is favorable or not based on data acquired from the langmuir isotherm 39 the values of rl can stablish the favorable isotherms 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 and irreversible rl 0 36 from the adsorption studies carried out to remove pollutants from water using moringa oleifera it is noted that a significant number of articles with experimental data had a better fit with the langmuir isotherm 74 5 n 38 and with relevant results in the study by ranote et al 19 the maximum adsorption capacity of hg ii using a moringa oleifera gum modified via acryloylation reaction was 840 34 mg g 1 even using unmodified moringa oleifera raw material it is possible to observe greater values of mca as in the study developed by çelekli et al 8 using moringa oleifera seed for rr 120 adsorption which resulted in an mca of 412 32 mg g 1 and in the study by escobar et al 46 where an mca equal to 694 2 mg g 1 was observed using moringa oleifera seed pulp in the adsorption of the dye acid blue 9 the model proposed by freundlich is an empirical equation used to explain the adsorption on heterogenous surfaces applied in the adsorption of organic and inorganic compounds in several types of adsorbents even biosorbents therefore this isotherm assumes that there is a multilayer interaction in a non ideal adsorptive process in various types of adsorption sites which have different adsorption energies 59 74 furthermore it is considered that the strongest binding sites are occupied first so that the bonding forces weaken as the occupation of actives site increase the constant n in freundlich model relates to the reactivity of the adsorbents in the active sites adsorption is favorable when the values of n range from 1 to 10 that is the higher the value of n the greater the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate nevertheless in case n is equal to 1 the adsorption is linear so the energies of the adsorption sites are identical 25 52 temkin isotherm considers that there is an effect on the indirect interactions that occur between the adsorbent and the adsorbate i e uniform distribution of binding energies then the heat of adsorption of all molecules and ions in the layer do not decrease logarithmically but linearly as there is a adsorbent surface coverage 14 38 the dubinin radushkevich d r equilibrium isotherm is generally used to analyze whether the nature of adsorption is physical or chemical this model does not assume that the surface homogeneity of the adsorbent surface or the adsorption potential of sites is constant being therefore a more general model than the langmuir isotherm in this way the adsorption mechanism is defined from the energy distribution on a heterogeneous surface 27 75 the d r model has been employed to determine the mean free energy of adsorption which can be used to identify chemical and physical adsorption if the value of this energy calculated by e 1 2 k is lower than 8 kj mol 1 it is considered a physisorption however a chemical adsorption or ion exchange is recognized when the mean free energy vary between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 8 27 the sips isotherm is an empirical model that can be considered a combination of the characteristics presenting in the langmuir and freundlich models 28 when the adsorption occurs on a heterogenous layer in cases of low concentrations of adsorbate the sips model is like the freundlich isotherm whilst in multilayer adsorptions with high concentrations of adsorbate this model shows characteristics of langmuir isotherm the adsorption capacity obtained from the sips isotherm may be more realistic than the value obtained from the langmuir model because it is assumed that the sips adsorption occurs first in a monolayer followed by a multilayer adsorption 42 4 2 fixed bed column studies the batch adsorption studies have been widely employed to initially verify the efficiency of removal of a contaminant by an adsorbent establishing a maximum quantity of adsorbate that can be removed however this initial process is limited to a low volumes of solution not ensuring this efficiency in a continuous flow and or in large scale adsorptive process 14 therefore in this context it is important to consider the fixed bed column studies which allow a better design of the adsorptive process in addition to presenting low operating costs 76 from these studies it is possible to estimate the adsorption capacity in a continuous flow and the adsorption desorption cycles ideal for a large volume of effluents furthermore it is essential that there are also batch adsorption studies to verify initially the use of a specific material as a potential adsorbent moreover among the eligible articles for this review only 2 two articles performed in addition to batch adsorption studies the fixed bed column studies kannan et al 55 realized a adsorption study of the anionic blue ffs dye using an adsorbent synthesized from the moringa oleifera seeds and calcium alginate the fixed bed tests were carried out at two different columns sizes and at three flow rates where it was observed based on the thomas model a maximum adsorption capacity of 1543 mg g 1 considerably higher than the values obtained by langmuir isotherm 76 92 mg g 1 in another study solutions of naphthol blue black and cr vi at three different concentrations were evaluated in a fixed bed study at three flow rates where it was confirmed the influence of both parameters concentration and flow on the exhaustion time of the column 28 column saturation may be a result of the less transfer resistance due to the increase of adsorbate concentration 77 moreover the decrease in flow rate contributes to the increase in the contact time also increasing the interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 28 4 3 desorption studies reusability in desorption studies it is important to ensure the regeneration capacity of the adsorbent i e the reversibility of the adsorptive process and then to confirm its applicability this step is more necessary when dealing with a high cost adsorbent since in this way the number of cycles which the adsorption process continues to be efficient is evaluated 11 the reusability studies are generally performed through the batch experiments where different solvents can be used to understand the greatest efficiency of solvent recovery although reusability studies were not an eligibility criterion about 47 of the eligible articles had desorption studies n 24 which confirms the need for these studies to assess the reliability of the adsorbent observing its cost effectiveness and reuse in the study carried out by kalavathy e miranda 2010 the adsorption efficiency using various solvents was compared where h2so4 and edta presented the highest percentage of adsorbent recovery efficiency 99 for the three metallic cations studied cu zn and ni in general an acid treatment for biosorbent reusability using hcl is efficient for metal desorption 27 however desorption efficiency can also be evaluated using other solvents such as distilled water in the adsorption of atrazine 18 nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the adsorption of diclofenac 59 and an ethanol water solution 50 v v in the adsorption of tartrazine 52 the recovery efficiency and the number of adsorption desorption cycles which the adsorbent remains efficient is very variable as it depends on several factors nature of the adsorbent chemical physical modification performed on the adsorbent nature of the adsorbate solvent of desorption solvent concentration 5 conclusion in the last decade adsorption studies have proven the efficiency of moringa oleifera in removing emerging contaminants from water since moringa oleifera is a lignocellulosic material with physicochemical properties favorable to the adsorption of several compounds raw moringa oleifera can be used as a low cost material that provides high values of maximum adsorption capacity however several authors have carried out adsorbent modifications such as activated carbon preparation chemical functionalization acidic or basic synthesis of composites or organic reactions e g esterification acryloylation to increase the adsorption capacity of moringa furthermore from this review it was possible to understand the main mechanisms that act in the adsorbent adsorbate interaction essential to verify the feasibility of the adsorption process and the efficiency in water treatment it is also observed that among the eligible articles only two studies presented fixed bed column studies a fundamental step to assesses employability of the adsorbent on large scale and with large volumes of solution finally it is noteworthy that in recent years several parts of moringa oleifera have been used to remove dyes and heavy metals from water however due to the chemical and morphological characteristics of this plant moringa oleifera can still be explored in adsorptive processes of pesticides and pharmaceutical residues as few articles had this focus in the last decade and knowing the problems associated with the contamination of water resources by these substances declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13107,micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf is a surfactant based method used to remove low concentrations of contaminants from water and wastewater streams the process consists of adding surfactant above the critical micelle concentration cmc in the contaminated water to solubilize the contaminant in micelles or to retain ionic contaminants via electro static interaction with ionic micelles the micelles size should be enough to be retained in a membrane with larger pore size than the one needed for the retention of the contaminant only this approach allows the increase of the permeate flux the parameters that influence meuf such as surfactant types membranes transmembrane pressure ph temperature and ionic strength are summarized in this work the literature review is focused on the different uses of meuf in function of the compound to be removed and a comparison of the different methodologies was elaborated the recent patents linked to meuf are also presented a critical analysis of the reviewed data indicated the most frequent gaps in meuf studies such as the lack of information regarding important parameters including ph temperature and permeate flux it was also observed that inaccurate conclusions are commonly associated with imprecise measurements of cmc the main challenge for future industrial scale applications of meuf is to develop studies from the present simple synthetic wastewater in laboratory scale to industrial wastewater on a meuf pilot scale however this review article shows the versatility of meuf as a promising method to remove different types of

pollutant to be removed the processes are classified as primary which removes total suspended solids and free oils secondary which partially removes dissolved solids and tertiary which removes dispersed oils and residual dissolved contaminants 1 2 membrane based processes such as reverse osmosis are a tertiary treatment process widely used to filter inorganic particles as well as to remove microorganisms and organic matter however it is a highly energy intensive process since the operating pressure is very high and the permeability is very low 3 4 over the last years micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf was proposed as an alternative separation process which requires mild operating conditions 5 this process consists of the surfactant addition to the contaminated solution to form micelles which aggregates above the critical micelle concentration of surfactant and can solubilize organic and inorganic contaminants the micelles formed with the contaminants are larger than the contaminant itself which enables the water treatment using an ultrafiltration membrane instead of a nanofiltration one 6 using this strategy membranes with larger pore sizes are still able to significantly retain pollutants from the water and can also allow higher permeate fluxes which is an economic advantage over nanofiltration membranes and reverse osmosis 7 8 meuf limitations are frequently associated with pore obstruction which leads to permeate flux reduction and permeation of surfactant monomers 9 meuf process is widely used to remove several dissolved pollutants such as organic and inorganic compounds in general mainly dyes and metal ions from aqueous solutions 10 11 the role of surfactant in pressure driven membranes techniques was already evaluated in the retention of different pollutants including arsenic methylene blue zinc manganese nickel boron cobalt caffeine and diclofenac 12 existing literature overviews discussed metal retention including cadmium nickel copper zinc chromium and lead 13 and the retention of various dyes like mordant black 17 mordant black 11 and methylene blue 14 however the literature lacks explicit information regarding permeate flux salinity ph surfactant and contaminant concentrations this review intends to be a powerful tool with complete information about meuf process application to treat wastewaters containing diverse organic and inorganic compounds it encompasses the most recent studies on removing ions dyes naphthenic acids and other recalcitrant compounds using meuf including the main operational conditions to allow an effective comparison among different studies furthermore to illustrate the industrial applications of this technique a short description of patents is also presented 2 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process the pressure driven membrane processes are usually classified as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro according to the membrane pore size from the largest to the smallest 12 15 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are very simple and prominent processes commonly used to treat water however they are usually expensive due to the energy demanded by higher pressures 16 18 among the separation processes using membranes the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration is a promising and effective technology for removing low concentrations of contaminants 17 19 meuf technique combines advantages from both uf and nf higher permeate flux from uf and higher selectivity from nf 5 16 the meuf process is based on the addition of surfactant into the stream to be filtered to form tridimensional micelles shapes that solubilize the pollutant inside its structure due to the hydrophobicity of the micelle internal core or to the ionic surface charge of the micelle in case of ionic pollutants 4 20 21 thus the micelle size is about 4 to 11 nm depending on the surfactant contaminant interaction which is large enough to be retained by an ultrafiltration membrane pore size 22 24 however a small portion of surfactant monomers may pass through the membrane along with the permeate flux 5 14 25 26 the surfactant is added in a concentration higher than the critical micellar concentration cmc to form large amphiphilic micelles as seen in fig 1 5 14 25 meuf process advantages include low energy costs high permeate flux and satisfactory retention efficiency compared to the traditional membrane filtrations 4 27 28 the early use of surfactants to enhance ultrafiltration was first reported in 1979 by park a leung s for the removal of phenol using dicocodimethylammonium chloride surfactant 30 later in the 80s other important contributions were made using cetylpyridinium chloride cpc as surfactant in the removal of 4 tert butylphenol 25 o m and p cresol 31 n hexanol n heptanol and n octanol 32 and chromate ions 33 by meuf there are two critical parameters for filtration processes the rejection factor and the permeate flux the rejection factor r which is the fraction of contaminant in the feed stream that permeates the membrane it is calculated from the relation of pollutant concentration in the permeate stream to the pollutant concentration in the feed according to eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p and cf are the concentration of contaminants in the permeate and in the feed solution respectively higher values of r are related to more efficient filtration process 34 the permeate flux is the volume of fluid that permeates the membrane area at a certain time and it is calculated according to eq 2 2 j v t a where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume l t is the processing time h and a is the membrane operational surface area m2 high values of j mean large amount of fluid permeated through the membrane in certain process time some studies showed permeate flux in meuf process varying as low as 2 l m 2 h 1 to over 300 l m 2 h 1 the permeate flux depends exclusively on each configuration process 11 34 35 the process performance depends on several parameters including ph transmembrane pressure tmp concentration and characteristics of surfactants surfactant to pollutant ratio temperature flow rate operating time and membrane type 29 36 the mechanical filtration is the most prominent phenomenon in meuf process however other phenomena such as adsorption when metals ions are adsorbed in the micelle surface solubilization when organics compounds are entrapped inside the micelle and micellization when the surfactants monomers self assembly above their cmc may also occur 28 37 38 meuf performance depends on a complex combination of ions and surfactant structures in the bulk solution the solution ph the surfactant and pollutant molar ratio the transmembrane pressure stirring the permeate flux the pore size and the membrane material are also common parameters that influence the process as shown in fig 2 39 2 1 surfactant surfactants are amphiphilic structures composed of a hydrophobic chain and a hydrophilic head 14 the cmc is an important parameter that refers to the minimum concentration of a surfactant necessary to start the formation of the micelles these micelles are defined as clusters of surfactant monomers and as they begin to form the surface tension of the solution is reduced to a certain extent 40 42 the micelles are tridimensional structures combined by van der waals forces hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions 43 45 the cmc is sensible to parameters such as temperature ph solvent type and the presence of other compounds the addition of electrolyte can facilitate the micelle formation by decreasing the cmc and increasing the aggregation number which is the number of monomers that compose a micelle 46 the physicochemical properties of a solution containing surfactants change according to the concentration of surfactant in the solution the cmc is measured when properties such as electrical conductivity and surface tension change abruptly in response to the addition of small quantities of surfactant in the solution 47 48 the surfactant selection mostly depends on the type of solute to be removed if the compound to be removed is an ion an ionic surfactant with opposite charge is generally chosen as in the case of using the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in the removal of metallic cations cd2 zn2 pb2 and cu2 36 or the retention of f no3 and po4 3 anions using cetylpyridinium chloride cpc or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab as a surfactant 28 49 for the retention of non charged hydrophobic solutes a nonionic surfactant is more appropriate summarizing the nature of the surfactant used in meuf defines the solutes that can be removed 14 43 50 some surfactants frequently used in meuf and their main characteristics are presented in table 1 the influence of surfactant concentration in the retention rate of meuf process was evaluated in some studies it was viewed that the sds concentration varying from 10 to 200 mmol l 1 did not influence the retention of citric and lactic acids 57 on the other hand it was observed that the increase in surfactant concentration influenced the retention and the permeate flux in a meuf process of emerging contaminants using cpc as a surfactant the retention was enhanced due to an increase in the aggregation number and the micelle size which augmented the interaction sites between the contaminants and the cpc micelle it resulted in more contaminants molecules solubilized in micelles increasing the retention however the permeate flux decreased with the increase of cpc concentration due to an intensification in the concentration polarization caused by an accumulation of surfactant monomers on the membrane surface 4 the retention of fluoride using cpc and octadecylamine oda was enhanced with an increase of the surfactants due to more formation of micelles consequentially more ions were attracted to the micelles 28 similar behavior was observed in the retention of methylene blue mb using sds as a surfactant 17 and in the retention of reactive blue 19 using ethyl hexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide ehab and ctab as a surfactants 56 2 1 1 mixed surfactant systems in a solution containing anionic surfactant the addition of a nonionic surfactant decreases the hydrophilic head charge of the anionic surfactant monomer which decreases the electrostatic repulsions furthermore the use of a mixed surfactant system decreases cmc which increases the micelle formation for the same surfactant concentration in some cases the retention rate of contaminant and recovery of surfactants increases considerably with the use of mixed surfactants 21 58 61 a mix of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether pne was used for the organic halogens ox retention in this case when the anionic surfactant concentration was above its cmc and in the presence of nonionic surfactant the retention rate was up to 80 the removal of anionic surfactants was 90 no isolate experiments were made with a single surfactant 61 using sds anionic and triton x 100 nonionic as a surfactant mixture for cadmium retention it was shown that the retention rate of cadmium decreases with the increase of the molar ratio of triton x 100 to sds however the residual surfactant rate was lower in the mixed sds triton x 100 studied system than the one in sds only system furthermore the residual surfactant in the permeate stream decreases with an increase of surfactant 21 on the other hand it was shown that the retention rate of nickel and aniline increases with the addition of the nonionic surfactant brij35 in the sds system it was reached maximum simultaneous retention of 64 and 95 for the aniline and nickel respectively nevertheless it was revealed that the permeate flux decreases with the increase in brij35 concentration 58 for glucose rejection however it was viewed that the highest retention was attained using the single cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab with a rejection of 64 in comparison of ctab triton x 100 mixture with a rejection factor of 48 and the aliquat 336 cationic triton x 100 mixture with a rejection of 56 62 2 1 2 micelle size enlargement as the contaminants particles are solubilized into surfactant micelles the size of micelles becomes larger to a colloidal size 56 63 using the dynamic light scattering dls technique it is possible to measure the size distribution of the micelle in water and in a solution containing the contaminant it was viewed that the cpc micelle size increased from 0 9 nm to 5 nm when the p xylene was solubilized inside the micelle 9 in fact the cpc micelle size usually increases from 1 nm to 3 to 10 nm depending on the target solubilized organic acid long chain organic acids lead to the formation of larger micelles 22 even in the presence of real wastewater the cpc micelle size was reported to be increased 64 using saponin as a surfactant which has a micelle size already large 386 nm the solubilization of methyl violet as a contaminant increased the micelle size up to 540 nm 35 2 1 3 surfactant recovery the retentate stream of meuf process contains a high concentration of surfactant and contaminant since the surfactant can cost a large portion of the process its recovery is economically appreciated furthermore surfactant recovery can reduce secondary pollution to the environment 65 there are few methodologies used to recover surfactant or the contaminant from the retentate stream of the meuf process such as acidification followed by ultrafiltration extraction with n butanol phase separation below the krafft temperature or foam fractioning the acidification followed by ultrafiltration was used to separate cobalt from the retained stream after acidification to ph 1 cobalt particles easily crossed the membrane by replacing the micelle bound to an h ion the cobalt recovery efficiency was 96 the recovery of sds increases with the increase of ph but the metal retention decreases it was estimated that a surfactant recovery of 65 could be attained at ph 3 66 for cadmium retention the acidification ultrafiltration process showed that sds could be recovered and reused only if the recovered sds concentration is above the cmc this recuperation process of acidification ultrafiltration is expensive compared to the use of novel sds reagent but it reduces secondary pollution 65 the use of n butanol was evaluated as a solvent for saponin recovery in an extraction process it was found that 85 of saponin was recovered with a ratio of 1 1 v v of solvent to surfactant solution of 350 mg l 1 35 in a meuf process with beet molasses the treatment of the retentate stream with naoh at ph of 12 56 and refrigeration at 4 5 c below the krafft temperature the temperature that the cmc is equal to the surfactant solubility resulted in formation of supernatant and precipitate phases the sds recovery in the precipitate fraction was above 95 while its concentration in the permeate stream was below 5 57 the leakage of surfactant in the permeate stream is called secondary pollution in some researches it was viewed that the secondary pollution was negligible 67 68 the addition of salts could reduce this leakage 69 the concentration polarization layer could improve the retention of surfactant and pollutant minimizing the secondary pollution 70 the use of cross linked surfactants was also described as reducing secondary pollution 71 72 to avoid secondary pollution biosurfactants could be used 35 73 however when the secondary pollution has already happened the foam fractionation process is commonly used to treat it in this process the surface active compounds are adsorbed to gas bubbles that rise to the top of the liquid surface forming the foam the less surface active compounds remain in the interstitial liquid phase as seen for sds and cadmium recovery 10 21 74 2 2 membranes membranes are a barrier to the solutes while permitting the solvent to pass through 70 membranes are usually synthesized using ceramic or polymer materials thus a compatibility study with the solution to be filtered is a fundamental step for the membrane selection 14 75 ceramic membranes can endure flows with higher temperatures or more extreme ph compared to the polymeric ones 3 when pores much smaller than the contaminants are used a satisfactory efficiency is obtained however membrane fouling is also favored to prevent fouling it is necessary to select the membrane surface charge considering its capacity to facilitate the permeation of suitable molecules 75 other important parameters when choosing membranes are the porosity and hydrophobicity which are selected according to the characteristics of the solution to be filtered furthermore the ultrafiltration membranes are classified by their molecular weight of cut off mwco measured in kilodaltons kda the mwco value indicates the molecular mass of solute that is 90 to 99 rejected by the membrane the exact efficiency depends on the manufacturer 14 76 the accumulation of solute near the membrane surface causes an increase in concentration by convective and diffusive forces this phenomenon is called concentration polarization as shown in fig 3 where the contaminant concentration increases from the homogeneous solution to the gel layer this phenomenon is one of the main causes of flux decline during the separation process 28 76 as a result the layer reduces the permeate flow and creates a concentration profile on the membrane surface therefore mass diffusion occurs from the concentration polarization layer to the bulk and convective transport also occurs across the membrane tending to an equilibrium that can be described by eq 3 the concentration polarization is the major limiting phenomenon to the filtration performance since it increases the filtration resistance near the membrane surface 39 76 77 3 j ss d m δ ln c g c b where j ss is the flow rate of the solution in the steady state m s 1 d m is the effective mass diffusivity of the solute m2 s 1 δ is the thickness of the concentration polarization layer m and c g and c b are the contaminant concentrations in the gel layer and the bulk mg m 3 respectively as an example in the studies conducted by shi et al 70 the concentration polarization layer was able to count up to 50 of the total resistance in the cadmium retention in a system using sds as a surfactant it was evaluated that sds concentration near the membrane was 13 mm while the bulk concentration was 0 8 mm the concentration polarization phenomenon is the main cause of membrane fouling and is mainly caused by the deposition of surfactant micelles on the membrane surface and the adsorption of surfactant in the membrane interior 78 the fouling type is commonly determined by hernia blocking model by four different physical concepts standard pore blocking complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation as shown in table 2 79 in a meuf system using different gemini surfactants to remove phenol it was viewed that different blocking models are able to influence the membrane fouling however the cake formation was the main form of membrane fouling 80 evaluating sdbs ctab and tween 80 as surfactant it was observed that the fouling mechanism is different depending on the concentration of cobalt used in experiments due to cmc changes and electrical charges of micelles and membranes for cobalt concentrations between 0 and 1 mg l 1 it was observed standard and intermediate pore blocking while for co 5 mg l 1 the main mechanism was the cake formation 81 in another study both cake formation model and standard pore blocking were the main cause of membrane fouling for cobalt retention using sds as a surfactant it was concluded that the rejection of cobalt for low concentration of sds was due to the fouling layer formed by deposition of sds on the membrane surface 19 using esterquat as a surfactant for the recovery of polyphenols and polysaccharides it was found that the complete pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism 82 2 3 operational characteristics the filtration processes are generally divided into two modes of operation dead end filtration in which the feed flux is perpendicular to the membrane and crossflow filtration in which the feed stream flows tangentially to the membrane surface in the dead end mode the flow quickly decreases over time due to the severe obstruction of the membrane pores to prevent this clogging a stirred system is typically adopted 26 27 the crossflow mode is performed combined with a recycling system to avoid complete obstruction of the membrane and to assure continuous flow which makes this type of system widely applied in industries 4 66 83 the crossflow operation mode is commonly used when the solution presents a high concentration of suspended solids while dead end operation mode is recommended for laboratory studies in fig 4 it is possible to observe that the concentration polarization layer is reduced in crossflow filtration when compared to the dead end mode besides the permeate flux in dead end filtration decreases up to zero with the increase of polarization layer resistance meanwhile in crossflow filtration the feed flow over the membrane surface minimizes the polarization layer due to the rinsing effect 1 76 2 3 1 transmembrane pressure transmembrane pressure is a fundamental parameter in membrane filtration since it is the most common driving force used in mf uf and nf processes it refers to the pressure difference between the retained and the permeate phases that push the passage of the solution through the membrane surface as seen in eq 4 in other words it is a pressure drop between the membrane external and internal surfaces this parameter is necessary to model the membrane hydrodynamic resistance or the fouling resistance another fundamental variable in membrane filtration 84 86 4 tmp p in p r 2 p p where p in is the pressure in the membrane inlet pa p r is the pressure of the retentate stream pa and p p is the pressure of the permeate stream pa 68 in eq 5 the tmp is a variable for calculating the membrane resistance and fouling resistance 5 j tmp μ r m r f where j is the permeate flux m3 m 2 s 1 tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of solution pa s r m is the membrane hydrodynamic resistance m 1 and r f is the fouling resistance m 1 38 despite the importance of this parameter it was reported that tmp presented no influence in the retention of some contaminants and in the presence of some surfactants such as emerging contaminants and the surfactant cpc 4 the safranin t 87 the yttrium and zinc 83 the naphthenic acids in the presence of sds as a surfactant 88 and the methyl violet with saponin and without surfactant 35 nevertheless it is known that tmp influences the permeate flux 15 87 89 differently it was described that an increase of the tmp could enlarge the gel layer and consequently increase the retention of cadmium using sds as a surfactant 70 and in the chloride retention using ctab as a surfactant 5 nonetheless an increase in tmp led to a reduction in the retention of the dye black mordant 17 in the presence of different cationic surfactants 90 the increase in tmp decreased the aniline retention 91 and the methyl violet retention using sds as a surfactant 17 2 3 2 crossflow velocity for a fixed pressure drop in a meuf systems the permeate flux generally increases when the crossflow rate is also increased until certain limit this behavior was observed in the retention of copper and cadmium using sds as surfactant 68 and for cadmium only retention 70 the increase in the permeate flux was also viewed during naphthenic acids recovery using sds as surfactant this increase was due to higher shear induced by higher crossflow rates however the retention of surfactant and pollutant was little influenced by the crossflow rate 88 similar results were obtained in methylene blue retention using sds as a surfactant the crossflow velocity positively influenced the permeate flux but slightly influenced the retention rate 92 2 3 3 ph the ph can play an important role in ultrafiltration mainly when solutes are able to change their charge in solution the ph of the solution should be evaluated along with the charge of the surfactant since there is a competition between the ions of the solution and the contaminant molecules for micelle formation 23 35 87 besides the ph can interfere in the filtration flux since it can modify the physical properties of the solution such as viscosity 14 82 the ph can also change the membrane hydrophobicity allowing higher or lower permeate flux across the membrane 90 samal et al 35 reported that in the retention of methyl violet using saponin as a surfactant the ph did not influence the dye retention however it was also reported that the alkaline medium reduced the permeate flux by the precipitation of dye in the membrane surface increasing the gel layer on the other hand in arsenic retention using cpc as a surfactant the retention of contaminant decreases in acidic ph 27 the same behavior was observed in the retention of the dye black mordant 17 with the surfactants c12tab c14tab c16tab or c18tab where the permeate flux was lower in acidic ph 90 in retention of metals such as lead cadmium zinc or copper using sds as a surfactant the retention varies from 0 to 97 99 depending on the ph the optimum retention ph for lead was between 2 and 10 to cadmium was above 3 to zinc was 3 8 and 10 to copper was above 3 36 it was shown that high ph values decrease the retention due to deprotonation of polyphenols and a consequent decrease in interactions with the surfactant 15 93 it was reported that acid ph increases the retention of aniline due to the positively charged formed which is attracted to the anionic sites of surfactant 91 and increases the retention rate of chloride using ctab as a surfactant 5 2 3 4 temperature temperature control is essential in meuf processes since water or wastewater streams may be either freezing or up to 80 c depending on the processes or seasonality higher temperatures can turn the hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions weaker compromising the micelle formation 75 94 on the other hand it was reported that the permeate flux increases with an augmentation in temperature due to a reduction of the gel layer suggesting a positive effect on meuf process 8 57 89 95 the temperature plays an important role specifically when using polymeric membranes which may be affected by temperatures above 50 c 96 97 likewise the size and shape of the micelles depend on temperature and ionic strength these parameters can collaborate to increase or decrease the micellization process 5 69 consequently affect the cmc value 44 45 61 98 2 3 5 contaminant concentration in the feed solution meuf studies are generally focused on the variation of surfactant concentration along with the experiments however few authors also explored the initial concentration of contaminants in the feed solutions for the removal of methyl violet by meuf feed concentrations of 200 and 250 mg l 1 were used combined with saponin as surfactant csurf 2 3 5 and 10 g l 1 removals higher than 99 were achieved for both contaminant initial concentrations suggesting a strong interaction between methyl violet and saponin to form micelles 35 however it is important to point out that the contaminant concentration was much lower 200 250 mg l 1 than the surfactant concentration 2 10 g l 1 a similar variation of contaminant concentration was studied by huang et al 19 the removal of cadmium was evaluated with feed concentrations of 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 the study assessed a cd ii removal of 90 using 4 mmol l 1 of sds as a surfactant the contaminant retention decreased with an increase in its initial concentration in the feed solution this result indicates a screening of membrane charge at high cd ii concentrations in order to assess the effect of dye concentration on the membrane separation process parakala moulik and sridhar 17 evaluated the removal of methylene blue using a feed concentration from 5 to 40 mg l 1 and fixed sds concentration of 32 8 mmol l 1 equivalent to 4 cmc in water a decrease in the permeate flux from 69 8 to 52 9 l m 2 h 1 was observed and decreased dye rejection from 99 8 to 95 4 the flux drop was probably affected due to the accumulation of micelles on the membrane surface which increased resistance to flux because sds concentration was fixed for all experiments likely micelle formation was also constant thus dye molecules that were not trapped into micelles could directly permeate membrane pores decreasing dye rejection meuf performance was also examined using different initial concentrations of sulfate combined with a blend of surfactant polymer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab poly diallydimethylammonium chloride pdadmac 99 the range of sulfate concentration varied from 1 to 20 mmol l 1 as a result the authors observed that the quantity of surfactant micelles or polymer ligands in the feed solutions affected sulfate retention with the use of fixed feed concentration of ctab pdadmac sulfate retention decreased with the increase in feed sulfate concentration this result suggests that at low initial sulfate concentrations the available binding sites provided by surfactant micelles or polymer ligands are most favorable exchange takes place between so4 2 and br in case of ctab and between so4 2 and cl in case of 4 pdadmac in the neighborhood of the polar heads as the permeation occurs it gradually saturates the adsorbent a series of n alkyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactants cntab were assessed by zaghbani hafiane and dhahbi 90 to study the effect of alkyl chain length on the efficiency of meuf process thus different surfactants c12tab c14tab c16tab and c18tab at three feed concentrations of eriochrome blue black r ebbr 0 1 0 5 and 1 mmol l 1 were studied the authors observed that the ebbr retention by c12 and c14 surfactants depended on the dye concentration for c12 the removals for 0 1 0 5 and 1 mmol l 1 were 34 6 42 7 and 51 4 respectively for c14 the removals were 51 1 54 3 and 97 9 respectively this result suggests that the saturation of solubilization was achieved for these surfactants however for c16 and c18 dye removal was kept higher than 99 for all ebbr concentrations tested 2 4 addition of salts sodium chloride played an important role in solution with surfactants since the electrolyte decreases the repulsion forces between the charges of the surfactant monomers facilitating the stabilization of micelles and consequently decreasing the cmc 61 87 the addition of different salts in concentrations up to 1 mol l 1 did not change the retention rate of black mordant 17 in meuf process however the salt presence decreased the permeate flow by increasing the micelle formation which increases the concentration polarization near the membrane surface 90 in methyl violet retention using saponin as a surfactant the addition of nacl up to 50 g l 1 increased the micelle size and decreased the cmc 35 the retention of methyl violet using sds as a surfactant was increased with the addition of 20 g l 1 of nacl 17 in the arsenic retention using cpc as a surfactant the metal retention decreased when a concentration up to 50 mmol l 1 of nacl was added to the solution 27 similarly in the retention of naphthenic acids using sds as a surfactant the addition of 0 01 to 0 1 mol l 1 of nacl decreased the retention from 98 to 95 and the permeate flow decreased about 10 88 the addition of nacl up to 2 g l 1 in enrofloxacin retention using cpb as a surfactant led to a decrease in the contaminant retention and in the permeate flux this was caused by the competition of the ion cl to solubilization into the micelle core the decrease in permeate flux was due to a decrease in the membrane permeability caused by an increase in electrostatic repulsion among the micelles 16 on the other hand the addition of 17 54 g l 1 of nacl in methylene blue retention using sds as a surfactant allowed an increase in the contaminant retention from 62 to 97 69 the presence of salts in the solution could be a limiting factor due to the competition of pollutant anions and the salt anions to the micelle surface charge as the micelles are considered nano scale ion exchangers the basic theory about ion exchangers is applied to predict the affinity distribution of these anions in waters containing a mixture of different anions and a surfactant 27 this theory was applied to evaluate common water anions in a cationic surfactant as cpc and ctab the affinity of anions to micelles was found to decrease as fe cn 6 3 cro4 2 so4 2 haso4 2 hpo4 2 no3 br no2 cl hco3 h2aso4 h2po4 f io3 the anions in the aqueous solution with greater affinity with the micelle will replace the original ion of the surfactant monomer and once it is associated these anions ionic bonded to the micelle surface will be rejected by ultrafiltration 71 100 102 2 5 evaluation of meuf process the meuf process depends on the interactions of the micelles and solutes to increase its performance then the separation efficiency of meuf is commonly evaluated by calculating physical parameters such as micelle loading binding constant and distribution coefficient 14 51 63 2 5 1 loading capacity the loading capacity is a proportion of pollutant solubilized in the micelles to the concentration of surfactant that formed the micelles and it is calculated according eq 6 51 103 6 l m p r p p s r cmc where l m is the loading capacity mmol l mmol 1 l 1 p is the pollutant concentration and s is the concentration of surfactant which contributes to surfactant pseudophase the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams and the cmc represents the critical micelle concentration of surfactant 104 2 5 2 binding constant the binding constant is one parameter commonly used to evaluate the affinity of organic compounds for the micelles and consequently the prediction of the feasibility of removing a solute by meuf 55 104 during the meuf process the binding constant decreases as the surfactant concentration increases in the retentate stream 55 63 it is calculated according to eqs 7 8 9 and 10 7 k p p m p w s 8 p m p r p p 9 p w p p 10 s s r cmc where k p is the binding constant l mmol 1 m and w subscripts represent the micellar and aqueous pseudophases respectively p is the pollutant concentration and s is the concentration of surfactant which contributes to surfactant pseudophase the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams and the cmc represents the critical micelle concentration of surfactant 2 5 3 distribution coefficient when a solute is introduced into two phase system it will be distributed in the two phases when the equilibrium is reached the distribution of this solute is defined as distribution coefficient and it is calculated by the concentration ratio of this solute in one phase to the other in the equilibrium condition in meuf system the distribution coefficient is the ratio of the solute present in the retentate to the solute in the permeate stream as shown in eq 11 55 63 11 d p r p p where d is the distribution coefficient p is the pollutant concentration and the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams an increase in the distribution coefficient indicates that more surfactant molecules exist in the micellar phase binding more pollutant as consequence 51 3 water and wastewater treatment by meuf extended research of the meuf process for different and relevant contributions in the last 12 years were made the results were categorized into four subtopics depending on the contaminant type anions cations dyes and organic compounds besides the small amount of meuf studies in this period different contaminants surfactants and membranes were evaluated among them a small portion of these studies was made with real wastewater additionally the process parameters of meuf studies are not always shown important information such as the permeate flux the temperature and even the ph are occasionally missing the contaminant retention rates shown in this research were always the high value reported by the authors 3 1 removal of anions by meuf a complex mixture of anions is present in water and wastewater streams including nitrate phosphate arsenate and chromate these anions competing for the micelle charge reducing the removal efficiency of target anions 100 dissolved anions are commonly present in produced water as chloride sulfate carbonate and bicarbonate which affects the conductivity and the scale forming potential 105 anions pollutants may also be present in groundwater due to agricultural activities 106 in table 3 it is presented a compilation meuf works for anion retention fluoride removal 10 mg l 1 was evaluated using membranes of polyether sulfone pes and regenerated cellulose rc of 4 and 5 kda respectively and cpc or octadecylamine oda as surfactants the highest retention obtained was 90 when using pes membrane combined with cpc in a ratio of 92 surfactant contaminant it was shown that retention increases with an increase in surfactant concentration an increase in the fluoride concentration decreases the retention rate it was concluded that the surfactant gel layer formed at the surface of the membrane enhances retention efficiency it was verified that the addition of sodium chloride significantly reduces the cmc of the surfactants and the retention efficiency due to the competition of ions 28 membrane pore size plays an important role in retention efficiency and at the permeate flux of the process the retention of tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah 2 88 g l 1 was evaluated in two different membranes 1 kda and 210 kda resulting in a flux of 35 and 90 l m 2 h 1 and a retention of 99 and 80 respectively for a ratio of surfactant to the contaminant of 1 44 the resistance to mass transfer was calculated and it was shown that the total resistance of the 210 kda membrane was unexpectedly higher than the one for 1 kda membrane 107 it was used sds concentrations above and below the cmc however the referenced cmc was calculated in pure water then as seen before the presence of tmah in solution may decrease the cmc allowing the formation of the micelles even in lower surfactant concentrations than expected it was studied sulfate retention 0 96 g l 1 using ctab as a surfactant and a 10 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose in a surfactant contaminant ratio of 38 it was viewed that the permeate flux decreases with the increase of the surfactant concentration from about 80 l m 2 h 1 using 3 64 g l 1 of ctab to 20 l m 2 h 1 using 36 4 g l 1 of ctab high retention rates were attained when the initial sulfate concentration was lower than 0 96 g l 1 99 using a surfactant contaminant ratio of 0 56 a hypochlorite retention rate of 75 was shown for an initial contaminant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 the ctab was used as a surfactant it was used a self made polyethersulfone titania membrane high retentions were attained in ph 2 to 4 and high tmp the permeate flux decreases when the ionic strength increases it was concluded that the concentration polarization phenomenon was more effective than the micelle formation 5 the retention of phosphate 15 mg l 1 using cpc and oda as a surfactant was evaluated in three pes membranes of 4 30 and 50 kda the surfactant contaminant ratio used varied from 39 to 128 higher retention rates were attained using the oda as a surfactant about 99 than the cpc 80 when using the cpc as a surfactant it was shown that the membrane pore size negatively influences the retention of phosphate and the cpc concentration positively influences the retention when using oda as a surfactant no significant change in retention rate was observed for the different membranes surfactant concentrations and tmp 108 another study evaluated the retention of phosphate nitrate and the mixture of both ions using ctab as a surfactant in regenerated cellulose membranes of 5 10 and 30 kda the highest retention rates were attained using the 10 kda membrane for phosphate only meuf initial concentration of 15 mg l 1 the highest retention rate attained was about 54 using a tmp of 200 kpa and a surfactant contaminant ratio of 66 for nitrate only meuf initial concentration of 28 mg l 1 the highest retention rate of 91 was reached using a tmp of 150 kpa and a surfactant contaminant ratio of 24 the simultaneous retention rate of phosphate and nitrate was less favorable than the retention of one component system reaching 34 and 84 for phosphate and nitrate respectively it was concluded that the 30 kda membrane was most vulnerable to fouling increasing the surfactant concentration significantly enhanced phosphate retention but not nitrate 49 the retention of nitrate phosphate and sulfate was evaluated from real river water using cpc 10 mmol l 1 as a surfactant in a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 46 as the evaluated water was a mixture of different salts the meuf process was still able to retain 84 of nitrate 91 of phosphate and 97 of sulfate using the binary ion exchange thermodynamic model it was calculated the selectivity of common anions of water to the surfactant micelle that was cro4 2 so4 2 hpo4 2 no3 br no2 cl hco3 h2po4 f the results showed that despite a large amount of sulfate concentration in the water it did not affect nitrate and phosphate removal 102 the meuf process was tested for a mixture containing nitrate 0 1 g l 1 and arsenate 0 001 g l 1 using a self made polyacrylonitrile membrane and cpc 1 7 g l 1 as a surfactant the retention rate was increased and the permeate flux decreased by increasing the surfactant concentration the presence of nitrate in the solution doesn t inhibit the binding of arsenate to the micelles however the retention of arsenate decreased 3 4 the presence of arsenate decreased the retention of nitrate as the arsenate bound to cpc micelles preferentially to nitrate 20 arsenate 7 5 g l 1 was successfully removed 97 of retention using cpc as a surfactant with a ratio of 277 surfactant contaminant a decrease in retention was observed when lowering the ph from 8 2 to 5 0 due to the formation of monovalent arsenate which poorly interacts with the micelle adding up to 50 mm of nacl in the solution also reduced the retention rate due to competition of the anions to the cationic sites of the surfactant it was suggested that arsenate retention would be limited in waters with a high concentration of anions 27 3 2 removal of cations by meuf dissolved cations are commonly present in produced water as sodium potassium calcium barium magnesium iron and strontium which also affect the conductivity and the scale forming potential 105 treating large volumes of aqueous streams contaminated with metals by conventional methods does not always combine low cost high selectivity and recycling capacity 29 the meuf process may be used to remove low metal concentrations of these aqueous streams 21 table 4 shows a compilation of meuf research involving metallic ions removal by meuf the retention of cadmium was evaluated by various studies mainly using sds as a surfactant retention of 90 was attained for 50 mg l 1 of cadmium using 5 10 and 30 kda pes membranes and a ratio of 23 of surfactant contaminant it was viewed that high retention was attained with the 5 kda membrane retention of 20 to 60 of sds were obtained furthermore the surfactant monomers aggregate into hemimicelles which are formed due to the adsorption of surfactant on the membrane surface it was concluded that the cadmium retention was related to the fouling layer formed by sds 19 it was shown retention of 99 for an initial cadmium concentration of 50 mg l 1 in a 10 kda membrane of pes and ratio of surfactant contaminant of 46 it was shown that the concentration of sds near the membrane surface was 16 higher than the sds concentration in the bulk solution it was observed that high tmp increases the retention rate it was concluded that the flux decline in the process was due to micelles formed in the concentration polarization layer which accounted for 50 of the total resistance 70 a ratio of 43 of surfactant to contaminant was used to obtain retention of up to 99 of cadmium ions 50 mg l 1 using sds as a surfactant combined with 10 kda membrane of polysulfone ps it was viewed that the cadmium retention increases with the augmentation of sds concentration until 1 mmol l 1 and after that the retention rate decreased 109 the authors used the lowest tmp of the evaluated works that is 30 kpa but due to high effective membrane area of 3000 cm2 its permeate flux of 10 15 l m 2 h 1 is near to other metallic retention works that used high tmp from 80 to 207 kpa and permeate flux from 13 to 114 l m 2 h 1 besides that the cmc cited is the cmc in water which does not represent the accurate cmc of surfactant in the presence of other electrolytes as reported by naskar et al 53 retention of 93 was obtained using an 8 kda pes membrane and a ratio of 17 surfactant contaminant retention rate of 72 was obtained using a mixture of sds and triton x 100 as surfactants an additional study with foam fractionation was presented with increased cadmium retention up to 98 no permeate flux was mentioned it was shown that the residual surfactant decreases when increasing the mixture of surfactants sds triton x 100 but decreases in the sds only system 21 the retentions of lead cadmium zinc and copper were evaluated separately using a 10 kda membrane of pes and a ratio of 46 surfactant contaminant retentions up to 97 99 were attained 36 the permeate flux was not shown it was interesting presented the influence of solution ph in the metal retention however the experimental room temperature varied from 20 to 30 c which influences the micellization and the meuf efficiency as reported by huang et al 69 simultaneous retentions of yttrium 30 mg l 1 and zinc 2 mg l 1 were evaluated using sds as a surfactant in a ratio to the contaminant of 90 retentions of 100 and 99 88 were attained for yttrium and zinc respectively two membrane pore sizes of 1 and 210 kda were used the effect of sds concentration and the tmp was also evaluated it was concluded that the membrane pore size is the most influential factor for metal retention 83 meuf was successfully used to remove nickel ions 70 mg l 1 from aqueous streams retention of almost 99 was attained using a 3 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose in neutral ph and a 68 surfactant contaminant ratio the response surface methodology was used to evaluate tmp contaminant concentration sds concentration and membrane pore size in constant ph 8 it was viewed a 5 fold increase in the permeate flux from 23 to 115 l m 2 h 1 when the membrane pore size was augmented from 3 to 10 kda however the nickel retention was slightly decreased from 98 7 to 97 8 it was concluded that all the factors were significant for meuf efficiency and the sds concentration was the most influential 29 cobalt retention was evaluated using sds as a surfactant and a ratio of 297 surfactant contaminant which resulted in retentions of 93 and 97 when using zro2 membranes of 1 and 210 kda pore sizes respectively the retentate fraction of the experiment was acidified and passed through another ultrafiltration in the same membrane allowing 96 of cobalt recuperation which is caused by a replacement of the h into the micelle anionic sites previously occupied by the metal cation 66 a boron meuf study 5 mg l 1 obtained retention of 99 using sds as a surfactant ratio of 230 surfactant contaminant combined with a 1 kda ceramic membrane pore size it was shown that high tmp reduces the retention rate a membrane of 210 kda was also evaluated however its retention was only 49 using 10 mmol l 1 of surfactant the filtration without the addition of surfactant resulted in retention of 97 45 using the 1 kda membrane and 800 kpa 110 the membrane pore size of 1 kda used in this study was relatively small since the ultrafiltration without any surfactant resulted in a retention of 97 45 which does not justify the use of surfactant to remove only 2 15 more of contaminant in this study it is affirmed that the use of surfactant was below the cmc however it was supposed that the cmc was calculated in pure water the paper does not show the calculations and this could lead to an erroneous interpretation of the results since the cmc normally decreases in the presence of other solutes 3 3 removal of dyes by meuf synthetic dyes which are toxic to the environment are present in processed water from textile industries these streams are frequently treated by adsorption coagulation flocculation oxidation process and biological techniques however each technique has particular limitations 17 since meuf process is a separation technique that uses the affinity of contaminants to the surfactant micelles to solubilize the contaminant this technique has been effectively used to remove dyes 35 in table 5 it is presented some works with dye removal by meuf and it is possible to observe that the methylene blue removal was a common object of study a pes membrane was used with a pore size of 0 01 μm with sds as a surfactant in a 20 g l 1 of nacl for retention of 10 mg l 1 of methylene blue it was attained retention of 99 6 the ratio of surfactant contaminant was 946 it was viewed that the mb retention was increased with an increase in the sds concentration or the nacl concentration nevertheless it was shown that the mb retention decreased with an increase of the tmp or the mb concentration in the initial solution 17 extended research was made using three different surfactants sds laureth 6 carboxylic acid rlm45 and oleth 10 carboxylic acid ro90 and four different membrane pore sizes 5 10 30 and 100 kda for an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 of mb it was assured retentions smaller than 10 and up to 95 with higher retentions obtained using smaller membrane pore sizes a surfactant contaminant ratio of 588 was used in the filtrations with sds 218 for rlm45 and 290 to ro90 when using 30 or 100 kda membrane higher retentions were shown using surfactants rlm45 and ro90 than the sds due to the formation of large micelle sizes 11 using a ratio of sds to methylene blue mb of 385 retention of 99 of mb 6 mg l 1 was attained it was used a 10 kda membrane it was shown that the addition of 17 53 g l 1 of nacl in the solution increased the retention of sds from 62 to almost 97 while maintaining almost the same retention of mb it was concluded that the temperature increases the retention of mb from the retentate stream due to an increase in the solubility of the mb 69 the retention of reactive blue 19 60 mg l 1 was evaluated using ehab and ctab as surfactants in a regenerated cellulose membrane of 5 10 and 30 kda it was viewed that in the 5 kda membrane pore size the retention without using any surfactant was above 99 indicating that the surfactant does not play a role in this membrane size due to the larger molecular size of the dye using ctab as a surfactant a ratio of surfactant dye of 14 was used for both 10 and 30 kda membranes and retentions of 99 62 and 96 85 were attained respectively using the ehab as a surfactant a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 12 was used for the 10 and the 30 kda membranes it was observed that the increase in surfactant concentration increases the retention rate and decreases the permeate flux retentions of 98 99 and 94 97 were obtained respectively it was concluded that the 10 kda membrane was the most efficient for meuf process due to higher permeate flux than the ultrafiltration with a 5 kda membrane 56 retention of eriochrome blue black r ebbr at a 42 mg l 1 using a 10 kda regenerated cellulose membrane with four different cationic surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide c12tab tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide c14tab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide c16tab and octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide c18tab was evaluated three concentrations of dyes were tested 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm of ebbr using a concentration of 10 times the surfactant cmc it was shown a retention rate above 99 8 when using c18tab retention above 99 6 using c16tab retention rate from 51 1 to 97 9 using c14tab and retention rate from 34 6 to 51 4 using the c12tab the chain length of the surfactant positively influences the retention rate and the permeate flux it was shown that an increase of up to 1 mol of different salts did not change dye retention but decreased the permeate flux moreover the use of acid ph values also led to a decrease in the permeate flow while the retention rate remains almost constant 90 methyl violet retention using saponin as a biosurfactant and four pes membranes with 10 20 30 and 50 kda were evaluated a ratio of surfactant dye of 8 was used in a feed of 250 mg l 1 of methyl violet and 2000 mg l 1 of saponin it was attained a rejection of methyl violet higher than 99 and 97 to 10 and 20 kda membranes respectively for the 30 kda membrane it was about 81 while for the 50 kda membrane it was about 62 the retention of saponin was high about 71 in a 10 kda membrane it was observed that the permeate flux increased from 2 to 11 lm 2 h 1 to the 10 and 50 kda membrane respectively the tmp the ph and the salinity did not influence the retention of dye 35 sunset yellow removal was studied using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and ethyl hexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide ehab as surfactants in a regenerated cellulose membrane of 10 and 30 kda the dye concentration in the feed was 45 mg l 1 the retention rates using ctab were 99 94 and 99 60 for a surfactant contaminant ratio of 18 6 and 17 in a 10 and 30 kda membrane respectively the retention rate using ehab as a surfactant was 99 61 for the 10 kda membrane and 99 05 for the 30 kda membrane the surfactant contaminant radio used was 16 for both membranes with ehab the surfactant concentration had a positive effect on the retention rate of dye while the retention of the membranes pore size of 10 and 30 did not show a significant difference it was concluded that both surfactants did not play a role in the retention rate in a 10 kda membrane due to the high retention of dye without using any surfactant 34 using the saponin as biosurfactant it was attained retention of 97 of the dye remazol red rb rrrb and 99 for the remazol turquoise blue rtb it was used a pes membrane of 10 kda in a flat sheet crossflow ultrafiltration mode a surfactant contaminant ratio of about 13 33 was used it was reached a retention rate of up to 98 it was observed that the addition of saponin significantly increases the retention of the dye and slightly decreases the permeate flux it was concluded that the fouling mechanism is different for the uf process without saponin with saponin below the cmc and with saponin above the cmc 103 3 4 removal of organic compounds by meuf water and wastewater contaminated with recalcitrant organic pollutants can be originated from both domestic and industrial activities in fact the waste streams from domestic wastewater pharmaceutical industries and hospitals may contain antibiotics and other pharmaceutical products from nanogram to microgram scale 16 besides that organic acids are present in the effluent of sugar beet processing plants 57 moreover different polyphenols compounds are found in olive mill wastewater 93 table 6 shows the most recent meuf studies involving organic contaminants the retention of 600 mg l 1 of different organic acids from olive mill synthetic wastewater was evaluated in a 10 kda membrane the ratio of surfactant to the contaminant used was 0 41 it was shown that retentions higher than 90 were attained with a cationic surfactant esterquat in the first minutes of filtration after that due to concentration polarization the retention decreased 20 a polyphenols rejection of 20 without using any surfactant was obtained due to the adsorption of polyphenols in the membrane it was demonstrated that the retention curve in function of the surfactant concentration tends to flatten when the surfactant concentration reached 5 times the cmc which was the best surfactant concentration it was revealed that the addition of non ionic surfactant did not influence the rejection factor retentions of 93 and 95 were attained in ph 1 and 3 respectively 15 treating real olive mill wastewater in a membrane of polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf a polyphenols retention of 74 was attained using the anionic surfactant sds 27 97 g l 1 at the optimum ph of 2 it was shown that the initial permeate flux of 25 7 with 3 5 bar and 44 5 l m 2 h 1 with 4 5 bar reduced 60 and 65 respectively in the end of the process time this behavior indicates that high pressures may cause severe fouling for the total membrane resistance 91 was caused by the addition of sds the permeate was 88 less dark demanding less chemical oxygen for its oxidation it was concluded that the meuf process could be used to treat olive mill wastewater for the concentration and recovery of polyphenols 93 the retention of enrofloxacin 9 mg l 1 using a pes membrane of 10 kda and cationic surfactant cpb in a ratio surfactant to contaminant of 179 was achieved reaching up to 94 of rejection with a permeate flux of 45 63 l m 2 h 1 a tmp of 4 bar and the optimum ph of 7 the process was modeled and it was shown that an artificial neural network predicts better the results than the response surface methodology 16 a study using a mixture of ten contaminants of emerging concern combined with five different surfactants sds triton x 100 tween 20 cpc and ctab was conducted with a pes membrane of 5 kda the higher retention values were obtained in the presence of the cationic surfactant cpc retentions up to 99 were attained for four of the contaminants sulfamethoxazole ketorolac hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac and up to 87 for other three flumequine atrazine and isoproturon it was shown that electrostatic interactions of anionic contaminant and cationic surfactant played an important role in retention 4 the retention of organic acids was successfully evaluated by geanta et al 57 the lactic and citric acids at the initial concentration of 4 14 and 8 84 g l 1 respectively were removed using sds in a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 6 9 and 3 2 respectively with a 5 kda membrane of tio2 retentions of 93 7 and 90 1 were attained respectively lower retentions were attained using other surfactants it was viewed that the concentration of sds in the permeate fraction remains constant below the cmc and it was concluded that the affinity of the sds micelles by the acids depends on the initial concentration of surfactant the retention of organic halogens from an industrial powder and detergent wastewater using a mixture of surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether pne when the conductivity of the stream was up to 5 1 μs cm 1 80 92 of organic halogens were removed when by the polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf membrane with 180 kda pore size it was not viewed as irreversible membrane fouling due to membrane hydrophilicity it was concluded that the electrolytes in solution affect the meuf efficiency and the retention of organic halogens increased above 90 if the conductivity of the wastewater was at least at 4 0 μs cm 1 even with the surfactant concentration below the cmc 61 however the cmc cited is referring to the cmc in water and it is well known that the cmc value changes according to the characteristics of the medium a ratio of 1215 of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab to contaminant was used to remove 25 to 100 of three different sulfonamides with a 3 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose rc in secondary sewage from a regional treatment plant the authors also evaluated the meuf process in a solution containing sediments and dissolved organic matter it was concluded that sediment increases the retention of contaminants but the presence of dissolved organic matter does not increase the retention of contaminants 111 aniline retention of 78 was obtained using a mixture of surfactants sds and rhamnolipid in a ratio of 8 2 the factors evaluated were mixing ratio ph salinity tmp and contaminant concentration by an orthogonal experiment it was concluded that the ph is the most influent factor for aniline retention the optimum ph was 5 and the mixing ratio was the most influent factor in the permeate flux aniline rejection from 17 to 78 and permeate flux from 205 to 298 l m 2 h 1 were attained 91 the membrane used was not described naphthenic acids nas are a family of saturated aliphatic and alicyclic acids presented in the wastewater of the petroleum industry among other contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene xylene phenols heavy metals and ions it was shown that the nas account for high than 50 of the organic fraction of this wastewater since the discharge of this effluent to the environment is limited by different regulations there are studies regarding the evaluation of methodologies to remove na from these wastewater streams 94 97 112 for a meuf process of naphthenic acids practical grade 500 mg l 1 removal a ratio of 43 2 of sds contaminant was used it was obtained retentions of 97 5 without salinity and 94 5 with salinity it was shown that the retention rate decreases with ph and salinity but increases with the surfactant concentration the permeate flux was enhanced up to 24 using an assisted electric field in the membrane module it was concluded that the meuf process is entirely governed by the solubilization of na in the micelle the ph and the electrolyte concentration 88 other works used cpc as a surfactant for na retention a ratio of 11 3 of surfactant contaminant was used to treat a solution of 300 mg l 1 of naphthenic acids practical grade napg retentions up to 99 were attained using ceramic membranes of 15 and 50 kda there was no significant difference in the retention rate by changing the membranes pore size or the tmp however the permeate flux was increased in high tmp for the 50 kda membrane the cpc retention was higher than 96 for all experiments with both membranes it was concluded that concentration polarization played a minor role in the process due to the structure of the ceramic membrane 7 it was evaluated the application of the meuf process for mixture retention containing octanoic acid 364 mg l 1 and xylene 70 mg l 1 using polyacrylonitrile pan membrane of 13 kda a ratio of 9 4 of surfactant contaminant was used retention rates of 94 2 and 99 8 for p xylene and octanoic acid were attained respectively no significant influence of the tmp on retention rate was observed it was demonstrated that the increase in cpc concentration decreases the permeate flux 9 it was used a pan membrane of 13 kda to remove na practical grade 300 mg l 1 it was used a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 11 3 it was shown that increasing the carbon number of the na decreases the cmc of the cpc increases the micelle size and increases the retention rate it was not observed a significant difference in retention rate when varying the tmp 22 the removal of naphthenic acids present in real produced water pw from two different fields was evaluated with cpc as a surfactant it was used polymeric and ceramic membranes of 13 and 50 kda respectively the cpc concentration used was constant 3 4 g l 1 in all experiments to sample a 84 mg l 1 of total organic carbon a ratio of 40 was used and retentions up to 96 and 98 were obtained with the use of polymeric and ceramic membrane respectively for sample b 66 mg l 1 of total organic carbon a ratio of 51 was used and retentions of 94 and 96 were obtained with the use of polymeric and ceramic membrane respectively it was shown that the increase in the tmp reduces the retention rate it was concluded that the ceramic membrane was more effective in removing organic contaminants mainly at high pressures due to its hydrophobic nature the ceramic membrane also presented relatively lower permeate flux than the pan membrane 64 3 5 critical analysis according to the presented data the meuf process can be used to treat different contaminants with high retention rates however as it is a relatively new technology compared to other separation techniques most of the presented data uses simple synthetic wastewater without any other component or salinity in its experiments probably due to limitations in quantifying the contaminant in the permeate stream it would be industrially appreciated if more studies were carried out using complex synthetic wastewater or real wastewater in the cited data a lack of detailed methodology was frequently observed an important and common forgotten parameter is the permeate flux the permeate flux is one of the most important parameters in membrane filtration the dimensioning of the pilot and industrial scales of the meuf process depends on the permeate flux to be determined the retention of surfactant is another critical parameter frequently omitted in the cited studies since the mass of surfactant added to the solution is always higher than the contaminant it is essential to retain the surfactant to avoid or minimize posterior treatment of the permeate stream an example is adding 20 times more surfactant than contaminant a low relation since relations up to 1000 times were viewed and if the retention of surfactant is about 95 the permeate stream would be in a concentration of surfactant equal to the initial concentration of a contaminant this is after all only a change of the contaminant as a treatment of the permeate stream would be necessary to remove the surfactant it was observed that ph and temperature play an important role in cmc and retention rate however these factors are frequently absent in the cited data as well as the tmp which does not ensure the reproducibility of these studies besides the frequent affirmation that the meuf is an economical process compared to others only a few works present an estimative of the costs concerning the used methodology there is a frequent misconception of the real cmc in the process since the cmc changes in the presence of other solutes the cmc in a medium with any contaminant is lower than the cmc of the surfactant in pure water therefore it is an erroneous approach to use the cmc in water to reference the surfactant concentration in a mixed solution containing both surfactant and contaminant as a result it is pointed in some works unexpected retention of contaminant even below the cmc in water however the presence of the contaminant probably pushed down the cmc to a value below the cmc in water in other words the surfactant after all could be above the real cmc it is a common conclusion to point to the best parameter process as the one used for the highest retention rate of contaminant however from an industrial point of view the best parameter process for meuf could be completely different mainly by using low surfactant concentration low pressures and neutral ph for economic reasons depending on the characteristics such as temperature and ph of the wastewater it is preferred ceramics membranes due to its high resistance 4 filled meuf related patent patent exploration involving meuf in a world intellectual property organization wipo patent scope platform showed few projects in the past 10 years an invention patent describes the use of the retained stream of the meuf process and the addition of a chelator into the system followed by ph adjustment stirring operation and then ultrafiltration the recovery of cd ii and surfactant sdbs were up to 65 2 and 55 1 respectively this approach is interesting since this recovery step minimizes secondary pollution 113 other invention patents cite the recuperation of cd ii using meuf process with a mixture of sds and brij 35 as surfactants the cadmium retention was close to 100 and the recuperation of surfactants was 15 44 and 82 4 for sds and brij 35 respectively 114 an invention patent of a microemulsion that easily breaks up with a simple dilution was described many potential applications are cited such as in the meuf process permiting an easy recuperation of the contaminant from the retentate stream no detailed data for the meuf process was provided apart from the dead end stirred mode filtration and the solution volume 115 an invention patent relates a concentration of hydrophobic exo signals from the rhizosphere by meuf promoting beneficial symbiotic and parasitic interactions to plants in that process a foliar application of elicitors was made in test plants cultivated in hydroponic media then after the treatment with elicitors a fraction of the hydroponic solution of 10 l was separated into the meuf process it proposes the temperature at 30 c addition of the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 407 the ph to 5 6 and then the ultrafiltration was performed in a membrane with a maximum pore size of 25 kda and a tmp of 140 to 170 kpa the radicular retentate was concentrated to 5 ml by a vacuum rotary evaporator 116 the same methodology was cited for the recovery of bio active hydrophobic components from radicular exudates by meuf 117 it was described as an invention patent to obtain high purity alliin using a meuf process it was used an imidazolium gemini as a cationic surfactant in a mixed system with sodium deoxycholate as anionic surfactant in a molar ratio of 1 4 it was cited the use of ph 11 and a 0 2 μm membrane pore size of pvdf the tmp was evaluated from 170 to 500 kpa the retentate solution was acidified 50 70 of ethanol was added evaporated crystallized and dried to obtain a high purity alliin it was expected a recovery rate of alliin from 88 to 99 118 5 challenges and future approaches to meuf meuf technique still has some challenges to overcome such as the flux decrease during the process caused by concentration polarization and the surfactant recuperation also the pollution after all is only transferred from one solution to another which means from the original polluted stream for a more concentrated one the retentate stream 97 chemical surfactants commonly present high critical micelle concentrations which is considered a disadvantage 91 alternatively the biosurfactants have low toxicity high biodegradability and their properties barely change with temperature and salinity 89 some promising studies researched high pollutant retention using biosurfactant as saponin 23 35 rhamnolipid 73 89 119 a mixture of rhamnolipids and sophorolipids 120 and a conjugated linoleic acid 72 a vast gap in literature could be supplied if new meuf studies use biosurfactants with low cmc besides that there are a few additional processes described in the literature that recuperate the contaminant or and the surfactant from the retentate or permeate streams such as acidification ultrafiltration liquid liquid extraction alkalinization refrigeration below the kraft temperature or the foam fractioning process an efficient process to recover the surfactant from the retentate stream may turn the meuf into a most economically attractive process 21 35 57 65 66 the use of a surfactant in which the micelles are easily cross linked using uv light was proposed to overcome the issue of loss of surfactant to the permeate stream 71 as the concentration polarization decreases the permeate flux there are alternatives to contour this problem such as the use of an electrical field that enhances the permeate flux 88 92 or even using regular backwashing 61 technologies that increase the permeate flux or minimize the loss of the membrane permeability during the process are little described for meuf process the cost of the meuf process is as well underexplored presenting the total cost of meuf is the first step to scale up the process however only a couple of works provide an estimative of the meuf costs for the treatment of 3 l of wastewater the cost of the meuf process was about us 0 15 while reusing the surfactant by acidification ultrafiltration technique was about us 0 71 65 a simulation of a plant to treat 60 000 m3 d 1 of seawater using both meuf and ro was estimated to cost about us 0 91 per cubic meter 110 while studies using synthetic wastewater are more frequent without any salinity some promising researches use real wastewater effluent as seen for organic acids retention 57 64 phenol retention 93 heavy metals retention 67 organic halogens retention 61 sulfonamide antibiotics 111 and soft drink wastewater treatment 121 the complexity of real wastewater turns the meuf into a more challenging process however only few studies use a pilot scale process which permits a more realistic evaluation of the meuf such as phosphorous retention from a fertilizer industry 68 boron retention 110 and cobalt retention 66 it is well known that the meuf process works on a laboratory scale however to attain another level the study of real wastewater using a pilot scale meuf process is the next important step to completely understand the technique behavior 6 conclusions meuf process is able to attain high retention rates in a diversity of contaminant streams containing ions dyes and organics as a variety of operating conditions can be applied to optimize the retention rate the membrane pore size type and surface hydrophobicity can influence the operation as well as the surfactant charge its cmc and its concentration in solution temperature transmembrane pressure ph and ionic strength also affect the process efficiency the ratio of surfactant to contaminant may vary significantly from one study to another from 1 to almost 1000 potentially resulting in a permeate with high surfactant concentration the majority of reported studies in the literature were operated with synthetic wastewater which is easily quantifiable furthermore important process parameters are commonly missing such as the ph the temperature the permeate flux the retention of surfactant and the transmembrane pressure the concept of cmc is usually mistaken in some results presented in the literature as there are different approaches for the meuf process still there is no standard methodology to present the data or system of units adopted this review outlined the data of higher retention rate however for a large scale process to be executed it is necessary to evaluate other parameters such as permeate flux and implementation and maintenance costs the major problem of meuf process as mentioned before is the concentration polarization which causes a decrease in the permeate flux reducing the efficiency and increasing operational costs furthermore since water and wastewater streams may have a wider variety of contaminants and different properties than a controlled laboratory experiment large scale meuf needs to overcome these conditions and the costs involved besides there is a rising demand for

13107,micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf is a surfactant based method used to remove low concentrations of contaminants from water and wastewater streams the process consists of adding surfactant above the critical micelle concentration cmc in the contaminated water to solubilize the contaminant in micelles or to retain ionic contaminants via electro static interaction with ionic micelles the micelles size should be enough to be retained in a membrane with larger pore size than the one needed for the retention of the contaminant only this approach allows the increase of the permeate flux the parameters that influence meuf such as surfactant types membranes transmembrane pressure ph temperature and ionic strength are summarized in this work the literature review is focused on the different uses of meuf in function of the compound to be removed and a comparison of the different methodologies was elaborated the recent patents linked to meuf are also presented a critical analysis of the reviewed data indicated the most frequent gaps in meuf studies such as the lack of information regarding important parameters including ph temperature and permeate flux it was also observed that inaccurate conclusions are commonly associated with imprecise measurements of cmc the main challenge for future industrial scale applications of meuf is to develop studies from the present simple synthetic wastewater in laboratory scale to industrial wastewater on a meuf pilot scale however this review article shows the versatility of meuf as a promising method to remove different types of contaminants from water and wastewater streams and the future challenges to overcome keywords membrane based separation technique surfactant micelles membranes water pollutants nomenclature c b

pollutant to be removed the processes are classified as primary which removes total suspended solids and free oils secondary which partially removes dissolved solids and tertiary which removes dispersed oils and residual dissolved contaminants 1 2 membrane based processes such as reverse osmosis are a tertiary treatment process widely used to filter inorganic particles as well as to remove microorganisms and organic matter however it is a highly energy intensive process since the operating pressure is very high and the permeability is very low 3 4 over the last years micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf was proposed as an alternative separation process which requires mild operating conditions 5 this process consists of the surfactant addition to the contaminated solution to form micelles which aggregates above the critical micelle concentration of surfactant and can solubilize organic and inorganic contaminants the micelles formed with the contaminants are larger than the contaminant itself which enables the water treatment using an ultrafiltration membrane instead of a nanofiltration one 6 using this strategy membranes with larger pore sizes are still able to significantly retain pollutants from the water and can also allow higher permeate fluxes which is an economic advantage over nanofiltration membranes and reverse osmosis 7 8 meuf limitations are frequently associated with pore obstruction which leads to permeate flux reduction and permeation of surfactant monomers 9 meuf process is widely used to remove several dissolved pollutants such as organic and inorganic compounds in general mainly dyes and metal ions from aqueous solutions 10 11 the role of surfactant in pressure driven membranes techniques was already evaluated in the retention of different pollutants including arsenic methylene blue zinc manganese nickel boron cobalt caffeine and diclofenac 12 existing literature overviews discussed metal retention including cadmium nickel copper zinc chromium and lead 13 and the retention of various dyes like mordant black 17 mordant black 11 and methylene blue 14 however the literature lacks explicit information regarding permeate flux salinity ph surfactant and contaminant concentrations this review intends to be a powerful tool with complete information about meuf process application to treat wastewaters containing diverse organic and inorganic compounds it encompasses the most recent studies on removing ions dyes naphthenic acids and other recalcitrant compounds using meuf including the main operational conditions to allow an effective comparison among different studies furthermore to illustrate the industrial applications of this technique a short description of patents is also presented 2 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process the pressure driven membrane processes are usually classified as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro according to the membrane pore size from the largest to the smallest 12 15 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are very simple and prominent processes commonly used to treat water however they are usually expensive due to the energy demanded by higher pressures 16 18 among the separation processes using membranes the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration is a promising and effective technology for removing low concentrations of contaminants 17 19 meuf technique combines advantages from both uf and nf higher permeate flux from uf and higher selectivity from nf 5 16 the meuf process is based on the addition of surfactant into the stream to be filtered to form tridimensional micelles shapes that solubilize the pollutant inside its structure due to the hydrophobicity of the micelle internal core or to the ionic surface charge of the micelle in case of ionic pollutants 4 20 21 thus the micelle size is about 4 to 11 nm depending on the surfactant contaminant interaction which is large enough to be retained by an ultrafiltration membrane pore size 22 24 however a small portion of surfactant monomers may pass through the membrane along with the permeate flux 5 14 25 26 the surfactant is added in a concentration higher than the critical micellar concentration cmc to form large amphiphilic micelles as seen in fig 1 5 14 25 meuf process advantages include low energy costs high permeate flux and satisfactory retention efficiency compared to the traditional membrane filtrations 4 27 28 the early use of surfactants to enhance ultrafiltration was first reported in 1979 by park a leung s for the removal of phenol using dicocodimethylammonium chloride surfactant 30 later in the 80s other important contributions were made using cetylpyridinium chloride cpc as surfactant in the removal of 4 tert butylphenol 25 o m and p cresol 31 n hexanol n heptanol and n octanol 32 and chromate ions 33 by meuf there are two critical parameters for filtration processes the rejection factor and the permeate flux the rejection factor r which is the fraction of contaminant in the feed stream that permeates the membrane it is calculated from the relation of pollutant concentration in the permeate stream to the pollutant concentration in the feed according to eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p and cf are the concentration of contaminants in the permeate and in the feed solution respectively higher values of r are related to more efficient filtration process 34 the permeate flux is the volume of fluid that permeates the membrane area at a certain time and it is calculated according to eq 2 2 j v t a where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume l t is the processing time h and a is the membrane operational surface area m2 high values of j mean large amount of fluid permeated through the membrane in certain process time some studies showed permeate flux in meuf process varying as low as 2 l m 2 h 1 to over 300 l m 2 h 1 the permeate flux depends exclusively on each configuration process 11 34 35 the process performance depends on several parameters including ph transmembrane pressure tmp concentration and characteristics of surfactants surfactant to pollutant ratio temperature flow rate operating time and membrane type 29 36 the mechanical filtration is the most prominent phenomenon in meuf process however other phenomena such as adsorption when metals ions are adsorbed in the micelle surface solubilization when organics compounds are entrapped inside the micelle and micellization when the surfactants monomers self assembly above their cmc may also occur 28 37 38 meuf performance depends on a complex combination of ions and surfactant structures in the bulk solution the solution ph the surfactant and pollutant molar ratio the transmembrane pressure stirring the permeate flux the pore size and the membrane material are also common parameters that influence the process as shown in fig 2 39 2 1 surfactant surfactants are amphiphilic structures composed of a hydrophobic chain and a hydrophilic head 14 the cmc is an important parameter that refers to the minimum concentration of a surfactant necessary to start the formation of the micelles these micelles are defined as clusters of surfactant monomers and as they begin to form the surface tension of the solution is reduced to a certain extent 40 42 the micelles are tridimensional structures combined by van der waals forces hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions 43 45 the cmc is sensible to parameters such as temperature ph solvent type and the presence of other compounds the addition of electrolyte can facilitate the micelle formation by decreasing the cmc and increasing the aggregation number which is the number of monomers that compose a micelle 46 the physicochemical properties of a solution containing surfactants change according to the concentration of surfactant in the solution the cmc is measured when properties such as electrical conductivity and surface tension change abruptly in response to the addition of small quantities of surfactant in the solution 47 48 the surfactant selection mostly depends on the type of solute to be removed if the compound to be removed is an ion an ionic surfactant with opposite charge is generally chosen as in the case of using the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in the removal of metallic cations cd2 zn2 pb2 and cu2 36 or the retention of f no3 and po4 3 anions using cetylpyridinium chloride cpc or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab as a surfactant 28 49 for the retention of non charged hydrophobic solutes a nonionic surfactant is more appropriate summarizing the nature of the surfactant used in meuf defines the solutes that can be removed 14 43 50 some surfactants frequently used in meuf and their main characteristics are presented in table 1 the influence of surfactant concentration in the retention rate of meuf process was evaluated in some studies it was viewed that the sds concentration varying from 10 to 200 mmol l 1 did not influence the retention of citric and lactic acids 57 on the other hand it was observed that the increase in surfactant concentration influenced the retention and the permeate flux in a meuf process of emerging contaminants using cpc as a surfactant the retention was enhanced due to an increase in the aggregation number and the micelle size which augmented the interaction sites between the contaminants and the cpc micelle it resulted in more contaminants molecules solubilized in micelles increasing the retention however the permeate flux decreased with the increase of cpc concentration due to an intensification in the concentration polarization caused by an accumulation of surfactant monomers on the membrane surface 4 the retention of fluoride using cpc and octadecylamine oda was enhanced with an increase of the surfactants due to more formation of micelles consequentially more ions were attracted to the micelles 28 similar behavior was observed in the retention of methylene blue mb using sds as a surfactant 17 and in the retention of reactive blue 19 using ethyl hexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide ehab and ctab as a surfactants 56 2 1 1 mixed surfactant systems in a solution containing anionic surfactant the addition of a nonionic surfactant decreases the hydrophilic head charge of the anionic surfactant monomer which decreases the electrostatic repulsions furthermore the use of a mixed surfactant system decreases cmc which increases the micelle formation for the same surfactant concentration in some cases the retention rate of contaminant and recovery of surfactants increases considerably with the use of mixed surfactants 21 58 61 a mix of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether pne was used for the organic halogens ox retention in this case when the anionic surfactant concentration was above its cmc and in the presence of nonionic surfactant the retention rate was up to 80 the removal of anionic surfactants was 90 no isolate experiments were made with a single surfactant 61 using sds anionic and triton x 100 nonionic as a surfactant mixture for cadmium retention it was shown that the retention rate of cadmium decreases with the increase of the molar ratio of triton x 100 to sds however the residual surfactant rate was lower in the mixed sds triton x 100 studied system than the one in sds only system furthermore the residual surfactant in the permeate stream decreases with an increase of surfactant 21 on the other hand it was shown that the retention rate of nickel and aniline increases with the addition of the nonionic surfactant brij35 in the sds system it was reached maximum simultaneous retention of 64 and 95 for the aniline and nickel respectively nevertheless it was revealed that the permeate flux decreases with the increase in brij35 concentration 58 for glucose rejection however it was viewed that the highest retention was attained using the single cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab with a rejection of 64 in comparison of ctab triton x 100 mixture with a rejection factor of 48 and the aliquat 336 cationic triton x 100 mixture with a rejection of 56 62 2 1 2 micelle size enlargement as the contaminants particles are solubilized into surfactant micelles the size of micelles becomes larger to a colloidal size 56 63 using the dynamic light scattering dls technique it is possible to measure the size distribution of the micelle in water and in a solution containing the contaminant it was viewed that the cpc micelle size increased from 0 9 nm to 5 nm when the p xylene was solubilized inside the micelle 9 in fact the cpc micelle size usually increases from 1 nm to 3 to 10 nm depending on the target solubilized organic acid long chain organic acids lead to the formation of larger micelles 22 even in the presence of real wastewater the cpc micelle size was reported to be increased 64 using saponin as a surfactant which has a micelle size already large 386 nm the solubilization of methyl violet as a contaminant increased the micelle size up to 540 nm 35 2 1 3 surfactant recovery the retentate stream of meuf process contains a high concentration of surfactant and contaminant since the surfactant can cost a large portion of the process its recovery is economically appreciated furthermore surfactant recovery can reduce secondary pollution to the environment 65 there are few methodologies used to recover surfactant or the contaminant from the retentate stream of the meuf process such as acidification followed by ultrafiltration extraction with n butanol phase separation below the krafft temperature or foam fractioning the acidification followed by ultrafiltration was used to separate cobalt from the retained stream after acidification to ph 1 cobalt particles easily crossed the membrane by replacing the micelle bound to an h ion the cobalt recovery efficiency was 96 the recovery of sds increases with the increase of ph but the metal retention decreases it was estimated that a surfactant recovery of 65 could be attained at ph 3 66 for cadmium retention the acidification ultrafiltration process showed that sds could be recovered and reused only if the recovered sds concentration is above the cmc this recuperation process of acidification ultrafiltration is expensive compared to the use of novel sds reagent but it reduces secondary pollution 65 the use of n butanol was evaluated as a solvent for saponin recovery in an extraction process it was found that 85 of saponin was recovered with a ratio of 1 1 v v of solvent to surfactant solution of 350 mg l 1 35 in a meuf process with beet molasses the treatment of the retentate stream with naoh at ph of 12 56 and refrigeration at 4 5 c below the krafft temperature the temperature that the cmc is equal to the surfactant solubility resulted in formation of supernatant and precipitate phases the sds recovery in the precipitate fraction was above 95 while its concentration in the permeate stream was below 5 57 the leakage of surfactant in the permeate stream is called secondary pollution in some researches it was viewed that the secondary pollution was negligible 67 68 the addition of salts could reduce this leakage 69 the concentration polarization layer could improve the retention of surfactant and pollutant minimizing the secondary pollution 70 the use of cross linked surfactants was also described as reducing secondary pollution 71 72 to avoid secondary pollution biosurfactants could be used 35 73 however when the secondary pollution has already happened the foam fractionation process is commonly used to treat it in this process the surface active compounds are adsorbed to gas bubbles that rise to the top of the liquid surface forming the foam the less surface active compounds remain in the interstitial liquid phase as seen for sds and cadmium recovery 10 21 74 2 2 membranes membranes are a barrier to the solutes while permitting the solvent to pass through 70 membranes are usually synthesized using ceramic or polymer materials thus a compatibility study with the solution to be filtered is a fundamental step for the membrane selection 14 75 ceramic membranes can endure flows with higher temperatures or more extreme ph compared to the polymeric ones 3 when pores much smaller than the contaminants are used a satisfactory efficiency is obtained however membrane fouling is also favored to prevent fouling it is necessary to select the membrane surface charge considering its capacity to facilitate the permeation of suitable molecules 75 other important parameters when choosing membranes are the porosity and hydrophobicity which are selected according to the characteristics of the solution to be filtered furthermore the ultrafiltration membranes are classified by their molecular weight of cut off mwco measured in kilodaltons kda the mwco value indicates the molecular mass of solute that is 90 to 99 rejected by the membrane the exact efficiency depends on the manufacturer 14 76 the accumulation of solute near the membrane surface causes an increase in concentration by convective and diffusive forces this phenomenon is called concentration polarization as shown in fig 3 where the contaminant concentration increases from the homogeneous solution to the gel layer this phenomenon is one of the main causes of flux decline during the separation process 28 76 as a result the layer reduces the permeate flow and creates a concentration profile on the membrane surface therefore mass diffusion occurs from the concentration polarization layer to the bulk and convective transport also occurs across the membrane tending to an equilibrium that can be described by eq 3 the concentration polarization is the major limiting phenomenon to the filtration performance since it increases the filtration resistance near the membrane surface 39 76 77 3 j ss d m δ ln c g c b where j ss is the flow rate of the solution in the steady state m s 1 d m is the effective mass diffusivity of the solute m2 s 1 δ is the thickness of the concentration polarization layer m and c g and c b are the contaminant concentrations in the gel layer and the bulk mg m 3 respectively as an example in the studies conducted by shi et al 70 the concentration polarization layer was able to count up to 50 of the total resistance in the cadmium retention in a system using sds as a surfactant it was evaluated that sds concentration near the membrane was 13 mm while the bulk concentration was 0 8 mm the concentration polarization phenomenon is the main cause of membrane fouling and is mainly caused by the deposition of surfactant micelles on the membrane surface and the adsorption of surfactant in the membrane interior 78 the fouling type is commonly determined by hernia blocking model by four different physical concepts standard pore blocking complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation as shown in table 2 79 in a meuf system using different gemini surfactants to remove phenol it was viewed that different blocking models are able to influence the membrane fouling however the cake formation was the main form of membrane fouling 80 evaluating sdbs ctab and tween 80 as surfactant it was observed that the fouling mechanism is different depending on the concentration of cobalt used in experiments due to cmc changes and electrical charges of micelles and membranes for cobalt concentrations between 0 and 1 mg l 1 it was observed standard and intermediate pore blocking while for co 5 mg l 1 the main mechanism was the cake formation 81 in another study both cake formation model and standard pore blocking were the main cause of membrane fouling for cobalt retention using sds as a surfactant it was concluded that the rejection of cobalt for low concentration of sds was due to the fouling layer formed by deposition of sds on the membrane surface 19 using esterquat as a surfactant for the recovery of polyphenols and polysaccharides it was found that the complete pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism 82 2 3 operational characteristics the filtration processes are generally divided into two modes of operation dead end filtration in which the feed flux is perpendicular to the membrane and crossflow filtration in which the feed stream flows tangentially to the membrane surface in the dead end mode the flow quickly decreases over time due to the severe obstruction of the membrane pores to prevent this clogging a stirred system is typically adopted 26 27 the crossflow mode is performed combined with a recycling system to avoid complete obstruction of the membrane and to assure continuous flow which makes this type of system widely applied in industries 4 66 83 the crossflow operation mode is commonly used when the solution presents a high concentration of suspended solids while dead end operation mode is recommended for laboratory studies in fig 4 it is possible to observe that the concentration polarization layer is reduced in crossflow filtration when compared to the dead end mode besides the permeate flux in dead end filtration decreases up to zero with the increase of polarization layer resistance meanwhile in crossflow filtration the feed flow over the membrane surface minimizes the polarization layer due to the rinsing effect 1 76 2 3 1 transmembrane pressure transmembrane pressure is a fundamental parameter in membrane filtration since it is the most common driving force used in mf uf and nf processes it refers to the pressure difference between the retained and the permeate phases that push the passage of the solution through the membrane surface as seen in eq 4 in other words it is a pressure drop between the membrane external and internal surfaces this parameter is necessary to model the membrane hydrodynamic resistance or the fouling resistance another fundamental variable in membrane filtration 84 86 4 tmp p in p r 2 p p where p in is the pressure in the membrane inlet pa p r is the pressure of the retentate stream pa and p p is the pressure of the permeate stream pa 68 in eq 5 the tmp is a variable for calculating the membrane resistance and fouling resistance 5 j tmp μ r m r f where j is the permeate flux m3 m 2 s 1 tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of solution pa s r m is the membrane hydrodynamic resistance m 1 and r f is the fouling resistance m 1 38 despite the importance of this parameter it was reported that tmp presented no influence in the retention of some contaminants and in the presence of some surfactants such as emerging contaminants and the surfactant cpc 4 the safranin t 87 the yttrium and zinc 83 the naphthenic acids in the presence of sds as a surfactant 88 and the methyl violet with saponin and without surfactant 35 nevertheless it is known that tmp influences the permeate flux 15 87 89 differently it was described that an increase of the tmp could enlarge the gel layer and consequently increase the retention of cadmium using sds as a surfactant 70 and in the chloride retention using ctab as a surfactant 5 nonetheless an increase in tmp led to a reduction in the retention of the dye black mordant 17 in the presence of different cationic surfactants 90 the increase in tmp decreased the aniline retention 91 and the methyl violet retention using sds as a surfactant 17 2 3 2 crossflow velocity for a fixed pressure drop in a meuf systems the permeate flux generally increases when the crossflow rate is also increased until certain limit this behavior was observed in the retention of copper and cadmium using sds as surfactant 68 and for cadmium only retention 70 the increase in the permeate flux was also viewed during naphthenic acids recovery using sds as surfactant this increase was due to higher shear induced by higher crossflow rates however the retention of surfactant and pollutant was little influenced by the crossflow rate 88 similar results were obtained in methylene blue retention using sds as a surfactant the crossflow velocity positively influenced the permeate flux but slightly influenced the retention rate 92 2 3 3 ph the ph can play an important role in ultrafiltration mainly when solutes are able to change their charge in solution the ph of the solution should be evaluated along with the charge of the surfactant since there is a competition between the ions of the solution and the contaminant molecules for micelle formation 23 35 87 besides the ph can interfere in the filtration flux since it can modify the physical properties of the solution such as viscosity 14 82 the ph can also change the membrane hydrophobicity allowing higher or lower permeate flux across the membrane 90 samal et al 35 reported that in the retention of methyl violet using saponin as a surfactant the ph did not influence the dye retention however it was also reported that the alkaline medium reduced the permeate flux by the precipitation of dye in the membrane surface increasing the gel layer on the other hand in arsenic retention using cpc as a surfactant the retention of contaminant decreases in acidic ph 27 the same behavior was observed in the retention of the dye black mordant 17 with the surfactants c12tab c14tab c16tab or c18tab where the permeate flux was lower in acidic ph 90 in retention of metals such as lead cadmium zinc or copper using sds as a surfactant the retention varies from 0 to 97 99 depending on the ph the optimum retention ph for lead was between 2 and 10 to cadmium was above 3 to zinc was 3 8 and 10 to copper was above 3 36 it was shown that high ph values decrease the retention due to deprotonation of polyphenols and a consequent decrease in interactions with the surfactant 15 93 it was reported that acid ph increases the retention of aniline due to the positively charged formed which is attracted to the anionic sites of surfactant 91 and increases the retention rate of chloride using ctab as a surfactant 5 2 3 4 temperature temperature control is essential in meuf processes since water or wastewater streams may be either freezing or up to 80 c depending on the processes or seasonality higher temperatures can turn the hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions weaker compromising the micelle formation 75 94 on the other hand it was reported that the permeate flux increases with an augmentation in temperature due to a reduction of the gel layer suggesting a positive effect on meuf process 8 57 89 95 the temperature plays an important role specifically when using polymeric membranes which may be affected by temperatures above 50 c 96 97 likewise the size and shape of the micelles depend on temperature and ionic strength these parameters can collaborate to increase or decrease the micellization process 5 69 consequently affect the cmc value 44 45 61 98 2 3 5 contaminant concentration in the feed solution meuf studies are generally focused on the variation of surfactant concentration along with the experiments however few authors also explored the initial concentration of contaminants in the feed solutions for the removal of methyl violet by meuf feed concentrations of 200 and 250 mg l 1 were used combined with saponin as surfactant csurf 2 3 5 and 10 g l 1 removals higher than 99 were achieved for both contaminant initial concentrations suggesting a strong interaction between methyl violet and saponin to form micelles 35 however it is important to point out that the contaminant concentration was much lower 200 250 mg l 1 than the surfactant concentration 2 10 g l 1 a similar variation of contaminant concentration was studied by huang et al 19 the removal of cadmium was evaluated with feed concentrations of 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 the study assessed a cd ii removal of 90 using 4 mmol l 1 of sds as a surfactant the contaminant retention decreased with an increase in its initial concentration in the feed solution this result indicates a screening of membrane charge at high cd ii concentrations in order to assess the effect of dye concentration on the membrane separation process parakala moulik and sridhar 17 evaluated the removal of methylene blue using a feed concentration from 5 to 40 mg l 1 and fixed sds concentration of 32 8 mmol l 1 equivalent to 4 cmc in water a decrease in the permeate flux from 69 8 to 52 9 l m 2 h 1 was observed and decreased dye rejection from 99 8 to 95 4 the flux drop was probably affected due to the accumulation of micelles on the membrane surface which increased resistance to flux because sds concentration was fixed for all experiments likely micelle formation was also constant thus dye molecules that were not trapped into micelles could directly permeate membrane pores decreasing dye rejection meuf performance was also examined using different initial concentrations of sulfate combined with a blend of surfactant polymer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab poly diallydimethylammonium chloride pdadmac 99 the range of sulfate concentration varied from 1 to 20 mmol l 1 as a result the authors observed that the quantity of surfactant micelles or polymer ligands in the feed solutions affected sulfate retention with the use of fixed feed concentration of ctab pdadmac sulfate retention decreased with the increase in feed sulfate concentration this result suggests that at low initial sulfate concentrations the available binding sites provided by surfactant micelles or polymer ligands are most favorable exchange takes place between so4 2 and br in case of ctab and between so4 2 and cl in case of 4 pdadmac in the neighborhood of the polar heads as the permeation occurs it gradually saturates the adsorbent a series of n alkyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactants cntab were assessed by zaghbani hafiane and dhahbi 90 to study the effect of alkyl chain length on the efficiency of meuf process thus different surfactants c12tab c14tab c16tab and c18tab at three feed concentrations of eriochrome blue black r ebbr 0 1 0 5 and 1 mmol l 1 were studied the authors observed that the ebbr retention by c12 and c14 surfactants depended on the dye concentration for c12 the removals for 0 1 0 5 and 1 mmol l 1 were 34 6 42 7 and 51 4 respectively for c14 the removals were 51 1 54 3 and 97 9 respectively this result suggests that the saturation of solubilization was achieved for these surfactants however for c16 and c18 dye removal was kept higher than 99 for all ebbr concentrations tested 2 4 addition of salts sodium chloride played an important role in solution with surfactants since the electrolyte decreases the repulsion forces between the charges of the surfactant monomers facilitating the stabilization of micelles and consequently decreasing the cmc 61 87 the addition of different salts in concentrations up to 1 mol l 1 did not change the retention rate of black mordant 17 in meuf process however the salt presence decreased the permeate flow by increasing the micelle formation which increases the concentration polarization near the membrane surface 90 in methyl violet retention using saponin as a surfactant the addition of nacl up to 50 g l 1 increased the micelle size and decreased the cmc 35 the retention of methyl violet using sds as a surfactant was increased with the addition of 20 g l 1 of nacl 17 in the arsenic retention using cpc as a surfactant the metal retention decreased when a concentration up to 50 mmol l 1 of nacl was added to the solution 27 similarly in the retention of naphthenic acids using sds as a surfactant the addition of 0 01 to 0 1 mol l 1 of nacl decreased the retention from 98 to 95 and the permeate flow decreased about 10 88 the addition of nacl up to 2 g l 1 in enrofloxacin retention using cpb as a surfactant led to a decrease in the contaminant retention and in the permeate flux this was caused by the competition of the ion cl to solubilization into the micelle core the decrease in permeate flux was due to a decrease in the membrane permeability caused by an increase in electrostatic repulsion among the micelles 16 on the other hand the addition of 17 54 g l 1 of nacl in methylene blue retention using sds as a surfactant allowed an increase in the contaminant retention from 62 to 97 69 the presence of salts in the solution could be a limiting factor due to the competition of pollutant anions and the salt anions to the micelle surface charge as the micelles are considered nano scale ion exchangers the basic theory about ion exchangers is applied to predict the affinity distribution of these anions in waters containing a mixture of different anions and a surfactant 27 this theory was applied to evaluate common water anions in a cationic surfactant as cpc and ctab the affinity of anions to micelles was found to decrease as fe cn 6 3 cro4 2 so4 2 haso4 2 hpo4 2 no3 br no2 cl hco3 h2aso4 h2po4 f io3 the anions in the aqueous solution with greater affinity with the micelle will replace the original ion of the surfactant monomer and once it is associated these anions ionic bonded to the micelle surface will be rejected by ultrafiltration 71 100 102 2 5 evaluation of meuf process the meuf process depends on the interactions of the micelles and solutes to increase its performance then the separation efficiency of meuf is commonly evaluated by calculating physical parameters such as micelle loading binding constant and distribution coefficient 14 51 63 2 5 1 loading capacity the loading capacity is a proportion of pollutant solubilized in the micelles to the concentration of surfactant that formed the micelles and it is calculated according eq 6 51 103 6 l m p r p p s r cmc where l m is the loading capacity mmol l mmol 1 l 1 p is the pollutant concentration and s is the concentration of surfactant which contributes to surfactant pseudophase the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams and the cmc represents the critical micelle concentration of surfactant 104 2 5 2 binding constant the binding constant is one parameter commonly used to evaluate the affinity of organic compounds for the micelles and consequently the prediction of the feasibility of removing a solute by meuf 55 104 during the meuf process the binding constant decreases as the surfactant concentration increases in the retentate stream 55 63 it is calculated according to eqs 7 8 9 and 10 7 k p p m p w s 8 p m p r p p 9 p w p p 10 s s r cmc where k p is the binding constant l mmol 1 m and w subscripts represent the micellar and aqueous pseudophases respectively p is the pollutant concentration and s is the concentration of surfactant which contributes to surfactant pseudophase the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams and the cmc represents the critical micelle concentration of surfactant 2 5 3 distribution coefficient when a solute is introduced into two phase system it will be distributed in the two phases when the equilibrium is reached the distribution of this solute is defined as distribution coefficient and it is calculated by the concentration ratio of this solute in one phase to the other in the equilibrium condition in meuf system the distribution coefficient is the ratio of the solute present in the retentate to the solute in the permeate stream as shown in eq 11 55 63 11 d p r p p where d is the distribution coefficient p is the pollutant concentration and the r and p subscripts represent the retentate and permeate streams an increase in the distribution coefficient indicates that more surfactant molecules exist in the micellar phase binding more pollutant as consequence 51 3 water and wastewater treatment by meuf extended research of the meuf process for different and relevant contributions in the last 12 years were made the results were categorized into four subtopics depending on the contaminant type anions cations dyes and organic compounds besides the small amount of meuf studies in this period different contaminants surfactants and membranes were evaluated among them a small portion of these studies was made with real wastewater additionally the process parameters of meuf studies are not always shown important information such as the permeate flux the temperature and even the ph are occasionally missing the contaminant retention rates shown in this research were always the high value reported by the authors 3 1 removal of anions by meuf a complex mixture of anions is present in water and wastewater streams including nitrate phosphate arsenate and chromate these anions competing for the micelle charge reducing the removal efficiency of target anions 100 dissolved anions are commonly present in produced water as chloride sulfate carbonate and bicarbonate which affects the conductivity and the scale forming potential 105 anions pollutants may also be present in groundwater due to agricultural activities 106 in table 3 it is presented a compilation meuf works for anion retention fluoride removal 10 mg l 1 was evaluated using membranes of polyether sulfone pes and regenerated cellulose rc of 4 and 5 kda respectively and cpc or octadecylamine oda as surfactants the highest retention obtained was 90 when using pes membrane combined with cpc in a ratio of 92 surfactant contaminant it was shown that retention increases with an increase in surfactant concentration an increase in the fluoride concentration decreases the retention rate it was concluded that the surfactant gel layer formed at the surface of the membrane enhances retention efficiency it was verified that the addition of sodium chloride significantly reduces the cmc of the surfactants and the retention efficiency due to the competition of ions 28 membrane pore size plays an important role in retention efficiency and at the permeate flux of the process the retention of tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah 2 88 g l 1 was evaluated in two different membranes 1 kda and 210 kda resulting in a flux of 35 and 90 l m 2 h 1 and a retention of 99 and 80 respectively for a ratio of surfactant to the contaminant of 1 44 the resistance to mass transfer was calculated and it was shown that the total resistance of the 210 kda membrane was unexpectedly higher than the one for 1 kda membrane 107 it was used sds concentrations above and below the cmc however the referenced cmc was calculated in pure water then as seen before the presence of tmah in solution may decrease the cmc allowing the formation of the micelles even in lower surfactant concentrations than expected it was studied sulfate retention 0 96 g l 1 using ctab as a surfactant and a 10 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose in a surfactant contaminant ratio of 38 it was viewed that the permeate flux decreases with the increase of the surfactant concentration from about 80 l m 2 h 1 using 3 64 g l 1 of ctab to 20 l m 2 h 1 using 36 4 g l 1 of ctab high retention rates were attained when the initial sulfate concentration was lower than 0 96 g l 1 99 using a surfactant contaminant ratio of 0 56 a hypochlorite retention rate of 75 was shown for an initial contaminant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 the ctab was used as a surfactant it was used a self made polyethersulfone titania membrane high retentions were attained in ph 2 to 4 and high tmp the permeate flux decreases when the ionic strength increases it was concluded that the concentration polarization phenomenon was more effective than the micelle formation 5 the retention of phosphate 15 mg l 1 using cpc and oda as a surfactant was evaluated in three pes membranes of 4 30 and 50 kda the surfactant contaminant ratio used varied from 39 to 128 higher retention rates were attained using the oda as a surfactant about 99 than the cpc 80 when using the cpc as a surfactant it was shown that the membrane pore size negatively influences the retention of phosphate and the cpc concentration positively influences the retention when using oda as a surfactant no significant change in retention rate was observed for the different membranes surfactant concentrations and tmp 108 another study evaluated the retention of phosphate nitrate and the mixture of both ions using ctab as a surfactant in regenerated cellulose membranes of 5 10 and 30 kda the highest retention rates were attained using the 10 kda membrane for phosphate only meuf initial concentration of 15 mg l 1 the highest retention rate attained was about 54 using a tmp of 200 kpa and a surfactant contaminant ratio of 66 for nitrate only meuf initial concentration of 28 mg l 1 the highest retention rate of 91 was reached using a tmp of 150 kpa and a surfactant contaminant ratio of 24 the simultaneous retention rate of phosphate and nitrate was less favorable than the retention of one component system reaching 34 and 84 for phosphate and nitrate respectively it was concluded that the 30 kda membrane was most vulnerable to fouling increasing the surfactant concentration significantly enhanced phosphate retention but not nitrate 49 the retention of nitrate phosphate and sulfate was evaluated from real river water using cpc 10 mmol l 1 as a surfactant in a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 46 as the evaluated water was a mixture of different salts the meuf process was still able to retain 84 of nitrate 91 of phosphate and 97 of sulfate using the binary ion exchange thermodynamic model it was calculated the selectivity of common anions of water to the surfactant micelle that was cro4 2 so4 2 hpo4 2 no3 br no2 cl hco3 h2po4 f the results showed that despite a large amount of sulfate concentration in the water it did not affect nitrate and phosphate removal 102 the meuf process was tested for a mixture containing nitrate 0 1 g l 1 and arsenate 0 001 g l 1 using a self made polyacrylonitrile membrane and cpc 1 7 g l 1 as a surfactant the retention rate was increased and the permeate flux decreased by increasing the surfactant concentration the presence of nitrate in the solution doesn t inhibit the binding of arsenate to the micelles however the retention of arsenate decreased 3 4 the presence of arsenate decreased the retention of nitrate as the arsenate bound to cpc micelles preferentially to nitrate 20 arsenate 7 5 g l 1 was successfully removed 97 of retention using cpc as a surfactant with a ratio of 277 surfactant contaminant a decrease in retention was observed when lowering the ph from 8 2 to 5 0 due to the formation of monovalent arsenate which poorly interacts with the micelle adding up to 50 mm of nacl in the solution also reduced the retention rate due to competition of the anions to the cationic sites of the surfactant it was suggested that arsenate retention would be limited in waters with a high concentration of anions 27 3 2 removal of cations by meuf dissolved cations are commonly present in produced water as sodium potassium calcium barium magnesium iron and strontium which also affect the conductivity and the scale forming potential 105 treating large volumes of aqueous streams contaminated with metals by conventional methods does not always combine low cost high selectivity and recycling capacity 29 the meuf process may be used to remove low metal concentrations of these aqueous streams 21 table 4 shows a compilation of meuf research involving metallic ions removal by meuf the retention of cadmium was evaluated by various studies mainly using sds as a surfactant retention of 90 was attained for 50 mg l 1 of cadmium using 5 10 and 30 kda pes membranes and a ratio of 23 of surfactant contaminant it was viewed that high retention was attained with the 5 kda membrane retention of 20 to 60 of sds were obtained furthermore the surfactant monomers aggregate into hemimicelles which are formed due to the adsorption of surfactant on the membrane surface it was concluded that the cadmium retention was related to the fouling layer formed by sds 19 it was shown retention of 99 for an initial cadmium concentration of 50 mg l 1 in a 10 kda membrane of pes and ratio of surfactant contaminant of 46 it was shown that the concentration of sds near the membrane surface was 16 higher than the sds concentration in the bulk solution it was observed that high tmp increases the retention rate it was concluded that the flux decline in the process was due to micelles formed in the concentration polarization layer which accounted for 50 of the total resistance 70 a ratio of 43 of surfactant to contaminant was used to obtain retention of up to 99 of cadmium ions 50 mg l 1 using sds as a surfactant combined with 10 kda membrane of polysulfone ps it was viewed that the cadmium retention increases with the augmentation of sds concentration until 1 mmol l 1 and after that the retention rate decreased 109 the authors used the lowest tmp of the evaluated works that is 30 kpa but due to high effective membrane area of 3000 cm2 its permeate flux of 10 15 l m 2 h 1 is near to other metallic retention works that used high tmp from 80 to 207 kpa and permeate flux from 13 to 114 l m 2 h 1 besides that the cmc cited is the cmc in water which does not represent the accurate cmc of surfactant in the presence of other electrolytes as reported by naskar et al 53 retention of 93 was obtained using an 8 kda pes membrane and a ratio of 17 surfactant contaminant retention rate of 72 was obtained using a mixture of sds and triton x 100 as surfactants an additional study with foam fractionation was presented with increased cadmium retention up to 98 no permeate flux was mentioned it was shown that the residual surfactant decreases when increasing the mixture of surfactants sds triton x 100 but decreases in the sds only system 21 the retentions of lead cadmium zinc and copper were evaluated separately using a 10 kda membrane of pes and a ratio of 46 surfactant contaminant retentions up to 97 99 were attained 36 the permeate flux was not shown it was interesting presented the influence of solution ph in the metal retention however the experimental room temperature varied from 20 to 30 c which influences the micellization and the meuf efficiency as reported by huang et al 69 simultaneous retentions of yttrium 30 mg l 1 and zinc 2 mg l 1 were evaluated using sds as a surfactant in a ratio to the contaminant of 90 retentions of 100 and 99 88 were attained for yttrium and zinc respectively two membrane pore sizes of 1 and 210 kda were used the effect of sds concentration and the tmp was also evaluated it was concluded that the membrane pore size is the most influential factor for metal retention 83 meuf was successfully used to remove nickel ions 70 mg l 1 from aqueous streams retention of almost 99 was attained using a 3 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose in neutral ph and a 68 surfactant contaminant ratio the response surface methodology was used to evaluate tmp contaminant concentration sds concentration and membrane pore size in constant ph 8 it was viewed a 5 fold increase in the permeate flux from 23 to 115 l m 2 h 1 when the membrane pore size was augmented from 3 to 10 kda however the nickel retention was slightly decreased from 98 7 to 97 8 it was concluded that all the factors were significant for meuf efficiency and the sds concentration was the most influential 29 cobalt retention was evaluated using sds as a surfactant and a ratio of 297 surfactant contaminant which resulted in retentions of 93 and 97 when using zro2 membranes of 1 and 210 kda pore sizes respectively the retentate fraction of the experiment was acidified and passed through another ultrafiltration in the same membrane allowing 96 of cobalt recuperation which is caused by a replacement of the h into the micelle anionic sites previously occupied by the metal cation 66 a boron meuf study 5 mg l 1 obtained retention of 99 using sds as a surfactant ratio of 230 surfactant contaminant combined with a 1 kda ceramic membrane pore size it was shown that high tmp reduces the retention rate a membrane of 210 kda was also evaluated however its retention was only 49 using 10 mmol l 1 of surfactant the filtration without the addition of surfactant resulted in retention of 97 45 using the 1 kda membrane and 800 kpa 110 the membrane pore size of 1 kda used in this study was relatively small since the ultrafiltration without any surfactant resulted in a retention of 97 45 which does not justify the use of surfactant to remove only 2 15 more of contaminant in this study it is affirmed that the use of surfactant was below the cmc however it was supposed that the cmc was calculated in pure water the paper does not show the calculations and this could lead to an erroneous interpretation of the results since the cmc normally decreases in the presence of other solutes 3 3 removal of dyes by meuf synthetic dyes which are toxic to the environment are present in processed water from textile industries these streams are frequently treated by adsorption coagulation flocculation oxidation process and biological techniques however each technique has particular limitations 17 since meuf process is a separation technique that uses the affinity of contaminants to the surfactant micelles to solubilize the contaminant this technique has been effectively used to remove dyes 35 in table 5 it is presented some works with dye removal by meuf and it is possible to observe that the methylene blue removal was a common object of study a pes membrane was used with a pore size of 0 01 μm with sds as a surfactant in a 20 g l 1 of nacl for retention of 10 mg l 1 of methylene blue it was attained retention of 99 6 the ratio of surfactant contaminant was 946 it was viewed that the mb retention was increased with an increase in the sds concentration or the nacl concentration nevertheless it was shown that the mb retention decreased with an increase of the tmp or the mb concentration in the initial solution 17 extended research was made using three different surfactants sds laureth 6 carboxylic acid rlm45 and oleth 10 carboxylic acid ro90 and four different membrane pore sizes 5 10 30 and 100 kda for an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 of mb it was assured retentions smaller than 10 and up to 95 with higher retentions obtained using smaller membrane pore sizes a surfactant contaminant ratio of 588 was used in the filtrations with sds 218 for rlm45 and 290 to ro90 when using 30 or 100 kda membrane higher retentions were shown using surfactants rlm45 and ro90 than the sds due to the formation of large micelle sizes 11 using a ratio of sds to methylene blue mb of 385 retention of 99 of mb 6 mg l 1 was attained it was used a 10 kda membrane it was shown that the addition of 17 53 g l 1 of nacl in the solution increased the retention of sds from 62 to almost 97 while maintaining almost the same retention of mb it was concluded that the temperature increases the retention of mb from the retentate stream due to an increase in the solubility of the mb 69 the retention of reactive blue 19 60 mg l 1 was evaluated using ehab and ctab as surfactants in a regenerated cellulose membrane of 5 10 and 30 kda it was viewed that in the 5 kda membrane pore size the retention without using any surfactant was above 99 indicating that the surfactant does not play a role in this membrane size due to the larger molecular size of the dye using ctab as a surfactant a ratio of surfactant dye of 14 was used for both 10 and 30 kda membranes and retentions of 99 62 and 96 85 were attained respectively using the ehab as a surfactant a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 12 was used for the 10 and the 30 kda membranes it was observed that the increase in surfactant concentration increases the retention rate and decreases the permeate flux retentions of 98 99 and 94 97 were obtained respectively it was concluded that the 10 kda membrane was the most efficient for meuf process due to higher permeate flux than the ultrafiltration with a 5 kda membrane 56 retention of eriochrome blue black r ebbr at a 42 mg l 1 using a 10 kda regenerated cellulose membrane with four different cationic surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide c12tab tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide c14tab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide c16tab and octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide c18tab was evaluated three concentrations of dyes were tested 0 1 0 5 and 1 mm of ebbr using a concentration of 10 times the surfactant cmc it was shown a retention rate above 99 8 when using c18tab retention above 99 6 using c16tab retention rate from 51 1 to 97 9 using c14tab and retention rate from 34 6 to 51 4 using the c12tab the chain length of the surfactant positively influences the retention rate and the permeate flux it was shown that an increase of up to 1 mol of different salts did not change dye retention but decreased the permeate flux moreover the use of acid ph values also led to a decrease in the permeate flow while the retention rate remains almost constant 90 methyl violet retention using saponin as a biosurfactant and four pes membranes with 10 20 30 and 50 kda were evaluated a ratio of surfactant dye of 8 was used in a feed of 250 mg l 1 of methyl violet and 2000 mg l 1 of saponin it was attained a rejection of methyl violet higher than 99 and 97 to 10 and 20 kda membranes respectively for the 30 kda membrane it was about 81 while for the 50 kda membrane it was about 62 the retention of saponin was high about 71 in a 10 kda membrane it was observed that the permeate flux increased from 2 to 11 lm 2 h 1 to the 10 and 50 kda membrane respectively the tmp the ph and the salinity did not influence the retention of dye 35 sunset yellow removal was studied using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and ethyl hexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide ehab as surfactants in a regenerated cellulose membrane of 10 and 30 kda the dye concentration in the feed was 45 mg l 1 the retention rates using ctab were 99 94 and 99 60 for a surfactant contaminant ratio of 18 6 and 17 in a 10 and 30 kda membrane respectively the retention rate using ehab as a surfactant was 99 61 for the 10 kda membrane and 99 05 for the 30 kda membrane the surfactant contaminant radio used was 16 for both membranes with ehab the surfactant concentration had a positive effect on the retention rate of dye while the retention of the membranes pore size of 10 and 30 did not show a significant difference it was concluded that both surfactants did not play a role in the retention rate in a 10 kda membrane due to the high retention of dye without using any surfactant 34 using the saponin as biosurfactant it was attained retention of 97 of the dye remazol red rb rrrb and 99 for the remazol turquoise blue rtb it was used a pes membrane of 10 kda in a flat sheet crossflow ultrafiltration mode a surfactant contaminant ratio of about 13 33 was used it was reached a retention rate of up to 98 it was observed that the addition of saponin significantly increases the retention of the dye and slightly decreases the permeate flux it was concluded that the fouling mechanism is different for the uf process without saponin with saponin below the cmc and with saponin above the cmc 103 3 4 removal of organic compounds by meuf water and wastewater contaminated with recalcitrant organic pollutants can be originated from both domestic and industrial activities in fact the waste streams from domestic wastewater pharmaceutical industries and hospitals may contain antibiotics and other pharmaceutical products from nanogram to microgram scale 16 besides that organic acids are present in the effluent of sugar beet processing plants 57 moreover different polyphenols compounds are found in olive mill wastewater 93 table 6 shows the most recent meuf studies involving organic contaminants the retention of 600 mg l 1 of different organic acids from olive mill synthetic wastewater was evaluated in a 10 kda membrane the ratio of surfactant to the contaminant used was 0 41 it was shown that retentions higher than 90 were attained with a cationic surfactant esterquat in the first minutes of filtration after that due to concentration polarization the retention decreased 20 a polyphenols rejection of 20 without using any surfactant was obtained due to the adsorption of polyphenols in the membrane it was demonstrated that the retention curve in function of the surfactant concentration tends to flatten when the surfactant concentration reached 5 times the cmc which was the best surfactant concentration it was revealed that the addition of non ionic surfactant did not influence the rejection factor retentions of 93 and 95 were attained in ph 1 and 3 respectively 15 treating real olive mill wastewater in a membrane of polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf a polyphenols retention of 74 was attained using the anionic surfactant sds 27 97 g l 1 at the optimum ph of 2 it was shown that the initial permeate flux of 25 7 with 3 5 bar and 44 5 l m 2 h 1 with 4 5 bar reduced 60 and 65 respectively in the end of the process time this behavior indicates that high pressures may cause severe fouling for the total membrane resistance 91 was caused by the addition of sds the permeate was 88 less dark demanding less chemical oxygen for its oxidation it was concluded that the meuf process could be used to treat olive mill wastewater for the concentration and recovery of polyphenols 93 the retention of enrofloxacin 9 mg l 1 using a pes membrane of 10 kda and cationic surfactant cpb in a ratio surfactant to contaminant of 179 was achieved reaching up to 94 of rejection with a permeate flux of 45 63 l m 2 h 1 a tmp of 4 bar and the optimum ph of 7 the process was modeled and it was shown that an artificial neural network predicts better the results than the response surface methodology 16 a study using a mixture of ten contaminants of emerging concern combined with five different surfactants sds triton x 100 tween 20 cpc and ctab was conducted with a pes membrane of 5 kda the higher retention values were obtained in the presence of the cationic surfactant cpc retentions up to 99 were attained for four of the contaminants sulfamethoxazole ketorolac hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac and up to 87 for other three flumequine atrazine and isoproturon it was shown that electrostatic interactions of anionic contaminant and cationic surfactant played an important role in retention 4 the retention of organic acids was successfully evaluated by geanta et al 57 the lactic and citric acids at the initial concentration of 4 14 and 8 84 g l 1 respectively were removed using sds in a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 6 9 and 3 2 respectively with a 5 kda membrane of tio2 retentions of 93 7 and 90 1 were attained respectively lower retentions were attained using other surfactants it was viewed that the concentration of sds in the permeate fraction remains constant below the cmc and it was concluded that the affinity of the sds micelles by the acids depends on the initial concentration of surfactant the retention of organic halogens from an industrial powder and detergent wastewater using a mixture of surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether pne when the conductivity of the stream was up to 5 1 μs cm 1 80 92 of organic halogens were removed when by the polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf membrane with 180 kda pore size it was not viewed as irreversible membrane fouling due to membrane hydrophilicity it was concluded that the electrolytes in solution affect the meuf efficiency and the retention of organic halogens increased above 90 if the conductivity of the wastewater was at least at 4 0 μs cm 1 even with the surfactant concentration below the cmc 61 however the cmc cited is referring to the cmc in water and it is well known that the cmc value changes according to the characteristics of the medium a ratio of 1215 of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab to contaminant was used to remove 25 to 100 of three different sulfonamides with a 3 kda membrane of regenerated cellulose rc in secondary sewage from a regional treatment plant the authors also evaluated the meuf process in a solution containing sediments and dissolved organic matter it was concluded that sediment increases the retention of contaminants but the presence of dissolved organic matter does not increase the retention of contaminants 111 aniline retention of 78 was obtained using a mixture of surfactants sds and rhamnolipid in a ratio of 8 2 the factors evaluated were mixing ratio ph salinity tmp and contaminant concentration by an orthogonal experiment it was concluded that the ph is the most influent factor for aniline retention the optimum ph was 5 and the mixing ratio was the most influent factor in the permeate flux aniline rejection from 17 to 78 and permeate flux from 205 to 298 l m 2 h 1 were attained 91 the membrane used was not described naphthenic acids nas are a family of saturated aliphatic and alicyclic acids presented in the wastewater of the petroleum industry among other contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene xylene phenols heavy metals and ions it was shown that the nas account for high than 50 of the organic fraction of this wastewater since the discharge of this effluent to the environment is limited by different regulations there are studies regarding the evaluation of methodologies to remove na from these wastewater streams 94 97 112 for a meuf process of naphthenic acids practical grade 500 mg l 1 removal a ratio of 43 2 of sds contaminant was used it was obtained retentions of 97 5 without salinity and 94 5 with salinity it was shown that the retention rate decreases with ph and salinity but increases with the surfactant concentration the permeate flux was enhanced up to 24 using an assisted electric field in the membrane module it was concluded that the meuf process is entirely governed by the solubilization of na in the micelle the ph and the electrolyte concentration 88 other works used cpc as a surfactant for na retention a ratio of 11 3 of surfactant contaminant was used to treat a solution of 300 mg l 1 of naphthenic acids practical grade napg retentions up to 99 were attained using ceramic membranes of 15 and 50 kda there was no significant difference in the retention rate by changing the membranes pore size or the tmp however the permeate flux was increased in high tmp for the 50 kda membrane the cpc retention was higher than 96 for all experiments with both membranes it was concluded that concentration polarization played a minor role in the process due to the structure of the ceramic membrane 7 it was evaluated the application of the meuf process for mixture retention containing octanoic acid 364 mg l 1 and xylene 70 mg l 1 using polyacrylonitrile pan membrane of 13 kda a ratio of 9 4 of surfactant contaminant was used retention rates of 94 2 and 99 8 for p xylene and octanoic acid were attained respectively no significant influence of the tmp on retention rate was observed it was demonstrated that the increase in cpc concentration decreases the permeate flux 9 it was used a pan membrane of 13 kda to remove na practical grade 300 mg l 1 it was used a ratio of surfactant contaminant of 11 3 it was shown that increasing the carbon number of the na decreases the cmc of the cpc increases the micelle size and increases the retention rate it was not observed a significant difference in retention rate when varying the tmp 22 the removal of naphthenic acids present in real produced water pw from two different fields was evaluated with cpc as a surfactant it was used polymeric and ceramic membranes of 13 and 50 kda respectively the cpc concentration used was constant 3 4 g l 1 in all experiments to sample a 84 mg l 1 of total organic carbon a ratio of 40 was used and retentions up to 96 and 98 were obtained with the use of polymeric and ceramic membrane respectively for sample b 66 mg l 1 of total organic carbon a ratio of 51 was used and retentions of 94 and 96 were obtained with the use of polymeric and ceramic membrane respectively it was shown that the increase in the tmp reduces the retention rate it was concluded that the ceramic membrane was more effective in removing organic contaminants mainly at high pressures due to its hydrophobic nature the ceramic membrane also presented relatively lower permeate flux than the pan membrane 64 3 5 critical analysis according to the presented data the meuf process can be used to treat different contaminants with high retention rates however as it is a relatively new technology compared to other separation techniques most of the presented data uses simple synthetic wastewater without any other component or salinity in its experiments probably due to limitations in quantifying the contaminant in the permeate stream it would be industrially appreciated if more studies were carried out using complex synthetic wastewater or real wastewater in the cited data a lack of detailed methodology was frequently observed an important and common forgotten parameter is the permeate flux the permeate flux is one of the most important parameters in membrane filtration the dimensioning of the pilot and industrial scales of the meuf process depends on the permeate flux to be determined the retention of surfactant is another critical parameter frequently omitted in the cited studies since the mass of surfactant added to the solution is always higher than the contaminant it is essential to retain the surfactant to avoid or minimize posterior treatment of the permeate stream an example is adding 20 times more surfactant than contaminant a low relation since relations up to 1000 times were viewed and if the retention of surfactant is about 95 the permeate stream would be in a concentration of surfactant equal to the initial concentration of a contaminant this is after all only a change of the contaminant as a treatment of the permeate stream would be necessary to remove the surfactant it was observed that ph and temperature play an important role in cmc and retention rate however these factors are frequently absent in the cited data as well as the tmp which does not ensure the reproducibility of these studies besides the frequent affirmation that the meuf is an economical process compared to others only a few works present an estimative of the costs concerning the used methodology there is a frequent misconception of the real cmc in the process since the cmc changes in the presence of other solutes the cmc in a medium with any contaminant is lower than the cmc of the surfactant in pure water therefore it is an erroneous approach to use the cmc in water to reference the surfactant concentration in a mixed solution containing both surfactant and contaminant as a result it is pointed in some works unexpected retention of contaminant even below the cmc in water however the presence of the contaminant probably pushed down the cmc to a value below the cmc in water in other words the surfactant after all could be above the real cmc it is a common conclusion to point to the best parameter process as the one used for the highest retention rate of contaminant however from an industrial point of view the best parameter process for meuf could be completely different mainly by using low surfactant concentration low pressures and neutral ph for economic reasons depending on the characteristics such as temperature and ph of the wastewater it is preferred ceramics membranes due to its high resistance 4 filled meuf related patent patent exploration involving meuf in a world intellectual property organization wipo patent scope platform showed few projects in the past 10 years an invention patent describes the use of the retained stream of the meuf process and the addition of a chelator into the system followed by ph adjustment stirring operation and then ultrafiltration the recovery of cd ii and surfactant sdbs were up to 65 2 and 55 1 respectively this approach is interesting since this recovery step minimizes secondary pollution 113 other invention patents cite the recuperation of cd ii using meuf process with a mixture of sds and brij 35 as surfactants the cadmium retention was close to 100 and the recuperation of surfactants was 15 44 and 82 4 for sds and brij 35 respectively 114 an invention patent of a microemulsion that easily breaks up with a simple dilution was described many potential applications are cited such as in the meuf process permiting an easy recuperation of the contaminant from the retentate stream no detailed data for the meuf process was provided apart from the dead end stirred mode filtration and the solution volume 115 an invention patent relates a concentration of hydrophobic exo signals from the rhizosphere by meuf promoting beneficial symbiotic and parasitic interactions to plants in that process a foliar application of elicitors was made in test plants cultivated in hydroponic media then after the treatment with elicitors a fraction of the hydroponic solution of 10 l was separated into the meuf process it proposes the temperature at 30 c addition of the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 407 the ph to 5 6 and then the ultrafiltration was performed in a membrane with a maximum pore size of 25 kda and a tmp of 140 to 170 kpa the radicular retentate was concentrated to 5 ml by a vacuum rotary evaporator 116 the same methodology was cited for the recovery of bio active hydrophobic components from radicular exudates by meuf 117 it was described as an invention patent to obtain high purity alliin using a meuf process it was used an imidazolium gemini as a cationic surfactant in a mixed system with sodium deoxycholate as anionic surfactant in a molar ratio of 1 4 it was cited the use of ph 11 and a 0 2 μm membrane pore size of pvdf the tmp was evaluated from 170 to 500 kpa the retentate solution was acidified 50 70 of ethanol was added evaporated crystallized and dried to obtain a high purity alliin it was expected a recovery rate of alliin from 88 to 99 118 5 challenges and future approaches to meuf meuf technique still has some challenges to overcome such as the flux decrease during the process caused by concentration polarization and the surfactant recuperation also the pollution after all is only transferred from one solution to another which means from the original polluted stream for a more concentrated one the retentate stream 97 chemical surfactants commonly present high critical micelle concentrations which is considered a disadvantage 91 alternatively the biosurfactants have low toxicity high biodegradability and their properties barely change with temperature and salinity 89 some promising studies researched high pollutant retention using biosurfactant as saponin 23 35 rhamnolipid 73 89 119 a mixture of rhamnolipids and sophorolipids 120 and a conjugated linoleic acid 72 a vast gap in literature could be supplied if new meuf studies use biosurfactants with low cmc besides that there are a few additional processes described in the literature that recuperate the contaminant or and the surfactant from the retentate or permeate streams such as acidification ultrafiltration liquid liquid extraction alkalinization refrigeration below the kraft temperature or the foam fractioning process an efficient process to recover the surfactant from the retentate stream may turn the meuf into a most economically attractive process 21 35 57 65 66 the use of a surfactant in which the micelles are easily cross linked using uv light was proposed to overcome the issue of loss of surfactant to the permeate stream 71 as the concentration polarization decreases the permeate flux there are alternatives to contour this problem such as the use of an electrical field that enhances the permeate flux 88 92 or even using regular backwashing 61 technologies that increase the permeate flux or minimize the loss of the membrane permeability during the process are little described for meuf process the cost of the meuf process is as well underexplored presenting the total cost of meuf is the first step to scale up the process however only a couple of works provide an estimative of the meuf costs for the treatment of 3 l of wastewater the cost of the meuf process was about us 0 15 while reusing the surfactant by acidification ultrafiltration technique was about us 0 71 65 a simulation of a plant to treat 60 000 m3 d 1 of seawater using both meuf and ro was estimated to cost about us 0 91 per cubic meter 110 while studies using synthetic wastewater are more frequent without any salinity some promising researches use real wastewater effluent as seen for organic acids retention 57 64 phenol retention 93 heavy metals retention 67 organic halogens retention 61 sulfonamide antibiotics 111 and soft drink wastewater treatment 121 the complexity of real wastewater turns the meuf into a more challenging process however only few studies use a pilot scale process which permits a more realistic evaluation of the meuf such as phosphorous retention from a fertilizer industry 68 boron retention 110 and cobalt retention 66 it is well known that the meuf process works on a laboratory scale however to attain another level the study of real wastewater using a pilot scale meuf process is the next important step to completely understand the technique behavior 6 conclusions meuf process is able to attain high retention rates in a diversity of contaminant streams containing ions dyes and organics as a variety of operating conditions can be applied to optimize the retention rate the membrane pore size type and surface hydrophobicity can influence the operation as well as the surfactant charge its cmc and its concentration in solution temperature transmembrane pressure ph and ionic strength also affect the process efficiency the ratio of surfactant to contaminant may vary significantly from one study to another from 1 to almost 1000 potentially resulting in a permeate with high surfactant concentration the majority of reported studies in the literature were operated with synthetic wastewater which is easily quantifiable furthermore important process parameters are commonly missing such as the ph the temperature the permeate flux the retention of surfactant and the transmembrane pressure the concept of cmc is usually mistaken in some results presented in the literature as there are different approaches for the meuf process still there is no standard methodology to present the data or system of units adopted this review outlined the data of higher retention rate however for a large scale process to be executed it is necessary to evaluate other parameters such as permeate flux and implementation and maintenance costs the major problem of meuf process as mentioned before is the concentration polarization which causes a decrease in the permeate flux reducing the efficiency and increasing operational costs furthermore since water and wastewater streams may have a wider variety of contaminants and different properties than a controlled laboratory experiment large scale meuf needs to overcome these conditions and the costs involved besides there is a rising demand for surfactant recovery and the use of biosurfactants that can facilitate the use of meuf in industrial processes declaration of competing interest the authors certify that they have no affiliations with

13108,a large amount of aquaculture wastewater with high load of nutrients organic matter and microalgae will pollute receiving water body and needs to treat before discharge in this work membrane distillation md with the ability to avoid non volatile substances was used to purify water and simultaneously recover nutrients from aquaculture wastewater results showed that micro structures have evenly distributed on the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane using nylon taffeta substrate resultant membrane has surpassed superhydrophobicity benchmark it achieved high water contact angle of 153 3 and low contact angle hysteresis of 8 4 the continuous separation and treatment of fish farm wastewater showed a small and steady flux reduction of 1 4 kg m2 h indicating less fouling by the surface printed membrane in the batch process of feed concentration the water recovery reached 86 3 the retentate concentration of fish farm water is at least five times higher than initial concentration of ammonia 16 4 to 82 2 mg l phosphate 18 0 to 99 8 mg l and potassium 68 0 to 384 8 mg l this concentrated feed can use as primary nutrient of liquid fertilizer in feed concentration process except for ammonia 86 rejection of all selected inorganic substances is higher than 99 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nutrient recovery water management superhydrophobic membrane distillation liquid fertilizer 1 introduction aquaculture is the business of cultivating and farming freshwater marine food under controlled conditions it is one of the rapid growing food production industries in the world demonstrating the importance of this industry in food supply owing to the high consumption of fish products the aquaculture industry is developing in a more intensive manners 1 2 despite supplying food and generating income for local communities the aquaculture farming still bears a series of adverse environmental consequences this is because fish farming produces a large amount of wastewater containing high load of particulate organic matters and dissolved nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these substances are not suitable to discharge to the surrounding water causing pollution to the receiving water body 3 table 1 shows the main nutrients of aquaculture wastewater in different locations in addition the rapid expansion of aquaculture has a greater demand for water resources the water needs to be changed regularly to maintain the fish in the ponds healthy and to remove toxic fish metabolites excess algae and other wastes to prevent fish death 4 this leads to the need to treat a large amount of wastewater during and after the cultivation process therefore it is necessary to establish effective wastewater treatment before discharge and at the same time the nutrients dissolved in the wastewater can be recovered the ability of membrane distillation md to prevent non volatile substances from passing through the permeate side while purifying water 9 10 has shown its potential in treating fish farm wastewater nevertheless membrane fouling especially organic matter and biofouling is an issue that needs to be considered in the membrane separation process 11 12 generally md membranes have high hydrophobicity to prevent liquid from penetrating into the membrane pores 13 14 however the presence of organics microorganisms and microalgae in fish farm wastewater may deteriorate the performance of the membrane natural organic matter released by microalgae during md process especially extracellular polymeric substances eps may adhere to the membrane surface polysaccharides protein and fatty acid are the main components of eps these components are surface active compounds 15 16 which can trigger membrane fouling through precipitation and certain chemical bond interactions 17 18 the biofouling layer on the membrane surface will partially or completely block the membrane pores thereby the additional mass resistance restricts the diffusion and transport of water vapor to the liquid vapor interface eps with amphiphilic properties may reduce the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface and induce membrane wetting 19 in order to improve the efficiency of the md process fouling is an important issue that should be addressed several methods are introduced to control or reduce the fouling of the membrane surface in the md process most of the techniques are to alter the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface or modify the membrane surface such as coating low surface energy chemicals 20 or nanoparticles and plasma treatment 21 22 however these methods require additional chemicals cost and energy usage on the other hand surface patterning technique that physically modifies the surface structure of the membrane is an attractive alternative to mitigate or reduce the membrane fouling 23 the repetitive structure on the membrane surface stimulates higher turbulence thereby reducing the tendency to be fouled 24 kharraz et al 25 implemented hydrophobic patterned pvdf membrane and superhydrophobic alkaline treated patterned pvdf membrane with perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane coating to treat seawater in the md process both patterned pvdf membranes have demonstrated their ability to alleviate salt deposition and fouling in 113 h of dcmd to treat seawater in our previous studies 26 27 we synthesized pvdf membranes by casting the membranes directly on the template substrate the surface of the membrane was printed with repetitive micro structures in the study the membrane produced using a non woven template substrate shows a significant improvement in surface superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 156 and a sliding angle of 5 27 one of our previous works 28 investigated membrane surfaces printed with different surface topographies and used in the md process for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater we reported that the surface printed membranes were able to improve permeation flux in md operations with high organic and inorganic rejections however the feasibility of the surface printed membrane for continuous concentration of nutrients in aquaculture wastewater has not been established to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the application of surface printing membrane in the md process to concentrate nutrients in aquaculture wastewater concentrations of organics suspended solids and microalgae will gradually increase due to the continuous reduction of liquid on the feed side these substances in the complex aquaculture wastewater tend to adhere to the membrane surface causing membrane wetting in this context the ability of surface printed membrane to resist organics and biofouling in continuously concentrated aquaculture effluent needs to be investigated hereby in this work a physical modification method is used to synthesize membranes to treat the microalgae rich wastewater from fish farms the surface of superhydrophobic pvdf membrane with uniformly distributed micro structures is prepared using nylon taffeta templated substrate the main propose of this study is to concentrate fish farm wastewater and convert it into economically viable liquid fertilizer while at the same time producing clean permeate water for aquaculture activities meanwhile this study also evaluated the effectiveness of the md concentration process to treat microalgae rich wastewater from fish farms therefore the water quality of the feed retentate and permeate water are analyzed to determine the separation efficiency of md this study also investigated membrane fouling including organic matter deposition and the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface after the md process 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf powder from alfa aesar was used as the polymer n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent was purchased from sigma aldrich and ethanol elite advanced materials non solvent was utilized for membrane synthesis nylon taffeta fabric from the local market was obtained as a template substrate to produce micro structured pvdf membrane wastewater from the fish farm was collected from an inland catfish farm near sungai udang malaysia the water sample was collected from the surface of the pond and stored in a cold environment before used 2 2 membrane preparation the pvdf powder was dried overnight at 60 c in an oven to remove moisture prior to membrane casting dried pvdf powder was dissolved in nmp solvent and stirring was continued for 24 h after all the powder was completely dissolved the pvdf dope was sonicated at room temperature for an hour to remove excess air bubbles the polymer dope was cast on a nylon taffeta template substrate with a thickness of 400 μm the cast film with the substrate was immersed in an ethanol coagulation bath for 6 h and followed by water coagulation bath for 18 h the membrane was air dried at room temperature for 3 days before being peeled from the substrate 2 3 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd performance test the dcmd system comprises two continuous flow pumps a chiller a heater two flow meters a temperature monitoring system with sensors and a membrane module all pipes and fittings were insulated to reduce the heat released to the surroundings the wastewater collected from the fish farm was used as hot feed and 2 l of milli q deionized water on the cold side the recirculation flow rates of the hot feed and cold permeate were both set to 0 5 l min in counter current flow mode the hot feed tank was jacketed and the temperature was controlled at 60 c by a heater while the cold permeate temperature was connected to a chiller to maintain the temperature at 20 c the surface of the membrane with micro structure faces the hot feed and the active membrane area was 33 3 cm2 the dcmd performance test was divided into two operation modes continuous separation and batch feed concentration mode in the continuous separation mode the concentration and volume of the feed was kept constant throughout the separation process for the batch feed concentration mode the feed was concentrated and the volume was reduced by mass transfer to the permeate side 2 l and 4 l of fish farm wastewater was used as the initial feed volume and concentrated for 24 and 48 h respectively an online weighing balance and a conductivity meter were utilized to record the permeated mass and the corresponding water conductivity the permeate flux j was determined by the following equation 1 j m a t where m a and t represented the mass of permeate g membrane active area m2 and process duration h respectively the water recovery in the batch feed concentration mode was calculated as eq 2 2 water recovery m p m fi 100 where mp and mfi are the mass of permeate collected g and mass of initial feed solution g respectively the rejection for the ions can be obtained through eq 3 3 rejection m fi c fi m p c p m fi c fi 100 where cfi and cp are denoted as the concentration of ions in the initial feed and final permeate mg l respectively 2 4 analytical method morphologies of surface and cross section of membranes were observed through scanning electron microscope sem

is the weight of 2 butanol absorbed by the membrane g mm is the dry weight of membrane g ρ b is the density of 2 butanol 0 81 g cm3 and ρ m is the density of pvdf 1 78 g cm3 at least three different spots of the membrane were analyzed to compute the average membrane s porosity for water contact angle measurement a drop of water was dispensed on the membrane surface by an automatic liquid dispenser with a surface meter lauda surface analyzer 200 germany 10 random spots of the membrane were analyzed to obtain an average result based on the sessile drop method for interpreting the advancing contact angle water droplet on the membrane surface was slowly expanded from the initial volume of 5 μl to 20 μl at a rate of 0 25 μl s maximum contact angle on the three phase contact line solid air liquid was recorded as the advancing contact angle after that the water droplet was gradually withdrawing from 20 μl to 5 μl at the same rate of 0 25 μl s the receding contact angle was recorded as the minimum contact angle between the water droplet and the membrane surface measurement for both advancing and receding contact angles was repeated for at least 10 random spots to compute an average result by using the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 800 carl zeiss germany the surface roughness and micro scaled structures of the membrane sample was identified thermo scientific

hemocytometer with an optical microscope and correlated it with the absorbance at 600 nm by an uv vis spectrophotometer carry 60 agilent the total suspended solids in the fish farm wastewater were tested based on the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss method 30 50 ml of fish farm wastewater was first filtered through a weighed standard glass fiber filter disk whatman gf c 1 2 μm the residue left on the filter was dried in an oven at temperature of 105 c for an hour the residue was weighed with the filter disk and recorded increment in weight of the filter disk represents the total suspended solids of the sample the total suspended solids tss concentration can be expressed as following equation 5 tss m 1 m 2 v where m1 is represented as the initial weight of the glass fiber filter m2 is the total weight of the solid residue and glass fiber filter and v is the volume of fish farm wastewater for filtration 3 results and discussion in this work a pvdf membrane with a highly ordered micro structures is essential to increase the superhydrophobicity of the membrane while preventing fouling induced wetting during dcmd separation as shown in fig 1 the membrane cast on the nylon taffeta template substrate has successfully printed even and repetitive micro structures on the surface fig 1a the tiny and interconnected globules are detected by the high magnification surface image fig 1a insert small image fibril like linkage bridges are observed between the globules which resulted in a bi continuous membrane structure it is precisely because the membrane is immersed in the ethanol coagulation bath that triggered a slow exchange rate between the solvent and the non solvent 28 the slow phase inversion process promotes the formation of small globules fig 1b resulting in nano scale roughness on the membrane the combination of micro scale and nano scale asperities enables a large amount of air layer to be trapped on the membrane surface during the sessile drop measurement a higher static water contact angle of 153 3 is achieved table 2 one of the reasons is due to its surface roughness in our previous study 27 the root mean square surface roughness ra of the non printed membrane solidified in an ethanol coagulation bath was 2 3 μm due to the existence of nano scale globules the non printed membrane can achieve a high static water contact angle of 134 but unable to achieve the superhydrophobic properties water contact angle exceeding 150 in the case of using nylon taffeta template to print micro grooves on the surface of the membrane the ra of the membrane is significantly improved with ra of 4 54 μm table 2 interestingly the improvement of the membrane surface roughness is contributed by the even and repetitive surface waviness profile fig 1c rather than the random heterogeneous roughness profile in fact air bubbles can be trapped in this uniform waviness microgrooves and form a repelling layer reducing the actual contact area between water and the membrane surface therefore it restricts the penetration of water into the membrane pores and keeps it staying as a spherical droplet on the rough membrane surface high surface roughness is essential for the construction of superhydrophobic membranes nonetheless high surface roughness does not necessarily reduce the adhesion between water and the membrane surface a membrane with a high static contact angle can promote a high dynamic advancing contact angle however it may also reduce the dynamic receding contact angle this is because the resulting roughness may promote the pinning effect of the droplets and cause continuous contact lines between the asperities 31 for superhydrophobic membrane water droplets are designed to be able to glide spontaneously on the membrane surface with no or very low contact angle hysteresis less than 10 32 as mentioned earlier the uniform and repetitive surface waviness profile on the membrane surface will cause the water to be unable to wet or reach the membrane surface area resulting in a large amount of air trapped beneath the droplets therefore it helps to form a slippery membrane surface with high dynamic advancing and receding contact angles of 154 6 and 146 2 respectively table 2 by comparing these two dynamic contact angles the low contact angle hysteresis of 8 6 indicates that the water droplets are supported by air bubbles trapped between the microgrooves therefore created a surface with very low liquid solid adhesion this result is supported by the homogeneous surface waviness fig 1c similar height of micro valleys which allows water droplet to glide on the membrane surface with very low pinning forces when water droplets roll off the surface less energy is required to overcome frictional barrier on the membrane surface in this work the adhesive force between the printed surface and the water droplets is extremely low resulting in a low sliding contact angle as low as 8 9 in addition the surface printed membrane also achieves a high porosity of 83 3 which provides more available open pore channels for vapor diffusion it is no doubt that the lower mass transfer resistance in the membrane will give an advantage to obtain a higher vapor flux in the dcmd for example the membrane resistances of commercial pvdf membrane porosity 64 33 and non surface printed pvdf membrane porosity 80 8 in previous study 28 were estimated to be 769 4 and 587 1 pa m2 h kg respectively meanwhile the membrane resistance of the surface printed membrane with 83 3 porosity in this work is 387 2 pa m2 h kg which is relatively lower than that of commercial and non surface printed pvdf membranes this difference emphasizes the benefits of membrane with higher porosity calculations of membrane resistance are included in the supplementary document in this work the surface printed membrane has undergone two operating modes of dcmd separation i e continuous separation mode and batch feed concentration mode fig 2 displays the permeate flux results for a 24 h dcmd separation in the first hour both operating modes showed similar vapor permeation flux of 29 1 kg m2 h this result portraits the production consistency of the surface printed membrane which has almost the same initial vapor permeation flux when fed with the same source of fish farm wastewater under the same separation conditions feed flow rate feed composition and feed temperature and using the same pvdf membrane the temperature polarization effect is expected to be the same for md continuous and batch separation modes in this work the temperature polarization coefficient was calculated to be 0 69 the calculation is included in the supplementary document when the dcmd separation process went further the two operating modes displayed two completely different separation performance trends in the continuous separation mode there is a stable vapor permeation flux fig 2 blue dotted line and a slight decrease is observed after 24 h of separation from 29 1 kg m2 h reduced by 4 8 to 27 7 kg m2 h the decrease in vapor permeation flux may be due to the adhesion of organic and inorganic foulants on the membrane surface resulting in small blockage of the membrane pores during the dcmd operation extracellular polymeric substances eps are released from the microalgae and microorganisms in the feed side it can enhance the adhesion of solids on the membrane surface leading to temperature polarization effects however the vapor flux proves that the fouling is relatively low when the vapor flux is constant throughout the continuous separation mode this may be due to the shear stress caused by the uniform and repetitive micro structures that can stimulate turbulence and reduce surface adhesion therefore the fouling rate of the membrane is greatly reduced under this condition the membrane can exhibit high and stable flux during 24 h continuous dcmd operation a very high water recovery of 95 2 was obtained at the end of the 24 h dcmd separation associated with low fouling rate and stable flux above 27 7 kg m2 h in contrast the surface printed membrane in the batch feed concentration mode showed a steady flux decline fig 2 grey dotted line which ultimately dropped by 47 9 the above results can be explained as the continuous increase in the concentration of inorganics organics suspended solids and microalgae on the feed side in the batch feed concentration mode in the process of nutrient recovery the concentration of the fish farm wastewater will be continuously enriched and saturated on the feed side this may cause the suspended solids colloids and microalgae to form larger solid clusters then it causes the organic matters and particulate matters to be deposited on the membrane surface therefore the blockage of the membrane pores hinders the mass transfer and exhibits a decrease in permeation flux as shown in fig 2 to reduce the deposition of impurities and organic matters on the membrane surface introducing turbulence flow on the feed side is one of the commonly used approaches 34 however when the flow becomes turbulence further increasing the flow rate may slightly increase the permeation flux but increase the risk of membrane wetting 35 therefore in this work the flow rate of 0 5 l min was used in the turbulence region re 2300 nonetheless the increase in feed concentration will also reduce the vapor pressure on the feed side thereby affecting the mass transfer of vapor to the cold permeate since the driving force of the md system is primarily based on the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane the vapor flux will be reduced in this study fig 2 the vapor driving force of the md system was reduced resulting in lower vapor permeability therefore the water recovery of this concentration mode is lower than that of the continuous separation mode reaching 80 1 24 h dcmd process taking into account these two factors fouling effects and concentration effects it is necessary to carefully re evaluate the effectiveness of the micro structures printed on the membrane surface in the batch feed concentration mode it is important to assess the dominance of these two factors which leads to a reduction in vapor flux in order to evaluate the fouling trend of the surface printed membrane in the batch feed concentration mode an initial feed volume of 4 l fish farm wastewater was used for 48 h of dcmd operation fig 3 red dots besides the surface printed membrane also treated fish farm wastewater with high nutrients and organic compositions in a concentration mode of md operation to further emphasize its wetting resistance which will be discussed later after the fish farm wastewater was operated in batch feed concentration mode for 24 h a new membrane was replaced in the md system using the fresh new membrane the concentrated fish farm wastewater continues to run for another 24 h the result of dcmd running for 48 h red dotted line in fig 3a proves that fouling is not the main factor leading to the reduction in flux the results in fig 3a showed that after dcmd has been running for 24 h the vapor permeation flux of the first surface printed membrane has decreased to 18 7 kg m2 h then replaced with a new surface printed membrane and continue the dcmd operation the initial vapor flux of the newly replaced membrane the 25th h of dcmd operation in fig 3a is reported as 19 7 kg m2 h this means that the difference in flux between the used membrane at the 24th h and the new membrane at the 25th h is only about 1 kg m2 h this interesting result indicates that even after 24 h of operation the fouling rate on the membrane is relatively low obviously the lower vapor flux is due to the decrease in feed vapor pressure during the entire feed concentration process md is a process that restricts the passage of non volatile components through the membrane by then the concentration of suspended solids microalgae and microorganism will be increased during the batch concentration process to withdraw clean water from the feed over time the concentration of nutrients and dissolved solids will slowly increase but the volume in the feed will steadily decrease similarly the reduction of feed vapor pressure will steadily reduce the vapor driving force of dcmd and produce a lower vapor flux interestingly in fig 3a the vapor permeation flux did not decrease sharply within 48 h of the batch feed concentration this means that the fouling on the membrane surface is minimal as shown in fig 3b the proportional relationship between suspended solids concentration and permeation flux is obtained by r2 0 9203 this relationship further verifies that the increase in suspended solids concentration is an important factor that gradually reduces the vapor permeation flux and is minimally affected by fouling in addition fig 3c and d also clearly show the significant difference in fish farm water before light green and after dark green brownish the concentration process at the same time the crystal clear solution condenses on the permeate side fig 4 shows the atr ftir spectrum of the fresh and fouled surface printed membranes after the batch feed concentration process a broad peak character in the wavenumber range of 3000 3500 cm 1 fig 4 blue shaded area represent the presence of o h groups derived from carbohydrates on the membrane surface 36 in addition the prominent peak at 3330 cm 1 is ascribed to the vibrational o h stretching of the residual water and the n h stretching of the amide in the protein the slightly stronger transmittance band at 1635 cm 1 and the weak transmission band at 1542 cm 1 are represented as amide i and amide ii from the protein respectively 37 low intensity but broad peak in the wavenumber range of 2800 3000 cm 1 fig 4 green shaded area and 1720 cm 1 indicate the existence of fatty acids 38 39 the weak peaks at 1035 and 1112 cm 1 which are associated to the bending vibration of o h indicates the presence of foulants related to polysaccharides 40 41 evidently eps extracted by microalgae and microorganisms in wastewater from fish farms are foulants attached to the surface of the membrane during the dcmd separation process the continuous heating and feed circulation process will generate high temperature and shear force which will destroy the cell wall of microalgae and excrete eps the adhesion of eps on the membrane surface enhances the accumulation of inorganics matter and suspended solids however there are fewer foulant peaks detected by atr ftir spectroscopy and more of them are very weak these results reflect that fouling occurred on the membrane during the dcmd separation process but the amount of foulants adhered to the membrane surface was very small at such a low fouling propensity there was no significant difference in the peak intensity on the membrane surface after 24 h and 48 h of water recovery from high concentration aquaculture solutions therefore the results further prove that the surface printed membrane has high fouling resistance even when operating under long dcmd duration and high concentration feed interestingly the membrane after dcmd separation showed serious fouling only in the outer area of the membrane surface spot a in fig 5 in contrast the central area spot b in fig 5 remains no or insignificant foulants adhered to the membrane surface this is because the inlet feed is perpendicular to the membrane surface as shown in the left image in fig 5 when the feed flows into the inlet and encounters a perpendicular bending direction along the membrane surface the flow will be twisted away from the bending axis the change in the perpendicular flow direction results in a sweeping action and creates flow recirculation loops in the module the flow rate of this circular loop will gradually decrease along the path thus it causes the flow velocity in the center area spot b to be higher than the flow velocity in the outer membrane area spot a the higher fluid dynamics in the central region of the membrane the coverage area of the inlet feed and outlet feed as shown in the image in fig 5 will result in higher shear stress therefore the adhesion of foulants is reduced and promotes less wetting of the area b consequently it will cause a smaller drop in the static water contact angle in area b as shown in fig 5 it is well known that a feed solution containing a high concentration of organic solutes will cause a decrease in the surface tension of the liquid membrane therefore it will transform a hydrophobic membrane into a hydrophilic membrane indeed after long term operation in the dcmd system the hydrophobicity of the surface printed membrane is also significantly reduced the static contact angles in fig 5 is decreased this lower water contact angle may be due to the deposition of hydrophilic polysaccharides and inorganic salts on the membrane surface 42 therefore the measured water contact angle of the outer area of the membrane surface area a is as low as 94 which is lower than the water contact angle of the fresh membrane although this peripheral area has been confirmed to be slightly fouled it still maintains a hydrophobicity above 90 in contrast the central area area b with less fouling on the membrane surface exhibits a higher water contact angle by maintaining its hydrophobicity as high as 121 permeation quality analysis is an effective method to evaluate membrane wettability when the membrane pores are wetted the salt can pass through the wetted pores from the feed side to the distillate side in table 3 the permeation conductivity and ions rejection indicated that no membrane wetting occurred during the batch feed concentration process during the 24 h and 48 h of dcmd separation the conductivity of the permeated water remained below 33 μs cm it is also worth noting that except for the 86 rejection of ammonia the rejection of all evaluated components are higher than 99 the low ammonia rejection can be attributed to the pervaporation of ammonia during the high operating temperature of dcmd ammonia can exist in two forms includes ionized ammonium nh4 ions or ammonia ammonia in vapor form is easily volatilized from the solution which depends on the concentration of the solution and the vapor pressure of ammonia which also depends on the feed temperature 43 it causes vaporized ammonia to pass through the membrane pores and condense in the permeate in addition to the high operating temperature of dcmd the ph of the aqueous feed also affects the formation of volatile ammonia the chemical equilibrium of ammonia and ammonium ions in the aqueous solution can be expressed as 6 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o the concentration of the hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion is closely related to the ph value of the solution and strongly affects the formation of vaporized ammonium few studies have shown that when the ph of the liquid is between 6 and 7 only a small amount of non volatile ammonium will be converted into volatile ammonia 44 45 since the conversion of ammonium ions in volatile ammonia gas can be transported across the membrane it will undoubtedly increase the conductivity of the permeate however it was found that the ph of the dcmd feed was close to ph 6 therefore only a small portion of the ammonia will be evaporated and the ammonia rejection will be kept above 86 the high rejection of inorganics no2 po4 3 k mg2 ca2 and na are obtained through the batch feed concentration mode because these components are non volatile although these components will not vaporize they have a tendency to cause scaling on the membrane surface some of these components especially the calcium and magnesium ions from calcium carbonate and magnesium chloride have reversible solubility in high temperature liquids therefore these crystalline solids will tend to nucleate 46 in the continuous concentration process the increasing feed concentration may cause more calcium and magnesium ion salts to form unwanted scale these salts will remain in the feed stream but due to the presence of eps they may adhere to the membrane surface in our previous study 28 the surface printed membrane after treatment of fish farm wastewater was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the results proved that the adhesion of calcium ions and magnesium ions on the surface printed membrane was very small after dcmd operation which may due to the eps excreted by microalgae according to the earlier discussion in figs 3 and 4 the membrane fouling in batch and continuous dcmd processes is minimal it proves the high feasibility of using the superhydrophobic surface printed membrane for simultaneous water reclamation and nutrient recovery in terms of reclaimed water permeated water must meet specific water discharge standards before it can be discharged into surrounding water bodies or recycled for aquaculture activities in the current work reference is made to the malaysia wastewater discharge standard 47 which is the standard a applicable to any water discharged into the catchment area for standard a the discharge limits of suspended solids and ammonia are 50 and 10 mg l respectively and the ph limit is 6 9 47 as shown in table 3 the water quality of aquaculture wastewater referring to the dcmd feed stream including its ph suspended solids and ammonia levels are all at the distressing level of the discharge limit however after the dcmd treatment there are fewer inorganic and organic compounds in the permeated water and most of the rejection reached more than 99 table 3 this means that no further treatment is required to purify the water at the permeate due to the low ions concentration in the permeate the water recovered from dcmd can be recycled back to the fish farm ponds as promising reuse water this work proposes zero discharged treatment of wastewater from fish farms in addition to the successful recovery of water in the permeate stream table 3 nutrient recovery in the feed retentate is also important ammonia phosphate and potassium are three crucial macronutrients in fertilizer the rejection of total ammonia phosphate and potassium in feed retentate is high and it can be used as concentrated liquid fertilizer as shown in fig 6 after 48 h of batch feed concentration approximately 86 3 of the fish farm wastewater has permeated to the cold side due to the high water recovery the initial vapor flux in fig 2 is 29 1 kg m2 h the concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium in the dcmd feed retentate has successfully achieved at least 5 times the initial concentration in the fish farm wastewater fig 6 by comparing with the molarity and dilution factor the predicted concentrations of ammonia phosphate and potassium based on the water recovery are slightly higher than that those obtained from experiments the variation in results may be due to several reasons as mentioned earlier the ammonium in the aqueous solution is easily evaporated and converted into volatile ammonia gas in dcmd operation volatile ammonia will be transported through the membrane pores thereby reducing the concentration in the feed stream unlike ammonia potassium is a non volatile inorganic substance that will not vaporize at high temperature however due to the amphiphilic protein derived from eps potassium may adhere to the membrane surface therefore the actual concentration found in the retentate feed is anticipated to be lower than the theoretical calculation phosphorus is another main component found in the fish farm wastewater and it also exists in the form of non volatile ions phosphate ions can combine with calcium or magnesium ions to form inorganic salts such as calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite which is a good source of plant phosphate fertilizer 48 in addition phosphorus may also form struvite mgnh4po4 h2o with magnesium and ammonium ions in fish farm wastewater 49 when the retentate feed is continuously concentrated by withdrawing clean water to the permeate side the growth of solid crystals can continue to form it promotes the accumulation of inorganics substances on the membrane surface by the excretion of eps from microalgae when phosphate adheres to the surface of the membrane it will undoubtedly reduce the amount of phosphate and potassium ions that can be concentrated it would be interesting if the concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium the three crucial macronutrients in fertilizers could be predicted based on the water recovery performance in dcmd it can be used to predict the nutrient content of liquid fertilizers concentrated from the aquaculture wastewater the nutrient content in aquaculture wastewater varies with the type of fish farming and cultivating technology as mentioned earlier in dcmd the water content in the feed fish farm wastewater is reduced but the nutrients will be mostly retained in the feed retentate since most of the rejection are over 99 table 3 the concentration of nutrients in the feed retentate can be correlated to the concept of dilution following this line of thought in this section a random wastewater from a fish farm is used as a basis for experiments to correlate the relationship between the concentration of nutrients ammonia phosphate and potassium and the water recovery in dcmd their relationships will be presented as an empirical equation to predict the nutrient concentration in the feed retentate based on the water recovery from dcmd as shown in fig 7 throughout the entire dcmd separation process the concentrations of ammonia phosphate and potassium were first measured experimentally then use an empirical equation to fit the data with an r2 value greater than 0 997 the empirical equations for ammonia phosphate and potassium obtained based on the dcmd water recovery are expressed as eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively 7 y 0 0002 x 3 0 01 x 2 0 2215 x 16 333 8 y 0 0002 x 3 0 0104 x 2 0 2401 x 18 9 y 0 0013 x 3 0 0935 x 2 2 2568 x 68 to validate and measure the effectiveness of the model an analysis of variance anova was performed and the results are shown in table 4 it is well known that a corresponding variable is significant if its p value is less than 0 05 50 the anova results in table 4 show low p values 0 00006 and high f values 1046 this means that the concentration models for ammonia phosphate and potassium are very significant the adjusted coefficient of determination radj 2 is used to assess the adequacy of the model and required a high correlation 0 9 between the experimental and predicted values 51 in this work the radj 2 of the models are higher than 0 996 in addition the coefficient of variation cv is a statistical measure used to compare the variations of two datasets for a good fit between the experimental values and the model results the cv should be less than 10 52 as shown in table 4 all found cvs are less than 6 with cvs for ammonia phosphate and potassium empirical models are 5 59 1 93 and 2 22 respectively the proposed empirical models with high radj 2 0 996 and low cv 10 are statistically valid and shows good predictions of ammonia phosphate and potassium concentrations at different water recovery percentage according to the concept of dilution when two solutions of the same volume are diluted with the same amount of water the concentration factor is the same regardless of their initial concentration likewise when the same amount of water is removed from the same volume of solution the concentration factor will also be the same in order to verify the applicability of the above empirical equations eqs 7 9 additional experiments were performed using fish farm wastewater with different initial nutrient concentrations the same amount of feed 2 l fish farm wastewater was used in this experiment the concept of dilution is applied to these empirical eqs 7 to 9 where concentration factors are introduced as shown in eqs 10 11 and 12 for ammonia phosphate and potassium 10 y 0 0002 x 3 0 01 x 2 0 2215 x 16 333 initial ammonia concentration 16 333 11 y 0 0002 x 3 0 0104 x 2 0 2401 x 18 initial phosphate concentration 18 12 y 0 0013 x 3 0 0935 x 2 2 2568 x 68 initial potassium concentration 68 combining the basis empirical eqs 7 to 9 and dilution factors the nutrient concentrations of different sources of fish farm wastewaters are predicted as shown in fig 8 it is found that under different water recovery of dcmd the experimentally determined nutrient concentrations are found similar to the predicted concentrations under different water recovery level the percentage error between the predicted concentration of each component and the experimental concentration is less than 10 these results support that the proposed empirical equation is suitable for predicting the nutrient content in the dcmd feed retentate based on the water recovery level regardless the initial nutrient concentration of the aquaculture wastewater the nutrient content of commercial liquid fertilizers varies greatly commercial liquid fertilizers are usually highly concentrated and need to be diluted before they can be used to grow plants table 5 summaries the nutrient composition of selected commercial liquid fertilizers diluted according to the recommended factor the content of npk is nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate and nitrite phosphorus in the form of phosphate and potassium which are the main nutrients in all tested liquid fertilizers npk nutrients are usually administered in higher concentrations followed by the secondary nutrients and micronutrients by using the superhydrophobic surface printed pvdf membrane it was found that the concentrated fish farm wastewater was compatible with the commercial liquid fertilizers table 5 it is worth noting that most commercial liquid fertilizers contain nitrogen in the form of nitrate no3 rather than ammonia nh3 n in contrast the concentrated fish farm wastewater shows large amounts of ammonia and traces of nitrate however nitrogen loss due to nitrate leaching is a common problem in soil cultivation which ammonia is not a problem 53 therefore by using ammonia as the main nitrogen content the concentrated fish farm wastewater shows its potential as a liquid fertilizer in addition most commercial liquid fertilizers mainly consist of only npk nutrients in fact calcium as a secondary nutrient is also an essential ingredient for plant growth it is an important component of the cell walls and useful in the production of new growth points and root tips 54 the presence of calcium provides elasticity and expansion of the cell walls thereby maintaining a more rigid growth point 55 compared with commercial liquid fertilizers the calcium content in the concentrated fish farm wastewater is much higher table 5 therefore it has the advantage of being a competitive liquid fertilizer 4 conclusion nylon taffeta templated pvdf membrane has been successfully implemented in md to treat wastewater from fish farms by using a nylon taffeta templated substrates the pvdf membrane with a uniformly distributed micro structures suppresses the superhydrophobicity benchmark by achieving a high water contact angle of 153 3 and an extremely low contact angle hysteresis of 8 4 the continuous dcmd separation of fish farm wastewater showed a very low flux reduction of 1 4 kg m2 h which indicates that there is no significant fouling and wetting on the membrane surface in batch feed concentration mode the nutrient concentration of the concentrated fish farm wastewater with a water recovery of 86 3 is five times higher than the initial concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium the dcmd concentration process provides a potential sustainable development for the aquaculture and agriculture sectors the by products or waste nutrients of aquaculture can be recovered by md to become a useful agriculture fertilizer although the ammonia rejection is not satisfactory only around 86 due to the high volatility of ammonia during the concentration of wastewater from fish farm the overall rejection for other components are higher than 99 the dcmd permeated water complies with the malaysia discharge standards which can be discharged to surrounding water bodies or recycled for fish farm activities in general the implementation of nylon taffeta templated pvdf membrane in the md process helps to achieve zero

13108,a large amount of aquaculture wastewater with high load of nutrients organic matter and microalgae will pollute receiving water body and needs to treat before discharge in this work membrane distillation md with the ability to avoid non volatile substances was used to purify water and simultaneously recover nutrients from aquaculture wastewater results showed that micro structures have evenly distributed on the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane using nylon taffeta substrate resultant membrane has surpassed superhydrophobicity benchmark it achieved high water contact angle of 153 3 and low contact angle hysteresis of 8 4 the continuous separation and treatment of fish farm wastewater showed a small and steady flux reduction of 1 4 kg m2 h indicating less fouling by the surface printed membrane in the batch process of feed concentration the water recovery reached 86 3 the retentate concentration of fish farm water is at least five times higher than initial concentration of ammonia 16 4 to 82 2 mg l phosphate 18 0 to 99 8 mg l and potassium 68 0 to 384 8 mg l this concentrated feed can use as primary nutrient of liquid fertilizer in feed concentration process except for ammonia 86 rejection of all selected inorganic substances is higher than 99 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nutrient recovery water management superhydrophobic membrane distillation liquid fertilizer 1 introduction aquaculture is the business of cultivating and farming freshwater marine food under controlled conditions it is one of the rapid growing food production industries in the world demonstrating the importance of this industry in food supply owing to the high consumption of fish products the aquaculture industry is developing in a more intensive manners 1 2 despite supplying food and generating income for local communities the aquaculture farming still bears a series of adverse environmental consequences this is because fish farming produces a large amount of wastewater containing high load of particulate organic matters and dissolved nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these substances are not suitable to discharge to the surrounding water causing pollution to the receiving water body 3 table 1 shows the main nutrients of aquaculture wastewater in different locations in addition the rapid expansion of aquaculture has a greater demand for water resources the water needs to be changed regularly to maintain the fish in the ponds healthy and to remove toxic fish metabolites excess algae and other wastes to prevent fish death 4 this leads to the need to treat a large amount of wastewater during and after the cultivation process therefore it is necessary to establish effective wastewater treatment before discharge and at the same time the nutrients dissolved in the wastewater can be recovered the ability of membrane distillation md to prevent non volatile substances from passing through the permeate side while purifying water 9 10 has shown its potential in treating fish farm wastewater nevertheless membrane fouling especially organic matter and biofouling is an issue that needs to be considered in the membrane separation process 11 12 generally md membranes have high hydrophobicity to prevent liquid from penetrating into the membrane pores 13 14 however the presence of organics microorganisms and microalgae in fish farm wastewater may deteriorate the performance of the membrane natural organic matter released by microalgae during md process especially extracellular polymeric substances eps may adhere to the membrane surface polysaccharides protein and fatty acid are the main components of eps these components are surface active compounds 15 16 which can trigger membrane fouling through precipitation and certain chemical bond interactions 17 18 the biofouling layer on the membrane surface will partially or completely block the membrane pores thereby the additional mass resistance restricts the diffusion and transport of water vapor to the liquid vapor interface eps with amphiphilic properties may reduce the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface and induce membrane wetting 19 in order to improve the efficiency of the md process fouling is an important issue that should be addressed several methods are introduced to control or reduce the fouling of the membrane surface in the md process most of the techniques are to alter the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface or modify the membrane surface such as coating low surface energy chemicals 20 or nanoparticles and plasma treatment 21 22 however these methods require additional chemicals cost and energy usage on the other hand surface patterning technique that physically modifies the surface structure of the membrane is an attractive alternative to mitigate or reduce the membrane fouling 23 the repetitive structure on the membrane surface stimulates higher turbulence thereby reducing the tendency to be fouled 24 kharraz et al 25 implemented hydrophobic patterned pvdf membrane and superhydrophobic alkaline treated patterned pvdf membrane with perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane coating to treat seawater in the md process both patterned pvdf membranes have demonstrated their ability to alleviate salt deposition and fouling in 113 h of dcmd to treat seawater in our previous studies 26 27 we synthesized pvdf membranes by casting the membranes directly on the template substrate the surface of the membrane was printed with repetitive micro structures in the study the membrane produced using a non woven template substrate shows a significant improvement in surface superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 156 and a sliding angle of 5 27 one of our previous works 28 investigated membrane surfaces printed with different surface topographies and used in the md process for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater we reported that the surface printed membranes were able to improve permeation flux in md operations with high organic and inorganic rejections however the feasibility of the surface printed membrane for continuous concentration of nutrients in aquaculture wastewater has not been established to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the application of surface printing membrane in the md process to concentrate nutrients in aquaculture wastewater concentrations of organics suspended solids and microalgae will gradually increase due to the continuous reduction of liquid on the feed side these substances in the complex aquaculture wastewater tend to adhere to the membrane surface causing membrane wetting in this context the ability of surface printed membrane to resist organics and biofouling in continuously concentrated aquaculture effluent needs to be investigated hereby in this work a physical modification method is used to synthesize membranes to treat the microalgae rich wastewater from fish farms the surface of superhydrophobic pvdf membrane with uniformly distributed micro structures is prepared using nylon taffeta templated substrate the main propose of this study is to concentrate fish farm wastewater and convert it into economically viable liquid fertilizer while at the same time producing clean permeate water for aquaculture activities meanwhile this study also evaluated the effectiveness of the md concentration process to treat microalgae rich wastewater from fish farms therefore the water quality of the feed retentate and permeate water are analyzed to determine the separation efficiency of md this study also investigated membrane fouling including organic matter deposition and the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface after the md process 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf powder from alfa aesar was used as the polymer n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent was purchased from sigma aldrich and ethanol elite advanced materials non solvent was utilized for membrane synthesis nylon taffeta fabric from the local market was obtained as a template substrate to produce micro structured pvdf membrane wastewater from the fish farm was collected from an inland catfish farm near sungai udang malaysia the water sample was collected from the surface of the pond and stored in a cold environment before used 2 2 membrane preparation the pvdf powder was dried overnight at 60 c in an oven to remove moisture prior to membrane casting dried pvdf powder was dissolved in nmp solvent and stirring was continued for 24 h after all the powder was completely dissolved the pvdf dope was sonicated at room temperature for an hour to remove excess air bubbles the polymer dope was cast on a nylon taffeta template substrate with a thickness of 400 μm the cast film with the substrate was immersed in an ethanol coagulation bath for 6 h and followed by water coagulation bath for 18 h the membrane was air dried at room temperature for 3 days before being peeled from the substrate 2 3 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd performance test the dcmd system comprises two continuous flow pumps a chiller a heater two flow meters a temperature monitoring system with sensors and a membrane module all pipes and fittings were insulated to reduce the heat released to the surroundings the wastewater collected from the fish farm was used as hot feed and 2 l of milli q deionized water on the cold side the recirculation flow rates of the hot feed and cold permeate were both set to 0 5 l min in counter current flow mode the hot feed tank was jacketed and the temperature was controlled at 60 c by a heater while the cold permeate temperature was connected to a chiller to maintain the temperature at 20 c the surface of the membrane with micro structure faces the hot feed and the active membrane area was 33 3 cm2 the dcmd performance test was divided into two operation modes continuous separation and batch feed concentration mode in the continuous separation mode the concentration and volume of the feed was kept constant throughout the separation process for the batch feed concentration mode the feed was concentrated and the volume was reduced by mass transfer to the permeate side 2 l and 4 l of fish farm wastewater was used as the initial feed volume and concentrated for 24 and 48 h respectively an online weighing balance and a conductivity meter were utilized to record the permeated

spots of the membrane were analyzed to compute the average membrane s porosity for water contact angle measurement a drop of water was dispensed on the membrane surface by an automatic liquid dispenser with a surface meter lauda surface analyzer 200 germany 10 random spots of the membrane were analyzed to obtain an average result based on the sessile drop method for interpreting the advancing contact angle water droplet on the membrane surface was slowly expanded from the initial volume of 5 μl to 20 μl at a rate of 0 25 μl s maximum contact angle on the three phase contact line solid air liquid was recorded as the advancing contact angle after that the water droplet was gradually withdrawing from 20 μl to 5 μl at the same rate of 0 25 μl s the receding contact angle was recorded as the minimum contact angle between the water droplet and the membrane surface measurement for both advancing and receding contact angles was repeated for at least 10 random spots to compute an average result by using the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 800 carl zeiss germany the surface roughness and micro scaled structures of the membrane sample was identified thermo scientific fourier transform infrared spectrometer attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir nicolet is10 usa was employed to characterize the key structural features of fresh and fouled membranes the spectra were acquired from 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 using a diamond crystal over a wavenumber range of 600 to 4000 cm 1 calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k elements in the fish farm wastewater every 6 h for the batch feed concentration mode and the dcmd permeate were analyzed using the atomic absorption spectroscopy aas shimadzu aa 6650 spectrometer japan with air acetylene flame at the wavelength of 422 7 285 2 589 and 766 5 nm respectively the total ammonia nh3 n nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and phosphate po4 contents in fish farm wastewater every 6 h for the batch feed concentration mode and the dcmd permeate were measured by a portable photometer lovibond maxi direct tintometer germany the quantity of microalgae was determined by a hemocytometer with an optical microscope and correlated it with the absorbance at 600 nm by an uv vis spectrophotometer carry 60 agilent the total suspended solids in the fish farm wastewater were tested based on the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss method 30 50 ml of fish farm wastewater was first filtered through a weighed standard glass fiber filter disk whatman gf c 1 2 μm the residue

filter m2 is the total weight of the solid residue and glass fiber filter and v is the volume of fish farm wastewater for filtration 3 results and discussion in this work a pvdf membrane with a highly ordered micro structures is essential to increase the superhydrophobicity of the membrane while preventing fouling induced wetting during dcmd separation as shown in fig 1 the membrane cast on the nylon taffeta template substrate has successfully printed even and repetitive micro structures on the surface fig 1a the tiny and interconnected globules are detected by the high magnification surface image fig 1a insert small image fibril like linkage bridges are observed between the globules which resulted in a bi continuous membrane structure it is precisely because the membrane is immersed in the ethanol coagulation bath that triggered a slow exchange rate between the solvent and the non solvent 28 the slow phase inversion process promotes the formation of small globules fig 1b resulting in nano scale roughness on the membrane the combination of micro scale and nano scale asperities enables a large amount of air layer to be trapped on the membrane surface during the sessile drop measurement a higher static water contact angle of 153 3 is achieved table 2 one of the reasons is due to its surface roughness in our previous study 27 the root mean square surface roughness ra of the non printed membrane solidified in an ethanol coagulation bath was 2 3 μm due to the existence of nano scale globules the non printed membrane can achieve a high static water contact angle of 134 but unable to achieve the superhydrophobic properties water contact angle exceeding 150 in the case of using nylon taffeta template to print micro grooves on the surface of the membrane the ra of the membrane is significantly improved with ra of 4 54 μm table 2 interestingly the improvement of the membrane surface roughness is contributed by the even and repetitive surface waviness profile fig 1c rather than the random heterogeneous roughness profile in fact air bubbles can be trapped in this uniform waviness microgrooves and form a repelling layer reducing the actual contact area between water and the membrane surface therefore it restricts the penetration of water into the membrane pores and keeps it staying as a spherical droplet on the rough membrane surface high surface roughness is essential for the construction of superhydrophobic membranes nonetheless high surface roughness does not necessarily reduce the adhesion between water and the membrane surface a membrane with a high static contact angle can promote a high dynamic advancing contact angle however it may also reduce the dynamic receding contact angle this is because the resulting roughness may promote the pinning effect of the droplets and cause continuous contact lines between the asperities 31 for superhydrophobic membrane water droplets are designed to be able to glide spontaneously on the membrane surface with no or very low contact angle hysteresis less than 10 32 as mentioned earlier the uniform and repetitive surface waviness profile on the membrane surface will cause the water to be unable to wet or reach the membrane surface area resulting in a large amount of air trapped beneath the droplets therefore it helps to form a slippery membrane surface with high dynamic advancing and receding contact angles of 154 6 and 146 2 respectively table 2 by comparing these two dynamic contact angles the low contact angle hysteresis of 8 6 indicates that the water droplets are supported by air bubbles trapped between the microgrooves therefore created a surface with very low liquid solid adhesion this result is supported by the homogeneous surface waviness fig 1c similar height of micro valleys which allows water droplet to glide on the membrane surface with very low pinning forces when water droplets roll off the surface less energy is required to overcome frictional barrier on the membrane surface in this work the adhesive force between the printed surface and the water droplets is extremely low resulting in a low sliding contact angle as low as 8 9 in addition the surface printed membrane also achieves a high porosity of 83 3 which provides more available open pore channels for vapor diffusion it is no doubt that the lower mass transfer resistance in the membrane will give an advantage to obtain a higher vapor flux in the dcmd for example the membrane resistances of commercial pvdf membrane porosity 64 33 and non surface printed pvdf membrane porosity 80 8 in previous study 28 were estimated to be 769 4 and 587 1 pa m2 h kg respectively meanwhile the membrane resistance of the surface printed membrane with 83 3 porosity in this work is 387 2 pa m2 h kg which is relatively lower than that of commercial and non surface printed pvdf membranes this difference emphasizes the benefits of membrane with higher porosity calculations of membrane resistance are included in the supplementary document in this work the surface printed membrane has undergone two operating modes of dcmd separation i e continuous separation mode and batch feed concentration mode fig 2 displays the permeate flux results for a 24 h dcmd separation in the first hour both operating modes showed similar vapor permeation flux of 29 1 kg m2 h this result portraits the production consistency of the surface printed membrane which has almost the same initial vapor permeation flux when fed with the same source of fish farm wastewater under the same separation conditions feed flow rate feed composition and feed temperature and using the same pvdf membrane the temperature polarization effect is expected to be the same for md continuous and batch separation modes in this work the temperature polarization coefficient was calculated to be 0 69 the calculation is included in the supplementary document when the dcmd separation process went further the two operating modes displayed two completely different separation performance trends in the continuous separation mode there is a stable vapor permeation flux fig 2 blue dotted line and a slight decrease is observed after 24 h of separation from 29 1 kg m2 h reduced by 4 8 to 27 7 kg m2 h the decrease in vapor permeation flux may be due to the adhesion of organic and inorganic foulants on the membrane surface resulting in small blockage of the membrane pores during the dcmd operation extracellular polymeric substances eps are released from the microalgae and microorganisms in the feed side it can enhance the adhesion of solids on the membrane surface leading to temperature polarization effects however the vapor flux proves that the fouling is relatively low when the vapor flux is constant throughout the continuous separation mode this may be due to the shear stress caused by the uniform and repetitive micro structures that can stimulate turbulence and reduce surface adhesion therefore the fouling rate of the membrane is greatly reduced under this condition the membrane can exhibit high and stable flux during 24 h continuous dcmd operation a very high water recovery of 95 2 was obtained at the end of the 24 h dcmd separation associated with low fouling rate and stable flux above 27 7 kg m2 h in contrast the surface printed membrane in the batch feed concentration mode showed a steady flux decline fig 2 grey dotted line which ultimately dropped by 47 9 the above results can be explained as the continuous increase in the concentration of inorganics organics suspended solids and microalgae on the feed side in the batch feed concentration mode in the process of nutrient recovery the concentration of the fish farm wastewater will be continuously enriched and saturated on the feed side this may cause the suspended solids colloids and microalgae to form larger solid clusters then it causes the organic matters and particulate matters to be deposited on the membrane surface therefore the blockage of the membrane pores hinders the mass transfer and exhibits a decrease in permeation flux as shown in fig 2 to reduce the deposition of impurities and organic matters on the membrane surface introducing turbulence flow on the feed side is one of the commonly used approaches 34 however when the flow becomes turbulence further increasing the flow rate may slightly increase the permeation flux but increase the risk of membrane wetting 35 therefore in this work the flow rate of 0 5 l min was used in the turbulence region re 2300 nonetheless the increase in feed concentration will also reduce the vapor pressure on the feed side thereby affecting the mass transfer of vapor to the cold permeate since the driving force of the md system is primarily based on the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane the vapor flux will be reduced in this study fig 2 the vapor driving force of the md system was reduced resulting in lower vapor permeability therefore the water recovery of this concentration mode is lower than that of the continuous separation mode reaching 80 1 24 h dcmd process taking into account these two factors fouling effects and concentration effects it is necessary to carefully re evaluate the effectiveness of the micro structures printed on the membrane surface in the batch feed concentration mode it is important to assess the dominance of these two factors which leads to a reduction in vapor flux in order to evaluate the fouling trend of the surface printed membrane in the batch feed concentration mode an initial feed volume of 4 l fish farm wastewater was used for 48 h of dcmd operation fig 3 red dots besides the surface printed membrane also treated fish farm wastewater with high nutrients and organic compositions in a concentration mode of md operation to further emphasize its wetting resistance which will be discussed later after the fish farm wastewater was operated in batch feed concentration mode for 24 h a new membrane was replaced in the md system using the fresh new membrane the concentrated fish farm wastewater continues to run for another 24 h the result of dcmd running for 48 h red dotted line in fig 3a proves that fouling is not the main factor leading to the reduction in flux the results in fig 3a showed that after dcmd has been running for 24 h the vapor permeation flux of the first surface printed membrane has decreased to 18 7 kg m2 h then replaced with a new surface printed membrane and continue the dcmd operation the initial vapor flux of the newly replaced membrane the 25th h of dcmd operation in fig 3a is reported as 19 7 kg m2 h this means that the difference in flux between the used membrane at the 24th h and the new membrane at the 25th h is only about 1 kg m2 h this interesting result indicates that even after 24 h of operation the fouling rate on the membrane is relatively low obviously the lower vapor flux is due to the decrease in feed vapor pressure during the entire feed concentration process md is a process that restricts the passage of non volatile components through the membrane by then the concentration of suspended solids microalgae and microorganism will be increased during the batch concentration process to withdraw clean water from the feed over time the concentration of nutrients and dissolved solids will slowly increase but the volume in the feed will steadily decrease similarly the reduction of feed vapor pressure will steadily reduce the vapor driving force of dcmd and produce a lower vapor flux interestingly in fig 3a the vapor permeation flux did not decrease sharply within 48 h of the batch feed concentration this means that the fouling on the membrane surface is minimal as shown in fig 3b the proportional relationship between suspended solids concentration and permeation flux is obtained by r2 0 9203 this relationship further verifies that the increase in suspended solids concentration is an important factor that gradually reduces the vapor permeation flux and is minimally affected by fouling in addition fig 3c and d also clearly show the significant difference in fish farm water before light green and after dark green brownish the concentration process at the same time the crystal clear solution condenses on the permeate side fig 4 shows the atr ftir spectrum of the fresh and fouled surface printed membranes after the batch feed concentration process a broad peak character in the wavenumber range of 3000 3500 cm 1 fig 4 blue shaded area represent the presence of o h groups derived from carbohydrates on the membrane surface 36 in addition the prominent peak at 3330 cm 1 is ascribed to the vibrational o h stretching of the residual water and the n h stretching of the amide in the protein the slightly stronger transmittance band at 1635 cm 1 and the weak transmission band at 1542 cm 1 are represented as amide i and amide ii from the protein respectively 37 low intensity but broad peak in the wavenumber range of 2800 3000 cm 1 fig 4 green shaded area and 1720 cm 1 indicate the existence of fatty acids 38 39 the weak peaks at 1035 and 1112 cm 1 which are associated to the bending vibration of o h indicates the presence of foulants related to polysaccharides 40 41 evidently eps extracted by microalgae and microorganisms in wastewater from fish farms are foulants attached to the surface of the membrane during the dcmd separation process the continuous heating and feed circulation process will generate high temperature and shear force which will destroy the cell wall of microalgae and excrete eps the adhesion of eps on the membrane surface enhances the accumulation of inorganics matter and suspended solids however there are fewer foulant peaks detected by atr ftir spectroscopy and more of them are very weak these results reflect that fouling occurred on the membrane during the dcmd separation process but the amount of foulants adhered to the membrane surface was very small at such a low fouling propensity there was no significant difference in the peak intensity on the membrane surface after 24 h and 48 h of water recovery from high concentration aquaculture solutions therefore the results further prove that the surface printed membrane has high fouling resistance even when operating under long dcmd duration and high concentration feed interestingly the membrane after dcmd separation showed serious fouling only in the outer area of the membrane surface spot a in fig 5 in contrast the central area spot b in fig 5 remains no or insignificant foulants adhered to the membrane surface this is because the inlet feed is perpendicular to the membrane surface as shown in the left image in fig 5 when the feed flows into the inlet and encounters a perpendicular bending direction along the membrane surface the flow will be twisted away from the bending axis the change in the perpendicular flow direction results in a sweeping action and creates flow recirculation loops in the module the flow rate of this circular loop will gradually decrease along the path thus it causes the flow velocity in the center area spot b to be higher than the flow velocity in the outer membrane area spot a the higher fluid dynamics in the central region of the membrane the coverage area of the inlet feed and outlet feed as shown in the image in fig 5 will result in higher shear stress therefore the adhesion of foulants is reduced and promotes less wetting of the area b consequently it will cause a smaller drop in the static water contact angle in area b as shown in fig 5 it is well known that a feed solution containing a high concentration of organic solutes will cause a decrease in the surface tension of the liquid membrane therefore it will transform a hydrophobic membrane into a hydrophilic membrane indeed after long term operation in the dcmd system the hydrophobicity of the surface printed membrane is also significantly reduced the static contact angles in fig 5 is decreased this lower water contact angle may be due to the deposition of hydrophilic polysaccharides and inorganic salts on the membrane surface 42 therefore the measured water contact angle of the outer area of the membrane surface area a is as low as 94 which is lower than the water contact angle of the fresh membrane although this peripheral area has been confirmed to be slightly fouled it still maintains a hydrophobicity above 90 in contrast the central area area b with less fouling on the membrane surface exhibits a higher water contact angle by maintaining its hydrophobicity as high as 121 permeation quality analysis is an effective method to evaluate membrane wettability when the membrane pores are wetted the salt can pass through the wetted pores from the feed side to the distillate side in table 3 the permeation conductivity and ions rejection indicated that no membrane wetting occurred during the batch feed concentration process during the 24 h and 48 h of dcmd separation the conductivity of the permeated water remained below 33 μs cm it is also worth noting that except for the 86 rejection of ammonia the rejection of all evaluated components are higher than 99 the low ammonia rejection can be attributed to the pervaporation of ammonia during the high operating temperature of dcmd ammonia can exist in two forms includes ionized ammonium nh4 ions or ammonia ammonia in vapor form is easily volatilized from the solution which depends on the concentration of the solution and the vapor pressure of ammonia which also depends on the feed temperature 43 it causes vaporized ammonia to pass through the membrane pores and condense in the permeate in addition to the high operating temperature of dcmd the ph of the aqueous feed also affects the formation of volatile ammonia the chemical equilibrium of ammonia and ammonium ions in the aqueous solution can be expressed as 6 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o the concentration of the hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion is closely related to the ph value of the solution and strongly affects the formation of vaporized ammonium few studies have shown that when the ph of the liquid is between 6 and 7 only a small amount of non volatile ammonium will be converted into volatile ammonia 44 45 since the conversion of ammonium ions in volatile ammonia gas can be transported across the membrane it will undoubtedly increase the conductivity of the permeate however it was found that the ph of the dcmd feed was close to ph 6 therefore only a small portion of the ammonia will be evaporated and the ammonia rejection will be kept above 86 the high rejection of inorganics no2 po4 3 k mg2 ca2 and na are obtained through the batch feed concentration mode because these components are non volatile although these components will not vaporize they have a tendency to cause scaling on the membrane surface some of these components especially the calcium and magnesium ions from calcium carbonate and magnesium chloride have reversible solubility in high temperature liquids therefore these crystalline solids will tend to nucleate 46 in the continuous concentration process the increasing feed concentration may cause more calcium and magnesium ion salts to form unwanted scale these salts will remain in the feed stream but due to the presence of eps they may adhere to the membrane surface in our previous study 28 the surface printed membrane after treatment of fish farm wastewater was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the results proved that the adhesion of calcium ions and magnesium ions on the surface printed membrane was very small after dcmd operation which may due to the eps excreted by microalgae according to the earlier discussion in figs 3 and 4 the membrane fouling in batch and continuous dcmd processes is minimal it proves the high feasibility of using the superhydrophobic surface printed membrane for simultaneous water reclamation and nutrient recovery in terms of reclaimed water permeated water must meet specific water discharge standards before it can be discharged into surrounding water bodies or recycled for aquaculture activities in the current work reference is made to the malaysia wastewater discharge standard 47 which is the standard a applicable to any water discharged into the catchment area for standard a the discharge limits of suspended solids and ammonia are 50 and 10 mg l respectively and the ph limit is 6 9 47 as shown in table 3 the water quality of aquaculture wastewater referring to the dcmd feed stream including its ph suspended solids and ammonia levels are all at the distressing level of the discharge limit however after the dcmd treatment there are fewer inorganic and organic compounds in the permeated water and most of the rejection reached more than 99 table 3 this means that no further treatment is required to purify the water at the permeate due to the low ions concentration in the permeate the water recovered from dcmd can be recycled back to the fish farm ponds as promising reuse water this work proposes zero discharged treatment of wastewater from fish farms in addition to the successful recovery of water in the permeate stream table 3 nutrient recovery in the feed retentate is also important ammonia phosphate and potassium are three crucial macronutrients in fertilizer the rejection of total ammonia phosphate and potassium in feed retentate is high and it can be used as concentrated liquid fertilizer as shown in fig 6 after 48 h of batch feed concentration approximately 86 3 of the fish farm wastewater has permeated to the cold side due to the high water recovery the initial vapor flux in fig 2 is 29 1 kg m2 h the concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium in the dcmd feed retentate has successfully achieved at least 5 times the initial concentration in the fish farm wastewater fig 6 by comparing with the molarity and dilution factor the predicted concentrations of ammonia phosphate and potassium based on the water recovery are slightly higher than that those obtained from experiments the variation in results may be due to several reasons as mentioned earlier the ammonium in the aqueous solution is easily evaporated and converted into volatile ammonia gas in dcmd operation volatile ammonia will be transported through the membrane pores thereby reducing the concentration in the feed stream unlike ammonia potassium is a non volatile inorganic substance that will not vaporize at high temperature however due to the amphiphilic protein derived from eps potassium may adhere to the membrane surface therefore the actual concentration found in the retentate feed is anticipated to be lower than the theoretical calculation phosphorus is another main component found in the fish farm wastewater and it also exists in the form of non volatile ions phosphate ions can combine with calcium or magnesium ions to form inorganic salts such as calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite which is a good source of plant phosphate fertilizer 48 in addition phosphorus may also form struvite mgnh4po4 h2o with magnesium and ammonium ions in fish farm wastewater 49 when the retentate feed is continuously concentrated by withdrawing clean water to the permeate side the growth of solid crystals can continue to form it promotes the accumulation of inorganics substances on the membrane surface by the excretion of eps from microalgae when phosphate adheres to the surface of the membrane it will undoubtedly reduce the amount of phosphate and potassium ions that can be concentrated it would be interesting if the concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium the three crucial macronutrients in fertilizers could be predicted based on the water recovery performance in dcmd it can be used to predict the nutrient content of liquid fertilizers concentrated from the aquaculture wastewater the nutrient content in aquaculture wastewater varies with the type of fish farming and cultivating technology as mentioned earlier in dcmd the water content in the feed fish farm wastewater is reduced but the nutrients will be mostly retained in the feed retentate since most of the rejection are over 99 table 3 the concentration of nutrients in the feed retentate can be correlated to the concept of dilution following this line of thought in this section a random wastewater from a fish farm is used as a basis for experiments to correlate the relationship between the concentration of nutrients ammonia phosphate and potassium and the water recovery in dcmd their relationships will be presented as an empirical equation to predict the nutrient concentration in the feed retentate based on the water recovery from dcmd as shown in fig 7 throughout the entire dcmd separation process the concentrations of ammonia phosphate and potassium were first measured experimentally then use an empirical equation to fit the data with an r2 value greater than 0 997 the empirical equations for ammonia phosphate and potassium obtained based on the dcmd water recovery are expressed as eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively 7 y 0 0002 x 3 0 01 x 2 0 2215 x 16 333 8 y 0 0002 x 3 0 0104 x 2 0 2401 x 18 9 y 0 0013 x 3 0 0935 x 2 2 2568 x 68 to validate and measure the effectiveness of the model an analysis of variance anova was performed and the results are shown in table 4 it is well known that a corresponding variable is significant if its p value is less than 0 05 50 the anova results in table 4 show low p values 0 00006 and high f values 1046 this means that the concentration models for ammonia phosphate and potassium are very significant the adjusted coefficient of determination radj 2 is used to assess the adequacy of the model and required a high correlation 0 9 between the experimental and predicted values 51 in this work the radj 2 of the models are higher than 0 996 in addition the coefficient of variation cv is a statistical measure used to compare the variations of two datasets for a good fit between the experimental values and the model results the cv should be less than 10 52 as shown in table 4 all found cvs are less than 6 with cvs for ammonia phosphate and potassium empirical models are 5 59 1 93 and 2 22 respectively the proposed empirical models with high radj 2 0 996 and low cv 10 are statistically valid and shows good predictions of ammonia phosphate and potassium concentrations at different water recovery percentage according to the concept of dilution when two solutions of the same volume are diluted with the same amount of water the concentration factor is the same regardless of their initial concentration likewise when the same amount of water is removed from the same volume of solution the concentration factor will also be the same in order to verify the applicability of the above empirical equations eqs 7 9 additional experiments were performed using fish farm wastewater with different initial nutrient concentrations the same amount of feed 2 l fish farm wastewater was used in this experiment the concept of dilution is applied to these empirical eqs 7 to 9 where concentration factors are introduced as shown in eqs 10 11 and 12 for ammonia phosphate and potassium 10 y 0 0002 x 3 0 01 x 2 0 2215 x 16 333 initial ammonia concentration 16 333 11 y 0 0002 x 3 0 0104 x 2 0 2401 x 18 initial phosphate concentration 18 12 y 0 0013 x 3 0 0935 x 2 2 2568 x 68 initial potassium concentration 68 combining the basis empirical eqs 7 to 9 and dilution factors the nutrient concentrations of different sources of fish farm wastewaters are predicted as shown in fig 8 it is found that under different water recovery of dcmd the experimentally determined nutrient concentrations are found similar to the predicted concentrations under different water recovery level the percentage error between the predicted concentration of each component and the experimental concentration is less than 10 these results support that the proposed empirical equation is suitable for predicting the nutrient content in the dcmd feed retentate based on the water recovery level regardless the initial nutrient concentration of the aquaculture wastewater the nutrient content of commercial liquid fertilizers varies greatly commercial liquid fertilizers are usually highly concentrated and need to be diluted before they can be used to grow plants table 5 summaries the nutrient composition of selected commercial liquid fertilizers diluted according to the recommended factor the content of npk is nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate and nitrite phosphorus in the form of phosphate and potassium which are the main nutrients in all tested liquid fertilizers npk nutrients are usually administered in higher concentrations followed by the secondary nutrients and micronutrients by using the superhydrophobic surface printed pvdf membrane it was found that the concentrated fish farm wastewater was compatible with the commercial liquid fertilizers table 5 it is worth noting that most commercial liquid fertilizers contain nitrogen in the form of nitrate no3 rather than ammonia nh3 n in contrast the concentrated fish farm wastewater shows large amounts of ammonia and traces of nitrate however nitrogen loss due to nitrate leaching is a common problem in soil cultivation which ammonia is not a problem 53 therefore by using ammonia as the main nitrogen content the concentrated fish farm wastewater shows its potential as a liquid fertilizer in addition most commercial liquid fertilizers mainly consist of only npk nutrients in fact calcium as a secondary nutrient is also an essential ingredient for plant growth it is an important component of the cell walls and useful in the production of new growth points and root tips 54 the presence of calcium provides elasticity and expansion of the cell walls thereby maintaining a more rigid growth point 55 compared with commercial liquid fertilizers the calcium content in the concentrated fish farm wastewater is much higher table 5 therefore it has the advantage of being a competitive liquid fertilizer 4 conclusion nylon taffeta templated pvdf membrane has been successfully implemented in md to treat wastewater from fish farms by using a nylon taffeta templated substrates the pvdf membrane with a uniformly distributed micro structures suppresses the superhydrophobicity benchmark by achieving a high water contact angle of 153 3 and an extremely low contact angle hysteresis of 8 4 the continuous dcmd separation of fish farm wastewater showed a very low flux reduction of 1 4 kg m2 h which indicates that there is no significant fouling and wetting on the membrane surface in batch feed concentration mode the nutrient concentration of the concentrated fish farm wastewater with a water recovery of 86 3 is five times higher than the initial concentration of ammonia phosphate and potassium the dcmd concentration process provides a potential sustainable development for the aquaculture and agriculture sectors the by products or waste nutrients of aquaculture can be recovered by md to become a useful agriculture fertilizer although the ammonia rejection is not satisfactory only around 86 due to the high volatility of ammonia during the concentration of wastewater from fish farm the overall rejection for other components are higher than 99 the dcmd permeated water complies with the malaysia discharge standards which can be discharged to surrounding water bodies or recycled for fish farm activities in general the implementation of nylon taffeta templated pvdf membrane in the md process helps to achieve zero

13109,a biofilm electrode system bes which is the combination of a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell mfc cw with a biofilm electrode reactor ber was used to treat wastewater that contained sulfamethoxazole for three months the variation in the microbial community including the microbial diversity was explored furthermore the key operating factors were identified and the sul genes harboring host bacteria were revealed the results demonstrated that the species richness in the ber was greater than in the mfc cw but the shannon index was susceptible to the run time the beta diversity showed that the species composition similarity was primarily clustered according to the position of the bes and then according to the run time in addition the principal axis analysis showed that the species composition similarity of the mfc cw was closer to that of the control sample both the ber and mfc cw were significantly correlated with the voltage and smx concentration p 0 01 at the same correlation level 0 25 0 5 there were 39 phyla during the entire operational period and the top 9 were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi chlorobi acidobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria nitrospirae and planctomysete the potential host bacteria of the sul genes such as lentisphaerae firmicutes proteobacteria and fusobacteria in the ber and chlorobi caldiserica nitrospirae actinobacteria and planctomycetes in the mfc cw were obtained using a procrustes analysis keywords microbial fuel cell biofilm electrode antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic microbial communities 1 introduction the ubiquitous usage of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has contributed to the entry of antibiotics into the environment particularly receiving waters this promotes the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb and the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args among bacteria 1 5 widespread antibiotic resistance is killing more than 700 000 people around the world every year posing a growing threat to human health 6 therefore it is imperative to eliminate antibiotics in wastewater and minimize the emergence of arb and args in the natural environment sulfamethoxazole smx is a broad spectrum sulfonamide antibiotic that has been widely used in humans aquaculture and animal husbandry for treating infection 7 8 conventional biological wastewater treatment processes fail to eliminate smx due to its biotoxicity and recalcitrance and this results in frequent detections of smx in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps 9 10 as a promising alternative bioelectrochemical systems bess that utilize the biocatalyzed electrode reaction can significantly enhance the degradation of antibiotics 11 moreover bess generate less sludge 12 and this will decrease the spread of arb and args during the process of sludge disposal 13 15 bess primarily consist of biofilm electrode reactors bers and microbial fuel cells mfcs bers use a biocathode with applied voltage that serves as an extracellular electron donor to reduce refractory pollutants such as nitroaromatic and azo dye 16 17 mfcs use microorganisms for oxidizing organic matter and generating electrical power 18 19 efficient antibiotic removal has been achieved by bers 15 20 and mfcs 21 it has been proposed that the enhanced removal performance of bes was attributed to the stimulated microbial activity and the accelerated formation of biofilm under electric voltage 22 a constructed wetland cw a cost effective technology for wastewater treatment was recently assembled to microbial fuel cell mfc to treat refractory wastewater as well to generate electricity 23 24 the cw coupled mfcs mfc cw have been reported to have achieved high antibiotic removal efficiencies this is achieved by a complex combination of biological metabolism physical adsorption and electrochemical oxidation reduction 25 26 in view of the complementary power pattern of a ber requires external power with an mfc cw generates electricity and their good smx removal performance integrating a ber and mfc cw could reduce the energy consumption and implement in depth treatment of wastewater the electricity generated by an mfc cw could power the ber and the residual antibiotics in the effluent of the ber could be further degraded in the mfc cw previous studies have shown that the assembly of a ber and an mfc cw achieved a credible smx removal performance 27 28 where the smx was degraded into less toxic and biodegradable by products 28 microorganisms are fundamental to the performance and stability of bioelectricity generation and antibiotic removal in a bes 29 the predominant microbes including bacteria and methanogens might be directly related to antibiotic biodegradation and arg abundances 30 the properties of wastewater such as antibiotics and organics impact the microbial community and the fate of args 13 until now the functional microorganisms that contribute to smx removal have remained poorly understood 31 in addition the effect of the operational condition on the composition of the microbial community requires further study and this is important for the optimization of an operating system to clarify this uncertainty the microbial communities in the ber mfc cws under various operational conditions are analyzed using 16s rrna high throughput gene sequencing and the microbial communities are then related to the smx removal efficiency and the occurrence of args a further understanding the functional microbial communities is conducive for the rapid development of bess to treat antibiotic containing wastewaters which remains a huge challenge for the effective control of arb and args 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup following zhang et al 28 the ber mfc cws which integrated a ber and an mfc cw were constructed to investigate the effect of the smx concentration and hydraulic reaction time hrt on the removal of smx and the fate of args the bers were 300 mm in height and 150 mm in internal diameter with an effective working volume of 4 l a graphite rod with a diameter of 20 mm and a length of 240 mm was used as the anode and stainless steel covered with microbial biomass was the biocathode in the ber the mfc cws with a working volume of 4 l were constructed with a height of 320 mm and a diameter of 190 mm the cathode and anode of the mfc cws were composed of granular activated carbon gac grain size of 3 mm to 5 mm specific surface area of 500 900 m2 g and a packing density of 0 45 0 55 g cm3 and a stainless steel wire mesh ssm 304 ss wire diameter of 0 42 mm pore size of 1 70 mm and 12 eyes these were placed in the upper portion and the bottom of the mfc cws all of the anode and cathode materials were pretreated as described in a previous study 32 anaerobic sludge 60 g mlss l was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant nanjing china and used as the inoculum synthetic wastewater with 2 4 mg l smx sigma aldrich co ltd china was continuously fed into the reactors by peristaltic pumps bt100 2j longer precision pump co ltd china the synthetic wastewater was composed of in g l glucose 0 225 nh4cl 0 020 nacl 0 150 kh2po4 0 004 cacl2 0 003 mgso4 7h2o 0 003 sinopharm china and a trace element solution of 0 2 ml l 33 2 2 experimental design and biomass sampling to evaluate the effects of the smx concentration power pattern and hydraulic retention time hrt on shaping the microbial communities of the ber mfc cws two sets of systems were established under room temperature the detailed experimental design is shown in table 1 in system 1 four ber mfc cws each composed of a ber and a mfc cw were established to investigate the effect of the smx concentration 2 and 4 mg l and the power pattern bioelectricity and direct voltage the output current of two of the mfc cws with the same influent smx were coupled and supplied to one of the ber designated as bioelectricity as shown in fig 1 while the other ber was powered by a power supply lp3003d shenzhen lodestar s t co ltd china with a voltage of 1000 mv designated as direct electricity the hrt was maintained at 60 h for both the bers and the mfc cws in system 2 two ber mfc cws each composed of a ber and two mfc cw were established to investigate the effect of the hrt fig 1 the ber was powered by the electricity generated by the two mfc cws and the effluent of the ber was equally divided to the two mfc cws the hrts were set to 16 and 8 h for the bers which corresponded to an hrt of 32 and 16 h for the stacked mfc cws the smx concentration of the influent of the bers in system 2 was maintained at 4 mg l as the cathode and the anode of the mfc cw were located in the upper portion and deep zone of the wetland they clearly had different redox potentials due to the availability of oxygen 34 therefore both biomass from the anode and cathode layer of the mfc cw were utilized for the community analysis biomass samples of 5 g were collected from the ber and the anode layer and cathode layer of each ber mfc cw were collected at the end of the operation for further dna extractions for the mfc cws in system 2 biomass samples were collected from only one of them because two of them were operated in parallel 2 3 dna extraction qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial communities shaped in the ber mfc cws were investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 35 36 the genomic dna of the samples 1 g was extracted using the fast dna spin kit for soil mobio carlsbad ca usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions sulfonamide resistance has been identified as arising from the acquisition of dihydropteroate synthase genes 37 and these include three different types namely sul1 sul2 and sul3 sul genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 and the universal bacterial 16s rrna genes for the total bacteria were quantified using the pcr system bio rad shanghai china the details of the qpcr process can be found in a previous study 28 for the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the universal primers 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes of both the bacteria and archaea domains were used sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq 2500 illumina usa at majorbio producing 2 250 bp paired end reads 2 4 sequencing data analysis the raw sequencing data were paired and trimmed using qiime v1 8 0 38 and the potentially chimeric sequences were removed with uchime 39 high quality reads were subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity and representative sequences from each otu were aligned to the silva 16s rrna database 40 for the purpose of fairly comparing samples a rarefied otu table at the lowest sequencing depth 18 091 sequences per sample was used to calculate the alpha and beta diversity metrics in qiime the alpha diversity metrics chao1 shannon and abundance based coverage estimator ace that weights community evenness richness as well as diversity were used to characterize the microbial community to determine the similarity of the community composition among the samples the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis distances between samples was analyzed 2 5 statistical analysis mantel tests based on the euclidean distance were conducted to identify the operational factors that were significantly correlated to the community composition based on the relative abundances of all the otus the potential hosts of the sul genes were identified according to the quantitative correlation between the sul genes and the bacterial genera at the phylum level additional statistical analyses including one way anova and pearson correlation analysis were performed using r v 3 3 2 the statistical results with p values 0 05 were considered to be significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational parameters driving variability of the microbial community operational parameters are important for reactor performance and variability of the bacterial communities in engineered systems hence the correlation between the operational variables and reactor performance was evaluated using a pearson correlation analysis fig 2 upper right the relationship between the reactor microbiomes and operational variables was further assessed with a mantel test using the community diversity index species abundance and chao1 and the operational parameters that included five operating factors and three sul genes fig 2 bottom left as shown in fig 2 the output voltage showed a positive correlation with the hrt r 0 31 whereas it showed a negative correlation with the operation time of system r 0 2 and the smx concentration of the effluent r 0 98 p 0 001 the smx removal efficiency was positively correlated to the hrt r 0 69 p 0 001 and the applied voltage r 0 62 p 0 01 while it was negatively correlated to the operation time r 0 47 p 0 05 and the smx concentration r 0 61 p 0 05 the selection pressure of smx induces the emergence of args that protect microbes to survive in an antimicrobial environment all three sul genes in the effluent of the system exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 89 0 99 with a high significance p 0 001 the sul genes showed a positive correlation with the smx concentration of influent whereas they showed a negative correlation with the hrt output voltage and the smx removal efficiency both an increase in the smx concentration in the influent and a decrease in the hrt resulted in a higher residual smx which was the primary contributor for the spread of args in both the bes and mfc cw a higher smx concentration imposes a higher selection pressure that enhances the propagation antibiotic resistant bacteria 41 compared with the correlation between the hrt and the sul iii gene both the smx removal efficiency and voltage were more negatively correlated with the sul i gene and sul ii gene this result demonstrated that the voltage had more effect in the reduction of the abundance of the sul i and sul ii genes while the sul iii gene required more reaction time to degrade mantel tests further indicated a significant correlation p 0 01 between the operational parameters and community composition the operational variables that could influence the bacteria community variation were different in the ber and mfc cw both of the microbial community compositions of the ber and mfc cw showed a significant positive correlation r 0 25 0 5 p 0 01 with the applied voltage and the smx concentration moreover the hrt displayed tighter correlations to the mfc cw assemblages than to the microbial community in the ber p 0 05 based on the above analysis the applied voltage and smx concentration could be the primary drivers that influenced the bacterial community composition in the ber in addition the hrt voltage and the smx concentration were the primary drivers that shaped the composition of the bacterial community in the mfc cw 3 2 biodiversity comparison among the samples under the different operational conditions an exploration of microbial diversity is instructive for revealing the characteristics of the microbial community therefore the alpha diversity and beta diversity of the microbial communities in the ber mfc cws under the different operational conditions were analyzed based on the 16s rrna sequencing data a total of 791 505 sequence reads from 22 samples including three inoculated sludge were obtained the sequencing depth varied from 18 091 to 82 008 sequences among the samples with a mean of 35 978 sequences fig 3a all of the sequences were clustered into 3705 otus as shown in the rarefaction curves of the number of otus vs the sampling effort fig 3a the number of observed species richness approached an asymptote along with the increase in the sequencing reads indicating that the depth of the sequencing nearly covered all the species in the samples the adequate sequencing depths were also supported by values of goods coverage table s1 and all were greater than 99 7 an exploration of microbial diversity is

richness chao1 and ace and diversity shannon and simpson is important for evaluating the suitability of an environment for microorganisms 23 the observed otu numbers among the samples ranged from 302 to 1471 fig 3a table s1 in general the reactors with higher smx concentrations had higher microbial richness as the estimators chao1 and ace increased from 1050 to 1483 and from 1059 to 1166 with the increasing smx concentration from 2 to 4 mg l in the ber respectively in addition similar variations in the microbial richness were observed in the mfc cw the microbial richness also decreased with an increased hrt where chao1 rose from 777 to 661 with a decreasing hrt from 16 h to 8 h comparison between the bers with different power patterns shown that the microbial diversity in the ber powered by the mfc cw showed a higher otu richness in view of the higher voltage average 1070 mv supplied by mfc cw than the direct voltage 1000 mv it was proposed that a higher voltage promoted the growth of microorganisms in terms of microbial diversity it presented as a rise and then a fall fig 3b this result was consistent with the richness and demonstrated that there was a harmful effect on the development of microorganisms with the time lapse because of toxic residue and antibiotic resistance gene accumulations as a consequence the performance of entire system declined especially the electricity generation capacity in addition the kruskal wallis test indicated that both the operational time p 0 0013 0 01 and the hrt p 0 0233 0 05 had significant effects on the microbial community diversity indices while the reactor type and the sampling location showed a non significant effect 0 664 and 0 626 respectively the pearson correlation showed that the microbial community diversity was positively correlated p 0 05 with the hrt fig 2 these results indicated that the operation time and hrt were the key factors that structured the microbial community in the bes alpha diversity as

microbial community diversity was positively correlated p 0 05 with the hrt fig 2 these results indicated that the operation time and hrt were the key factors that structured the microbial community in the bes a difference analysis between the samples using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination fig 4a and a heatmap fig 4b was performed based on the bray curtis algorithm most of the samples from the ber except b1 2 and b2 2 were clearly separated from the mfc cw samples in the nmds plots fig 4a indicating that the bacterial community structure in the ber differed from that in mfc cw in addition there were obvious differences among the communities from the anode and the cathode of the mfc cw where samples from the anode of the mfc cw clustered separately from the cathode samples as shown fig 4b the heatmap hierarchical clustering showed that most of the bray curtis distances among the samples of the ber were greater than 0 6 this demonstrated that the microbial communities in the bers were significantly changed all of the samples in the bers were divided into four groups using hierarchical clustering the similarity coefficient of the microbial community structure in the reactor gradually increased during the operational period this indicated that the operating factors such as the smx concentration and running time were more likely to change the microbial community than the hrt and the current supply mode 3 3 overview of the microbial communities there was a distinct difference between the microbial communities of the ber and the mfc cw proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi dominated in the ber while the most dominant phyla in the mfc cw were proteobacteria od1 and chlorobi a total of 39 phyla were found during the entire operational period and the top 10 are shown in fig 5 previous studies indicated that proteobacteria acinetobacter geobacter stenotrophomonas and pseudomonas was the most abundant phylum in bes 23 42 in this study the proteobacteria was the dominant bacteria during the inoculated sludge and its relative abundance was greater than 60 in addition the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were 15 14 and 7 76 respectively there were profound changes in the relative abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi after they were inoculated into the ber 27 specifically the relative abundance of the proteobacteria decreased to 25 52 and 23 63 after a month of operation in the ber then increased to 35 28 37 31 35 94 49 76 and 60 40 however bacteroidetes and chloroflexi increased to 21 84 and 26 49 and 24 95 and 31 27 respectively the relative abundances of bacteroidetes in the bers that had the power supplied by the direct current power were 8 24 and 12 11 and this was less that of those powered by the mfc cw i e 20 58 and 22 08 diversity of the microbial community might due to stimulation with the different current resulted in change of cell proliferation and dehydrogenase activity in the bers 27 in addition the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased during the operation time unlike the ber the microbial community of the mfc cw displayed a quick difference with the inoculated sludge due to the different medium and chlorobi was the dominant bacteria in the mfc cw 23 in addition complex interactions among functional bacteria i e exoelectrogens and antibiotic degrading bacteria were crucial for electricity generation and antibiotic degradation in the mfc cw 42 43 3 4 potential host bacteria of the sul genes a procrustes analysis was used to obtain the relevance of the relative abundance of the sul genes within the bacterial community composition at the phylum level and a high correlation was found m2 0 924 fig 6a this demonstrated that the evolution in the microbial community was evidently attributed to the sul genes the potential host bacteria of the sul genes were also analyzed as shown in fig 6b d and the potential host bacteria of the sul genes were slightly different in the system indicating that some specific bacteria were affected by electrical stimulation 43 specifically there were more phyla that were positively correlated with the sul genes in the ber and the mfc because of the prolonged exposure to high levels of antibiotics the top five phyla that were positively correlated in the ber were gn02 lentisphaerae firmicutes proteobacteria and fusobacteria and in the mfc c they were od1 chlorobi brc1 caldiserica and ws5 however in the mfc e they were chlamydiae od1 nitrospirae actinobacteria and planctomycetes variation of microbial community is the major factor for the changes of antibiotic removal and args in bes this study provided a new insight on the mechanisms underlying the key operating parameters and variation of microbial community during antibiotic degradation in the system in addition the alteration of args was gained in the bes it is worth noting that the analysis between the genera and the args only provided a possibility of the hosts of the args and the actual microbes that carry the args warrant further studies in the bes 4 conclusions variations in the microbial community and in microbial diversity were explored in the system the key operating factors and the sul gene harboring host bacteria were revealed the species richness in the ber was greater than in the mfc cw there were 39 phyla found during the entire operational period and the top 9 were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi chlorobi acidobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria nitrospirae and planctomysete bacterial hosts for instance lentisphaerae firmicutes proteobacteria chlorobi caldiserica nitrospirae actinobacteria and planctomycetes had positive correlations with the sul genes and were slightly different in the bes according to the network analysis selection by residual smx was the primary contributor to the fate of args in the bes and a higher smx concentration resulted in a higher selection pressure that enhanced the propagation of the antibiotic resistant bacteria the variations in the potential host bacteria could have been another key mechanism that contributed to changes in the args the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 alpha diversity index of each sample table s1 supplementary data to this article can be

by the electricity generated by the two mfc cws and the effluent of the ber was equally divided to the two mfc cws the hrts were set to 16 and 8 h for the bers which corresponded to an hrt of 32 and 16 h for the stacked mfc cws the smx concentration of the influent of the bers in system 2 was maintained at 4 mg l as the cathode and the anode of the mfc cw were located in the upper portion and deep zone of the wetland they clearly had different redox potentials due to the availability of oxygen 34 therefore both biomass from the anode and cathode layer of the mfc cw were utilized for the community analysis biomass samples of 5 g were collected from the ber and the anode layer and cathode layer of each ber mfc cw were collected at the end of the operation for further dna extractions for the mfc cws in system 2 biomass samples were collected from only one of them because two of them were operated in parallel 2 3 dna extraction qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial communities shaped in the ber mfc cws were investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 35 36 the genomic dna of the samples 1 g was extracted using the fast dna spin kit for soil mobio carlsbad ca usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions sulfonamide resistance has been identified as arising from the acquisition of dihydropteroate synthase genes 37 and these include three different types namely sul1 sul2 and sul3 sul genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 and the universal bacterial 16s rrna genes for the total bacteria were quantified using the pcr system bio rad shanghai china the details of the qpcr process can be found in a previous study 28 for the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the universal primers 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes of both the bacteria and archaea domains were used sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq 2500 illumina usa at majorbio producing 2 250 bp paired end reads 2 4 sequencing data analysis the raw sequencing data were paired and trimmed using qiime v1 8 0 38 and the potentially chimeric sequences were removed with uchime 39 high quality reads were subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity and representative sequences from each otu were aligned to the silva 16s rrna database 40 for the purpose of fairly comparing samples a rarefied otu table at the lowest sequencing depth 18 091 sequences per sample was used to calculate the alpha and beta diversity metrics in qiime the alpha diversity metrics chao1 shannon and abundance based coverage estimator ace that weights community evenness richness as well as diversity were used to characterize the microbial community to determine the similarity of the community composition among the samples the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis distances between samples was analyzed 2 5 statistical analysis mantel tests based on the euclidean distance were conducted to identify the operational factors that were significantly correlated to the community composition based on the relative abundances of all the otus the potential hosts of the sul genes were identified according to the quantitative correlation between the sul genes and the bacterial genera at the phylum level additional statistical analyses including one way anova and pearson correlation analysis were performed using r v 3 3 2 the statistical results with p values 0 05 were considered to be significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational parameters driving variability of the microbial community operational parameters are important for reactor performance and variability of the bacterial communities in engineered systems hence the correlation between the operational variables and reactor performance was evaluated using a pearson correlation analysis fig 2 upper right the relationship between the reactor microbiomes and operational variables was further assessed with a mantel test using the community diversity index species abundance and chao1 and the operational parameters that included five operating factors and three sul genes fig 2 bottom left as shown in fig 2 the output voltage showed a positive correlation with the hrt r 0 31 whereas it showed a negative correlation with the operation time of system r 0 2 and the smx concentration of the effluent r 0 98 p 0 001 the smx removal efficiency was positively correlated to the hrt r 0 69 p 0 001 and the applied voltage r 0 62 p 0 01 while it was negatively correlated to the operation time r 0 47 p 0 05 and the smx concentration r 0 61 p 0 05 the selection pressure of smx induces the emergence of args that protect microbes to survive in an antimicrobial environment all three sul genes in the effluent of the system exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 89 0 99 with a high significance p 0 001 the sul genes showed a positive correlation with the smx concentration of influent whereas they showed a negative correlation with the hrt output voltage and the smx removal efficiency both an increase in the smx concentration in the influent and a decrease in the hrt resulted in a higher residual smx which was the primary contributor for the spread of args in both the bes and mfc cw a higher smx concentration imposes a higher selection pressure that enhances the propagation antibiotic resistant bacteria 41 compared with the correlation between the hrt and the sul iii gene both the smx removal efficiency and voltage were more negatively correlated with the sul i gene and sul ii gene this result demonstrated that the voltage had more effect in the reduction of the abundance of the sul i and sul ii genes while the sul iii gene required more reaction time to degrade mantel tests further indicated a significant correlation p 0 01 between the operational parameters and community composition the operational variables that could influence the bacteria community variation were different in the ber and mfc cw both of the microbial community compositions of the ber and mfc cw showed a significant positive correlation r 0 25 0 5 p 0 01 with the applied voltage and the smx concentration moreover the hrt displayed tighter correlations to the mfc cw assemblages than to the microbial community in the ber p 0 05 based on the above analysis the applied voltage and smx concentration could be the primary drivers that influenced the bacterial community composition in the ber in addition the hrt voltage and the smx concentration were the primary drivers that shaped the composition of the bacterial community in the mfc cw 3 2 biodiversity comparison among the samples under the different operational conditions an exploration of microbial diversity is instructive for revealing the characteristics of the microbial community therefore the alpha diversity and beta diversity of the microbial communities in the ber mfc cws under the different operational conditions were analyzed based on the 16s rrna sequencing data a total of 791 505 sequence reads from 22 samples including three inoculated sludge were obtained the sequencing depth varied from 18 091 to 82 008 sequences among the samples with a mean of 35 978 sequences fig 3a all of the sequences were clustered into 3705 otus as shown in the rarefaction curves of the number of otus vs the sampling effort fig 3a the number of observed species richness approached an asymptote along with the increase in the sequencing reads indicating that the depth of the sequencing nearly covered all the species in the samples the adequate sequencing depths were also supported by values of goods coverage table s1 and all were greater than 99 7 an exploration of microbial diversity is

richness chao1 and ace and diversity shannon and simpson is important for evaluating the suitability of an environment for microorganisms 23 the observed otu numbers among the samples ranged from 302 to 1471 fig 3a table s1 in general the reactors with higher smx concentrations had higher microbial richness as the estimators chao1 and ace increased from 1050 to 1483 and from 1059 to 1166 with the increasing smx concentration from 2 to 4 mg l in the ber respectively in addition similar variations in the microbial richness were observed in the mfc cw the microbial richness also decreased with an increased hrt where chao1 rose from 777 to 661 with a decreasing hrt from 16 h to 8 h comparison between the bers with different power patterns shown that the microbial diversity in the ber powered by the mfc cw showed a higher otu richness in view of the higher voltage average 1070 mv supplied by mfc cw than the direct voltage 1000 mv it was proposed that a higher voltage promoted the growth of microorganisms in terms of microbial diversity it presented as a rise and then a fall fig 3b this result was consistent with the richness and demonstrated that there was a harmful effect on the development of microorganisms with the time lapse because of toxic residue and antibiotic resistance gene accumulations as a consequence the performance of entire system declined especially the electricity generation capacity in addition the kruskal wallis test indicated that both the operational time p 0 0013 0 01 and the hrt p 0 0233 0 05 had significant effects on the microbial community diversity indices while the reactor type and the sampling location showed a non significant effect 0 664 and 0 626 respectively the pearson correlation showed that the microbial community diversity was positively correlated p 0 05 with the hrt fig 2 these results indicated that the operation time and hrt were the key factors that structured the microbial community in the bes alpha diversity as

microbial community diversity was positively correlated p 0 05 with the hrt fig 2 these results indicated that the operation time and hrt were the key factors that structured the microbial community in the bes a difference analysis between the samples using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination fig 4a and a heatmap fig 4b was performed based on the bray curtis algorithm most of the samples from the ber except b1 2 and b2 2 were clearly separated from the mfc cw samples in the nmds plots fig 4a indicating that the bacterial community structure in the ber differed from that in mfc cw in addition there were obvious differences among the communities from the anode and the cathode of the mfc cw where samples from the anode of the mfc cw clustered separately from the cathode samples as shown fig 4b the heatmap hierarchical clustering showed that most of the bray curtis distances among the samples of the ber were greater than 0 6 this demonstrated that the microbial communities in the bers were significantly changed all of the samples in the bers were divided into four groups using hierarchical clustering the similarity coefficient of the microbial community structure in the reactor gradually increased during the operational period this indicated that the operating factors such as the smx concentration and running time were more likely to change the microbial community than the hrt and the current supply mode 3 3 overview of the microbial communities there was a distinct difference between the microbial communities of the ber and the mfc cw proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi dominated in the ber while the most dominant phyla in the mfc cw were proteobacteria od1 and chlorobi a total of 39 phyla were found during the entire operational period and the top 10 are shown in fig 5 previous studies indicated that proteobacteria acinetobacter geobacter stenotrophomonas and pseudomonas was the most abundant phylum in bes 23 42 in this study the proteobacteria was the dominant bacteria during the inoculated sludge and its relative abundance was greater than 60 in addition the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were 15 14 and 7 76 respectively there were profound changes in the relative abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi after they were inoculated into the ber 27 specifically the relative abundance of the proteobacteria decreased to 25 52 and 23 63 after a month of operation in the ber then increased to 35 28 37 31 35 94 49 76 and 60 40 however bacteroidetes and chloroflexi increased to 21 84 and 26 49 and 24 95 and 31 27 respectively the relative abundances of bacteroidetes in the bers that had the power supplied by the direct current power were 8 24 and 12 11 and this was less that of those powered by the mfc cw i e 20 58 and 22 08 diversity of the microbial community might due to stimulation with the different current resulted in change of cell proliferation and dehydrogenase activity in the bers 27 in addition the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased during the operation time unlike the ber the microbial community of the mfc cw displayed a quick difference with the inoculated sludge due to the different medium and chlorobi was the dominant bacteria in the mfc cw 23 in addition complex interactions among functional bacteria i e exoelectrogens and antibiotic degrading bacteria were crucial for electricity generation and antibiotic degradation in the mfc cw 42 43 3 4 potential host bacteria of the sul genes a procrustes analysis was used to obtain the relevance of the relative abundance of the sul genes within the bacterial community composition at the phylum level and a high correlation was found m2 0 924 fig 6a this demonstrated that the evolution in the microbial community was evidently attributed to the sul genes the potential host bacteria of the sul genes were also analyzed as shown in fig 6b d and the potential host bacteria of the sul genes were slightly different in the system indicating that some specific bacteria were affected by electrical stimulation 43 specifically there were more phyla that were positively correlated with the sul genes in the ber and the mfc because of the prolonged exposure to high levels of antibiotics the top five phyla that were positively correlated in the ber were gn02 lentisphaerae firmicutes proteobacteria and fusobacteria and in the mfc c they were od1 chlorobi brc1 caldiserica and ws5 however in the mfc e they were chlamydiae od1 nitrospirae actinobacteria and planctomycetes variation of microbial community is the major factor for the changes of antibiotic removal and args in bes this study provided a new insight on the mechanisms underlying the key operating parameters and variation of microbial community during antibiotic degradation in the system in addition the alteration of args was gained in the bes it is worth noting that the analysis between the genera and the args only provided a possibility of the hosts of the args and the actual microbes that carry the args warrant further studies in the bes 4 conclusions variations in the microbial community and in microbial diversity were explored in the system the key operating factors and the sul gene harboring host bacteria were revealed the species richness in the ber was greater than in the mfc cw there were 39 phyla found during the entire operational period and the top 9 were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi chlorobi acidobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria nitrospirae and planctomysete bacterial hosts for instance lentisphaerae firmicutes proteobacteria chlorobi caldiserica nitrospirae actinobacteria and planctomycetes had positive correlations with the sul genes and were slightly different in the bes according to the network analysis selection by residual smx was the primary contributor to the fate of args in the bes and a higher smx concentration resulted in a higher selection pressure that enhanced the propagation of the antibiotic resistant bacteria the variations in the potential host bacteria could have been another key mechanism that contributed to changes in the args the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 alpha diversity index of each sample table s1 supplementary data to this article can be
