finally the paper ends with results and discussions given the simulation outputs limitations and the way forward in the conclusion 2 materials and methods 2 1 makran region s groundwater issue and alternative livelihood policy the makran coastal region is part of southeastern iran with approximately 15 000 km2 fig 1 a the region strategically has a high potential for investment because of its unique access to the free seas as a threat to economic growth subsequent subsidence resulting from groundwater depletion in the west of the region namely the minab plain has put the region at a stack hashemi 2021 the aquifer s area is about 857 km2 and rainfall is the primary source of groundwater recharge dastvareh et al 2020 the aquifer s thickness has been estimated at 30 m feizolahi et al 2019 the maximum storage volume of the aquifer is estimated at 6000 mcm according to equation 2 considering a 23 percent storage coefficient on average 1 v h a s in which v aquifer volume mcm a aquifer area km2 h aquifer thickness or height of water level respectively for estimating total aquifer volume or groundwater volume s storage coefficient land subsidence and earth fissures caused by groundwater depletion have affected more than 60 km2 in the plain hashemi 2021 the subsidence has occurred due to aquifer compaction resulting from groundwater level declines that will decrease the useful aquifer volume to save water in the long term due to reducing the storage capacity precipitation is the major recharge factor fueling the aquifer directly or indirectly through runoff but groundwater depletion here is not necessarily caused by rainfall reduction according to the time series depicted in fig 1b we witness declining groundwater volume during increased rainfall the evidence indicates an inverse relationship between groundwater volume and the expected irrigated agriculture gdp responsible for 90 of water withdrawal from the resources hashemi 2021 the shrimp industry and irrigated farmings are the main drivers in generating regional gdp 10 and 80 percent respectively the information in table 1 indicates that despite shrimp farming irrigated agriculture seriously depends on groundwater resources the region has an opportunity to enjoy parts of the seashore area namely khour at about 14 500 ha having a high possibility for shrimp farming based on the seawater these natural areas emerge from travelling seawater into natural dead end channels thus shrimp farming functions away from groundwater resources within the khour channels consequently shrimp farming is assumed as the best alternative for launching al policy to compensate for the due losses in irrigated agriculture total irrigated agriculture is about 58 670 ha with water demand at about 7500 m3 ha year on average its potential expansion is about 70 000 ha targeted to be fulfilled gradually according to the annual expected gdp until 2050 fig 1c however sequence groundwater depletion put a red flag before such development and calls for launching the al policy relying on the prosperity of the shrimp industry theoretically developing the shrimp farms area from 1000 ha to its maximum amount 14 500 ha can compensate for decreasing irrigated agriculture at about 58 000 ha leaving 300 mcm per year for groundwater resources while fulfilling the annual expected gdp that is very close to the definition of groundwater sustainability following alley et al 1999 in which neither groundwater resources nor expected gdp sacrifices each other however the s shaped tp s morphology matters in doing so since the region s specific issues are whether such morphology can influence the expected results and if so which tp morphology would be most appropriate 2 2 methodology the system dynamics modelling approach whose applicability in assessing sustainability transition has been proved in previous studies ziemele et al 2016 moradi and vagnoni 2018 bolwig et al 2019 papachristos 2019 is adopted to assess tp s morphology on groundwater sustainability to this end the following steps have been taken parameters which are responsible for the s shaped function s morphology are scrutinised and mapped as a typical tp for decreasing irrigated crop area to fulfil the total desired changes until 2050 a system dynamics model is developed for simulating system mechanism governing groundwater volume and total gdp both represented as indicators of groundwater sustainability till 2050 groundwater sustainability in response to interventions made into the s shaped tp s morphology as the model input is examined through the simulation model 2 2 1 mapping a typical s shaped tp for the case study the s shaped path in fig 1 illustrates a typical tp morphology introduced by rotmans et al 2001 adding to the course brugge and de haan 2005 considered four phases for the typical tp predevelopment takeoff acceleration and stabilisation van der voorn et al 2012 followed the function analysis and introduced a critical point entitled tangent point within the acceleration phase in fig 2 the tangent point appears to rest in the acceleration phase at the function s turning point when viewed mathematically at the tangent point the system s sufficient stability is assumed according to van der voorn et al 2012 this is the point when transformative capacity turns into adaptive capacity ibid in order to sustain the adaptive capacity for change the whole policy development process should be improved once the key elements of a system structure have been reorganised into new or different configurations ibid a number of parameters can explain the s shaped path of the tp fig 3 a to c for this purpose a sigmoid function determined with three parameters han and moraga 1995 was assumed in equation 1 figures indicate how the function responds to the change in each parameter individually in addition the following paragraph discusses the dynamics of the s shaped path in more detail 2 t p p a r a m e t e r c 1 e p a r a m t e r a t p a r a m e t e r b in which t time accordingly parameter a is responsible for the slope of the tangent point mainly affecting the acceleration phase increasing its value shortens the acceleration phase period by reducing its slope and vice versa however this parameter does not affect the tangent point s position in this way it is responsible for the time lag between capacity building and adaptive capacity and determines the kick off time for launching the al policy fig 3a parameter b determines the starting time of the transition it no longer disturbs the tp s morphology and the regulation of each phase s period there is a possibility that it will delay or set forward the launch of the al policy particularly the predevelopment phase an increase in parameter b postpones the predevelopment phase as well as all phases and vice versa this parameter is also responsible for the horizontal dynamic of the tangent point position fig 3b parameter c is responsible for the total amount of expected reorganisation or changes resting in the stabilisation phase it no longer changes the kick off time of the policy implementation but disturbs the path s slope in four phases this parameter is also responsible for the tangent point dynamic the more value of parameter c calls for enormous changes needed to reach the tangent point sliding this parameter s value changes the same direction in the stabilisation phase fig 3c accordingly equation 1is served to map a typical tp for launching the al policy in the region thus a primary tp was portrayed as a temporal pattern to decrease irrigated agriculture at about 58 000 ha until 2050 fig 3d in parallel with this tp one can imagine a complimentary one developing a shrimp farm area at about 14 500 ha by 2050 to compensate for due losses in irrigated agriculture the tangent point has been highlighted in the middle part of the acceleration phase of the tp s morphologies by finding the turning point of the tp s function besides the parameters responsible for the primary tp s morphology were written in fig 3d 2 2 2 buildding up the system dyanmics model the first step in sd based simulation is to map the cld it is an sd foundational tool used to develop a perception of complex systems sterman 2001 that consists of balancing or negative feedback loops b reinforcing or positive feedback loops r or a combination of both which forms a dynamic structure or a cld senge 1997 here the cld governing the human environmental system consists of two balancings b1 and b2 and one reinforcing r loop fig 4 a b1 and b2 drive the system s behaviour towards their equilibrium points the limit of precipitation and total expected gdp respectively r1 is responsible for the growth of irrigated agriculture s gdp and consequently groundwater withdrawal which plays a crucial role in exploiting groundwater resources according to fig 4a the links which are mapped in grey are attributed to launching the al policy to control unintended growth of the r loop they do this by simultaneously decreasing irrigated agriculture to save groundwater resources and developing shrimp farm areas to compensate due lost gdp the simulation began by turning the cld into a stock flow diagram sfd the sfd concept implies that all world dynamic behaviour occurs when stock flows accumulate derived sfd including two stocks and six flow variables was delineated in the vensim dss software fig 4b the interactions among other components were drawn in the shape of feedback links in blue the groundwater volume stock served to simulate the groundwater budget according to equation 3 the recharge from precipitation flow as the main factor for the groundwater volume recharge was calculated based on equation 4 and equation 5 embedded in the model served to evaluate the rate of subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal that affects the maximum aquifer capacity volume stock the equations for other variables and the sensitivity analysis of groundwater resources for the parameters are brought in fig s1 in the annexe 3 g r o u n d w a t e r v o l u m e t g r o u n d w a t e r v o l u m e t 1 r e t

three kinds of variables including exogenous endogenous and omitted variables sterman 2001 in this regard the core of the model boundary encompasses the endogenous variables generated by the model including total gdp decreasing rate of irrigated crop area groundwater volume shrimp farms area total value added agricultural water supply certainty demand for irrigated crop area total shrimp value added rate of subsidence evaporation outflow exogenous variables are the parameters used as external inputs for the simulation including recharge rate from precipitation annual evaporation total expected gdp annual rainfall parameters responsible for s shaped tp s morphology and finally the main omitted variables defined as those being outside the scope of the study are total energy demand and supply for livelihood total occupation in the region and migrant labors in outwards the region the groundwater volume variable was targeted for the calibration and verification stages thus its observed data were divided into two periods 1996 2010 for calibration and 2010 2016 for verification the model calibration was compiled based on estimating x k and s parameters in table s1 in the annexe for this purpose these parameters maximum and minimum possible values were put into the calibration section in the vensim dss software in the following the verification process was accomplished for data between 2010 and 2016 of this simulated and observed data are delineated in fig 4c where corresponding regressions are embedded for each stage separately furthermore estimated parameters and formulated variables were presented in detail in table s1 annexe the sensitivity analysis for the parameters including x k and s on groundwater resources can be found in figure s1 in the annexe 3 results and discussions 3 1 simulation results the simulated model was employed as an engine behind a user friendly decision support dashboard including groundwater volume shrimp farm area demand for irrigated agriculture and total gdp as graph outputs and indicative of the case study s sustainability slider keys are responsible for the tp s morphology as the model s inputs and interventions fig 5 by sliding the parameters within their range decision makers can examine groundwater sustainability which has already been defined as the situation where expected gdp can be met without harming groundwater resources in response to various tp morphologies a sensitivity analysis has been conducted using two batches of data including tp s morphologies for three responsible parameters fig s2 and groundwater volume for corresponding morphologies fig s3 initially the model was run through the business as usual scenario keeping the development of irrigated agriculture and the t scenario launching the al policy based on the primary tp fig 3d until 2050 fig 5 despite the business as usual scenario the results indicate a promising future for the al policy in meeting 2050 s gdp targets fig 1c nonetheless it also shows grave repercussions for groundwater just like the business as usual scenario in the following the primary tp was manipulated in several shots for comparison purposes keeping the t scenario results as the benchmark in the next run parameter b is adjusted to assess the response to shifting the tp kick off time therefore the primary tp was duplicated twice with a four year deviation in its kicking off time attributed to s1 the earlier one and s2 the latter the results indicate that the kicking off time of transition matters in the policy success of bringing groundwater sustainability fig 6 this conclusion has been reached since the s1 scenario has produced much more satisfactory results than s2 maintaining groundwater volume at a higher level without causing an economic collapse this suggests accelerating the transition s start time would yield more desirable results similarly in the next shot the comparison is taken place for tps with different tangent point angles tps have been designed by sliding parameter a that produces s1 and s2 scenarios fig 6 the s1 scenario has a tp that began in 1996 and has a smoother acceleration phase than the t scenario on the way to total transformation while s2 which began in 2027 maintains a tp with a sharper acceleration phase than s1 and t in doing so applying the generated scenarios indicates that the groundwater could have experienced greater sustainability if the transition had begun earlier than 2020 in 1996 s1 scenario additionally that could have made launching the al policy much easier since the less slope for the acceleration phase the easier it is to implement the transformation löhr and mattes 2022 despite a sharper tangent point angle than s1 the s2 scenario lagged behind s1 in sustaining groundwater resources fig 7 during this comparison round it was demonstrated that tangent point angles significantly impact the al policy s success the fourth comparison batch examined how much targeted transformation contributed to groundwater sustainability this is accomplished by generating two scenarios each starting from the same launching point as the t scenario but with different targeted transformations by 2050 thus s1 and s2 scenarios were generated whereas both have a faster acceleration phase than t according to the results setting tp on the maximum expected transformation is not enough to guarantee the success of the al policy according to fig 8 while the t scenario has failed in ceasing groundwater depletion the s1 scenario has overcome it even with the same amount of targeted transformation on top of that the s2 scenario based on a tp that is set at less targeted transformation than that of the t scenario reflects the more satisfying results upon a well designed tp s morphology according to the results from the fifth batch of comparison runs shortfalls in one phase of a tp can be compensated if the other phases are well designed that is substantiated by results mapped in fig 9 that shows how the s2 scenario with a tp kicking off with a significant delay and targeting less transformation compared to s1 catches up with s1 in terms of ceasing groundwater depletion by raising its tp s tangent point angle it ensures that with the right set of kicking off time and tangent point angle the region can overcome its weakness in materialising the total expected transformation to cope with groundwater depletion generally the results affirm the crucial role of tp s morphology in al s success in saving groundwater volume in the simplified case study representing critical points for al policy success these raised points are what papachristos 2019 referred to as the potential of system dynamics for transition research in terms of methodology and case study research the results explore the most fundamental ability of system dynamics to understand and model a system s structure which is responsible for its dynamic behaviour in support of that the results indicate how feedback structure and shifting power between reinforcing and balancing loops of the cld governing the groundwater and economy in the case study can change our expectations of a tp s performance in the long term for instance despite common belief one can perceive that targeting even a high amount of transformation towards promoting productivity does not guarantee the best outputs unless designing an appropriate tp mapping such externalities owes to the system dynamics ability to unveil non linear causal relations governed by reinforcing and balancing forces which are inseparable characteristics of technology disruptions in socio technical systems 3 2 limitations and avenues to pursue to answer if tps morphology matters in the al policy success this study has simplified and scrutinised a tp that leads to replacing irrigated agriculture with the shrimp industry in saving groundwater depletion and economic prosperity in the long term nonetheless tps also capture the co development of social economic policy and behavioural factors proposed for future studies moradi and vagnoni 2018 thus there are some significant limitations associated with this study that are appreciated in the following from three vantage points co flows associated with tps one of the frequently mentioned strength points of system dynamics modelling in previous efforts has been its ability to map co development mechanisms such as social economic and political ones associated with any change in the system over time holtz et al 2015 bolwig et al 2019 this ability equips users to unveil feedback oriented behaviour as a result of any intervention in the system on the other hand the changes in each phase of tps including predevelopment takeoff acceleration and stabilisation may be associated with unintended feedback thus the model should capture many more co development mechanisms associated with each phase of tps including co flows of stocks and flows that influence tps performance in the long term consequently this vein still has ample space for further model development uncertainties of exogenous factors groundwater management is marked by significant human and environmental uncertainties which play a leading role in shaping tps not to mention their performance on the ground according to its outline the paper examines the tps morphology on the success of the al policy rather than concentrating on uncertainties affecting tps nevertheless external forces like climate change bailey and wilson 2009 eisenhauer 2016 politics breetz et al 2018 and international attitudes can substantially affect the tps morphology and performance in this way such political uncertainty should be addressed in evaluating tps performance which remains unsubstantiated here adopted system dynamics modelling approach here a command and control system dynamics model was used to assess tps morphology which is highly aligned with how central governments operate however tps should be unfolded due to the continuous struggles of leading actors over policy goals and instruments mcdowall 2014 de koning et al 2021 the interaction with a broad range of actors including stakeholders managers and transition scholars who play a leading role in welcoming and settling for the tps on the ground has been left behind by this modelling approach the transition management literature emphasises the necessity for learning in the process of causing a change to become sustainable luederitz et al 2017 van mierlo et al 2020 goyal and howlett 2020 however the command and control modelling approach has fewer concerns with this matter consequently that asks for supporting the current model by conducting participatory methods such as participatory research action research shared knowledge creation or combinations of models and participation de koning et al 2021 4 conclusions and implications in response to whether the morphology of s shaped tp influences the al policy in controlling groundwater depletion this paper adopted a system dynamics modelling approach for this reason three parameters have been introduced each responsible for specific attributes of a tp s morphology the makran region of iran suffering from severe groundwater depletion was adopted to examine the argument accordingly the results suggested a general direction for designing the tp s morphology to increase the effectiveness of the al policy in the region setting forward the starting point of the transition decreasing the capacity building process s period and considering the maximum amount of change at the stabilising phase of transition were introduced as courses of action to reach the ideal outcomes in addition the paper showed that the decision makers well dominance over the morphology of the tp was able to compensate for possible weak points in the transition phases according to this article launching al policies should not be based solely on targeting maximum productivity the tp needs to be designed in a way that is relevant to the situation this is highly dependent on many factors intertwined with social aspects not considered in the study as a result designing a tp in a command and control way is not enough integrating the issue into a socio technical framework is important because each tp has a specific socio economic morphology tp should be derived from an interactive process involving a broad spectrum of policymakers and stakeholders for that purpose the author suggests a process based on participatory system dynamics psd stave 2010 in which stakeholders especially farmers can use the approach to map out a tp for launching the al that produces the best results in this way tps could be mapped in a participatory manner this approach might be taken to the next level if neglected factors of possible uncertainties such as climate change politics and international instability etc are concerned for future efforts the author suggests considering these factors interacting with stakeholders through psd declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement i greatly appreciate the three reviewers substantial comments which have helped me improve

the maximum storage volume of the aquifer is estimated at 6000 mcm according to equation 2 considering a 23 percent storage coefficient on average 1 v h a s in which v aquifer volume mcm a aquifer area km2 h aquifer thickness or height of water level respectively for estimating total aquifer volume or groundwater volume s storage coefficient land subsidence and earth fissures caused by groundwater depletion have affected more than 60 km2 in the plain hashemi 2021 the subsidence has occurred due to aquifer compaction resulting from groundwater level declines that will decrease the useful aquifer volume to save water in the long term due to reducing the storage capacity precipitation is the major recharge factor fueling the aquifer directly or indirectly through runoff but groundwater depletion here is not necessarily caused by rainfall reduction according to the time series depicted in fig 1b we witness declining groundwater volume during increased rainfall the evidence indicates an inverse relationship between groundwater volume and the expected irrigated agriculture gdp responsible for 90 of water withdrawal from the resources hashemi 2021 the shrimp industry and irrigated farmings are the main drivers in generating regional gdp 10 and 80 percent respectively the information in table 1 indicates that despite shrimp farming irrigated agriculture seriously depends on groundwater resources the region has an opportunity to enjoy parts of the seashore area namely khour at about 14 500 ha having a high possibility for shrimp farming based on the seawater these natural areas emerge from travelling seawater into natural dead end channels thus shrimp farming functions away from groundwater resources within the khour channels consequently shrimp farming is assumed as the best alternative for launching al policy to compensate for the due losses in irrigated agriculture total irrigated agriculture is about 58 670 ha with water demand at about 7500 m3 ha year on average its potential expansion is about 70 000 ha targeted to be fulfilled gradually according to the annual expected gdp until 2050 fig 1c however sequence groundwater depletion put a red flag before such development and calls for launching the al policy relying on the prosperity of the shrimp industry theoretically developing the shrimp farms area from 1000 ha to its maximum amount 14 500 ha can compensate for decreasing irrigated agriculture at about 58 000 ha leaving 300 mcm per year for groundwater resources while fulfilling the annual expected gdp that is very close to the definition of groundwater sustainability following alley et al 1999 in which neither groundwater resources nor expected gdp sacrifices each other however the s shaped tp s morphology matters in doing so since the region s specific issues are whether such morphology can influence the expected results and if so which tp morphology would be most appropriate 2 2 methodology the system dynamics modelling approach whose applicability in assessing sustainability transition has been proved in previous studies ziemele et al 2016 moradi and vagnoni 2018 bolwig et al 2019 papachristos 2019 is adopted to assess tp s morphology on groundwater sustainability to this end the following steps have been taken parameters which are responsible for the s shaped function s morphology are scrutinised and mapped as a typical tp for decreasing irrigated crop area to fulfil the total desired changes until 2050 a system dynamics model is developed for simulating system mechanism governing groundwater volume and total gdp both represented as indicators of groundwater sustainability till 2050 groundwater sustainability in response to interventions made into the s shaped tp s morphology as the model input is examined through the simulation model 2 2 1 mapping a typical s shaped tp for the case study the s shaped path in fig 1 illustrates a typical tp morphology introduced by rotmans et al 2001 adding to the course brugge and de haan 2005 considered four phases for the typical tp predevelopment takeoff acceleration and stabilisation van der voorn et al 2012 followed the function analysis and introduced a critical point entitled tangent point within the acceleration phase in fig 2 the tangent point appears to rest in the acceleration phase at the function s turning point when viewed mathematically at the tangent point the system s sufficient stability is assumed according to van der voorn et al 2012 this is the point when transformative capacity turns into adaptive capacity ibid in order to sustain the adaptive capacity for change the whole policy development process should be improved once the key elements of a system structure have been reorganised into new or different configurations ibid a number of parameters can explain the s shaped path of the tp fig 3 a to c for this purpose a sigmoid function determined with three parameters han and moraga 1995 was assumed in equation 1 figures indicate how the function responds to the change in each parameter individually in addition the following paragraph discusses the dynamics of the s shaped path in more detail 2 t p p a r a m e t e r c 1 e p a r a m t e r a t p a r a m e t e r b in which t time accordingly parameter a is responsible for the slope of the tangent point mainly affecting the acceleration phase increasing its value shortens the acceleration phase period by reducing its slope and vice versa however this parameter does not affect the tangent point s position in this way it is responsible for the time lag between capacity building and adaptive capacity and determines the kick off time for launching the al policy fig 3a parameter b determines the starting time of the transition it no longer disturbs the tp s morphology and the regulation of each phase s period there is a possibility that it will delay or set forward the launch of the al policy particularly the predevelopment phase an increase in parameter b postpones the predevelopment phase as well as all phases and vice versa this parameter is also responsible for the horizontal dynamic of the tangent point position fig 3b parameter c is responsible for the total amount of expected reorganisation or changes resting in the stabilisation phase it no longer changes the kick off time of the policy implementation but disturbs the path s slope in four phases this parameter is also responsible for the tangent point dynamic the more value of parameter c calls for enormous changes needed to reach the tangent point sliding this parameter s value changes the same direction in the stabilisation phase fig 3c accordingly equation 1is served to map a typical tp for launching the al policy in the region thus a primary tp was portrayed as a temporal pattern to decrease irrigated agriculture at about 58 000 ha until 2050 fig 3d in parallel with this tp one can imagine a complimentary one developing a shrimp farm area at about 14 500 ha by 2050 to compensate for due losses in irrigated agriculture the tangent point has been highlighted in the middle part of the acceleration phase of the tp s morphologies by finding the turning point of the tp s function besides the parameters responsible for the primary tp s morphology were written in fig 3d 2 2 2 buildding up the system dyanmics model the first step in sd based simulation is to map the cld it is an sd foundational tool used to develop a perception of complex systems sterman 2001 that consists of balancing or negative feedback loops b reinforcing or positive feedback loops r or a combination of both which forms a dynamic structure or a cld senge 1997 here the cld governing the human environmental system consists of two balancings b1 and b2 and one reinforcing r loop fig 4 a b1 and b2 drive the system s behaviour towards their equilibrium points the limit of precipitation and total expected gdp respectively r1 is responsible for the growth of irrigated agriculture s gdp and consequently groundwater withdrawal which plays a crucial role in exploiting groundwater resources according to fig 4a the links which are mapped in grey are attributed to launching the al policy to control unintended growth of the r loop they do this by simultaneously decreasing irrigated agriculture to save groundwater resources and developing shrimp farm areas to compensate due lost gdp the simulation began by turning the cld into a stock flow diagram sfd the sfd concept implies that all world dynamic behaviour occurs when stock flows accumulate derived sfd including two stocks and six flow variables was delineated in the vensim dss software fig 4b the interactions among other components were drawn in the shape of feedback links in blue the groundwater volume stock served to simulate the groundwater budget according to equation 3 the recharge from precipitation flow as the main factor for the groundwater volume recharge was calculated based on equation 4 and equation 5 embedded in the model served to evaluate the rate of subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal that affects the maximum aquifer capacity volume stock the equations for other variables and the sensitivity analysis of groundwater resources for the parameters are brought in fig s1 in the annexe 3 g r o u n d w a t e r v o l u m e t g r o u n d w a t e r v o l u m e t 1 r e t

three kinds of variables including exogenous endogenous and omitted variables sterman 2001 in this regard the core of the model boundary encompasses the endogenous variables generated by the model including total gdp decreasing rate of irrigated crop area groundwater volume shrimp farms area total value added agricultural water supply certainty demand for irrigated crop area total shrimp value added rate of subsidence evaporation outflow exogenous variables are the parameters used as external inputs for the simulation including recharge rate from precipitation annual evaporation total expected gdp annual rainfall parameters responsible for s shaped tp s morphology and finally the main omitted variables defined as those being outside the scope of the study are total energy demand and supply for livelihood total occupation in the region and migrant labors in outwards the region the groundwater volume variable was targeted for the calibration and verification stages thus its observed data were divided into two periods 1996 2010 for calibration and 2010 2016 for verification the model calibration was compiled based on estimating x k and s parameters in table s1 in the annexe for this purpose these parameters maximum and minimum possible values were put into the calibration section in the vensim dss software in the following the verification process was accomplished for data between 2010 and 2016 of this simulated and observed data are delineated in fig 4c where corresponding regressions are embedded for each stage separately furthermore estimated parameters and formulated variables were presented in detail in table s1 annexe the sensitivity analysis for the parameters including x k and s on groundwater resources can be found in figure s1 in the annexe 3 results and discussions 3 1 simulation results the simulated model was employed as an engine behind a user friendly decision support dashboard including groundwater volume shrimp farm area demand for irrigated agriculture and total gdp as graph outputs and indicative of the case study s sustainability slider keys are responsible for the tp s morphology as the model s inputs and interventions fig 5 by sliding the parameters within their range decision makers can examine groundwater sustainability which has already been defined as the situation where expected gdp can be met without harming groundwater resources in response to various tp morphologies a sensitivity analysis has been conducted using two batches of data including tp s morphologies for three responsible parameters fig s2 and groundwater volume for corresponding morphologies fig s3 initially the model was run through the business as usual scenario keeping the development of irrigated agriculture and the t scenario launching the al policy based on the primary tp fig 3d until 2050 fig 5 despite the business as usual scenario the results indicate a promising future for the al policy in meeting 2050 s gdp targets fig 1c nonetheless it also shows grave repercussions for groundwater just like the business as usual scenario in the following the primary tp was manipulated in several shots for comparison purposes keeping the t scenario results as the benchmark in the next run parameter b is adjusted to assess the response to shifting the tp kick off time therefore the primary tp was duplicated twice with a four year deviation in its kicking off time attributed to s1 the earlier one and s2 the latter the results indicate that the kicking off time of transition matters in the policy success of bringing groundwater sustainability fig 6 this conclusion has been reached since the s1 scenario has produced much more satisfactory results than s2 maintaining groundwater volume at a higher level without causing an economic collapse this suggests accelerating the transition s start time would yield more desirable results similarly in the next shot the comparison is taken place for tps with different tangent point angles tps have been designed by sliding parameter a that produces s1 and s2 scenarios fig 6 the s1 scenario has a tp that began in 1996 and has a smoother acceleration phase than the t scenario on the way to total transformation while s2 which began in 2027 maintains a tp with a sharper acceleration phase than s1 and t in doing so applying the generated scenarios indicates that the groundwater could have experienced greater sustainability if the transition had begun earlier than 2020 in 1996 s1 scenario additionally that could have made launching the al policy much easier since the less slope for the acceleration phase the easier it is to implement the transformation löhr and mattes 2022 despite a sharper tangent point angle than s1 the s2 scenario lagged behind s1 in sustaining groundwater resources fig 7 during this comparison round it was demonstrated that tangent point angles significantly impact the al policy s success the fourth comparison batch examined how much targeted transformation contributed to groundwater sustainability this is accomplished by generating two scenarios each starting from the same launching point as the t scenario but with different targeted transformations by 2050 thus s1 and s2 scenarios were generated whereas both have a faster acceleration phase than t according to the results setting tp on the maximum expected transformation is not enough to guarantee the success of the al policy according to fig 8 while the t scenario has failed in ceasing groundwater depletion the s1 scenario has overcome it even with the same amount of targeted transformation on top of that the s2 scenario based on a tp that is set at less targeted transformation than that of the t scenario reflects the more satisfying results upon a well designed tp s morphology according to the results from the fifth batch of comparison runs shortfalls in one phase of a tp can be compensated if the other phases are well designed that is substantiated by results mapped in fig 9 that shows how the s2 scenario with a tp kicking off with a significant delay and targeting less transformation compared to s1 catches up with s1 in terms of ceasing groundwater depletion by raising its tp s tangent point angle it ensures that with the right set of kicking off time and tangent point angle the region can overcome its weakness in materialising the total expected transformation to cope with groundwater depletion generally the results affirm the crucial role of tp s morphology in al s success in saving groundwater volume in the simplified case study representing critical points for al policy success these raised points are what papachristos 2019 referred to as the potential of system dynamics for transition research in terms of methodology and case study research the results explore the most fundamental ability of system dynamics to understand and model a system s structure which is responsible for its dynamic behaviour in support of that the results indicate how feedback structure and shifting power between reinforcing and balancing loops of the cld governing the groundwater and economy in the case study can change our expectations of a tp s performance in the long term for instance despite common belief one can perceive that targeting even a high amount of transformation towards promoting productivity does not guarantee the best outputs unless designing an appropriate tp mapping such externalities owes to the system dynamics ability to unveil non linear causal relations governed by reinforcing and balancing forces which are inseparable characteristics of technology disruptions in socio technical systems 3 2 limitations and avenues to pursue to answer if tps morphology matters in the al policy success this study has simplified and scrutinised a tp that leads to replacing irrigated agriculture with the shrimp industry in saving groundwater depletion and economic prosperity in the long term nonetheless tps also capture the co development of social economic policy and behavioural factors proposed for future studies moradi and vagnoni 2018 thus there are some significant limitations associated with this study that are appreciated in the following from three vantage points co flows associated with tps one of the frequently mentioned strength points of system dynamics modelling in previous efforts has been its ability to map co development mechanisms such as social economic and political ones associated with any change in the system over time holtz et al 2015 bolwig et al 2019 this ability equips users to unveil feedback oriented behaviour as a result of any intervention in the system on the other hand the changes in each phase of tps including predevelopment takeoff acceleration and stabilisation may be associated with unintended feedback thus the model should capture many more co development mechanisms associated with each phase of tps including co flows of stocks and flows that influence tps performance in the long term consequently this vein still has ample space for further model development uncertainties of exogenous factors groundwater management is marked by significant human and environmental uncertainties which play a leading role in shaping tps not to mention their performance on the ground according to its outline the paper examines the tps morphology on the success of the al policy rather than concentrating on uncertainties affecting tps nevertheless external forces like climate change bailey and wilson 2009 eisenhauer 2016 politics breetz et al 2018 and international attitudes can substantially affect the tps morphology and performance in this way such political uncertainty should be addressed in evaluating tps performance which remains unsubstantiated here adopted system dynamics modelling approach here a command and control system dynamics model was used to assess tps morphology which is highly aligned with how central governments operate however tps should be unfolded due to the continuous struggles of leading actors over policy goals and instruments mcdowall 2014 de koning et al 2021 the interaction with a broad range of actors including stakeholders managers and transition scholars who play a leading role in welcoming and settling for the tps on the ground has been left behind by this modelling approach the transition management literature emphasises the necessity for learning in the process of causing a change to become sustainable luederitz et al 2017 van mierlo et al 2020 goyal and howlett 2020 however the command and control modelling approach has fewer concerns with this matter consequently that asks for supporting the current model by conducting participatory methods such as participatory research action research shared knowledge creation or combinations of models and participation de koning et al 2021 4 conclusions and implications in response to whether the morphology of s shaped tp influences the al policy in controlling groundwater depletion this paper adopted a system dynamics modelling approach for this reason three parameters have been introduced each responsible for specific attributes of a tp s morphology the makran region of iran suffering from severe groundwater depletion was adopted to examine the argument accordingly the results suggested a general direction for designing the tp s morphology to increase the effectiveness of the al policy in the region setting forward the starting point of the transition decreasing the capacity building process s period and considering the maximum amount of change at the stabilising phase of transition were introduced as courses of action to reach the ideal outcomes in addition the paper showed that the decision makers well dominance over the morphology of the tp was able to compensate for possible weak points in the transition phases according to this article launching al policies should not be based solely on targeting maximum productivity the tp needs to be designed in a way that is relevant to the situation this is highly dependent on many factors intertwined with social aspects not considered in the study as a result designing a tp in a command and control way is not enough integrating the issue into a socio technical framework is important because each tp has a specific socio economic morphology tp should be derived from an interactive process involving a broad spectrum of policymakers and stakeholders for that purpose the author suggests a process based on participatory system dynamics psd stave 2010 in which stakeholders especially farmers can use the approach to map out a tp for launching the al that produces the best results in this way tps could be mapped in a participatory manner this approach might be taken to the next level if neglected factors of possible uncertainties such as climate change politics and international instability etc are concerned for future efforts the author suggests considering these factors interacting with stakeholders through psd declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement i greatly appreciate the three reviewers substantial comments which have helped me improve

11681,the article explores the adsorption of fluoride in groundwater and the synergistic properties of a mixture of bone char and biochar the bone char and biochar were produced using cattle bones and coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernel in a locally constructed double barrel retort with particle size ranging from 0 05 to 0 315 mm the morphology of the char was examined using a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy for elements the surface functional groups were assessed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy almost all the fluoride was removed from the groundwater within 15 27 min of column treatment cattle bone char standalone treatment was the most effective adsorbent with a removal rate of 91 4 which is almost identical to the integrated removal rate of 91 1 for bone char and coconut husk biochar the presence of the hydroxyapatite groups in the bone char together with the high surface areas of the chars increased the integrated bed s effectiveness in lowering fluoride concentrations in contaminated groundwater from 3 6 mg l to 1 5 mg l with an adsorption capacity of 0 084 mg g the breakthrough curves were predicted with the bed depth service time model under the same operational conditions the integrated bed showed almost 100 efficacy in removing fluoride from contaminated groundwater with a 3 6 mg l fluoride concentration within a breakthrough time of 15 27 min this was due to the interplay between the chars high surface areas and the hydroxyapatite groups in the bone char which enhance adsorption and the synergistic effect of the integrated char graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated char contaminated groundwater adsorption fluoride competing anions data availability the article contains data generated or analysed throughout the research any additional data needed can be given on request 1 introduction the provision of safe drinking water remains a significant public health concern in regions where fluoride f toxicity has been prevalent historically ijumulana et al 2022 fluoride is widely distributed in the environment due to its geogenic nature while it is an essential micronutrient f is also an inorganic geogenic contaminant in groundwater that poses a significant risk to human health bretzler anja and annette 2015 f is one of the naturally occurring elements found in the earth s crust and is present in varying concentrations in water it makes up about 0 06 0 09 of the crust and is the 13th most abundant element sunkari et al 2022 it is enriched in alkali granite and metamorphic bedrock aquifers fluoride bearing minerals such as fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f villiaumite naf cryolite na3alf6 topaz al2sio4 f oh 2 and silicates such as the phyllosilicates of illite mica and amphibole minerals group su et al 2013 interactions between f bearing rocks or minerals and the groundwater under suitable conditions e g ph release the f into the water as a geogenic contaminant bretzler anja and annette 2015 su et al 2013 the presence of f in groundwater can be augmented by human activities like irrigation surface water flows and the application of phosphate fertilizers li et al 2020 high levels of f in groundwater fluoride 1 5 mg l has attracted worldwide attention because of its serious adverse health effects hossain and patra 2020 li et al 2020 su et al 2013 prolonged consumption of f contaminated groundwater with high concentration levels can result in health issues affecting various systems and organs including bones teeth the reproductive system kidneys nervous system digestive system and endocrine system alarcón herrera et al 2020 these health problems can cause peripheral nerve damage digestive problems diabetes kidney issues liver enlargement reduced bone marrow function high blood pressure and heart disease alarcón herrera et al 2020 concentrations exceeding 4 mg l can lead to male sterility skeletal fluorosis teeth mottling bone disease and ligament calcification other effects include painful skin rashes crippling deformities osteosclerosis childhood intellectual impairment and mental retardation or neurological manifestation hossain and patra 2020 nabbou et al 2019 according to alarcón herrera et al 2020 exposure to high f levels in groundwater may result in a decrease in birth rates thyroid function and the ability to regulate glucose levels however f levels between 0 7 and 1 2 mg l are beneficial fung et al 2021 about 200 million people drink groundwater with f concentration exceeding the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l kut et al 2016 and the most affected are people in water stressed areas over 18 african countries have recorded excess f in groundwater but community wide treatment practices for f contamination are limited kut et al 2016 in our recent study araya et al 2022 we found that the savelugu nanton district in ghana is the most severely affected by high levels of f in groundwater followed by the karaga district the bongo and kassena nankana west districts also have notably high levels of f 1 5 mg l the primary causes of elevated f levels in groundwater in these areas are the geology of the region and high evapotranspiration rates araya et al 2022 a recent review of the issue of high f concentration in groundwater in ghana showed that f is released when fluoride bearing rocks or minerals interact with water under alkaline and arid conditions sunkari et al 2022 in the northern region of ghana the minerals albite and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins are the main sources of f sunkari et al 2022 the use of geostatistical models to study f contamination of groundwater resources in ghana confirmed that the interaction between water and rocks as well as the effects of climate change are the primary factors contributing to high levels of fluoride in the north araya et al 2022 it should be noted that many of the communities in ghana where high levels of f in groundwater have been observed are poorly resourced therefore it is crucial to identify practical and feasible approaches that use locally available adsorbents and involve active community participation to address this problem in this regard the use of bone and biochar bed units for groundwater defluoridation may prove to be valuable kut et al 2016 bone and biochar on their own have proven capabilities in the removal of f through the adsorption process he et al 2020 in particular bone char made from sheep and cattle bones has been used effectively in removing f alkurdi et al 2020 medellin castillo et al 2014 moussavi et al 2022 biochar can also be made from a variety of organic materials such as wood chips agricultural waste e g coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernels and even manure as these organic materials are readily available and considered a waste in ghana using an integrated bone and biochar bed made from these materials for the adsorption of f in groundwater is both economically and environmentally sound compared to using bone char alone however there is a lack of research on the integration of bone and biochar for f adsorption from groundwater the study uses a combination of bone char and biochar to treat fluoride contaminated groundwater in an effort to provide a sustainable alternative solution therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the synergistic effects of integrating bone char and biochar and their impact on the adsorption of f and other competing anions in actual groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two sets of transparent water filter cartridge housing 1 4 inch water purifier t33 shell filter measuring 22 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter were used four biomass coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernels based biochar and char made from cattle bones were screened in addition to river sand for the experiment the wood based biochar and bone char were produced locally using a double barrel retort by pyrolysis at 450 c the chars were ground graded into various particles using mortar and pestle and were sieved with an impact motorised sieve shaker iso 3310 1 2000 to collect the fraction of 0 005 0 05 0 315 2 5 and 5 mm different particle sizes the 0 05 and 0 315 mm particles were selected for the column investigations based on the batch adsorption study michael et al 2022 that showed the f 0 05 and 0 315 mm factions had the best adsorption the fractions were then rinsed with deionised water to remove powdered particles and oven dried thereafter finally the prepared chars were tailored for integrated fixed bed adsorption studies to remediate f contaminated groundwater from bongo in ghana 2 2 characterization of bone char and biochar the nacl salt addition method was used to determine the point of zero charge pzc fifty 50 ml of nacl 0 1 m solution was freshly prepared in ten 250 ml conical flasks the ph of the nacl solution was varied from ph 3 to 12 by adding naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 1 m solution about 0 3 g of the char was added to each solution in the 250 ml conical flasks the mixtures were shaken using shel lab s16 s16r orbital shaking incubator at 25 c and 150 rpm for 24 h the final phs of the solutions were determined after filtering using 0 45 μm pore size membranes with fisherbrand fb 70155 suction pump the changes in ph were plotted to obtain the pzc the morphology of the bone char and the four chosen biochars was examined using a tescan vega 3 xmu scanning electron microscope sem and their elemental compositions were determined using energy spectroscopy eds the brunauer emmett teller bet model using helium adsorption was used to estimate the surface areas of the bone and bio chars the micropore volume was determined from n2 adsorption data using the t method the functional groups were examined using the perkinelmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer 2 3 integrated filtration bed unit fixed bed column experiments were conducted in four transparent water filter cartridge housings each with a length of 22 cm length and 4 cm internal diameter water purifier t33 shell filter the adsorbents in a mass ratio of bone to biochar as indicated in table 1 were dry packed in a treatment column set between 2 cm 15 g river sand plugs at the entrance and outlet of that column until the total required bed heights of 6 10 12 and 15 cm were obtained the choice of adsorbents mass ratio i e for the bone and biochar was decided by the results of a pre test or a series of iterations performed to guide the design of the experiment the 2 cm 15 g river sand wads were done to keep the adsorbents in place or avoid floating and prevent particles from migrating with the exit flow the other two columns were dry packed with only river sand 8 5 cm each and were fixed in between the treatment column from the source water f contaminated groundwater and the fourth column as a tank treated water storage in series fig 1 the t33 shell filter s delicate filter mesh cover effectively prevented the dissolved particles from escaping into the treated water the two river sand packed columns also served as rough filtration units between the f contaminated source water and the treated water with the fourth plastic column serving as a storage tank a control column without combined bone char and biochar river sand only confirmed no f loss to the river sand column components the average inflow concentration was constant for all the fixed bed studies because actual groundwater containing f 3 6 mg l was used for the experiments a peristaltic pump was used to pump the natural groundwater containing 3 6 mg l of f upwards through the columns at a rate of 130 ml min the f removal efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the initial co mg l and residual f concentration ct mg l based on eqn 1 1 r c o c t c o 100 2 4 effect of mass ratios of bone char and biochar on the integrated char f adsorption the effects of bone char and biochar mass ratios on the f adsorption of the integrated char were investigated by varying the mass ratios of the materials from 25 to 70 g standalone bone char and biochar were also evaluated the column experiments were conducted at 25 2 c as explained in section 2 3 2 5 fixed bed adsorption modelling of integrated bone and biochar 2 5 1 mass transfer modelling the area of the packed column where active adsorption occurs in a packed bed system is known as the mass transfer zone mtz díaz blancas et al 2020 the adsorbate passes through the mtz of the packed bed till it reaches its breakthrough point when a pre set level of the adsorbate in the effluent is reached the length of the active adsorption zone in the column can be calculated using eqn 2 2 m t z h t s t b t s where h is the height of the bed cm tb is the breakthrough time min and ts is the exhaustion time min which is typically the time the effluent concentration reaches 95 i e c co 0 95 of the inlet concentration 2 5 2 modelling contaminant breakthrough the adsorbent first reached saturation and the most significant amount of f was initially removed under continuous flow after the adsorption zone ascended until it reached the bed s exit and over time the adsorbate concentration in the effluent equalled that of the influent equilibrium the final to initial concentration ratios ct co versus time t or the collected effluent volumes v form the breakthrough curve borna et al 2016 the breakthrough point in this study was determined based on who s recommended level for f in drinking water 1 5 mg l and the exhaustion time was chosen when the treated water concentration was 70 of the initial 3 6 mg l of the natural groundwater as a result the breakthrough time t was established when the f concentration in the column outlet reached 1 5 mg l as shown in eqn 3 below the column capacity at the breakthrough point was calculated 3 q c c o m 0 v t 1 c t c o d v where co and ct are the influent and effluent concentrations mg l respectively qc is the column capacity at breakthrough mg g vt ml is the volume of the contaminated solution that passed through the column at time t the effectiveness of the integrated char was assessed using the empty bed contact time ebct model and integrated usage rate ur the period during which the f was in contact with the integrated bone and biochar bed as the influent contaminant is referred to as ebct vimal et al 2019 the ebct for bed heights 6 10 and 12 cm was calculated as the ratio of the bed volume to the flow rate using eqn 4 4 e b c t v c q a c z q where vc cm3 is the volume of the packed column q ml min is the flow rate ac is the cross sectional area and z is bed height cm the bed volume is the ratio of the weight of the integrated char to its bulk density and was

cross sectional area as shown in eqn 4 above however the ebct can be determined using the bed depth as in eqn 6 6 e b c t b e d d e p t h c m l i n e a r v e l o c i t y c m min the integrated adsorbent usage rate ur was calculated using eqn 7 7 u r m g b r e a k t h r o u g h v o l u m e l where m is the mass of integrated char in the column 2 5 3 bed depth service time model hutchin s simplification of the bed depth service time bdst approach in 1973 was based on the work of bohart and adams saatçi and oulman 1980 the bdst was used to examine the behaviour and column performances of the integrated bone and biochar packed bed adsorbents in the removal of f from groundwater huang et al 2022 for the bdst model the surface reaction between the f and the unused integrated bone and biochar capacity determines the adsorption rate it can also be used to predict the longevity of the adsorbent in the bed unit before its replacement the adams bohart model describes the column adsorption data and the breakthrough curve kundu and gupta 2007 the adams bohart method however requires at least nine different column tests to gather the necessary laboratory data which takes time to collect the required data however the bdst modelling technique only requires three column tests maji et al 2007 this implies that the bench scale treatment should include at least three integrated chars of various depths running at the same flow rate until the same breakpoint concentration is obtained the adams bohart equation can be simplified as eqn 8 8 ln c o c t 1 k b a n o z u k b a c o t where co is the initial f concentration ct is the column breakthrough concentration at breakthrough time t kba is the a b rate coefficient n o is the adsorption capacity of the integrated char z is the bed depth and u is the superficial pore groundwater velocity plotting ln co c 1 against time t kba can be calculated from the slope of the graph and n o from the y intercept for the bdst model z and t of a column exhibits linear relationship vinodhini and das 2010 therefore the bdst equation is rearranged from the adams bohart model chu 2020 huang et al 2022 the bdst can be expressed as eqn 9 9 t n o z c o u 1 k a c o ln c o c t 1 where t is bed service time min ct is the f concentration mg l at the breakthrough time z is the bed depth cm or height n0 is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent or the storage capacity of the integrated char mg l u is the linear velocity cm min ka is the bdst rate constant l mg min n0 can be estimated from the slope of the bdst plot with initial concentration c0 and a constant linear velocity u for the column operation the rate constant ka which represents the rate of adsorption from the water phase to the adsorbent phase can be derived from the intercept of the bdst plot kumar et al 2019 the critical bed depth z0 at t 0 was calculated this z0 is the theoretical value of the adsorbent material used in this investigation bone char and biochar therefore at t 0 z0 eqn 8 rewritten as eqn 10 below 10 z o u k o n o ln c o c t 1 2 5 4 adsorption kinetics of packed bed column the adsorbent masses were varied for the kinetic studies 25 50 and 60 g the time required for an adsorbent dose to attain the who recommended value of 1 5 mg l was investigated at 5 10 15 20 30 35 40 and 45 min respectively 2 5 5 effect of bed depth on f uptake fixed bed experiments seek to lower the concentration of f ions and other competing ions in the groundwater not surpassing their breakthrough concentrations therefore with an initial concentration of 3 6 mg l and flow velocity of 130 ml min experiments were conducted to assess the effect of bed height at 6 10 and 12 cm 3 competing anions groundwater naturally contains a variety of anions and the presence of these competing anions can impact the ability of f to be removed through adsorption in order to study the effects of competing anions i e cl no3 so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 on f adsorption by an integrated bone and biochar bed the concentrations of these ions were measured before and after treatment 3 1 analytical methods for f and competing anions f was measured using the spadns method applicable in the range 0 10 2 00 mg f l with a detection limit of 0 005 mg l f reacts with zirconium to generate a colourless complex that bleaches red in proportion to the f concentration in the water f calibration curves were created using standard f solutions the 2017 standard method was used to determine the concentration of competing anions such as bicarbonate carbonate chloride nitrate nitrite phosphate and sulphate in groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 ph and point of zero charge the ph of the treated water ranged from 7 2 to 8 5 but the raw water was 7 5 7 7 throughout the experiments the ph of the integrated char was highly alkaline 8 50 with the bone char 7 80 the coconut husks 9 16 neem tree 8 84 bamboo 8 77 and distilled water 5 84 the surface of the adsorbent is mostly negatively charged when the solution ph is greater than phpzc while the opposite is true when ph is lower than phpzc kooh et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the point of zero charge followed a similar trend with bone char 7 7 coconut husks char 8 3 and the integrated char as 8 0 the fact that the pzc values were slightly lower than their ph values suggests that the surface of the char accumulates positive charges and that negatively charged ions can be drawn to the surface from the solution facilitating their adsorption 4 1 2 characterization of chars the morphology and images of the bone char and the four chosen biochars from sem are shown in fig 3 the findings proved that each biochar had some irregular fragments an uneven distribution of particle sizes and porous surfaces that would be advantageous for the adsorption of f and the competing anions compared to the more porous cattle bone char the surface of the coconut husk was more irregular and extremely rough neem trees and bamboo have more honeycomb like surfaces than coconut husk which is also fractured and uneven like cattle bone the river sand and palm kernel shell are quite broken and abrasive fig 3 the detailed elemental compositions of the chosen biochar and the cattle bone char as determined by the eds peaks are displayed in table 2 and fig 4 the elemental composition of the cattle bone char was o 43 ca 34 p 16 and c 6 7 while the coconut husks were also made up of c 59 4 k 21 5 cl 13 1 o 5 2 p 0 4 and na 0 4 as observed in the ftir spectra fig 5 all the chars contained a strong broad peak between 3434 and 3400 cm 1 ascribed to the oh stretch vibrations on their surfaces all the biochars exhibited similar peaks around 2925 2424 cm 1 which were absent in the bone char and confirmed as symmetric c h of the aliphatic ch2 stretch the bone and all the biochar displayed characteristic adsorption bands at 1400 1595 and 871 875 cm 1 indicating the cc stretch and c h bending vibrations respectively in a previous study lam et al 2019 the absorption bands at 1034 1098 cm 1 was attributed to the c o stretch vibrations the 1636 1386 cm 1 bands attest to carboxylic c cooh and phenolic o h respectively eduah et al 2020 according to a study by hou et al 2019 the absorption bands observed at 1637 1400 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of functional groups such as c o cn and co another prominent band seen at 875 cm 1 is attributed to carbonate eduah et al 2020 except for bone char the peak seen at 754 712 cm 1 is associated with aromatic c h bend the asymmetric vibrations of phosphorus and oxygen in the po4 3 wavelengths show groups in the bone char at 603 563 cm 1 michael et al 2022 shahid et al 2019 the peak at 470 cm 1 in the bone char was ascribed to the symmetric bending vibrations in the po4 3 patel et al 2015 shahid et al 2019 the 657 413 cm 1 peak can each be attributed to the vibration of oh distortion and c o stretching and they all show that biochar contains phenolic groups and alcohols the cattle bone char had a bet surface area of 105 02 02 m2 g a single point total pore volume of 0 3301 m3 g a micropore area of 38 384 m2 g and an external area of 66 640 m2 g the coconut husk s bet surface area and single point total pore volume were 43 38 0 59 m2 g and 0 0384 m3 g respectively while its micropore area and external area were 28 639 m2 g and 14 745 m2 g respectively bamboo neem tree and palm kernel shell all had bet surface areas and single point total pore volumes of 40 55 1 14 30 83 1 26 and 0 45 0 03 m2 g and 0 0690 0 0584 and 0 1682 m3 g respectively the palm kernel shell char produced using a locally designed retort was found to be subpar or below standard quality possibly due to the amount used exceeding the retort s capacity the river sand s surface area was 0 91 0 02 m2 g and the single point total pore volume of 0 1716 m3 g the cattle bone char and coconut husks were chosen for the integrated bone and biochar bed unit due to their favourable surface chemistry and chemical properties 4 2 adsorption capacity and effect of mass integration of the bone and biochar 4 2 1 adsorption capacity of the integrated char the adsorption ability the ratios of the mass of the adsorbate mg and the mass of the adsorbent g decreased when the area exposed to adsorption increased with the increasing adsorbent dose alghamdi et al 2019 mohan et al 2017 a noticeable decrease in the adsorption capacity of the integrated char was observed as the mass increased fig 6 this implies that an increase in the mass of the integrated char led to a high removal rate of f from groundwater the occupation of f in the available pores of the char brought about a decrease in its adsorption capacity because adsorption capacity is directly proportional to the volume and inversely proportional to its mass the char s adsorption isotherm demonstrated chemical mechanisms and their kinetics and thermodynamics revealed that the f was taken up by the integrated bone char and biochar bed in a spontaneous and exothermic process controlled by chemisorption michael et al 2022 understanding the impact of ph is critical since it directly influences the electrostatic interactions between the integrated char surface and the f the fact that the pzc value was slightly lower than its ph value phpzc ph suggests that the surface of the char accumulates positive charges and that negatively charged ions were drawn to the surface from the groundwater solution facilitating their adsorption therefore the anionic f may be attracted to positively charged integrated char surface and this observation points to ionic interactions with the adsorbents kooh et al 2018 4 2 2 comparison of the effectiveness of the individual chars and the integrated char the results of the synergy between cattle bone and coconut husk biochar with the support of river sand for rough filtration are presented in table 3 the effects of mass variations on f removal efficiency was also studied the f removal efficiency is shown in table 3 as a percentage at the beginning of the treatment ci mg l and the end cr mg l as expected there was no impact from the river sand as far as the f removal was concerned because the river sand had a poor surface area 0 91 0 02 m2 g and 0 1716 m3 g single point total pore volume as explained earlier the integrated bone and biochar bed was as effective adsorbent as the bone char only when 70 g each was used cattle bone char alone was the most effective adsorbent with a removal rate of 91 4 nearly identical to the combined removal rate of 91 1 for bone char and coconut husk biochar the bone char contains hydroxyapatite which is an anion exchange material and therefore effectively removed the f better than the other chars as indicated earlier at 4 1 2 and in our recent study michael et al 2022 the cattle bone biochar showed higher efficiency than the other biochar because of its better total pore volume pore diameter and bet surface area which were better than the other biochar produced under same conditions the standalone coconuts husks with a bed height of 9 5 cm and mass of 35 g performed poorly compared to their integrated version again f adsorption increased with increasing mass of the adsorbent both integrated and standalone chars the combined bone and biochar bed is preferable to using bone char alone for the adsorption of f in groundwater because coconut husks are freely available in ghana and constitute a nuisance to the environment 5 fixed bed columns adsorption and breakthrough models 5 1 mass transfer model for integrated bone char and biochar the estimated mass transfer zones mtz for the different bed heights are shown in table 5 the column exhaustion concentration i e c co 0 7 was used to estimate the mtz the results show that for the same influent concentration of 3 6 mg l and a volumetric rate of 130 ml min the mtz increased with increasing bed height 6 12 cm indicating a longer lifespan of the column similar observations were made by mani and bhandari 2022 who studied the adsorption of f at bed heights of 2 8 cm 5 2 bdst models fixed bed continuous flow experiments are crucial for enhancing the design and operation of large scale adsorption processes and for estimating the breakthrough curve which defines the functional lifetime of the adsorbent ramirez et al 2018 at a fixed rate of 130 ml min and predetermined bed heights of 6 10 and 12 cm the breakthrough curve for f adsorption by the integrated bone and biochar bed was performed at an initial natural groundwater concentration of 3 6 mg l the bdst model equation was used to plot the graph of t versus z as shown in fig 7 however the adsorption of f from groundwater onto integrated char requires intricate and time consuming rate limiting processes hence data points are not in a straight line from the origin fig 7a nidheesh et al 2013 table 5 also displays all the values for the bdst constant parameters the linear plot of the bdst model was used to calculate the kinetic rate constant ka saturation concentration no and minimum column height zo it has been noted that when bed height increases so do the breakthrough time and exhaustion time no ka and zo had values of 83 3 mg l 0 48 and 0 09 cm respectively fig 8 shows the initial s shaped curves for different experimental value breakthroughs for the integrated chars as shown in fig 7 b c and d the breakthrough curves were time dependent for ct co with f removal across the column at the breakthrough point for a bed height of 6 cm 540 ml of water was treated with a 0 07 l bed volume bv an empty bed contact time of 0 58 min and the breakthrough capacity qc was determined to be 0 084 mg g it was clear from fig 7 c and d that bed heights of 10 and 12 cm had breakthrough curves that were not particularly steep indicating that their bed exhaustion did not occur quickly as a result these beds were more cost effective than a bed with a height of 6 cm table 4 displays all the breakthrough time bed volumes and empty bed contact times at various bed heights based on the findings it can be said that breakthrough time increased as bed height increased this is primarily the outcome of the adsorbent s porosity the bigger pore size of the integrated bone and biochar bed adsorbent led to a higher number of active sites in the adsorbent to adsorb the excess f the adsorption capacity and removal effectiveness determinants were integrated char loading and porosity 5 3 adsorption kinetics of packed bed column as shown in figs 8 and 9 the initial adsorption rate was high after 5 min almost 80 of the total f was removed the adsorption capacity then increased gradually over the contact time until it reached 35 min and then remained constant the findings suggest that the integrated bone char and biochar bed removed f effectively to the who guideline value 1 5 mg l within 12 27 min on average for all the bed depths fig 8 in this work the influence of time on various bed heights for the kinetics of f removal was assessed at a concentration of 3 6 mg l the initial concentration of the f and the bed heights during the chemical reaction were both highly correlated with the adsorption kinetics of f mosavi et al 2021 as seen in fig 8 the integrated char bed heights were proportional to their mass the who acceptable value of 1 5 mg l for f was reached at 16 23 and 27 min respectively for bed heights of 6 10 and 12 cm because the absorbate had more time for contact interactions with the integrated char at a higher bed height of 12 cm compared to 6 cm the bed height had an impact on the kinetics of flow rate and the breakthrough time decreased as the bed height increased the findings fig 6 show that within 15 min the amounts of f detected were 1 36 mg l bed height of 6 cm 0 95 mg l bed height of 10 cm and 0 81 mg l bed height of 12 cm due to the large surface area and minimal flow resistance with a bed height of 6 cm as opposed to 12 cm the f adsorption equilibrium was quickly established the f were stored on the external surface of integrated char which had a higher bed height and greater interior surfaces the concentration of f in the groundwater drops dramatically within 5 min to 0 78 mg l bed height of 6 cm 0 80 mg l bed height of 10 cm and 0 32 mg l bed height of 12 cm due to the unoccupied available empty pores space on the integrated char and surface area 5 4 effect of bed depth on f uptake using contaminated groundwater with an initial f concentration of 3 6 mg l and a flow velocity of 130 ml min the effects of bed height on breakthrough time bt at 6 10 and 12 cm were determined as shown in table 5 the impact of flow rates using 150 300 and 500 ml min models indicates that breakthrough time decreases as the flow rate increases because the absorbate does not have sufficient contact interactions with the integrated char the observation was confirmed in the study of f adsorption using coconut husk biochar talat et al 2018 6 competing anions in the first 15 min most of the fluoride phosphate and bicarbonate were adsorbed by the integrated cattle bone char and coconut biochar materials figs 9 and 10 depict the f removal amid competing anions as seen by the decrease in f uptake and increases in the adsorption of bicarbonate and phosphate onto the integrated char bicarbonate and phosphate had the most significant competitive impacts on f fig 9 the sulphate nitrate and chloride anions had no apparent effect on the fluoride s capacity to bind to the integrated char the integrated char leaves nitrate sulphate and chloride in the groundwater intact while removing fluoride bicarbonate and phosphate the combination of the cattle bone char and biochar might release phosphate into the groundwater because of phosphate residues in the bone char remarkably f adsorption was not affected by the presence of the competing anions until the integrated char reached saturation 7 conclusion fixed upward flow adsorption columns were used to study the effects of time adsorbent dosage and column height on the removal of f from groundwater integrated bone and biochar bed efficiently removed f in 5 min amid competing ions in bench scale continuous adsorption experiments reaching the most excellent adsorption capacity of 0 084 mg g for a bed depth of 6 cm and volumetric flow rate of 130 ml min experimental integrated bed column operations were well fitted to the bdst model r2 0 99 the findings established that the fluoride that remained in the water after treatment was within the 1 5 mg l who guideline for drinking water higher bed depth and lower flow rates favoured the f adsorption by the integrated system the integrated char from bones and biomass materials has a synergistic property that makes it an efficient adsorbent for groundwater defluorination the capacity of low cost bone char and biochar to bind f leads to the conclusion that f can be removed from groundwater using an integrated bed column operation hence a combined bone and biochar bed unit is recommended for bench scale removal of f from actual groundwater in adsorption columns in the presence of interfering anions a follow up field pilot scale experiment will be conducted to investigate the effects of other

11681,the article explores the adsorption of fluoride in groundwater and the synergistic properties of a mixture of bone char and biochar the bone char and biochar were produced using cattle bones and coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernel in a locally constructed double barrel retort with particle size ranging from 0 05 to 0 315 mm the morphology of the char was examined using a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy for elements the surface functional groups were assessed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy almost all the fluoride was removed from the groundwater within 15 27 min of column treatment cattle bone char standalone treatment was the most effective adsorbent with a removal rate of 91 4 which is almost identical to the integrated removal rate of 91 1 for bone char and coconut husk biochar the presence of the hydroxyapatite groups in the bone char together with the high surface areas of the chars increased the integrated bed s effectiveness in lowering fluoride concentrations in contaminated groundwater from 3 6 mg l to 1 5 mg l with an adsorption capacity of 0 084 mg g the breakthrough curves were predicted with the bed depth service time model under the same operational conditions the integrated bed showed almost 100 efficacy in removing fluoride from contaminated groundwater with a 3 6 mg l fluoride concentration within a breakthrough time of 15 27 min this was due to the interplay between the chars high surface areas and the hydroxyapatite groups in the bone char which enhance adsorption and the synergistic effect of the integrated char graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated char contaminated groundwater adsorption fluoride competing anions data availability the article contains data generated or analysed throughout the research any additional data needed can be given on request 1 introduction the provision of safe drinking water remains a significant public health concern in regions where fluoride f toxicity has been prevalent historically ijumulana et al 2022 fluoride is widely distributed in the environment due to its geogenic nature while it is an essential micronutrient f is also an inorganic geogenic contaminant in groundwater that poses a significant risk to human health bretzler anja and annette 2015 f is one of the naturally occurring elements found in the earth s crust and is present in varying concentrations in water it makes up about 0 06 0 09 of the crust and is the 13th most abundant element sunkari et al 2022 it is enriched in alkali granite and metamorphic bedrock aquifers fluoride bearing minerals such as fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f villiaumite naf cryolite na3alf6 topaz al2sio4 f oh 2 and silicates such as the phyllosilicates of illite mica and amphibole minerals group su et al 2013 interactions between f bearing rocks or minerals and the groundwater under suitable conditions e g ph release the f into the water as a geogenic contaminant bretzler anja and annette 2015 su et al 2013 the presence of f in groundwater can be augmented by human activities like irrigation surface water flows and the application of phosphate fertilizers li et al 2020 high levels of f in groundwater fluoride 1 5 mg l has attracted worldwide attention because of its serious adverse health effects hossain and patra 2020 li et al 2020 su et al 2013 prolonged consumption of f contaminated groundwater with high concentration levels can result in health issues affecting various systems and organs including bones teeth the reproductive system kidneys nervous system digestive system and endocrine system alarcón herrera et al 2020 these health problems can cause peripheral nerve damage digestive problems diabetes kidney issues liver enlargement reduced bone marrow function high blood pressure and heart disease alarcón herrera et al 2020 concentrations exceeding 4 mg l can lead to male sterility skeletal fluorosis teeth mottling bone disease and ligament calcification other effects include painful skin rashes crippling deformities osteosclerosis childhood intellectual impairment and mental retardation or neurological manifestation hossain and patra 2020 nabbou et al 2019 according to alarcón herrera et al 2020 exposure to high f levels in groundwater may result in a decrease in birth rates thyroid function and the ability to regulate glucose levels however f levels between 0 7 and 1 2 mg l are beneficial fung et al 2021 about 200 million people drink groundwater with f concentration exceeding the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l kut et al 2016 and the most affected are people in water stressed areas over 18 african countries have recorded excess f in groundwater but community wide treatment practices for f contamination are limited kut et al 2016 in our recent study araya et al 2022 we found that the savelugu nanton district in ghana is the most severely affected by high levels of f in groundwater followed by the karaga district the bongo and kassena nankana west districts also have notably high levels of f 1 5 mg l the primary causes of elevated f levels in groundwater in these areas are the geology of the region and high evapotranspiration rates araya et al 2022 a recent review of the issue of high f concentration in groundwater in ghana showed that f is released when fluoride bearing rocks or minerals interact with water under alkaline and arid conditions sunkari et al 2022 in the northern region of ghana the minerals albite and biotite in the bongo granitoids and pegmatite veins are the main sources of f sunkari et al 2022 the use of geostatistical models to study f contamination of groundwater resources in ghana confirmed that the interaction between water and rocks as well as the effects of climate change are the primary factors contributing to high levels of fluoride in the north araya et al 2022 it should be noted that many of the communities in ghana where high levels of f in groundwater have been observed are poorly resourced therefore it is crucial to identify practical and feasible approaches that use locally available adsorbents and involve active community participation to address this problem in this regard the use of bone and biochar bed units for groundwater defluoridation may prove to be valuable kut et al 2016 bone and biochar on their own have proven capabilities in the removal of f through the adsorption process he et al 2020 in particular bone char made from sheep and cattle bones has been used effectively in removing f alkurdi et al 2020 medellin castillo et al 2014 moussavi et al 2022 biochar can also be made from a variety of organic materials such as wood chips agricultural waste e g coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernels and even manure as these organic materials are readily available and considered a waste in ghana using an integrated bone and biochar bed made from these materials for the adsorption of f in groundwater is both economically and environmentally sound compared to using bone char alone however there is a lack of research on the integration of bone and biochar for f adsorption from groundwater the study uses a combination of bone char and biochar to treat fluoride contaminated groundwater in an effort to provide a sustainable alternative solution therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the synergistic effects of integrating bone char and biochar and their impact on the adsorption of f and other competing anions in actual groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two sets of transparent water filter cartridge housing 1 4 inch water purifier t33 shell filter measuring 22 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter were used four biomass coconut husks bamboo neem tree and palm kernels based biochar and char made from cattle bones were screened in addition to river sand for the experiment the wood based biochar and bone char were produced locally using a double barrel retort by pyrolysis at 450 c the chars were ground graded into various particles using mortar and pestle and were sieved with an impact motorised sieve shaker iso 3310 1 2000 to collect the fraction of 0 005 0 05 0 315 2 5 and 5 mm different particle sizes the 0 05 and 0 315 mm particles were selected for the column investigations based on the batch adsorption study michael et al 2022 that showed the f 0 05 and 0 315 mm factions had the best adsorption the fractions were then rinsed with deionised water to remove powdered particles and oven dried thereafter finally the prepared chars were tailored for integrated fixed bed adsorption studies to remediate f contaminated groundwater from bongo in ghana 2 2 characterization of bone char and biochar the nacl salt addition method was used to determine the point of zero charge pzc fifty 50 ml of nacl 0 1 m solution was freshly prepared in ten 250 ml conical flasks the ph of the nacl solution was varied from ph 3 to 12 by adding naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 1 m solution about 0 3 g of the char was added to each solution in the 250 ml conical flasks the mixtures were shaken using shel lab s16 s16r orbital shaking incubator at 25 c and 150 rpm for 24 h the final phs of the solutions were determined after filtering using 0 45 μm pore size membranes with fisherbrand fb 70155 suction pump the changes in ph were plotted to obtain the pzc the morphology of the bone char and the four chosen biochars was examined using a tescan vega 3 xmu scanning electron microscope sem and their elemental compositions were determined using energy spectroscopy eds the brunauer emmett teller bet model using helium adsorption was used to estimate the surface areas of the bone and bio chars the micropore volume was determined from n2 adsorption data using the t method the functional groups were examined using the perkinelmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer 2 3 integrated filtration bed unit fixed bed column experiments were conducted in four transparent water filter cartridge housings each with a length of 22 cm length and 4 cm internal diameter water purifier t33 shell filter the adsorbents in a mass ratio of bone to biochar as indicated in table 1 were dry packed in a treatment column set between 2 cm 15 g river sand plugs at the entrance and outlet of that column until the total required bed heights of 6 10 12 and 15 cm were obtained the choice of adsorbents mass ratio i e for the bone and biochar was decided by the results of a pre test or a series of iterations performed to guide the design of the experiment the 2 cm 15 g river sand wads were done to keep the adsorbents in place or avoid floating and prevent particles from migrating with the exit flow the other two columns were dry packed with only river sand 8 5 cm each and were fixed in between the treatment column from the source water f contaminated groundwater and the fourth column as a tank treated water storage in series fig 1 the t33 shell filter s delicate filter mesh cover effectively prevented the dissolved particles from escaping into the treated water the two river sand packed columns also served as rough filtration units between the f contaminated source water and the treated water with the fourth plastic column serving as a storage tank a control column without combined bone char and biochar river sand only confirmed no f loss to the river sand column components the average inflow concentration was constant for all the fixed bed studies because actual groundwater containing f 3 6 mg l was used for the experiments a peristaltic pump was used to pump the natural groundwater containing 3 6 mg l of f upwards through the columns at a rate of 130 ml min the f removal efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the initial co mg l and residual f concentration ct mg l based on eqn 1 1 r c o c t c o 100 2 4 effect of mass ratios of bone char and biochar on the integrated char f adsorption the effects of bone char and biochar mass ratios on the f adsorption of the integrated char were investigated by varying the mass ratios of the materials from 25 to 70 g standalone bone char and biochar were also evaluated the column experiments were conducted at 25 2 c as explained in section 2 3 2 5 fixed bed adsorption modelling of integrated bone and biochar 2 5 1 mass transfer modelling the area of the packed column where active adsorption occurs in a packed bed system is known as the mass transfer zone mtz díaz blancas et al 2020 the adsorbate passes through the mtz of the packed bed till it reaches its breakthrough point when a pre set level of the adsorbate in the effluent is reached the length of the active adsorption zone in the column can be calculated using eqn 2 2 m t z h t s t b t s where h is the height of the bed cm tb is the breakthrough time min and ts is the exhaustion time min which is typically the time the effluent concentration reaches 95 i e c co 0 95 of the inlet concentration 2 5 2 modelling contaminant breakthrough the adsorbent first reached saturation and the most significant amount of f was initially removed under continuous flow after the adsorption zone ascended until it reached the bed s exit and over time the adsorbate concentration in the effluent equalled that of the influent equilibrium the final to initial concentration ratios ct co versus time t or the collected effluent volumes v form the breakthrough curve borna et al 2016 the breakthrough point in this study was determined based on who s recommended level for f in drinking water 1 5 mg l and the exhaustion time was chosen when the treated water concentration was 70 of the initial 3 6 mg l of the natural groundwater as a result the breakthrough time t was established when the f concentration in the column outlet reached 1 5 mg l as shown in eqn 3 below the column capacity at the breakthrough point was calculated 3 q c c o m 0 v t 1 c t c o d v where co and ct are the influent and effluent concentrations mg l respectively qc is the column capacity at breakthrough mg g vt ml is the volume of the contaminated solution that passed through the column at time t the effectiveness of the integrated char was assessed using the empty bed contact time ebct model and integrated usage rate ur the period during which the f was in contact with the integrated bone and biochar bed as the influent contaminant is referred to as ebct vimal et al 2019 the ebct for bed heights 6 10 and 12 cm was calculated as the ratio of the bed volume to the flow rate using eqn 4 4 e b c t v c q a c z q where vc cm3 is the volume of the packed column q ml min is the flow rate ac is the cross sectional area and z is bed height cm the bed volume is the ratio of the weight of the integrated char to its bulk density and was calculated using eqn 5 5 v c w e i g h t o f i n t e g r a t e d c h a r g b u l k d e n s i t y o f i n t e g r a t e d c h a r g c m 3 vc can also be calculated using the bed height and column s cross sectional area as shown in eqn 4 above however the ebct can be determined using the bed depth as in eqn 6 6 e b c t b e d d e p t h c m l i n e a r v e l o c i t y c m min the integrated adsorbent usage rate ur was calculated using eqn 7 7 u r m g b r e a k t h r o u g h v o l u m e l where m is the mass of integrated char in the column 2 5 3 bed depth service time model hutchin s simplification of the bed depth service time bdst approach in 1973 was based on the work of bohart and adams saatçi and oulman 1980 the bdst was used to examine the behaviour and column performances of the integrated bone and biochar packed bed adsorbents in the removal of f from groundwater huang et al 2022 for the bdst model the surface reaction between the f and the unused integrated bone and biochar capacity determines the adsorption rate it can also be used to predict the longevity of the adsorbent in the bed unit before its replacement the adams bohart model describes the column adsorption data and the breakthrough curve kundu and gupta 2007 the adams bohart method however requires at least nine different column tests to gather the necessary laboratory data which takes time to collect the required data however the bdst modelling technique only requires three column tests maji et al 2007 this implies that the bench scale treatment should include at least three integrated chars of various depths running at the same flow rate until the same breakpoint concentration is obtained the adams bohart equation can be simplified as eqn 8 8 ln c o c t 1 k b a n o z u k b a c o t where co is the initial f concentration ct is the column breakthrough concentration at breakthrough time t kba is the a b rate coefficient n o is the adsorption capacity of the integrated char z is the bed depth and u is the superficial pore groundwater velocity plotting ln co c 1 against time t kba can be calculated from the slope of the graph and n o from the y intercept for the bdst model z and t of a column exhibits linear relationship vinodhini and das 2010 therefore the bdst equation is rearranged from the adams bohart model chu 2020 huang et al 2022 the bdst can be expressed as eqn 9 9 t n o z c o u 1 k a c o ln c o c t 1 where t is bed service time min ct is the f concentration mg l at the breakthrough time z is the bed depth cm or height n0 is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent or the storage capacity of the integrated char mg l u is the linear velocity cm min ka is the bdst rate constant l mg min n0 can be estimated from the slope of the bdst plot with initial concentration c0 and a constant linear velocity u for the column operation the rate constant ka which represents the rate of adsorption from the water phase to the adsorbent phase can be derived from the intercept of the bdst plot kumar et al 2019 the critical bed depth z0 at t 0 was calculated this z0 is the theoretical value of the adsorbent material used in this investigation bone char and biochar therefore at t 0 z0 eqn 8 rewritten as eqn 10 below 10 z o u k o n o ln c o c t 1 2 5 4 adsorption kinetics of packed bed column the adsorbent masses were varied for the kinetic studies 25 50 and 60 g the time required for an adsorbent dose to attain the who recommended value of 1 5 mg l was investigated at 5 10 15 20 30 35 40 and 45 min respectively 2 5 5 effect of bed depth on f uptake fixed bed experiments seek to lower the concentration of f ions and other competing ions in the groundwater not surpassing their breakthrough concentrations therefore with an initial concentration of 3 6 mg l and flow velocity of 130 ml min experiments were conducted to assess the effect of bed height at 6 10 and 12 cm 3 competing anions groundwater naturally contains a variety of anions and the presence of these competing anions can impact the ability of f to be removed through adsorption in order to study the effects of competing anions i e cl no3 so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 on f adsorption by an integrated bone and biochar bed the concentrations of these ions were measured before and after treatment 3 1 analytical methods for f and competing anions f was measured using the spadns method applicable in the range 0 10 2 00 mg f l with a detection limit of 0 005 mg l f reacts with zirconium to generate a colourless complex that bleaches red in proportion to the f concentration in the water f calibration curves were created using standard f solutions the 2017 standard method was used to determine the concentration of competing anions such as bicarbonate carbonate chloride nitrate nitrite phosphate and sulphate in groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 ph and point of zero charge the ph of the treated water ranged from 7 2 to 8 5 but the raw water was 7 5 7 7 throughout the experiments the ph of the integrated char was highly alkaline 8 50 with the bone char 7 80 the coconut husks 9 16 neem tree 8 84 bamboo 8 77 and distilled water 5 84 the surface of the adsorbent is mostly negatively charged when the solution ph is greater than phpzc while the opposite is true when ph is lower than phpzc kooh et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the point of zero charge followed a similar trend with bone char 7 7 coconut husks char 8 3 and the integrated char as 8 0 the fact that the pzc values were slightly lower than their ph values suggests that the surface of the char accumulates positive charges and that negatively charged ions can be drawn to the surface from the solution facilitating their adsorption 4 1 2 characterization of chars the morphology and images of the bone char and the four chosen biochars from sem are shown in fig 3 the findings proved that each biochar had some irregular fragments an uneven distribution of particle sizes and porous surfaces that would be advantageous for the adsorption of f and the competing anions compared to the more porous cattle bone char the surface of the coconut husk was more irregular and extremely rough neem trees and bamboo have more honeycomb like surfaces than coconut husk which is also fractured and uneven like cattle bone the river sand and palm kernel shell are quite broken and abrasive fig 3 the detailed elemental compositions of the chosen biochar and the cattle bone char as determined by the eds peaks are displayed in table 2 and fig 4 the elemental composition of the cattle bone char was o 43 ca 34 p 16 and c 6 7 while the coconut husks were also made up of c 59 4 k 21 5 cl 13 1 o 5 2 p 0 4 and na 0 4 as observed in the ftir spectra fig 5 all the chars contained a strong broad peak between 3434 and 3400 cm 1 ascribed to the oh stretch vibrations on their surfaces all the biochars exhibited similar peaks around 2925 2424 cm 1 which were absent in the bone char and confirmed as symmetric c h of the aliphatic ch2 stretch the bone and all the biochar displayed characteristic adsorption bands at 1400 1595 and 871 875 cm 1 indicating the cc stretch and c h bending vibrations respectively in a previous study lam et al 2019 the absorption bands at 1034 1098 cm 1 was attributed to the c o stretch vibrations the 1636 1386 cm 1 bands attest to carboxylic c cooh and phenolic o h respectively eduah et al 2020 according to a study by hou et al 2019 the absorption bands observed at 1637 1400 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of functional groups such as c o cn and co another prominent band seen at 875 cm 1 is attributed to carbonate eduah et al 2020 except for bone char the peak seen at 754 712 cm 1 is associated with aromatic c h bend the asymmetric vibrations of phosphorus and oxygen in the po4 3 wavelengths show groups in the bone char at 603 563 cm 1 michael et al 2022 shahid et al 2019 the peak at 470 cm 1 in the bone char was ascribed to the symmetric bending vibrations in the po4 3 patel et al 2015 shahid et al 2019 the 657 413 cm 1 peak can each be attributed to the vibration of oh distortion and c o stretching and they all show that biochar contains phenolic groups and alcohols the cattle bone char had a bet surface area of 105 02 02 m2 g a single point total pore volume of 0 3301 m3 g a micropore area of 38 384 m2 g and an external area of 66 640 m2 g the coconut husk s bet surface area and single point total pore volume were 43 38 0 59 m2 g and 0 0384 m3 g respectively while its micropore area and external area were 28 639 m2 g and 14 745 m2 g respectively bamboo neem tree and palm kernel shell all had bet surface areas and single point total pore volumes of 40 55 1 14 30 83 1 26 and 0 45 0 03 m2 g and 0 0690 0 0584 and 0 1682 m3 g respectively the palm kernel shell char produced using a locally designed retort was found to be subpar or below standard quality possibly due to the amount used exceeding the retort s capacity the river sand s surface area was 0 91 0 02 m2 g and the single point total pore volume of 0 1716 m3 g the cattle bone char and coconut husks were chosen for the integrated bone and biochar bed unit due to their favourable surface chemistry and chemical properties 4 2 adsorption capacity and effect of mass integration of the bone and biochar 4 2 1 adsorption capacity of the integrated char the adsorption ability the ratios of the mass of the adsorbate mg and the mass of the adsorbent g decreased when the area exposed to adsorption increased with the increasing adsorbent dose alghamdi et al 2019 mohan et al 2017 a noticeable decrease in the adsorption capacity of the integrated char was observed as the mass increased fig 6 this implies that an increase in the mass of the integrated char led to a high removal rate of f from groundwater the occupation of f in the available pores of the char brought about a decrease in its adsorption capacity because adsorption capacity is directly proportional to the volume and inversely proportional to its mass the char s adsorption isotherm demonstrated chemical mechanisms and their kinetics and thermodynamics revealed that the f was taken up by the integrated bone char and biochar bed in a spontaneous and exothermic process controlled by chemisorption michael et al 2022 understanding the impact of ph is critical since it directly influences the electrostatic interactions between the integrated char surface and the f the fact that the pzc value was slightly lower than its ph value phpzc ph suggests that the surface of the char accumulates positive charges and that negatively charged ions were drawn to the surface from the groundwater solution facilitating their adsorption therefore the anionic f may be attracted to positively charged integrated char surface and this observation points to ionic interactions with the adsorbents kooh et al 2018 4 2 2 comparison of the effectiveness of the individual chars and the integrated char the results of the synergy between cattle bone and coconut husk biochar with the support of river sand for rough filtration are presented in table 3 the effects of mass variations on f removal efficiency was also studied the f removal efficiency is shown in table 3 as a percentage at the beginning of the treatment ci mg l and the end cr mg l as expected there was no impact from the river sand as far as the f removal was concerned because the river sand had a poor surface area 0 91 0 02 m2 g and 0 1716 m3 g single point total pore volume as explained earlier the integrated bone and biochar bed was as effective adsorbent as the bone char only when 70 g each was used cattle bone char alone was the most effective adsorbent with a removal rate of 91 4 nearly identical to the combined removal rate of 91 1 for bone char and coconut husk biochar the bone char contains hydroxyapatite which is an anion exchange material and therefore effectively removed the f better than the other chars as indicated earlier at 4 1 2 and in our recent study michael et al 2022 the cattle bone biochar showed higher efficiency than the other biochar because of its better total pore volume pore diameter and bet surface area which were better than the other biochar produced under same conditions the standalone coconuts husks with a bed height of 9 5 cm and mass of 35 g performed poorly compared to their integrated version again f adsorption increased with increasing mass of the adsorbent both integrated and standalone chars the combined bone and biochar bed is preferable to using bone char alone for the adsorption of f in groundwater because coconut husks are freely available in ghana and constitute a nuisance to the environment 5 fixed bed columns adsorption and breakthrough models 5 1 mass transfer model for integrated bone char and biochar the estimated mass transfer zones mtz for the different bed heights are shown in table 5 the column exhaustion concentration i e c co 0 7 was used to estimate the mtz the results show that for the same influent concentration of 3 6 mg l and a volumetric rate of 130 ml min the mtz increased with increasing bed height 6 12 cm indicating a longer lifespan of the column similar observations were made by mani and bhandari 2022 who studied the adsorption of f at bed heights of 2 8 cm 5 2 bdst models fixed bed continuous flow experiments are crucial for enhancing the design and operation of large scale adsorption processes and for estimating the breakthrough curve which defines the functional lifetime of the adsorbent ramirez et al 2018 at a fixed rate of 130 ml min and predetermined bed heights of 6 10 and 12 cm the breakthrough curve for f adsorption by the integrated bone and biochar bed was performed at an initial natural groundwater concentration of 3 6 mg l the bdst model equation was used to plot the graph of t versus z as shown in fig 7 however the adsorption of f from groundwater onto integrated char requires intricate and time consuming rate limiting processes hence data points are not in a straight line from the origin fig 7a nidheesh et al 2013 table 5 also displays all the values for the bdst constant parameters the linear plot of the bdst model was used to calculate the kinetic rate constant ka saturation concentration no and minimum column height zo it has been noted that when bed height increases so do the breakthrough time and exhaustion time no ka and zo had values of 83 3 mg l 0 48 and 0 09 cm respectively fig 8 shows the initial s shaped curves for different experimental value breakthroughs for the integrated chars as shown in fig 7 b c and d the breakthrough curves were time dependent for ct co with f removal across the column at the breakthrough point for a bed height of 6 cm 540 ml of water was treated with a 0 07 l bed volume bv an empty bed contact time of 0 58 min and the breakthrough capacity qc was determined to be 0 084 mg g it was clear from fig 7 c and d that bed heights of 10 and 12 cm had breakthrough curves that were not particularly steep indicating that their bed exhaustion did not occur quickly as a result these beds were more cost effective than a bed with a height of 6 cm table 4 displays all the breakthrough time bed volumes and empty bed contact times at various bed heights based on the findings it can be said that breakthrough time increased as bed height increased this is primarily the outcome of the adsorbent s porosity the bigger pore size of the integrated bone and biochar bed adsorbent led to a higher number of active sites in the adsorbent to adsorb the excess f the adsorption capacity and removal effectiveness determinants were integrated char loading and porosity 5 3 adsorption kinetics of packed bed column as shown in figs 8 and 9 the initial adsorption rate was high after 5 min almost 80 of the total f was removed the adsorption capacity then increased gradually over the contact time until it reached 35 min and then remained constant the findings suggest that the integrated bone char and biochar bed removed f effectively to the who guideline value 1 5 mg l within 12 27 min on average for all the bed depths fig 8 in this work the influence of time on various bed heights for the kinetics of f removal was assessed at a concentration of 3 6 mg l the initial concentration of the f and the bed heights during the chemical reaction were both highly correlated with the adsorption kinetics of f mosavi et al 2021 as seen in fig 8 the integrated char bed heights were proportional to their mass the who acceptable value of 1 5 mg l for f was reached at 16 23 and 27 min respectively for bed heights of 6 10 and 12 cm because the absorbate had more time for contact interactions with the integrated char at a higher bed height of 12 cm compared to 6 cm the bed height had an impact on the kinetics of flow rate and the breakthrough time decreased as the bed height increased the findings fig 6 show that within 15 min the amounts of f detected were 1 36 mg l bed height of 6 cm 0 95 mg l bed height of 10 cm and 0 81 mg l bed height of 12 cm due to the large surface area and minimal flow resistance with a bed height of 6 cm as opposed to 12 cm the f adsorption equilibrium was quickly established the f were stored on the external surface of integrated char which had a higher bed height and greater interior surfaces the concentration of f in the groundwater drops dramatically within 5 min to 0 78 mg l bed height of 6 cm 0 80 mg l bed height of 10 cm and 0 32 mg l bed height of 12 cm due to the unoccupied available empty pores space on the integrated char and surface area 5 4 effect of bed depth on f uptake using contaminated groundwater with an initial f concentration of 3 6 mg l and a flow velocity of 130 ml min the effects of bed height on breakthrough time bt at 6 10 and 12 cm were determined as shown in table 5 the impact of flow rates using 150 300 and 500 ml min models indicates that breakthrough time decreases as the flow rate increases because the absorbate does not have sufficient contact interactions with the integrated char the observation was confirmed in the study of f adsorption using coconut husk biochar talat et al 2018 6 competing anions in the first 15 min most of the fluoride phosphate and bicarbonate were adsorbed by the integrated cattle bone char and coconut biochar materials figs 9 and 10 depict the f removal amid competing anions as seen by the decrease in f uptake and increases in the adsorption of bicarbonate and phosphate onto the integrated char bicarbonate and phosphate had the most significant competitive impacts on f fig 9 the sulphate nitrate and chloride anions had no apparent effect on the fluoride s capacity to bind to the integrated char the integrated char leaves nitrate sulphate and chloride in the groundwater intact while removing fluoride bicarbonate and phosphate the combination of the cattle bone char and biochar might release phosphate into the groundwater because of phosphate residues in the bone char remarkably f adsorption was not affected by the presence of the competing anions until the integrated char reached saturation 7 conclusion fixed upward flow adsorption columns were used to study the effects of time adsorbent dosage and column height on the removal of f from groundwater integrated bone and biochar bed efficiently removed f in 5 min amid competing ions in bench scale continuous adsorption experiments reaching the most excellent adsorption capacity of 0 084 mg g for a bed depth of 6 cm and volumetric flow rate of 130 ml min experimental integrated bed column operations were well fitted to the bdst model r2 0 99 the findings established that the fluoride that remained in the water after treatment was within the 1 5 mg l who guideline for drinking water higher bed depth and lower flow rates favoured the f adsorption by the integrated system the integrated char from bones and biomass materials has a synergistic property that makes it an efficient adsorbent for groundwater defluorination the capacity of low cost bone char and biochar to bind f leads to the conclusion that f can be removed from groundwater using an integrated bed column operation hence a combined bone and biochar bed unit is recommended for bench scale removal of f from actual groundwater in adsorption columns in the presence of interfering anions a follow up field pilot scale experiment will be conducted to investigate the effects of other environmental conditions on the performance of the integrated bed unit declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

11682,assessing the level of radon concentrations in water for domestic purposes is important because it will reveal if the consumption and uses of such water is safe this study was conceived with the aim to ascertain the integrity of water being consumed and used for other activities as well as to determine the source of radon concentrations in shallow aquifers within the granitic rocks of amuloko and olorunsogo areas in ibadan nigeria concentrations and health effects of radon in 40 groundwater samples were analyzed using rad7 detector in amuloko area the radon concentrations and the total annual effective dose received in groundwater varied from 3 00 to 24 50 bql 1 and 29 49 to 240 61 μsvy 1 the mean and the standard deviation sd of radon concentrations and the total annual effective doses received in groundwater by adults in amuloko area are 13 45 6 58 bq l 1 and 132 06 64 62 μsv y 1 in olorunsogo control points the radon concentrations and the total annual effective dose received in groundwater varied from 3 18 to 20 00 bql 1 and 31 18 to 196 42 μsvy 1 the mean and the sd of radon concentrations and the total annual effective doses received in groundwater by adults at the control points are 12 06 4 74 bq l 1 and 118 47 46 57 μsv y 1 in sequence the mean radon concentrations and the mean total annual effective dose received in groundwater were higher than the threshold limits of 11 10 bql 1 and 100 00 μsvy 1 by factors of 1 21 and 1 32 in amuloko and 1 09 and 1 19 in olorunsogo respectively it is established that no significant variation exists between the sources of radon concentrations in the shallow aquifers from the two settlements this suggests that the elevated concentrations of radon at the two settlements are due to the geological contributions

the earth s surface is covered with water water being an easy solvent enables most pollutants to dissolve in it and gets contaminated saeed and hassan 2015 the quality of this vital resource could be deteriorated due to anthropogenic activities groundwater is often cheaper more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water therefore it is commonly used for public water supplies

are safe and sustainable and by establishing a sustainable consumption pattern sdg 2019 the use of un treated groundwater capable of having high radon concentrations for drinking and other domestic purposes is usually being practised in the south western region of nigeria thus an exposure to radon from un treated water could result to accumulation of high absorbed doses in some gastrointestinal

radiological health effects of water consumed and used for domestic purposes as well as to investigate the radon source s or pathway s in shallow aquifers within granitic rocks from two settlements in the crystalline basement complex of nigeria 1 1 description of study area and its geological settings ibadan the acclaimed largest city in the west africa is bounded by the republic of benin in the west and other nigerian state boundaries in its other axes oladejo et al 2019 it is the second most congested city to lagos in nigeria with the total geographical area and population of about 6800 km2 and 2 84 million people ademola and oyeleke 2017 it is one of the mega cities being situated within the humid and sub humid tropical climate in southwestern nigeria the annual rainfall and the maximum temperature in ibadan are approximately 1230 mm and 32 c respectively aladejana et al 2018 the geology of ibadan is that of the precambrian basement complex fig 1 a which is an integral of the reformed basement rocks of west africa adagunodo et al 2018a 2018b 2019a the predominant rocks of the basement complex are mainly metamorphic and crystalline rocks adagunodo et al 2013 2013 in ibadan some intrusive rocks such as granites and porphyries are found within the metamorphic rocks ganiyu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1b the rocks within ibadan and its environs are amphibolites undifferentiated gneiss complex migmatite and banded gneiss granite gneiss pegmatite and quartz vein as well as quartzite quart schist okunlola et al 2009 migmatite and banded gneiss are the major rocks in ibadan these major rocks are originated from a highly altered metamorphic rock that is banded or mixed with granitic rocks the study area is situated at the southeastern region of ibadan fig 1b about 7 m away from the dumpsite there is a river flowing in w e direction the plumes from the dump could have infiltrated into the river through the fault lines around study site fig 1b the study area is situated in a very low land with a valley like topography being experienced towards its northwestern side locally amuloko and its environs are generally underlain with a very thin overburden aladejana et al 2018 the granite gneiss constitutes the geology of the study area gneiss is a metamorphic rock that was formed under enormous heat and pressure it is formed from granites volcanics or schists it is made up of coarse grained minerals such as feldspar and quartz the composition of granitic gneiss resembles that of granite the hydrogeologic conditions that control the storativity and transmissivity of the study area are the same as that of basement rocks in basement complex rocks aquifers are concealed within the weathered and or fractured bedrocks sunmonu et al 2012 at the unaltered state of the basement complex rocks they are characterized by low porosity and permeability as soon as they become weathered and fractured secondary porosity and permeability are developed which now controls the flow and storativity of groundwater within the aquifers of basement rocks lapworth et al 2017 adagunodo et al 2018a the depth to water table and the elevation of the study area varied from 1 0 to 6 0 m and 150 167 m respectively 2 materials and methods a total of forty 40 water samples were obtained from amuloko and olorunsogo in ibadan twenty 20 water samples were taken from hand dug wells starting from the closest residential building to amuloko dumpsite to other residential areas within the study site in order to assess the sources of the radon concentrations into the groundwater system in the study area twenty 20 water samples were obtained in olorunsogo area about few kilometers away from amuloko in ibadan the water samples were collected at the early hours of the day before the commencement of human activities for an in situ analysis of each hand dug well the early hour analysis was done to ensure that some properties of the water were not affected by human activities a clean 1 5 l plastic bottle was used for each sample collection all the bottles used were rinsed with distilled water a day to the sample s collection it was ensured while dipping the bottles in a fetcher that the water bubbles were prevented from being entrapped into the bottle prior to its capping to avoid escape of dissolved radon in the water oni et al 2019b for accuracy three 3 water samples were taken at each location culminating to a total of 120 samples in all locations where the mean of the result obtained was used as the representative value for each location the collected samples were analyzed before the sun rises on daily basis this is to ensure that the quality of the obtained results is unaltered as temperature increase could affect the level of radon concentrations in water ajibola et al 2021 orosun et al 2021 a well calibrated active electronic detector rad7 was used for in situ measurements of radon concentrations in each water sample the set up of the rad7 used in this study is shown in fig 2 durridge 2013 rad7 is a semiconductor detector that uses the principle of alpha spectroscopy method for its measurements it measures radon daughters that accumulate on the detector surface with a strong electric field rad7 is an accurate sniffer that can be used for both short term and long term measurements it is capable of dissolving the energy of various radon isotopes such as radon radon 222 and thoron radon 220 in big bottle system a bottle varying from 1 5 to 2 5 l could be fixed to the detector durridge 2013 2018a in this study a 1 5 l bottle as utilized by orosun et al 2021 was adopted the big bottle system uses a closed loop aeration process this process resembles that of radh2o system in a closed loop aeration process at all time there are constant volumes of water and air with an independent flow rate as the air re flows through the water radon concentrations are extracted from the water until a state of equilibrium is reached it takes 10 min aeration to attain equilibrium unlike in radh2o system that aeration only takes 5 min durridge 2018b also the time for aeration is very short in comparison to 3 8 days half life of radon this quality gives rad7 an edge over other detectors for measuring radon in water prior to the measurement of radon concentrations in the water samples the entrapped radon and dry air were purged from the active electronic detector rad7 through the help of the drying unit afterwards each 1 5 l plastic bottle filled with the collected sample was fixed to the drying unit and the detector the device was allowed to function in a sniff mode in order to determine the concentrations of radon inside the air loop after the radon in the air loop has been determined the conversion factor from the big bottle system substituting 1 5 l plastic bottle for 2 5 l and the water s temperature during aeration were used to determine the concentration of radon in each water sample durridge 2018a the durridge s capture package was used for this process because by using the big bottle system the radon in the air loop is easily determined and automatically estimate the concentrations of radon in the water durridge 2018b to assess the relationship between some physical parameters such as temperature and ph and radon concentrations in the study locations thoron concentrations were measured by rad7 detector apart from the half life of thoron 55 6 s that is shorter than that of radon 3 8 days both elements are identical for all experimental activities lane smith and schubert 2020 this permits thoron to be measured by rad7 using alpha spectrometry method as well the groundwater ph and its corresponding temperature were measured on site by using the hanna meter rad7 has a measurement accuracy of 5 a norminal sensitivty of 0 00925 bq l 1 and an intrinsic background of 0 000185 bq l 1 durridge 2018a the radiation doses due to ingestion and inhalation were estimated for all the water samples this is imperative because either of the two could cause serious health issues besides the lung cancer as soon as it is absorbed into the bloodstreams hopke et al 2000 the annual effective dose for radon ingested is calculated using equation 1 as given by unscear 2000 as well as ademola and oyeleke 2017 1 aedring μsvy 1 crn w c w edc where aedring is the annual effective dose of radon ingested crn w is the radon concentrations in drinking water kbqm 3 c w is the annual water intake given as 0 5 1 5 and 2 0 l of water per day by infants children and adults respectively who 2004 2011 duggal et al 2013 bem et al 2014 the choice of water intake per person can vary based on daily activities or season howard and bartram 2003 the values adopted in this

estimate the annual effective dose of total radon received aedr total 3 aedr total μsvy 1 aedr ing aedr inh kriging was used for the production of geospatial maps in this study kriging is a geostatistical gridding technique in numerical analysis that has proven useful in other fields omosehinmi and arogunjo 2016 it produces the most appealing linear unbiased prediction and visual maps at unsampled locations surfer version 2021 it could be used to measure the uncertainty in the estimated surface and to also measure the spatial correlation between two points wu and hung 2016 the application of this geostatistical approach has been shown by many authors sunmonu et al 2012 adagunodo et al 2018a the basic descriptive statistics such as the mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv skewness skew kurtosis kurt minimum min maximum max t test and the analysis of variance anova were performed on the raw and processed data in order to determine the intra variation among the data and the inter variation that exist between the data that were acquired on the two granitic terrains that is amuloko and olorunsogo ibadan descriptive analysis had been one of the useful tools to describe in summary the variations that exist between set of obtained or acquired data ademola and oyeleke 2017 adagunodo et al 2019b orosun et al 2021 ghias et al 2021 3 results and discussion the geospatial distributions of radon concentrations in water crn w and the annual effective dose from radon concentrations aedr by infants children and adults through ingestion and inhalation within amuloko and olorunsogo and its environs are shown in fig 3 a h and fig 4 h respectively the radon concentrations in amuloko groundwater trend in the north east ne to south west sw orientation very low radon concentrations are observed at the amuloko dumpsite and around the river channel this implies that the dumpsite is acting as an artificial lining that suppresses radon emission around the dumpsite also radon concentrations in surface water are comparably lower than that of groundwater oni et al 2019a ajibola et al 2021 majorly the north western western south western and southern parts of the study area in amuloko are notable hotspots the radon concentrations in groundwater sources from the hotspots in amuloko fig 3a h are beyond the global limits of 11 10 bq l 1 for radon concentrations in water crn w 100 00 and 200 00 μsv y 1 for the aedr ingested in water by adults and children as given by the unscear 2000 the concentrations of radon in amuloko groundwater increased towards the fault line between the undifferentiated gneiss complex and granite gneiss in the study area fig 1b the results in the groundwater sources from amuloko corroborate with the claim that radon emits more along fault lines choubey et al 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 prasad et al 2009 chen et al 2018 sukanya et al 2022 the radon concentrations in the groundwater sources in olorunsogo area increase towards the north eastern direction fig 4a h low concentrations of radon from different groundwater sources are observed towards the south western part of the survey point 2 olorunsogo there are hotspots at the northern north eastern eastern and part of the south eastern zones the obtained results from the hotspot zones are higher than the average global limits of 11 10 bq l 1 for radon concentrations in water crn w 100 00 and 200 00 μsv y 1 for the annual effective doses of radon aedr ingested in water by adults and children as given by the unscear 2000 like in amuloko results the radon concentrations in groundwater sources in olorunsogo also increased towards the fault line within the basement rocks fig 1b the level of radon concentrations along these two faults further confirmed that granitic rocks are associated with high radon contents choubey et al 2000 omeje et al 2019 oni et al 2019a the estimated basic descriptive statistics for the annual effective dose of radon received aedr in water in amuloko area survey point 1 and in olorunsogo survey point 2 are presented in tables 1 and 2 at survey point 1 amuloko the minimum min and maximum max values for the crn w varied from 3 00 to 24 50 bq l 1 with mean and standard deviation sd of 13 45 6 58 bq l 1 the min and max values for the aedr ing in water by infants children and adults varied from 38 36 to 313 01 μsv y 1 32 88 268 30 μsv y 1 and 21 92 178 86 μsv y 1 respectively the mean and sd of the aedr ing in water by these three age groups are 171 80 84 07 μsv y 1 147 26 72 06 μsv y 1 and 98 17 48 04 μsv y 1 respectively the min and max values of the aedr inh in water varied from 7 57 to 61 75 μsv y 1 with mean and sd of 33 89 16 58 μsv y 1 the min and max values of the aedr total received in water through inhalation and ingestion by infants children and adults varied from 45 93 to 374 76 μsv y 1 40 45 330 04 μsv y 1 and 29 49 240 61 μsv y 1 respectively the mean and sd of the aedr total received in water by these three age groups are 205 69 100 65 μsv y 1 181 15 88 64 μsv y 1 and 132 06 64 62 μsv y 1 respectively the high observed sd in this study could be attributed to the heterogeneity of the near surface layers of the crust ali et al 2010 khan 2011 orosun et al 2021 oladapo et al 2022 at survey point 2 olorunsogo the lowest and the highest values for the crn w varied from 3 18 to 20 00 bq l 1 with an average and standard deviation sd of 12 06 4 74 bq l 1 the lowest and the highest values of the aedr ing in water by infants children and adults varied from 40 56 to 255 53 μsv y 1 34 77 219 02 μsv y 1 and 23 18 146 01 μsv y 1 in sequence the averages and standard deviations of the aedr ing in water by these three age groups are 154 12 60 58 μsv y 1 132 10 51 93 μsv y 1 and 88 07 34 62 μsv y 1 respectively the lowest and the highest values of the aedr inh in water varied from 8 00 to 50 41 μsv y 1 with an average and sd of 30 40 11 95 μsv y 1 the lowest and the highest values of the aedr total received in water through inhalation and ingestion by infants children and adults varied from 48 56 to 305 93 μsv y 1 42 77 and 269 43 μsv y 1 and 31 18 196 42 μsv y 1 in sequence the averages and standard deviations of the aedr received in water by these three age groups are 184 52 72 53 μsv y 1 162 51 63 88 μsv y 1 and 118 47 46 57 μsv y 1 respectively at the two survey points amuloko and olorunsogo the estimated mean values for the crn w are higher than the global limit gl of 11 10 bq l 1 by factors of 1 21 and 1 09 respectively this shows that the groundwater at the two granitic locations is enriched with radon consumption of elevated concentrations of radon in water for all age groups had been linked to serious health challenges such as lung cancer and stomach cancer unscear 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 who 2018 oni and adagunodo 2019 ajibola et al 2021 oni et al 2021 furthermore the mean values for aedr total by adults at the two survey points are higher than the gl of 100 μsv y 1 by factors of 1 32 and 1 19 respectively the order of the mean aedr received in water by all age groups from tables 1 and 2 revealed that infants children adults the overall outcome of this order constitute deleterious health hazard to infants in both locations because some of the critical organs in infants are radio sensitive since some of these organs have not been fully developed generally the mean aedr that is higher than 100 μsv y 1 in water is considered as being unsafe for consumption by all age groups infants children and adults usepa 1999 who 2004 nasir and shah 2012 ademola and oyeleke 2017 the trend of results in all age groups in this study is in agreement with the studies conducted on precambrian basement rocks by ajibola et al 2021 and orosun et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv is a statistical measure of the dispersion of the available data around the mean it is the ratio of the sd to the mean the coefficient of variation cv is a useful tool for comparing the variation levels between intra data points and inter data points a 0 cv 0 1 implies a low level of variation 0 11 cv 0 30 implies a medium level of variation and 0 31 cv 1 implies a high level of variation wang et al 2017 a low level of variation indicates intra variation while a high level of variation indicates inter variation machin et al 2007 the intra data variations variations within the data per location that produced the cv of 0 49 in amuloko area and 0 39 in olorunsogo area indicates that radon is not part of the groundwater s constituent but a foreign body that find its way into the aquifer meanwhile a difference of 0 05 is observed in the cv between the two locations inter data variation this further confirms that the radon concentrations emanating from the two locations are from the same source this suggests that the anthropogenic activities around the survey point 1 do not contribute to the level of radon gas in amuloko groundwater sources skewness skew and kurtosis kurt are integral of data characterization adagunodo et el 2019b the skewness determines the equivalence or non equivalence of data the kurtosis compares the peakedness or flatness tailedness of a set of distribution to a normal distribution the skewness in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas are 0 22 and 0 09 indicating asymmentric right skewed probability distributions at the two locations a right skewed data implies that its right tail is longer when compared to its left counterparts groeneveld and meeden 1984 at the two locations the distributions are normally distributed about the mean since 1 indicates the range of comfortability in normality test normality testing 2019 the kurt at survey points 1 and 2 are 0 97 and 0 88 indicating flattened light tailed distributions as reported by ghias et al 2021 a light tailed distribution goes along with a low kurt which corresponds to the results obtained in this study the ph of groundwater from amuloko varied from 7 0 to 7 4 with a mean of 7 2 table 1 meanwhile the ph from olorunsogo groundwater varied from 6 5 to 7 1 with a mean of 6 8 table 2 the results from the two locations suggest that the ph of groundwater in amuloko is of weakly alkaline while that of olorunsogo varied from weakly acidic to weakly alkaline the influence of waste site could have resulted to a weak alkalinity nature of amuloko groundwater olafisoye et al 2012 results from the two locations are within the acceptable limits by who which varied from 6 8 to 8 5 who 2011 the ph values of groundwater from this present study are in agreement with the ph of groundwater obtained from a granitic environment in ogbomoso south west nigeria adabanija et al 2020 one of the physical parameters that determine the suitability of water for human consumptions and other applications is water temperature the who recommends that the temperature of water for human use should vary from 24 5 to 39 7 c who 2011 the water temperature in amuloko ranged between 25 3 and 31 5 c with a mean of 28 1 c table 1 while that of olorunsogo varied from 33 2 to 36 5 c with a mean of 35 0 c table 2 the results indicated that the groundwater sources at the two settlements are suitable for human usage and consumption which correspond to the water temperature 25 2 38 8 c obtained from near a major fault in zarand iran by rahimi et al 2022 thoron 220rn is a gas and a radioactive isotope of radon 222rn which is being produced from byproducts of thorium it decays by emission of an alpha particle and has a half life of 56 s it is also capable of destroying the dna deoxyribonucleic acid which could lead to lung cancer and other respiratory challenges if inhaled into the lungs wanjala et al 2021 the descriptive results of thoron concentrations at both settlements are presented in tables 1 and 2 in amuloko the thoron concentrations varied between 0 44 and 1 56 bq l 1 with a mean of 0 84 bq l 1 while the 220rn concentrations in olorunsogo ranged from 0 31 to 1 21 bq l 1 with a mean of 0 59 bq l 1 the range of thoron concentrations obtained in the current study is higher than the values 0 0 07 bq l 1 obtained in groundwater samples from kufa city in iraq ali et al 2012 currently there is no threshold limit for thoron concentration in potable water it is advisable to ensure that its concentrations in water for consumption and other uses is as low as possible to avoid any health risk that could accompany an overdose of thoron through ingestion or inhalation in future ali et al 2012 lane smith and schubert 2020 one of the applications of thoron measurements in groundwater system is to determine the groundwater discharge pattern chanyotha et al 2010 lane smith and schubert 2020 the presence of thoron in all the groundwater samples in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas could have been attributed to network of the faults in the study area because in crystalline basement complex viable aquifers could only be developed through weathering or fracturing of the parent rocks sunmonu et al 2012 adagunodo et al 2018a the relationships between radon temperature ph and thoron at the two locations were established using the pearson s correlation the correlation results are presented in table 3 classifications of the results are as follows a positive strong correlation exists when r 0 8 a positive significant correlation exists when 0 5 r 0 8 a positive weak correlation exists when 0 3 r 0 5 and an insignificant positive correlation exists when r 0 3 orosun et al 2019 2021 when the conditions above are in the negative form it shows a negative correlation among the group adagunodo et al 2018c a negative weak correlation of 0 4266 and 0 3190 exists between radon and temperature in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas respectively this confirmed that an increase in temperature would reduce the concentrations of radon in water ajibola et al 2021 also a strong positive correlation of 0 8949 in amuloko and a significant positive correlation of 0 5914 in olorunsogo between radon and thoron concentrations ascertained that both are byproducts of rocks and lithostratigraphic units being enriched with radioactive elements uranium and thorium omeje et al 2019 wanjala et al 2021 in order to further understand whether there is significance difference between the data acquired in amuloko and the data acquired in olorunsogo an independent sample test and an anova test were performed on the acquired data at the two locations a t test is one of the inferential tests in statistics used to establish the difference that exist between means from two or more groups equations 4 and 5 are the relationships for estimating t test gerald 2018 the null hypothesis in this study is that there is no significant difference between the radon concentration sources in amuloko groundwater and the radon concentration sources in olorunsogo groundwater the decision rule is that if the magnitude of the t calculated value is greater than the t critical value at significance level α value of 0 05 the hypothesis is rejected machin et al 2007 the independent samples test for the two locations is shown in table 4 based on the fact that the significance value p value is greater than α value the equal variances assumed parameters are considered for the t test in table 4 the t critical i e 2 024 is greater than the magnitude of the t calculated therefore the null hypothesis is accepted 4 t x 1 x 2 s p 1 n 1 1 n 2 5 s p n 2 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the first and the second sample means n1 and n2 are the first and the second sample populations s1 and s2 are the first and the second sample standard deviations sp is the pooled standard deviation an anova test is a statistical measure to analyze the differences among population means it is used to determine if the experimented results are significant or not kenton 2021 in this study a one way anova was used because only two groups locations are involved in the analysis the anova test can be determined by equation 6 sawyer 2009 the anova result for the two locations is shown in table 5 the same hypothesis used for the t test was established for the anova for variations to occur in the anova result f ratio must be greater than 1 and p value α value machin et al 2007 kenton 2021 as shown in table 5 f ratio 0 582 1 and p value 0 450 α value 0 05 this result further confirms that no variation exists between the source of radon concentrations in amuloko shallow aquifers and that of olorunsogo shallow aquifers 6 f m s t m s e where f is the anova coefficient mst is the mean sum of squares due to treatment and mse is the mean sum of squares due to noise the mst indicates an indirect measure of differences in group mean while mse indicates the statistical noise or error since the variance is not explained by the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable sawyer 2009 based on the descriptive statistics and the inferential tests t test and anova used in this study high radon concentrations in groundwater towards the two fault planes at survey points 1 and 2 have been linked to the geological contributions of faults this could have been due to iron oxidation during faulting and weathering of the parent rocks iron oxidation mostly results to exclusive iron staining identity of fault zones and fractured rocks richey and evans 2013 olorunfemi et al 2020 this process increases the level of radon being emanated from fault planes through soils and rocks which results to negative or low magnetic anomalies that is enhanced magnetic susceptibilities olorunfemi et al 2020 and high concentrations of radon in groundwater choubey and ramola 1997 choubey et al 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 prasad et al 2009 2018 furthermore the major pathways of radon within fault zones are dispersion and diffusion through permeable soils as a result of decayed 238u being accumulated in soils and upward migration of radon along faults and fractures through carrier gasses such as n2 and co2 chen et al 2018 radon from the carrier gases are produced from both the decay of 238u at the crust mantle interface and the one produced at the casio3 perovskite interface in the mantle wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 aquifers along the fault zones are contaminated with radon since one of the pathways for this gas to reach the surface due to its short half life is through the fault plane this is evident in the study of oni et al 2019b where groundwater without storage tank had higher radon concentrations than the one with storage facilities this study agrees with the works of choubey et al 2000 at himalayan springs and asadi et al 2015 near anar fault in iran it was concluded in their studies that aquifers around the fault zone showed higher radon concentrations than those away from the fault zone furthermore range of the crn w at the two locations in this study are compared with the results from other parts of the world as shown in table 6 it was revealed that the maximum crn w obtained in all the locations as presented in table 6 are above the global limit gl of 11 10 bq l 1 especially where the crn w obtained in the city of zarand in iran is greater than the gl by a factor of 1 30 and the crn w obtained in shanomo and bagwai areas in kano north western nigeria is greater than the gl by a factor of 4 50 4 conclusion this study assessed the radon concentrations in groundwater sources and its health effects within shallow aquifers from two granitic terrains in the south eastern axis of ibadan nigeria forty groundwater samples in triplicates were collected from the two settlements amuloko and olorunsogo being situated over granite gneiss in ibadan geospatial variations in radon concentrations and the annual effective doses due to inhalation and ingestion for all the age groups infants children and adults increased from the north eastern axis to the south western zone in amuloko meanwhile a reverse trend was observed in olorunsogo it was observed that the levels of radon concentrations in groundwater sources along the two fault zones are much higher than other locations including the dumpsite and the river channel axis the estimated means for the crn w in amuloko and in olorunsogo area are higher than the global limit gl by factors of 1 21 and 1 09 the estimated means for the aedr total by adults at the two locations are higher than the global limit gl by factors of 1 32 and 1 19 the aedr received in water by all age groups from the two locations are in the order infants children adults the aedr received in water by all age groups indicated that no one is safe from the risks associated with consumption of radon enriched water such as lung cancers stomach cancers and other carcinogenic diseases that could affect the internal organs the statistical analysis revealed that the radon pathway to the aquifer in the study locations is mainly through the geogenic contributions and anthropogenic source such as dumpsite has no effect on the radon concentrations it is recommended that direct usage of groundwater without storage facilities that could minimize the level of radon in water prior to treatments at these settlements should be avoided ethical approval not applicable

11682,assessing the level of radon concentrations in water for domestic purposes is important because it will reveal if the consumption and uses of such water is safe this study was conceived with the aim to ascertain the integrity of water being consumed and used for other activities as well as to determine the source of radon concentrations in shallow aquifers within the granitic rocks of amuloko and olorunsogo areas in ibadan nigeria concentrations and health effects of radon in 40 groundwater samples were analyzed using rad7 detector in amuloko area the radon concentrations and the total annual effective dose received in groundwater varied from 3 00 to 24 50 bql 1 and 29 49 to 240 61 μsvy 1 the mean and the standard deviation sd of radon concentrations and the total annual effective doses received in groundwater by adults in amuloko area are 13 45 6 58 bq l 1 and 132 06 64 62 μsv y 1 in olorunsogo control points the radon concentrations and the total annual effective dose received in groundwater varied from 3 18 to 20 00 bql 1 and 31 18 to 196 42 μsvy 1 the mean and the sd of radon concentrations and the total annual effective doses received in groundwater by adults at the control points are 12 06 4 74 bq l 1 and 118 47 46 57 μsv y 1 in sequence the mean radon concentrations and the mean total annual effective dose received in groundwater were higher than the threshold limits of 11 10 bql 1 and 100 00 μsvy 1 by factors of 1 21 and 1 32 in amuloko and 1 09 and 1 19 in olorunsogo respectively it is established that no significant variation exists between the sources of radon concentrations in the shallow aquifers from the two settlements this suggests that the elevated concentrations of radon at the two settlements are due to the geological contributions of faults graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater radon aquifer thoron crystalline basement complex faults data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction about 70 of the earth s surface is covered with water water being an easy solvent enables most pollutants to dissolve in it and gets contaminated saeed and hassan 2015 the quality of this vital resource could be deteriorated due to anthropogenic activities groundwater is often cheaper more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water therefore it is commonly used for public water supplies the rate at which groundwater is being polluted is lesser than that of surface water when groundwater is polluted it is not easily cleaned up waste disposal and management remains one of the major challenges in the developing countries such as nigeria davies 2010 waste if not properly disposed could lead to contamination of surface and groundwater in its immediate environment camacho et al 2011 abstraction of groundwater from both soft and hard rock environment is mainly through the identification of aquifers in the subsurface in a hard rock environment that is a crytalline bedrock setting aquifers are located within a very thick weathered overburden and or fractured bedrock sunmonu et al 2012 to reduce the risks of uncertainties surrounding the location of aquifers in the subsurface geophysical methods such as electromagnetic electrical resistivity magnetic and gravity methods have been adopted in such quest raji 2014 adagunodo et al 2018a one of the most important environmental issues today is groundwater contamination adagunodo 2017 and between the wide diversity of contaminants affecting water resources waste materials of diverse contents constitute the larger percent of these contaminants some of the waste materials are enriched in radon concentrations contributing to groundwater contamination by radon ahmed et al 2019 the unscear report in 2006 disclosed that when groundwater and surface water were assessed 20 of groundwater samples were polluted with radon gas while 0 2 was recorded for surface water samples unscear 2006 water from crystalline basement aquifers could contain radon due to the composition of radioactive materials in the basement rocks shu aibu et al 2021 the geological rocks of southwestern nigeria are rich in 226ra which is the direct parent of 222rn esan et al 2020 oladapo et al 2022 this could be a medium for record of elevated radon concentrations in some locations within the southwest nigeria radon is a carcinogenic radioactive gas being formed by the decay of 238u oni and adagunodo 2019 it is present from point to point in differs quantity within the crust abodunrin and akinloye 2020 it escapes to the soil through the fractured bedrocks rock pores and faults and to the groundwater through the aquifer pores and soil pores whereby it diffuses into the air from the surface of the earth shu aibu et al 2021 oladapo et al 2022 low radon concentrations are associated with wet or moist soils and compacted geological formations that could have attained equilibrium based on its time of deposition that are older than 1600 years being the half life of 238u abodunrin and akinloye 2020 the radon being emanated from the subsurface is high in dry soils unconsolidated deposits shallow surface strata and specific types of bedrocks such as shales limestones permeable sandstones granites sedimentary ironstones and phosphatic rocks that are rich in uranium and in shallow surface strata tanner 1964 narayana et al 2007 ferreira et al 2011 saç et al 2012 ademola and oyeleke 2017 the world health organization who 2009 and the international commission on radiological protection icrp 2009 had described inhalation of high concentrations of radon as the second leading causative agent for lung cancer with smoking being the major cause who 2009 icrp 2009 oni et al 2019a yusuff et al 2019 oni et al 2021 oruncak and ozkan 2020 usikalu et al 2020 modibo et al 2021 the carcinogenic havoc caused by radon to lungs varied from 3 to 17 of the total life threatening diseases that had been recorded sharma et al 2016 in fact 57 of the attack to lungs is as a result of radon inhalation and its degradation products oruncak and ozkan 2020 a great number of deaths had been recorded in the united states of america due to overexposure to radon usikalu et al 2020 the numbers of lung cancer s deaths being associated with radon exposure in norway has increased by 12 finne et al 2019 an increase of

2022 sukanya et al 2022 awareness of the presence of radon and its potential health effects is very low in nigeria high radon concentrations in drinking water have been linked to stomach cancer ademola and oyeleke 2017 though there are numbers of publications on the risk assessments of radon in the nigerian groundwater system oni and adagunodo 2019 oni et al 2019b bello et al 2020 ajibola et al 2021 shu aibu et al 2021 oni et al 2021 little or no report was documented within the vicinity of the study area this paper shall serve as a baseline study that has considered the effect of dumpsite on the degree of radon concentrations in the groundwater around a mega dumpsite it would also seek to achieve some of the sustainable development goal s sdg agenda such as sdg 3 11 and 12 these three sdg were constituted in order to attain the following feats by the year 2030 assurance of healthy lives and promotion of well being for all ages ensuring that cities and human settlements are safe and sustainable and by establishing a sustainable consumption pattern sdg 2019 the use of un treated groundwater capable of having high radon concentrations for drinking and other domestic purposes is usually being practised in the south western region of nigeria thus an exposure to radon from un treated water could result to accumulation of high absorbed doses in some gastrointestinal tract organs such as stomach rectum anus small and large intestines and some tissues such as the lining of the gastrointestinal tract and lung tissues hopke et al 2000 oni et al 2019b suresh et al 2020 recent study by zhang et al 2022 posited that there are plausible linkages between radon exposure and development of dementia in humans this study was conceived with the aim to assess the radiological health effects of water consumed and used for domestic purposes as well as to investigate the radon source s or pathway s in shallow aquifers within granitic rocks from two settlements in the crystalline basement complex of nigeria 1 1 description of study area and its geological settings ibadan the acclaimed largest city in the west africa is bounded by the republic of benin in the west and other nigerian state boundaries in its other axes oladejo et al 2019 it is the second most congested city to lagos in nigeria with the total geographical area and population of about 6800 km2 and 2 84 million people ademola and oyeleke 2017 it is one of the mega cities being situated within the humid and sub humid tropical climate in southwestern nigeria the annual rainfall and the maximum temperature in ibadan are approximately 1230 mm and 32 c respectively aladejana et al 2018 the geology of ibadan is that of the precambrian basement complex fig 1 a which is an integral of the reformed basement rocks of west africa adagunodo et al 2018a 2018b 2019a the predominant rocks of the basement complex are mainly metamorphic and crystalline rocks adagunodo et al 2013 2013 in ibadan some intrusive rocks such as granites and porphyries are found within the metamorphic rocks ganiyu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1b the rocks within ibadan and its environs are amphibolites undifferentiated gneiss complex migmatite and banded gneiss granite gneiss pegmatite and quartz vein as well as quartzite quart schist okunlola et al 2009 migmatite and banded gneiss are the major rocks in ibadan these major rocks are originated from a highly altered metamorphic rock that is banded or mixed with granitic rocks the study area is situated at the southeastern region of ibadan fig 1b about 7 m away from the dumpsite there is a river flowing in w e direction the plumes from the dump could have infiltrated into the river through the fault lines around study site fig 1b the study area is situated in a very low land with a valley like topography being experienced towards its northwestern side locally amuloko and its environs are generally underlain with a very thin overburden aladejana et al 2018 the granite gneiss constitutes the geology of the study area gneiss is a metamorphic rock that was formed under enormous heat and pressure it is formed from granites volcanics or schists it is made up of coarse grained minerals such as feldspar and quartz the composition of granitic gneiss resembles that of granite the hydrogeologic conditions that control the storativity and transmissivity of the study area are the same as that of basement rocks in basement complex rocks aquifers are concealed within the weathered and or fractured bedrocks sunmonu et al 2012 at the unaltered state of the basement complex rocks they are characterized by low porosity and permeability as soon as they become weathered and fractured secondary porosity and permeability are developed which now controls the flow and storativity of groundwater within the aquifers of basement rocks lapworth et al 2017 adagunodo et al 2018a the depth to water table and the elevation of the study area varied from 1 0 to 6 0 m and 150 167 m respectively 2 materials and methods a total of forty 40 water samples were obtained from amuloko and olorunsogo in ibadan twenty 20 water samples were taken from hand dug wells starting from the closest residential building to amuloko dumpsite to other residential areas within the study site in order to assess the sources of the radon concentrations into the groundwater system in the study area twenty 20 water samples were obtained in olorunsogo area about few kilometers away from amuloko in ibadan the water samples were collected at the early hours of the day before the commencement of human activities for an in situ analysis of each hand dug well the early hour analysis was done to ensure that some properties of the water were not affected by human activities a clean 1 5 l plastic bottle was used for each sample collection all the bottles used were rinsed with distilled water a day to the sample s collection it was ensured while dipping the bottles in a fetcher that the water bubbles were prevented from being entrapped into the bottle prior to its capping to avoid escape of dissolved radon in the water oni et al 2019b for accuracy three 3 water samples were taken at each location culminating to a total of 120 samples in all locations where the mean of the result obtained was used as the representative value for each location the collected samples were analyzed before the sun rises on daily basis this is to ensure that the quality of the obtained results is unaltered as temperature increase could affect the level of radon concentrations in water ajibola et al 2021 orosun et al 2021 a well calibrated active electronic detector rad7 was used for in situ measurements of radon concentrations in each water sample the set up of the rad7 used in this study is shown in fig 2 durridge 2013 rad7 is a semiconductor detector that uses the principle of alpha spectroscopy method for its measurements it measures radon daughters that accumulate on the detector surface with a strong electric field rad7 is an accurate sniffer that can be used for both short term and long term measurements it is capable of dissolving the energy of various radon isotopes such as radon radon 222 and thoron radon 220 in big bottle system a bottle varying from 1 5 to 2 5 l could be fixed to the detector durridge 2013 2018a in this study a 1 5 l bottle as utilized by orosun et al 2021 was adopted the big bottle system uses a closed loop aeration process this process resembles that of radh2o system in a closed loop aeration process at all time there are constant volumes of water and air with an independent flow rate as the air re flows through the water radon concentrations are extracted from the water until a state of equilibrium is reached it takes 10 min aeration to attain equilibrium unlike in radh2o system that aeration only takes 5 min durridge 2018b also the time for aeration is very short in comparison to 3 8 days half life of radon this quality gives rad7 an edge over other detectors for measuring radon in water prior to the measurement of radon concentrations in the water samples the entrapped radon and dry air were purged from the active electronic detector rad7 through the help of the drying unit afterwards each 1 5 l plastic bottle filled with the collected sample was fixed to the drying unit and the detector the device was allowed to function in a sniff mode in order to determine the concentrations of radon inside the air loop after the radon in the air loop has been determined the conversion factor from the big bottle system substituting 1 5 l plastic bottle for 2 5 l and the water s temperature during aeration were used to determine the concentration of radon in each water sample durridge 2018a the durridge s capture package was used for this process because by using the big bottle system the radon in the air loop is easily determined and automatically estimate the concentrations of radon in the water durridge 2018b to assess the relationship between some physical parameters such as temperature and ph and radon concentrations in the study locations thoron concentrations were measured by rad7 detector apart from the half life of thoron 55 6 s that is shorter than that of radon 3 8 days both elements are identical for all experimental activities lane smith and schubert 2020 this permits thoron to be measured by rad7 using alpha spectrometry method as well the groundwater ph and its corresponding temperature were measured on site by using the hanna meter rad7 has a measurement accuracy of 5 a norminal sensitivty of 0 00925 bq l 1 and an intrinsic background of 0 000185 bq l 1 durridge 2018a the radiation doses due to ingestion and inhalation were estimated for all the water samples this is imperative because either of the two could cause serious health issues besides the lung cancer as soon as it is absorbed into the bloodstreams hopke et al 2000 the annual effective dose for radon ingested is calculated using equation 1 as given by unscear 2000 as well as ademola and oyeleke 2017 1 aedring μsvy 1 crn w c w edc where aedring is the annual effective dose of radon ingested crn w is the radon concentrations in drinking water kbqm 3 c w is the annual water intake given as 0 5 1 5 and 2 0 l of water per day by infants children and adults respectively who 2004 2011 duggal et al 2013 bem et al 2014 the choice of water intake per person can vary based on daily activities or season howard and bartram 2003 the values adopted in this study are as a result of the physical activities climate and culture of people residing in ibadan nigeria the edc is the effective dose conversion coefficients given as 7 10 8 2 10 8 and 1 10 8 svbq 1 for infants children and adults respectively unscear 2000 ezzulddin and mansour 2017 the annual effective dose of radon inhaled is calculated using equation 2 as given by unscear 2000 as well as ezzulddin and mansour 2017 2 aedrinh μsvy 1 crn w rn w eq iot dcf where aedrinh is the annual effective dose of radon inhaled rn w is the radon in air to water given as 10 4 eq is the equilibrium

nsvh 1 bqm 3 1 ademola and oyeleke 2017 orosun et al 2021 in order to have a clue about the overall doses being received through radon ingested and radon inhaled annually equation 3 is used to estimate the annual effective dose of total radon received aedr total 3 aedr total μsvy 1 aedr ing aedr inh kriging was used for the production of geospatial maps in this study kriging is a geostatistical gridding technique in numerical analysis that has proven useful in other fields omosehinmi and arogunjo 2016 it produces the most appealing linear unbiased prediction and visual maps at unsampled locations surfer version 2021 it could be used to measure the uncertainty in the estimated surface and to also measure the spatial correlation between two points wu and hung 2016 the application of this geostatistical approach has been shown by many authors sunmonu et al 2012 adagunodo et al 2018a the basic descriptive statistics such as the mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv skewness skew kurtosis kurt minimum min maximum max t test and the analysis of variance anova were performed on the raw and processed data in order to determine the intra variation among the data and the inter variation that exist between the data that were acquired on the two granitic terrains that is amuloko and olorunsogo ibadan descriptive analysis had been one of the useful tools to describe in summary the variations that exist between set of obtained or acquired data ademola and oyeleke 2017 adagunodo et al 2019b orosun et al 2021 ghias et al 2021 3 results and discussion the geospatial distributions of radon concentrations in water crn w and the annual effective dose from radon concentrations aedr by infants children and adults through ingestion and inhalation within amuloko and olorunsogo and its environs are shown in fig 3 a h and fig 4 h respectively the radon concentrations in amuloko groundwater trend in the north east ne to south west sw orientation very low radon concentrations are observed at the amuloko dumpsite and around the river channel this implies that the dumpsite is acting as an artificial lining that suppresses radon emission around the dumpsite also radon concentrations in surface water are comparably lower than that of groundwater oni et al 2019a ajibola et al 2021 majorly the north western western south western and southern parts of the study area in amuloko are notable hotspots the radon concentrations in groundwater sources from the hotspots in amuloko fig 3a h are beyond the global limits of 11 10 bq l 1 for radon concentrations in water crn w 100 00 and 200 00 μsv y 1 for the aedr ingested in water by adults and children as given by the unscear 2000 the concentrations of radon in amuloko groundwater increased towards the fault line between the undifferentiated gneiss complex and granite gneiss in the study area fig 1b the results in the groundwater sources from amuloko corroborate with the claim that radon emits more along fault lines choubey et al 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 prasad et al 2009 chen et al 2018 sukanya et al 2022 the radon concentrations in the groundwater sources in olorunsogo area increase towards the north eastern direction fig 4a h low concentrations of radon from different groundwater sources are observed towards the south western part of the survey point 2 olorunsogo there are hotspots at the northern north eastern eastern and part of the south eastern zones the obtained results from the hotspot zones are higher than the average global limits of 11 10 bq l 1 for radon concentrations in water crn w 100 00 and 200 00 μsv y 1 for the annual effective doses of radon aedr ingested in water by adults and children as given by the unscear 2000 like in amuloko results the radon concentrations in groundwater sources in olorunsogo also increased towards the fault line within the basement rocks fig 1b the level of radon concentrations along these two faults further confirmed that granitic rocks are associated with high radon contents choubey et al 2000 omeje et al 2019 oni et al 2019a the estimated basic descriptive statistics for the annual effective dose of radon received aedr in water in amuloko area survey point 1 and in olorunsogo survey point 2 are presented in tables 1 and 2 at survey point 1 amuloko the minimum min and maximum max values for the crn w varied from 3 00 to 24 50 bq l 1 with mean and standard deviation sd of 13 45 6 58 bq l 1 the min and max values for the aedr ing in water by infants children and adults varied from 38 36 to 313 01 μsv y 1 32 88 268 30 μsv y 1 and 21 92 178 86 μsv y 1 respectively the mean and sd of the aedr ing in water by these three age groups are 171 80 84 07 μsv y 1 147 26 72 06 μsv y 1 and 98 17 48 04 μsv y 1 respectively the min and max values of the aedr inh in water varied from 7 57 to 61 75 μsv y 1 with mean and sd of 33 89 16 58 μsv y 1 the min and max values of the aedr total received in water through inhalation and ingestion by infants children and adults varied from 45 93 to 374 76 μsv y 1 40 45 330 04 μsv y 1 and 29 49 240 61 μsv y 1 respectively the mean and sd of the aedr total received in water by these three age groups are 205 69 100 65 μsv y 1 181 15 88 64 μsv y 1 and 132 06 64 62 μsv y 1 respectively the high observed sd in this study could be attributed to the heterogeneity of the near surface layers of the crust ali et al 2010 khan 2011 orosun et al 2021 oladapo et al 2022 at survey point 2 olorunsogo the lowest and the highest values for the crn w varied from 3 18 to 20 00 bq l 1 with an average and standard deviation sd of 12 06 4 74 bq l 1 the lowest and the highest values of the aedr ing in water by infants children and adults varied from 40 56 to 255 53 μsv y 1 34 77 219 02 μsv y 1 and 23 18 146 01 μsv y 1 in sequence the averages and standard deviations of the aedr ing in water by these three age groups are 154 12 60 58 μsv y 1 132 10 51 93 μsv y 1 and 88 07 34 62 μsv y 1 respectively the lowest and the highest values of the aedr inh in water varied from 8 00 to 50 41 μsv y 1 with an average and sd of 30 40 11 95 μsv y 1 the lowest and the highest values of the aedr total received in water through inhalation and ingestion by infants children and adults varied from 48 56 to 305 93 μsv y 1 42 77 and 269 43 μsv y 1 and 31 18 196 42 μsv y 1 in sequence the averages and standard deviations of the aedr received in water by these three age groups are 184 52 72 53 μsv y 1 162 51 63 88 μsv y 1 and 118 47 46 57 μsv y 1 respectively at the two survey points amuloko and olorunsogo the estimated mean values for the crn w are higher than the global limit gl of 11 10 bq l 1 by factors of 1 21 and 1 09 respectively this shows that the groundwater at the two granitic locations is enriched with radon consumption of elevated concentrations of radon in water for all age groups had been linked to serious health challenges such as lung cancer and stomach cancer unscear 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 who 2018 oni and adagunodo 2019 ajibola et al 2021 oni et al 2021 furthermore the mean values for aedr total by adults at the two survey points are higher than the gl of 100 μsv y 1 by factors of 1 32 and 1 19 respectively the order of the mean aedr received in water by all age groups from tables 1 and 2 revealed that infants children adults the overall outcome of this order constitute deleterious health hazard to infants in both locations because some of the critical organs in infants are radio sensitive since some of these organs have not been fully developed generally the mean aedr that is higher than 100 μsv y 1 in water is considered as being unsafe for consumption by all age groups infants children and adults usepa 1999 who 2004 nasir and shah 2012 ademola and oyeleke 2017 the trend of results in all age groups in this study is in agreement with the studies conducted on precambrian basement rocks by ajibola et al 2021 and orosun et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv is a statistical measure of the dispersion of the available data around the mean it is the ratio of the sd to the mean the coefficient of variation cv is a useful tool for comparing the variation levels between intra data points and inter data points a 0 cv 0 1 implies a low level of variation 0 11 cv 0 30 implies a medium level of variation and 0 31 cv 1 implies a high level of variation wang et al 2017 a low level of variation indicates intra variation while a high level of variation indicates inter variation machin et al 2007 the intra data variations variations within the data per location that produced the cv of 0 49 in amuloko area and 0 39 in olorunsogo area indicates that radon is not part of the groundwater s constituent but a foreign body that find its way into the aquifer meanwhile a difference of 0 05 is observed in the cv between the two locations inter data variation this further confirms that the radon concentrations emanating from the two locations are from the same source this suggests that the anthropogenic activities around the survey point 1 do not contribute to the level of radon gas in amuloko groundwater sources skewness skew and kurtosis kurt are integral of data characterization adagunodo et el 2019b the skewness determines the equivalence or non equivalence of data the kurtosis compares the peakedness or flatness tailedness of a set of distribution to a normal distribution the skewness in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas are 0 22 and 0 09 indicating asymmentric right skewed probability distributions at the two locations a right skewed data implies that its right tail is longer when compared to its left counterparts groeneveld and meeden 1984 at the two locations the distributions are normally distributed about the mean since 1 indicates the range of comfortability in normality test normality testing 2019 the kurt at survey points 1 and 2 are 0 97 and 0 88 indicating flattened light tailed distributions as reported by ghias et al 2021 a light tailed distribution goes along with a low kurt which corresponds to the results obtained in this study the ph of groundwater from amuloko varied from 7 0 to 7 4 with a mean of 7 2 table 1 meanwhile the ph from olorunsogo groundwater varied from 6 5 to 7 1 with a mean of 6 8 table 2 the results from the two locations suggest that the ph of groundwater in amuloko is of weakly alkaline while that of olorunsogo varied from weakly acidic to weakly alkaline the influence of waste site could have resulted to a weak alkalinity nature of amuloko groundwater olafisoye et al 2012 results from the two locations are within the acceptable limits by who which varied from 6 8 to 8 5 who 2011 the ph values of groundwater from this present study are in agreement with the ph of groundwater obtained from a granitic environment in ogbomoso south west nigeria adabanija et al 2020 one of the physical parameters that determine the suitability of water for human consumptions and other applications is water temperature the who recommends that the temperature of water for human use should vary from 24 5 to 39 7 c who 2011 the water temperature in amuloko ranged between 25 3 and 31 5 c with a mean of 28 1 c table 1 while that of olorunsogo varied from 33 2 to 36 5 c with a mean of 35 0 c table 2 the results indicated that the groundwater sources at the two settlements are suitable for human usage and consumption which correspond to the water temperature 25 2 38 8 c obtained from near a major fault in zarand iran by rahimi et al 2022 thoron 220rn is a gas and a radioactive isotope of radon 222rn which is being produced from byproducts of thorium it decays by emission of an alpha particle and has a half life of 56 s it is also capable of destroying the dna deoxyribonucleic acid which could lead to lung cancer and other respiratory challenges if inhaled into the lungs wanjala et al 2021 the descriptive results of thoron concentrations at both settlements are presented in tables 1 and 2 in amuloko the thoron concentrations varied between 0 44 and 1 56 bq l 1 with a mean of 0 84 bq l 1 while the 220rn concentrations in olorunsogo ranged from 0 31 to 1 21 bq l 1 with a mean of 0 59 bq l 1 the range of thoron concentrations obtained in the current study is higher than the values 0 0 07 bq l 1 obtained in groundwater samples from kufa city in iraq ali et al 2012 currently there is no threshold limit for thoron concentration in potable water it is advisable to ensure that its concentrations in water for consumption and other uses is as low as possible to avoid any health risk that could accompany an overdose of thoron through ingestion or inhalation in future ali et al 2012 lane smith and schubert 2020 one of the applications of thoron measurements in groundwater system is to determine the groundwater discharge pattern chanyotha et al 2010 lane smith and schubert 2020 the presence of thoron in all the groundwater samples in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas could have been attributed to network of the faults in the study area because in crystalline basement complex viable aquifers could only be developed through weathering or fracturing of the parent rocks sunmonu et al 2012 adagunodo et al 2018a the relationships between radon temperature ph and thoron at the two locations were established using the pearson s correlation the correlation results are presented in table 3 classifications of the results are as follows a positive strong correlation exists when r 0 8 a positive significant correlation exists when 0 5 r 0 8 a positive weak correlation exists when 0 3 r 0 5 and an insignificant positive correlation exists when r 0 3 orosun et al 2019 2021 when the conditions above are in the negative form it shows a negative correlation among the group adagunodo et al 2018c a negative weak correlation of 0 4266 and 0 3190 exists between radon and temperature in amuloko and in olorunsogo areas respectively this confirmed that an increase in temperature would reduce the concentrations of radon in water ajibola et al 2021 also a strong positive correlation of 0 8949 in amuloko and a significant positive correlation of 0 5914 in olorunsogo between radon and thoron concentrations ascertained that both are byproducts of rocks and lithostratigraphic units being enriched with radioactive elements uranium and thorium omeje et al 2019 wanjala et al 2021 in order to further understand whether there is significance difference between the data acquired in amuloko and the data acquired in olorunsogo an independent sample test and an anova test were performed on the acquired data at the two locations a t test is one of the inferential tests in statistics used to establish the difference that exist between means from two or more groups equations 4 and 5 are the relationships for estimating t test gerald 2018 the null hypothesis in this study is that there is no significant difference between the radon concentration sources in amuloko groundwater and the radon concentration sources in olorunsogo groundwater the decision rule is that if the magnitude of the t calculated value is greater than the t critical value at significance level α value of 0 05 the hypothesis is rejected machin et al 2007 the independent samples test for the two locations is shown in table 4 based on the fact that the significance value p value is greater than α value the equal variances assumed parameters are considered for the t test in table 4 the t critical i e 2 024 is greater than the magnitude of the t calculated therefore the null hypothesis is accepted 4 t x 1 x 2 s p 1 n 1 1 n 2 5 s p n 2 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the first and the second sample means n1 and n2 are the first and the second sample populations s1 and s2 are the first and the second sample standard deviations sp is the pooled standard deviation an anova test is a statistical measure to analyze the differences among population means it is used to determine if the experimented results are significant or not kenton 2021 in this study a one way anova was used because only two groups locations are involved in the analysis the anova test can be determined by equation 6 sawyer 2009 the anova result for the two locations is shown in table 5 the same hypothesis used for the t test was established for the anova for variations to occur in the anova result f ratio must be greater than 1 and p value α value machin et al 2007 kenton 2021 as shown in table 5 f ratio 0 582 1 and p value 0 450 α value 0 05 this result further confirms that no variation exists between the source of radon concentrations in amuloko shallow aquifers and that of olorunsogo shallow aquifers 6 f m s t m s e where f is the anova coefficient mst is the mean sum of squares due to treatment and mse is the mean sum of squares due to noise the mst indicates an indirect measure of differences in group mean while mse indicates the statistical noise or error since the variance is not explained by the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable sawyer 2009 based on the descriptive statistics and the inferential tests t test and anova used in this study high radon concentrations in groundwater towards the two fault planes at survey points 1 and 2 have been linked to the geological contributions of faults this could have been due to iron oxidation during faulting and weathering of the parent rocks iron oxidation mostly results to exclusive iron staining identity of fault zones and fractured rocks richey and evans 2013 olorunfemi et al 2020 this process increases the level of radon being emanated from fault planes through soils and rocks which results to negative or low magnetic anomalies that is enhanced magnetic susceptibilities olorunfemi et al 2020 and high concentrations of radon in groundwater choubey and ramola 1997 choubey et al 2000 al tamimi and abumurad 2001 prasad et al 2009 2018 furthermore the major pathways of radon within fault zones are dispersion and diffusion through permeable soils as a result of decayed 238u being accumulated in soils and upward migration of radon along faults and fractures through carrier gasses such as n2 and co2 chen et al 2018 radon from the carrier gases are produced from both the decay of 238u at the crust mantle interface and the one produced at the casio3 perovskite interface in the mantle wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 aquifers along the fault zones are contaminated with radon since one of the pathways for this gas to reach the surface due to its short half life is through the fault plane this is evident in the study of oni et al 2019b where groundwater without storage tank had higher radon concentrations than the one with storage facilities this study agrees with the works of choubey et al 2000 at himalayan springs and asadi et al 2015 near anar fault in iran it was concluded in their studies that aquifers around the fault zone showed higher radon concentrations than those away from the fault zone furthermore range of the crn w at the two locations in this study are compared with the results from other parts of the world as shown in table 6 it was revealed that the maximum crn w obtained in all the locations as presented in table 6 are above the global limit gl of 11 10 bq l 1 especially where the crn w obtained in the city of zarand in iran is greater than the gl by a factor of 1 30 and the crn w obtained in shanomo and bagwai areas in kano north western nigeria is greater than the gl by a factor of 4 50 4 conclusion this study assessed the radon concentrations in groundwater sources and its health effects within shallow aquifers from two granitic terrains in the south eastern axis of ibadan nigeria forty groundwater samples in triplicates were collected from the two settlements amuloko and olorunsogo being situated over granite gneiss in ibadan geospatial variations in radon concentrations and the annual effective doses due to inhalation and ingestion for all the age groups infants children and adults increased from the north eastern axis to the south western zone in amuloko meanwhile a reverse trend was observed in olorunsogo it was observed that the levels of radon concentrations in groundwater sources along the two fault zones are much higher than other locations including the dumpsite and the river channel axis the estimated means for the crn w in amuloko and in olorunsogo area are higher than the global limit gl by factors of 1 21 and 1 09 the estimated means for the aedr total by adults at the two locations are higher than the global limit gl by factors of 1 32 and 1 19 the aedr received in water by all age groups from the two locations are in the order infants children adults the aedr received in water by all age groups indicated that no one is safe from the risks associated with consumption of radon enriched water such as lung cancers stomach cancers and other carcinogenic diseases that could affect the internal organs the statistical analysis revealed that the radon pathway to the aquifer in the study locations is mainly through the geogenic contributions and anthropogenic source such as dumpsite has no effect on the radon concentrations it is recommended that direct usage of groundwater without storage facilities that could minimize the level of radon in water prior to treatments at these settlements should be avoided ethical approval not applicable

11683,equitable access to safe drinking water is a global concern particularly in low and middle income countries improvement towards accessibility of safe drinking water would enhance economic well being human prosperity by reducing regional disparities this study has two major objectives first it identifies the spatial patterns and the spatial relationship between contiguous districts concerning household expenditure on safe drinking water second it examines the local varying spatial impact of various sociodemographic factors on expenditure on safe drinking water by applying geographically weighted regression the study results revealed that spatial patterns of high high and low low clustered districts were located mainly in baluchistan and punjab provinces respectively in addition the gwr results exhibited that household income family size and access to television facilities were significantly associated with household expenditure on safe drinking water moreover the local gwr coefficients of these variables vary across districts of pakistan which confirmed the existence of geographical disparities in terms of household expenditure on safe drinking water thus policymakers and the government must prioritize the high high clustered districts by focusing on the key determinants of expenditure on safe drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords socioeconomic indicators safe drinking water spatial analysis spatial disparities geographically weighted regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction equitable access to safe drinking water is a basic need and human right of everyone as it prevents many illnesses diseases like diarrheal and enteropathy diseases which cause death particularly in children ages under five bessong et al 2009 cissé 2019 cumming et al 2019 ding et al 2017 el sayed and kamel 2020 ercumen et al 2015 hasan and alam 2020 jalan and ravallion 2003 ngure et al 2014 it is one of the united nations development programme s undp s important sustainable development goals sdgs i e clean water and sanitation ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all goal 6 undp 2015b according to world health organization who safe drinking water is the proportion of inhabitants having access to an adequate quantity of safe drinking water located within a suitable distance from the residents home who 2019 in another study safe drinking water is defined as the water without any significant risk to the health for a lifetime of its usage including different sensitivities that may occur at any stage of life khwaja and aslam 2018 30 percent of people throughout the world do not have access to safely managed drinking water services and at the current rate it is expected that in 2030 1 6 billion people will lack access to safely managed drinking water undp 2015a 2019 undp reported that about 844 million people still have no access to clean and safe drinking water undp 2015b access to safe drinking water is nowadays a global concern particularly in low and middle income countries bain et al 2012 cassivi et al 2018 fukuda et al 2019 rosa and clasen 2010 shields bain et al 2015 treacy 2019 in 2017 1 2 million people died due to the unavailability of safe water sources which makes up a 2 2 percent share of global deaths however this share accounts for 6 percent of the total deaths in low income countries also the death rate in chad per year was recorded as 14 percent whereas this rate was only 0 01 percent in most of europe hannah 2021 despite many countries have improved the availability and accessibility of safe drinking water it is still a serious issue in low and middle income countries therefore the enhancement of safe water accessibility is playing a pivotal role in economic development and human prosperity numerous studies have been conducted on households access to safe drinking water and its significant determinants abubakar 2019 akram 2020 amoah 2020 gomez et al 2019 kong et al 2020 oskam et al 2021 thakur et al 2021 yousaf et al 2020 many factors such as gross national income gni female education region governance political stability and corruption are important to influence water accessibility gomez et al 2019 similarly kong et al 2020 found that income education house type and region rural urban have significantly determined the household accessibility to safe drinking water besides socio cultural aspects such as religion have also influenced improved drinking water van der voorn 2008 there exist inequalities in low and high income households in terms of access to safe drinking water households with lower socioeconomic positions have limited access to safe drinking water in comparison with households having higher socioeconomic positions oskam et al 2021 pakistan being a developing nation faces many problems such as health education housing sanitation electricity and clean water among these the lack of accessibility to safe drinking water has gained momentous consideration as it is the most central need and human right of everyone it is because only 20 of inhabitants in pakistan have access to safe drinking water aid 2019 daud et al 2017 khan et al 2020 pakistan is one of the top ten countries with the lowest access to safe drinking water khan and hussain 2020 therefore several studies have been conducted to identify the significant determinants of access to safe drinking water adil et al 2021 daud et al 2017 kausar et al 2011 khan and hussain 2021 shahid et al 2015 zahid 2018 these studies showed that income is substantially associated with access to safe drinking water which resultantly confirmed access to safe drinking water as an economic concern particularly in pakistan the government of pakistan has improved households access to safe drinking water by facilitating them with low and or zero cost but on the other hand many problems prevent people s accessibility to safe water for instance the growing population has threatened the inhabitant s accessibility to safe drinking water similarly the household distance to the place where safe drinking water is available as a result inhabitants spend a specific share of their budget to get safe water used for various domestic purposes thus identifying the factors that affect household expenditure on safe drinking water is a new hot topic for today s researchers by considering safe drinking water as an economic phenomenon most of the previous studies in pakistan explored the impact of various socioeconomic characteristics on access to safe drinking water adil et al 2021 kausar et al 2011 shahid et al 2015 there exist considerable socioeconomic variations in access to safe drinking water among households as well as across various geographical levels anthonj et al 2020 hernández vasquéz et al 2021 oskam et al 2021 households expenditure on safe water has been ignored and or studied rarely akram 2020 yousaf et al 2020 also no proper consideration has been given to geographical inequalities in households expenditure on safe drinking water reducing inequalities is one of the undp s sustainable development goals sdgs i e reduced inequalities goal 10 to achieve undp 2015b therefore the measurement of inequalities across geographical boundaries particularly in spatial perspectives is also a new hot topic for researchers there is a dire need to focus on spatial disparities in households expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan spatial analysis is useful in examining the disparities across different geographical levels it became popular after the first law of geography presented by waldo tobler in 1970 the law states that everything in the world is related to everything else but distant things are related less in comparison with near things dempsey 2014 tobler 1970 spatial analysis helps in identifying the significant atypical clusters presence of hotspots and or cold spots and outliers heterogeneous patterns hotspots are the spatial clusters of areas where a region with a high score is surrounded by neighboring regions with a high score while cold spots are the areas where a region with a lower score is surrounded by areas with lower scores spatial outliers are the clusters of regions where an area with a lower higher value is surrounded by areas with higher lower scores more interestingly the geographically weighted regression gwr approach has an opportunity to consider the coordinates data and provide separate coefficients for all regions which is impossible in the conventional ols technique raza et al 2019 therefore the gwr framework has been applied to identify the local varying coefficients of socioeconomic characteristics on household expenditure on safe drinking water the local gwr coefficients are very helpful in understanding the inequalities across regions in terms of the size of the effect keeping in view the importance of undp s two sdgs clean water and sanitation goal 6 and reduced inequalities goal 10 concerning safe drinking water the present study has two major objectives first it measures the spatial inequalities in households expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan it also recognizes the significant spatial clusters of hotspots cold spots and outliers second it examines the spatial inequalities by measuring the local varying coefficients of socioeconomic factors affecting expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan as the present study aims at measuring inequalities in household expenditure on safe drinking water this paper can contribute to the existing literature on two main grounds first expenditure on safe drinking water is studied very rarely in spatial terminologies and has not been analyzed previously in pakistan second no study in pakistan assesses the spatial local impacts of socioeconomic determinants on safe drinking water at the district level therefore this study is the first pioneering attempt to analyze the household expenditure on safe drinking water from spatial perspectives in the following sections we provide review of literature section 2 and elaborate methodology including study data source variables of the study statistical models of spatial auatocorrelation analysis and geographically weighted regression section 3 we present results and discussion in section 4 and section 5 respectively section 6 describe limitation of the study followed by the conclusion in section 7 2 review of literature safe drinking water is the central need and basic right of all human beings also it is one of the undp s sustainable development goals sdgs that needs significant consideration to discuss undp 2015b as human life is impossible without safe drinking water all habitants and or households need to spend a specific portion of their income to get safe drinking water reducing household expenditure on safe drinking water is an economic benefit that can improve human well being and prosperity these expenditures can be measured through indicators covering socioeconomic housing environmental and geographical aspects previously researchers have mainly focused on households access to safe drinking water and explored the impact of socioeconomic factors access to safe drinking water is significant because contaminated water has adverse effects on physical health having such importance researchers have conducted studies on access to safe drinking water for instance gomez et al 2019 examined the impact of socioeconomic factors on access to water in rural areas of low and middle income countries their findings suggested that gross national income gni primary education agriculture population growth and income groups have substantially influenced safe water koskei et al 2013 also conducted a study on socioeconomic factors affecting access to improved water and sanitation in bomet municipality kenya empirical findings of the study revealed that households characteristics such as the education of the head and occupation have a strong influence on household access to improved water variations in household access to safe drinking water remained one of the most troubling challenges in the world especially in low and middle income countries adams 2018 explored intra urban disparities in water access among households in malawi s slums using linear and logistic regressions this study addressed the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on water access the findings of the study showed discrepancies in the share of households that satisfy malawi versus the united nations and world health organization minimum water access standards socio economic status significantly impacted water access underscoring the need for pro poor water policies that identify that even among households in predominantly poor and under resourced urban settings significant socioeconomic differences underlie inequalities in water access a similar study conducted by hernández vasquéz et al 2021 explored disparities in household access to safe drinking water in peru from the year 2008 2018 there were no considerable variations in access to safe drinking water in small cities however in medium and large cities variations in access to safe water occurred from the year 2008 2018 moreover in small cities socioeconomic inequalities increased from 2008 to 2018 while in large cities socioeconomic disparities reduced in these ten years a bulk of the studies have also been conducted on safe drinking water from spatial perspectives for instance pullan et al 2014 measured geographical inequalities in the use of improved drinking water supply and sanitation across sub saharan africa by spatially analyzing the cross sectional data they resulted in substantial geographical inequalities in water and sanitation that exceed urban rural disparities further they evinced countries with a higher level of inequality compared to coverage in the use of an improved drinking water source also practiced higher levels of inequality in the use of improved sanitation belay and andualem 2022 conducted a study on limited access to improved unimproved drinking water among households in ethiopia in terms of spatial and fixed effect analysis household responsible persons education residence and regions were significantly correlated with limited access to drinking water service spatial findings of the study showed that the eastern part of amhara afar and the somali areas predicted the highest limited drinking water services the unimproved drinking water source was located in the central part of amhara somalia region almost all regions predicted the highest prevalence of unimproved toilet facilities these studies considered safe water accessibility only and ignored households expenditure on safe drinking water which is a major financial issue for most of the dwellers in developing nations as a result numerous studies explored the household willingness to pay wtp for water and its significant determinants for example thakur et al 2022 measured the impact of socioeconomic attributes on households willingness to pay wtp for drinking water in bihar india they used the linear regression model to measure the causal associations among socioeconomic attributes and households wtp for safe drinking water the significant socioeconomic factors of wtp for water were household income education age awareness arsenic concentration level and visit to the doctor similarly khan et al 2014 examined willingness to pay wtp for arsenic as safe arsenic free drinking water across different as risk zones in bangladesh household income water consumption and awareness of water resource contamination have substantially influenced the wtp for arsenic clean drinking water as all people demand safe water bal et al 2021 examined the income and price elasticities of safe drinking water in west bengal india considering the consumption of water they divided the households into four classes 1 domestic pipeline 2 commercial pipeline 3 domestic water tanker and 4 commercial water tanker their findings showed that the price for all groups of households is elastic further they concluded that the income elasticity of water demand is relatively high it was less in households under domestic pipeline and domestic water tanker in comparison with the other two classes in a nutshell it is obvious from previous literature that researchers have either focused on access to safe drinking water and the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on wtp for drinking water or measured the geographical inequalities concerning safe drinking water existing literature mainly studied safe water in non spatial form and very scarce consideration has been given to its spatial perspectives therefore considering the existing literature this study has been designed to measure spatial inequalities in household expenditure on safe drinking water 3 methodology 3 1 study area and data specification this study primarily concentrates on measuring the spatial inequalities concerning expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan pakistan is the world s 5th most populous country having a current population of pakistan 231 million people with a population growth rate of 2 percent per year united nations 2019 there are 32 2 million households in pakistan with 12 2 million households in urban areas and 20 million households in rural areas in general the overall distribution of the population favors the male population which is 51 percent whereas the female population is 49 percent pakistan bureau of statistics 2017 there are five provinces and federally administrated tribal areas fata and 169 districts in pakistan as this is a district level study districts of pakistan that fulfill the required information about spatial analysis were considered as the observations of the research fig 1 some of the districts were excluded from the study as they were restricted by the law and order situations at the time of the survey or they do not have sufficient information on socioeconomic and demographic indicators used to measure their impacts on household expenditure on safe drinking water after excluding these districts a total of 134 districts were considered as the study observations socioeconomic and demographic indicators were obtained from pakistan social and living standard measurement pslm survey 2019 20 recently conducted by the pakistan bureau of statistics islamabad pakistan pakistan bureau of statistics 2020 pakistan bureau of statistics has implemented the stratified two stage sample design to accumulate the data and the population of all districts of pakistan was considered as a universal sample this cross sectional dataset contains rich information on socioeconomic demographic housing health environment water and sanitation at the district level the survey has not been conducted specifically for the study of water situations in pakistan though it has sufficient information on household water status that can be used to identify the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on household expenditure on safe drinking water at the district level surveys of pslm have also been used by many researchers to achieve their study objectives 3 2 indicators of the study the selection of appropriate factors that determine the household expenditure on safe drinking water is very much important in this study the selected indicators were based on previous studies but mainly depended on the data availability table 1 shows a detailed explanation of the dependent and independent variables of the study 3 3 spatial analysis 3 3 1 spatial autocorrelation global moran s i to test whether the districts of pakistan are spatially agglomerated with one another concerning the monthly expenditure of households on safe drinking water the global moran i statistic was applied anselin 1995 the moran i statistic is econometrically written as under 1 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x i j where n in equation 1 is the number of districts x i and x j are the adjacent district ith and jth monthly expenditure on safe drinking water respectively x denotes the mean of health poverty of all districts w ij is the weighted spatial matrix in case ith and jth districts share a common boundary w ij 1 otherwise 0 i denote the score of global moran s i that ranges between 1 and 1 the closer the moran s i score to 1 or 1 the higher the spatial interconnection which means that the surrounding districts are spatially agglomerated concerning expenditure on safe drinking water and vice versa the 0 score of moran s i statistic means that the districts are disseminated randomly no spatial association in terms of households expenditure on safe drinking water 3 3 2 local indicators of spatial association lisa lisa also known as local moran s i was used to identify the significant spatial clusters and or outliers among the contiguous districts of pakistan concerning monthly expenditure on drinking water econometrically the lisa statistic is written as under 2 i i n x i x i 1 n w i j x j x i 1 n x i x i j where n denotes the number of districts x i and x j are the expenditure on drinking water of ith and jth districts respectively x is the average expenditure on the water of all districts w ij denotes the spatial weight matrix i i is the extent of a spatial relationship between each ith and its surrounding districts lisa outcomes can be divided into four quadrants i e high high hh also known as a hot spot low low ll or cold spot high low hl and low high lh both known as the outliers anselin 1995 the hh and ll quadrants mean that the health poverty of a district and its adjacent districts are significantly spatially agglomerated whereas the quadrants of hl and lh show that the contiguous districts are heterogeneous anselin 1995 3 3 3 geographically weighted regression gwr is a spatial analysis procedure that considers non stationary indicators into consideration e g demographic factors housing attributes environmental characteristics and models the local associations between these predictors and an outcome of interest gwr is an extension of the ols that augments a level of modeling sophistication by allowing the relationships between the dependent and explanatory variables to differ by locality on one hand gwr is useful as an exploratory technique that permits visualization of stimulus response relationships and if how that relationship fluctuates in space it also accounts for spatial autocorrelations of variables briefly gwr constructs a separate ols equation for every location in the study area which integrates the dependent and explanatory variables of locations falling within the bandwidth of each target location bandwidth can be manually entered by the user or it can be determined by the statistical software on the other hand like other econometric models gwr has several limitations the most important one is the problem of multicollinearity in local varying coefficients this issue has been discussed extensively and alternatives have been suggested but the debates are still in progress despite this issue gwr is still considered a significant tool for identifying the spatial non stationarity and is used extensively in previous studies antczak 2019 antczak and miszczynska 2020 li et al 2020 muche et al 2021 raza et al 2019 the conventional ordinary least square technique assumes the constant homogenous spatial association between the explanatory and dependent variables and does not capture the spatial geographical variability whereas our study s interest is to find out the spatial impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on household expenditure on safe drinking water therefore in the present study the most sophisticated model of gwr was applied as it captures the geographical variability the simple regression model is statistically written as under 3 y i β o k 1 p β k x i k ε i where y i represents the dependent variable at location i i 1 2 3 n which is the linear combination of explanatory variables x k at location i β o is the intercept term β k is the regression coefficient of kth independent variable k 1 2 3 p ε i is the error term independently and normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance this simple ols is considered a special case of a geographically weighted regression model however the assumption of a homogenous constant relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables is not correct at various topographies practically this association is heterogenous in different geographical settings as a result the simple regression model does not capture the true parameter estimates in this regard gwr is the appropriate statistical technique to measure the local varying coefficients as it considers the non stationary or spatial i e the parameter estimates become specific to location i association between dependent and independent variables the gwr model is written in an econometric form as under 4 y i β o u i v i k 1 p β k u i v i x i k ε i where u i v i denotes the coordinates longitudes and latitudes of ith location the local regression parameters were obtained using the gwr technique by assigning weights to the observations which is the function of distance from location i the parameter vector at location i can be expressed in matrix form as under 5 β ˆ i x t w u i v i x 1 x t w u i v i y i where β ˆ i is the vector of parameter k at location i i 1 2 3 n x t w u i v i x denotes the variance covariance matrix and w u i v i is the n by n local spatial weight matrix with non zero diagonal elements as it is assumed in spatial analysis regions nearby to ith location exert more influence on the regression coefficient at location i and vice versa accordingly the fixed gaussian kernel weighting function was calculated using the following equation 6 w i j exp 1 2 d i j b 2 where w i j is the euclidean distance between the two topographical regions i and j b is the bandwidth size the model goodness of fit diagnostic must be minimized through cross validation cv score and or akaike information criterion aic to select the optimum bandwidth size the present study used the cv score to determine the optimum bandwidth using the following equation 7 c v i 1 n j 1 n y i y ˆ j i b 2 where cv is the cross validation score i and j 1 2 3 n y i and y ˆ j i are the actual and estimated values of observations respectively b is the size of bandwidth the general form of the gwr model in equation 4 has been specified to examine the determinants of household expenditure on safe drinking water econometrically the gwr model specific to our study variables is shown as under 8 h e s d w i β o u i v i β 1 u i v i h y i β 2 u i v i h h e i β 3 u i v i f s i β 4 u i v i h i a i β 5 u i v i h t v i β 6 u i v i h d d w i ε i where u i v i are the coordinates of ith district i i 1 2 3 121 β 1 u i v i β 2 u i v i β 6 u i v i are the local varying coefficient of the weighted regression model at location i and ε i is the error term at location i which is normally and independently distributed with zero mean and constant variance hesdw was the household expenditure on safe drinking water hy was the household mean income hhe was the household head education fs was the family size hia was the household access to internet facility htv was the household with television access and hddw was the household distance to safe drinking water facility 3 4 statistical tools different analytical tools were used geographical information system gis was used to construct the maps geoda was used for spatial analysis of moran s i and lisa and rstudio was used for gwr purposes anselin et al 2010 fischer and getis 2009 getis 2010 statistical package for social sciences spss and ms excel were used to extract and prepare the study variables from the dataset used in the study 4 results before delving into the spatial analysis of household expenditure on safe drinking water it is better to assess the visual patterns of the scores of study variables for this purpose all the study indicators have been displayed on maps to understand the regional variations in the accessibility of these variables across all districts of pakistan 4 1 visual representation of the study variables fig 2 a displays the household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan a cluster of districts with high expenditure on safe drinking water was found in the western districts of the country most of these districts are located in baluchistan province some of the districts from khyber pakhtunkhwa kp province also have higher monthly expenditure on safe drinking water in contrast a pattern of districts where the monthly expenditure on safe drinking water was found to be low is in the southern part of the country most of these districts are from sindh province however districts from baluchistan and punjab provinces also have lower expenditure but they did not make a pattern moreover districts from punjab province and the newly merged districts previously known as federally administered tribal areas fata made a strong cluster of districts whose expenditure on safe drinking water is relatively neither higher nor low fig 2b represents the household mean monthly income across districts of pakistan there exist considerable variations across all districts districts from punjab kp and fata displayed a cluster of high mean income whereas baluchistan and sindh province showed a bunch of districts with a lower mean income of households some of the districts from baluchistan province in the western part of the country also made a cluster of districts where the monthly income of households was relatively high the education of the household head is visually displayed in fig 2c there exist no considerable variations in districts in terms of head education almost all districts except very few from baluchistan province of the country showed that the mean head education ranges from 8 years to 11 years two of the districts from sindh province also showed a low score of the mean education of the household responsible person overall there was no obvious cluster in terms of head education across the districts of the country in most of the districts of punjab sindh and baluchistan the family size was found to be low which ranges from 3 to 6 people per household fig 2d however in fata and kp province the districts made a cluster of districts whose family size was high in comparison with other provinces some of the districts from baluchistan province also showed a pattern of high family size which ranges from 5 to 8 members like family size there are significant variations across districts concerning the percentage of households whose distance to safe drinking water is greater than 1 km fig 2e punjab and sindh provinces displayed a clear picture of districts where a higher percentage which ranges from 40 to 85 of household distance to safe drinking water is more than one km in contrast percent of households with a distance to safe drinking water greater than one km is less than in baluchistan and kp provinces fig 2f and g displayed the percent of households with access to internet and television facilities respectively both panels f and g depicted similar patterns still there is a cluster of districts where the population with internet accessibility in the northern part of the country most of these districts are located in fata and kp provinces some of the districts from punjab province have low accessibility to internet facilities which ranges from 0 to 66 percent in contrast to internet facilities there exists no clear pattern of districts concerning the percentage of households with access to television facilities all districts were found to be dispersed randomly 4 2 global moran s i and lisa analysis the household s expenditure on safe drinking water presents some sorts of clusters across the districts of pakistan especially in districts located in baluchistan province fig 2a to understand whether the contiguous districts of pakistan are spatially associated with one another or to estimate the spatial relationship among the neighboring districts the global moran s i statistic was used fig 3 a shows that concerning the household expenditure on safe drinking water the adjacent districts of pakistan were substantially spatially correlated with one another by 15 percent with a pseudo p value of 0 0002 these spatial associations or spatial clusters may be in four different quadrants 1 high high clustered quadrant also known as hotspots 2 low low clustered quadrant also knowns as cold spots 3 high low quadrant and 4 low high quadrant both high low and low high quadrants are known as outliers to identify these spatial clusters local indicators of spatial association lisa analysis has been performed fig 3b a significant cluster of high high districts was found in the central part of the country located in baluchistan province where districts with higher expenditure on safe drinking water were surrounded by the higher expenditure districts similarly the low low clustered districts were found in the northern as well as southern districts of the country where the low expenditure districts were surrounded by the districts whose expenditures were also low moreover the high low and low high clusters were noted in baluchistan and kp provinces respectively which means that high low districts concerning expenditure on safe drinking water are surrounded by low high expenditure districts 4 3 gwr results before exploring the detailed results of gwr it is necessary to compare first the non spatial regression model simple ols with the spatial regression model of gwr from table 2 it is apparent that gwr results are comparatively robust and accurate as the residual sum of squares ml based global sigma estimates 2 log likelihood aic and classic aic scores are significantly reduced with gwr application also r2 coefficient of determination has improved significantly from 34 percent to 53 percent in geographically weighted regression results according to the global ols results all variables are significant and positively associated with household expenditure on safe drinking water except head education and internet facility which have insignificantly influenced expenditure on water however the gwr results are local ones which means that each district has its coefficient these results are interpreted in detail as under income and education of households were regressed on household expenditure on safe drinking water these results are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively for income and heads education the empirical findings showed that both income and education of the head are positively related to the expenditure on safe drinking water however the education of the head was found to be insignificant across all districts of the country on average a one percent increase in per year household income has significantly increased expenditure on water from 0 07 to 0 89 percent ceteris paribus fig 4a the size of the impact is higher in the northern and eastern districts of pakistan which ranges from 0 769 to 0 851 these districts are mainly located in punjab and kp provinces in contrast a swath of the districts whose impact is relatively lower is found in the western and southern areas of the country the majority of these districts are from baluchistan and sindh provinces fig 5 a depicts that the local varying coefficients are highly significant at 1 and 5 percent except for some of the districts from baluchistan and sindh similarly fig 4b shows that keeping the other variables constant an increase by 1 year in education level generated an average decrease in the household expenditure on safe drinking water from 0 202 to 0 125 percent the highest impact range 0 044 0 125 is found in the eastern and southern districts of pakistan whereas the lowest range 0 202 to 0 085 districts are located in the central part of the country as well as in the north western part the effect of education on expenditure on safe drinking water is insignificant all over the country fig 5b the regression results of family size and internet facility are presented in fig 4c and d respectively the impact of family size is positive whereas the internet facility is negatively associated with expenditure on safe drinking water table 2 fig 4c visually displayed the locally varying coefficients of family size which range from 0 086 to 0 189 the empirical findings showed that the impact of family size on household expenditure on safe drinking water in the central districts of the country which touches almost four provinces is higher whereas districts from baluchistan and a few from punjab province have less impact score fig 5c shows that these varying coefficients are significant almost in all districts of pakistan unlike family size internet facility has negatively impacted household expenditure on safe drinking water ceteris paribus an increase of 1 percent in the population with internet accessibility on average reduces the household water expenditure by the range of 0 008 to 0 fig 4d a cluster of districts whose impact is relatively lower was found in the central part of the country whereas the outer boundary districts have higher impacts these districts were mainly from all four provinces of pakistan the local varying coefficients of almost all districts are insignificant except some of the central districts where internet accessibility is significantly associated with water expenditure fig 4d households with access to television and household distance to drinking water are regressed on expenditure on safe drinking water and their results are shown in fig 4e and f respectively the varying local coefficients of households with television facilities are lower in the southern and southwestern districts fig 4e these lower range coefficients districts are mainly located in sindh and baluchistan provinces whereas the higher range coefficients are located in punjab kp provinces as well as in the newly merged areas of kp fata television accessibility is positively associated with expenditure on safe drinking water throughout the country on average an additional percentage increase in the population with television accessibility will increase the range of the impacts on water expenditure from 0 001 to 0 006 percent fig 5e showed that the impact of television accessibility on water expenditure is significant at a 5 percent level of significance in some of the sindh and baluchistan provinces and insignificant for the rest of the country similar to television accessibility the local varying coefficients of household distance to the water are directly associated with expenditure on water the range of local coefficients is from 0 004 to 0 008 which means that some of the districts are inversely associated with water expenditure fig 4f districts with inverse coefficients were mainly located in the central part of the country whereas the districts having positive influence are located in the rest of the country fig 5f depicts that these local varying coefficients are insignificant except for some of the districts from baluchistan province which are significant at a 5 percent level of significance 5 discussion households accessibility to safe drinking water is very important as only 30 percent of the global population has access to safe drinking water undp 2019 also it is one of the significant sdgs goal 6 ensure clean water and sanitation of the united nations development program undp 2015a due to its less accessibility research on clean drinking water became the new hot spot of today s researchers and academicians the present study in this regard measured the spatial variability in household expenditure on safe drinking water across all districts and identified the significant factors that spatially determine the household expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan it is apparent from the study results that there exist considerable variations across the districts of pakistan concerning expenditure on safe drinking water the majority of the districts from baluchistan province have higher expenditure on safe drinking water households from these districts have no source of own water or if water is available then unable to drink daud et al 2017 as a result such households pay higher expenditures to get safe drinking water some of the districts have lower expenditure on safe drinking water which not only mean that they have access to safe water at a lower cost it may be because 80 percent of people in baluchistan are compelled to drink unsafe water as safe water is not available daud et al 2017 in contrast expenditure on safe drinking water is lower in punjab and some of the districts from sindh province relative to baluchistan the study results confirmed that regional or provincial variations concerning expenditure on safe drinking water exist either due to the differences in good governance political stability or mismanagement of groundwater in provincial governments cooper 2018 qureshi 2020 moreover the variations concerning household expenditure on safe drinking water are significantly dependent upon one another across districts in other words districts with the same characteristics in terms of water expenditure are located together like fig 3a confirmed that districts of pakistan are spatially agglomerated by 15 percent with a pseudo p value of 0 0002 level of significance central districts of the country most of which are from baluchistan province made a cluster of the regions that have higher expenditure on safe drinking water in contrast a pattern of districts where the expenditure on safe drinking water was found to be lower was found in northern and southern areas of pakistan as the simple regression through the ordinary least square technique is non spatial the geographically weighted regression model was applied to analytically evaluate the spatial impacts of various socioeconomic and demographic indicators on household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water the current study s empirical findings revealed that the monthly income of households significantly determined the expenditure on safe drinking water this variable was found to be positively correlated and its impact varied across districts thakur et al 2022 for instance districts from punjab and kp were found to be highly sensitive in comparison with the southern and western areas of the country the reason behind higher and lower sensitivity of income may be the inequalities in the mean or per capita income and accessibility to safe drinking water across districts deshpande et al 2020 jamal 2016 interestingly gwr results confirmed that the size of the positive impact of the monthly income of households varied geographically across districts our study results showed an insignificant contribution of household head education in the determination of expenditure on safe drinking water however it is obvious from the results that like income the impact of education varied across districts of pakistan household expenditure on safe drinking water mainly depends on the size of the family as the number of persons in a family increase the quantity of safe drinking water also increases which in turn increases the household expenditure on drinking water our findings are consistent with the previous studies of aziz et al 2022 fotue and sikod 2012 the study s empirical findings confirmed the positive significant effects of family size on household expenditure on safe water however the size of the impact is diverse across districts for instance central districts of pakistan have higher effects concerning family size whereas in some regions of baluchistan as well as punjab their impact on expenditure on safe water is low nowadays the internet is considered the best source of information awareness as it facilitates and keeps up to date people through online magazines newspapers news and so on george 2022 the study results revealed that household access to internet facilities helped in reducing the expenditure on safe drinking water with varied impacts across districts crampton and ragusa 2016 in other words internet accessibility is inversely related to expenditure on safe drinking water but the impact is insignificant it may be because only 25 percent of the total population has access to the internet bank 2020 it is also clear from fig 2f that there are considerable variations in internet accessibility across districts and most of the districts have less accessibility to the internet like the internet access to television is also considered a source of information george 2022 household expenditure on safe drinking water has been significantly reduced with the increased percentage of households with television accessibility also the results confirmed the varied impact of television accessibility on expenditure on safe drinking water access to television is found to be highly sensitive in districts from punjab whereas it is less sensitive in the areas of sindh and baluchistan provinces finally household distance to safe drinking water is found to be highly significant through conventional or non spatial ordinary least squares the conventional ols results showed that expenditure on safe drinking water is substantially increased with a one percent increase in the population with a distance 1 km to safe drinking water pichel et al 2021 in contrast the gwr results of local varying coefficients indicated the distance variable as insignificant in most of the districts it is also apparent from gwr results that for some districts the impact of distance is negative which means that household expenditure on safe drinking water declines as the percentage of households with a distance 1 km to water increases such inverse varying coefficients are opposite to the expected sign of a relationship between the distance and the expenditure on safe drinking water 6 limitations this study was limited based on some important grounds first variables other than the study may determine the household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water we used only six indicators because the available datasets lacked additional information that could influence the expenditure on safe drinking water second factors other than our study variables can be used to identify the spatially varying local coefficients of household expenditure on safe drinking water third due to the unavailability of data on socio cultural aspects this study has been limited only to socioeconomic factors fourth the variable distance was measured as the percentage of households with a distance greater than one km to safe drinking water it is because distance information was available only as to whether a household distance to safe drinking water is greater than or less than one km no information on the exact distance to the drinking water facility was available finally the gwr results were obtained at the district level as this survey was conducted at the district level spatial analysis at the union council level or even at more micro units is appropriate to better understand the spatial clusters as well as spatial local coefficients of expenditure on safe drinking water this analysis was also restricted to the district level due to the lack of spatial information such as latitude and longitude on the micro union council or village level in the surveys 7 conclusion the prompt results concluded spatial clusters of the districts with high expenditure on safe drinking water in the western part of the country on the other hand a spatial cluster of low expenditure districts was found in the southern part such higher and lower clusters occurred due to the geographical disparities in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households tirumala and tiwari 2022 moreover the clusters of high and low expenditure districts were found to be significantly associated with their neighboring districts it is concluded from the lisa analysis that districts of baluchistan have presented a spatial cluster of high high expenditure districts and districts from the northern and southern parts of the country have presented a spatial cluster of low low expenditure districts the findings of spatial dependency are worth consideration for government to reduce disparities the local varying coefficients significantly improved the coefficient of determination r2 to 53 from the conventional ols model where it was 34 monthly income of a household family size and household access to television have significantly determined the safe drinking water expenditure across all districts except some districts where the coefficients were found to be insignificant akinyemi et al 2018 further the household head s education access to internet facilities and distance to safe drinking water were found to be insignificant almost in all districts however the local varying slopes of education internet and distance to safe drinking water were found to be significant for some of the districts the robust results of gwr are useful in the identification of the areas where the government and policymakers need to focus the most as access to the internet is insignificant future studies are required to assess why people s access to the internet is insignificant the most important variable of distance was also found to be insignificant almost in all districts and in some districts its impact was recorded as negative which means the higher the population with a distance 1 km to safe drinking water the lower the expenditure on water such controversial results concluded to reconduct a separate survey in identifying the true impact of distance on household expenditure on safe drinking water finally our study results concluded that the gwr model outperformed the global model in terms of fit to the empirical dataset apart from study variables employment status socio cultural aspects access to water and sanitation facilities household locations concerning regional peripheries and so on could improve the spatial analysis thakur et al 2022 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

11683,equitable access to safe drinking water is a global concern particularly in low and middle income countries improvement towards accessibility of safe drinking water would enhance economic well being human prosperity by reducing regional disparities this study has two major objectives first it identifies the spatial patterns and the spatial relationship between contiguous districts concerning household expenditure on safe drinking water second it examines the local varying spatial impact of various sociodemographic factors on expenditure on safe drinking water by applying geographically weighted regression the study results revealed that spatial patterns of high high and low low clustered districts were located mainly in baluchistan and punjab provinces respectively in addition the gwr results exhibited that household income family size and access to television facilities were significantly associated with household expenditure on safe drinking water moreover the local gwr coefficients of these variables vary across districts of pakistan which confirmed the existence of geographical disparities in terms of household expenditure on safe drinking water thus policymakers and the government must prioritize the high high clustered districts by focusing on the key determinants of expenditure on safe drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords socioeconomic indicators safe drinking water spatial analysis spatial disparities geographically weighted regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction equitable

united nations development programme s undp s important sustainable development goals sdgs i e clean water and sanitation ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all goal 6 undp 2015b according to world health organization who safe drinking water is the proportion of inhabitants having access to an adequate quantity of safe drinking water located within a suitable distance from the residents home who 2019 in another study safe drinking water is defined as the water without any significant risk to the health for a lifetime of its usage including different sensitivities that may occur at any stage of life khwaja and aslam 2018 30 percent of people throughout the world do not have access to safely managed drinking water services and at the current rate it is expected that in 2030 1 6 billion people will lack access to safely managed drinking water undp 2015a 2019 undp reported that about 844 million people still have no access to clean and safe drinking water undp 2015b access to safe drinking water is nowadays a global concern particularly in low and middle income countries bain et al 2012 cassivi et al 2018 fukuda et al 2019 rosa and clasen 2010 shields bain et al 2015 treacy 2019 in 2017 1 2 million people died due to the unavailability of safe water sources which makes up a 2 2 percent share of global deaths however this share accounts for 6 percent of the total deaths in low income countries also the death rate in chad per year was recorded as 14 percent whereas this rate was only 0 01 percent in most of europe hannah 2021 despite many countries have improved the availability and accessibility of safe drinking water it is still a serious issue in low and middle income countries therefore the enhancement of safe water accessibility is playing a pivotal role in economic development and human prosperity numerous studies have been conducted on households access to safe drinking water and its significant determinants abubakar 2019 akram 2020 amoah 2020 gomez et al 2019 kong et al 2020 oskam et al 2021 thakur et al 2021 yousaf et al 2020 many factors such as gross national income gni female education region governance political stability and corruption are important to influence water accessibility gomez et al 2019 similarly kong et al 2020 found that income education house type and region rural urban have significantly determined the household accessibility to safe drinking water besides socio cultural aspects such as religion have also influenced improved drinking water van der voorn 2008 there exist inequalities in low and high income households in terms of access to safe drinking water households with lower socioeconomic positions have limited access to safe drinking water in comparison with households having higher socioeconomic positions oskam et al 2021 pakistan being a developing nation faces many problems such as health education housing sanitation electricity and clean water among these the lack of accessibility to safe drinking water has gained momentous consideration as it is the most central need and human right of everyone it is because only 20 of inhabitants in pakistan have access to safe drinking water aid 2019 daud et al 2017 khan et al 2020 pakistan is one of the top ten countries with the lowest access to safe drinking water khan and hussain 2020 therefore several studies have been conducted to identify the significant determinants of access to safe drinking water adil et al 2021 daud et al 2017 kausar et al 2011 khan and hussain 2021 shahid et al 2015 zahid 2018 these studies showed that income is substantially associated with access to safe drinking water which resultantly confirmed access to safe drinking water as an economic concern particularly in pakistan the government of pakistan has improved households access to safe drinking water by facilitating them with low and or zero cost but on the other hand many problems prevent people s accessibility to safe water for instance the growing population has threatened the inhabitant s accessibility to safe drinking water similarly the household distance to the place where safe drinking water is available as a result inhabitants spend a specific share of their budget to get safe water used for various domestic purposes thus identifying the factors that affect household expenditure on safe drinking water is a new hot topic for today s researchers by considering safe drinking water as an economic phenomenon most of the previous studies in pakistan explored the impact of various socioeconomic characteristics on access to safe drinking water adil et al 2021 kausar et al 2011 shahid et al 2015 there exist considerable socioeconomic variations in access to safe drinking water among households as well as across various geographical levels anthonj et al 2020 hernández vasquéz et al 2021 oskam et al 2021 households expenditure on safe water has been ignored and or studied rarely akram 2020 yousaf et al 2020 also no proper consideration has been given to geographical inequalities in households expenditure on safe drinking water reducing inequalities is one of the undp s sustainable development goals sdgs i e reduced inequalities goal 10 to achieve undp 2015b therefore the measurement of inequalities across geographical boundaries particularly in spatial perspectives is also a new hot topic for researchers there is a dire need to focus on spatial disparities in households expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan spatial analysis is useful in examining the disparities across different geographical levels it became popular after the first law of geography presented by waldo tobler in 1970 the law states that everything in the world is related to everything else but distant things are related less in comparison with near things dempsey 2014 tobler 1970 spatial analysis helps in identifying the significant atypical clusters presence of hotspots and or cold spots and outliers heterogeneous patterns hotspots are the spatial clusters of areas where a region with a high score is surrounded by neighboring regions with a high score while cold spots are the areas where a region with a lower score is surrounded by areas with lower scores spatial outliers are the clusters of regions where an area with a lower higher value is surrounded by areas with higher lower scores more interestingly the geographically weighted regression gwr approach has an opportunity to consider the coordinates data and provide separate coefficients for all regions which is impossible in the conventional ols technique raza et al 2019 therefore the gwr framework has been applied to identify the local varying coefficients of socioeconomic characteristics on household expenditure on safe drinking water the local gwr coefficients are very helpful in understanding the inequalities across regions in terms of the size of the effect keeping in view the importance of undp s two sdgs clean water and sanitation goal 6 and reduced inequalities goal 10 concerning safe drinking water the present study has two major objectives first it measures the spatial inequalities in households expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan it also recognizes the significant spatial clusters of hotspots cold spots and outliers second it examines the spatial inequalities by measuring the local varying coefficients of socioeconomic factors affecting expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan as the present study aims at measuring inequalities in household expenditure on safe drinking water this paper can contribute to the existing literature on two main grounds first expenditure on safe drinking water is studied very rarely in spatial terminologies and has not been analyzed previously in pakistan second no study in pakistan assesses the spatial local impacts of socioeconomic determinants on safe drinking water at the district level therefore this study is the first pioneering attempt to analyze the household expenditure on safe drinking water from spatial perspectives in the following sections we provide review of literature section 2 and elaborate methodology including study data source variables of the study statistical models of spatial auatocorrelation analysis and geographically weighted regression section 3 we present results and discussion in section 4 and section 5 respectively section 6 describe limitation of the study followed by the conclusion in section 7 2 review of literature safe drinking water is the central need and basic right of all human beings also it is one of the undp s sustainable development goals sdgs that needs significant consideration to discuss undp 2015b as human life is impossible without safe drinking water all habitants and or households need to spend a specific portion of their income to get safe drinking water reducing household expenditure on safe drinking water is an economic benefit that can improve human well being and prosperity these expenditures can be measured through indicators covering socioeconomic housing environmental and geographical aspects previously researchers have mainly focused on households access to safe drinking water and explored the impact of socioeconomic factors access to safe drinking water is significant because contaminated water has adverse effects on physical health having such importance researchers have conducted studies on access to safe drinking water for instance gomez et al 2019 examined the impact of socioeconomic factors on access to water in rural areas of low and middle income countries their findings suggested that gross national income gni primary education agriculture population growth and income groups have substantially influenced safe water koskei et al 2013 also conducted a study on socioeconomic factors affecting access to improved water and sanitation in bomet municipality kenya empirical findings of the study revealed that households characteristics such as the education of the head and occupation have a strong influence on household access to improved water variations in household access to safe drinking water remained one of the most troubling challenges in the world especially in low and middle income countries adams 2018 explored intra urban disparities in water access among households in malawi s slums using linear and logistic regressions this study addressed the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on water access the findings of the study showed discrepancies in the share of households that satisfy malawi versus the united nations and world health organization minimum water access standards socio economic status significantly impacted water access underscoring the need for pro poor water policies that identify that even among households in predominantly poor and under resourced urban settings significant socioeconomic differences underlie inequalities in water access a similar study conducted by hernández vasquéz et al 2021 explored disparities in household access to safe drinking water in peru from the year 2008 2018 there were no considerable variations in access to safe drinking water in small cities however in medium and large cities variations in access to safe water occurred from the year 2008 2018 moreover in small cities socioeconomic inequalities increased from 2008 to 2018 while in large cities socioeconomic disparities reduced in these ten years a bulk of the studies have also been conducted on safe drinking water from spatial perspectives for instance pullan et al 2014 measured geographical inequalities in the use of improved drinking water supply and sanitation across sub saharan africa by spatially analyzing the cross sectional data they resulted in substantial geographical inequalities in water and sanitation that exceed urban rural disparities further they evinced countries with a higher level of inequality compared to coverage in the use of an improved drinking water source also practiced higher levels of inequality in the use of improved sanitation belay and andualem 2022 conducted a study on limited access to improved unimproved drinking water among households in ethiopia in terms of spatial and fixed effect analysis household responsible persons education residence and regions were significantly correlated with limited access to drinking water service spatial findings of the study showed that the eastern part of amhara afar and the somali areas predicted the highest limited drinking water services the unimproved drinking water source was located in the central part of amhara somalia region almost all regions predicted the highest prevalence of unimproved toilet facilities these studies considered safe water accessibility only and ignored households expenditure on safe drinking water which is a major financial issue for most of the dwellers in developing nations as a result numerous studies explored the household willingness to pay wtp for water and its significant determinants for example thakur et al 2022 measured the impact of socioeconomic attributes on households willingness to pay wtp for drinking water in bihar india they used the linear regression model to measure the causal associations among socioeconomic attributes and households wtp for safe drinking water the significant socioeconomic factors of wtp for water were household income education age awareness arsenic concentration level and visit to the doctor similarly khan et al 2014 examined willingness to pay wtp for arsenic as safe arsenic free drinking water across different as risk zones in bangladesh household income water consumption and awareness of water resource contamination have substantially influenced the wtp for arsenic clean drinking water as all people demand safe water bal et al 2021 examined the income and price elasticities of safe drinking water in west bengal india considering the consumption of water they divided the households into four classes 1 domestic pipeline 2 commercial pipeline 3 domestic water tanker and 4 commercial water tanker their findings showed that the price for all groups of households is elastic further they concluded that the income elasticity of water demand is relatively high it was less in households under domestic pipeline and domestic water tanker in comparison with the other two classes in a nutshell it is obvious from previous literature that researchers have either focused on access to safe drinking water and the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on wtp for drinking water or measured the geographical inequalities concerning safe drinking water existing literature mainly studied safe water in non spatial form and very scarce consideration has been given to its spatial perspectives therefore considering the existing literature this study has been designed to measure spatial inequalities in household expenditure on safe drinking water 3 methodology 3 1 study area and data specification this study primarily concentrates on measuring the spatial inequalities concerning expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan pakistan is the world s 5th most populous country having a current population of pakistan 231 million people with a population growth rate of 2 percent per year united nations 2019 there are 32 2 million households in pakistan with 12 2 million households in urban areas and 20 million households in rural areas in general the overall distribution of the population favors the male population which is 51 percent whereas the female population is 49 percent pakistan bureau of statistics 2017 there are five provinces and federally administrated tribal areas fata and 169 districts in pakistan as this is a district level study districts of pakistan that fulfill the required information about spatial analysis were considered as the observations of the research fig 1 some of the districts were excluded from the study as they were restricted by the law and order situations at the time of the survey or they do not have sufficient information on socioeconomic and demographic indicators used to measure their impacts on household expenditure on safe drinking water after excluding these districts a total of 134 districts were considered as the study observations socioeconomic and demographic indicators were obtained from pakistan social and living standard measurement pslm survey 2019 20 recently conducted by the pakistan bureau of statistics islamabad pakistan pakistan bureau of statistics 2020 pakistan bureau of statistics has implemented the stratified two stage sample design to accumulate the data and the population of all districts of pakistan was considered as a universal sample this cross sectional dataset contains rich information on socioeconomic demographic housing health environment water and sanitation at the district level the survey has not been conducted specifically for the study of water situations in pakistan though it has sufficient information on household water status that can be used to identify the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on household expenditure on safe drinking water at the district level surveys of pslm have also been used by many researchers to achieve their study objectives 3 2 indicators of the study the selection of appropriate factors that determine the household expenditure on safe drinking water is very much important in this study the selected indicators were based on previous studies but mainly depended on the data availability table 1 shows a detailed explanation of the dependent and independent variables of the study 3 3 spatial analysis 3 3 1 spatial autocorrelation global moran s i to test whether the districts of pakistan are spatially agglomerated with one another concerning the monthly expenditure of households on safe drinking water the global moran i statistic was applied anselin 1995 the moran i statistic is econometrically written as under 1 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x i j where n in equation 1 is the number of districts x i and x j are the adjacent district ith and jth monthly expenditure on safe drinking water respectively x denotes the mean of health poverty of all districts w ij is the weighted spatial matrix in case ith and jth districts share a common boundary w ij 1 otherwise 0 i denote the score of global moran s i that ranges between 1 and 1 the closer the moran s i score to 1 or 1 the higher the spatial interconnection which means that the surrounding districts are spatially agglomerated concerning expenditure on safe drinking water and vice versa the 0 score of moran s i statistic means that the districts are disseminated randomly no spatial association in terms of households expenditure on safe drinking water 3 3 2 local indicators of spatial association lisa lisa also known as local moran s i was used to identify the significant spatial clusters and or outliers among the contiguous districts of pakistan concerning monthly expenditure on drinking water econometrically the lisa statistic is written as under 2 i i n x i x i 1 n w i j x j x i 1 n x i x i j where n denotes the number of districts x i and x j are the expenditure on drinking water of ith and jth districts respectively x is the average expenditure on the water of all districts w ij denotes the spatial weight matrix i i is the extent of a spatial relationship between each ith and its surrounding districts lisa outcomes can be divided into four quadrants i e high high hh also known as a hot spot low low ll or cold spot high low hl and low high lh both known as the outliers anselin 1995 the hh and ll quadrants mean that the health poverty of a district and its adjacent districts are significantly spatially agglomerated whereas the quadrants of hl and lh show that the contiguous districts are heterogeneous anselin 1995 3 3 3 geographically weighted regression gwr is a spatial analysis procedure that considers non stationary indicators into consideration e g demographic factors housing attributes environmental characteristics and models the local associations between these predictors and an outcome of interest gwr is an extension of the ols that augments a level of modeling sophistication by allowing the relationships between the dependent and explanatory variables to differ by locality on one hand gwr is useful as an exploratory technique that permits visualization of stimulus response relationships and if how that relationship fluctuates in space it also accounts for spatial autocorrelations of variables briefly gwr constructs a separate ols equation for every location in the study area which integrates the dependent and explanatory variables of locations falling within the bandwidth of each target location bandwidth can be manually entered by the user or it can be determined by the statistical software on the other hand like other econometric models gwr has several limitations the most important one is the problem of multicollinearity in local varying coefficients this issue has been discussed extensively and alternatives have been suggested but the debates are still in progress despite this issue gwr is still considered a significant tool for identifying the spatial non stationarity and is used extensively in previous studies antczak 2019 antczak and miszczynska 2020 li et al 2020 muche et al 2021 raza et al 2019 the conventional ordinary least square technique assumes the constant homogenous spatial association between the explanatory and dependent variables and does not capture the spatial geographical variability whereas our study s interest is to find out the spatial impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on household expenditure on safe drinking water therefore in the present study the most sophisticated model of gwr was applied as it captures the geographical variability the simple regression model is statistically written as under 3 y i β o k 1 p β k x i k ε i where y i represents the dependent variable at location i i 1 2 3 n which is the linear combination of explanatory variables x k at location i β o is the intercept term β k is the regression coefficient of kth independent variable k 1 2 3 p ε i is the error term independently and normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance this simple ols is considered a special case of a geographically weighted regression model however the assumption of a homogenous constant relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables is not correct at various topographies practically this association is heterogenous in different geographical settings as a result the simple regression model does not capture the true parameter estimates in this regard gwr is the appropriate statistical technique to measure the local varying coefficients as it considers the non stationary or spatial i e the parameter estimates become specific to location i association between dependent and independent variables the gwr model is written in an econometric form as under 4 y i β o u i v i k 1 p β k u i v i x i k ε i where u i v i denotes the coordinates longitudes and latitudes of ith location the local regression parameters were obtained using the gwr technique by assigning weights to the observations which is the function of distance from location i the parameter vector at location i can be expressed in matrix form as under 5 β ˆ i x t w u i v i x 1 x t w u i v i y i where β ˆ i is the vector of parameter k at location i i 1 2 3 n x t w u i v i x denotes the variance covariance matrix and w u i v i is the n by n local spatial weight matrix with non zero diagonal elements as it is assumed in spatial analysis regions nearby to ith location exert more influence on the regression coefficient at location i and vice versa accordingly the fixed gaussian kernel weighting function was calculated using the following equation 6 w i j exp 1 2 d i j b 2 where w i j is the euclidean distance between the two topographical regions i and j b is the bandwidth size the model goodness of fit diagnostic must be minimized through cross validation cv score and or akaike information criterion aic to select the optimum bandwidth size the present study used the cv score to determine the optimum bandwidth using the following equation 7 c v i 1 n j 1 n y i y ˆ j i b 2 where cv is the cross validation score i and j 1 2 3 n y i and y ˆ j i are the actual and estimated values of observations respectively b

s i and lisa and rstudio was used for gwr purposes anselin et al 2010 fischer and getis 2009 getis 2010 statistical package for social sciences spss and ms excel were used to extract and prepare the study variables from the dataset used in the study 4 results before delving into the spatial analysis of household expenditure on safe drinking water it is better to assess the visual patterns of the scores of study variables for this purpose all the study indicators have been displayed on maps to understand the regional variations in the accessibility of these variables across all districts of pakistan 4 1 visual representation of the study variables fig 2 a displays the household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water across districts of pakistan a cluster of districts with high expenditure on safe drinking water was found in the western districts of the country most of these districts are located in baluchistan province some of the districts from khyber pakhtunkhwa kp province also have higher monthly expenditure on safe drinking water in contrast a pattern of districts where the monthly expenditure on safe drinking water was found to be low is in the southern part of the country most of these districts are from sindh province however districts from baluchistan and punjab provinces also have lower expenditure but they did not make a pattern moreover districts from punjab province and the newly merged districts previously known as federally administered tribal areas fata made a strong cluster of districts whose expenditure on safe drinking water is relatively neither higher nor low fig 2b represents the household mean monthly income across districts of pakistan there exist considerable variations across all districts districts from punjab kp and fata displayed a cluster of high mean income whereas baluchistan and sindh province showed a bunch of districts with a lower mean income of households some of the districts from baluchistan province in the western part of the country also made a cluster of districts where the monthly income of households was relatively high the education of the household head is visually displayed in fig 2c there exist no considerable variations in districts in terms of head education almost all districts except very few from baluchistan province of the country showed that the mean head education ranges from 8 years to 11 years two of the districts from sindh province also showed a low score of the mean education of the household responsible person overall there was no obvious cluster in terms of head education across the districts of the country in most of the districts of punjab sindh and baluchistan the family size was found to be low which ranges from 3 to 6 people per household fig 2d however in fata and kp province the districts made a cluster of districts whose family size was high in comparison with other provinces some of the districts from baluchistan province also showed a pattern of high family size which ranges from 5 to 8 members like family size there are significant variations across districts concerning the percentage of households whose distance to safe drinking water is greater than 1 km fig 2e punjab and sindh provinces displayed a clear picture of districts where a higher percentage which ranges from 40 to 85 of household distance to safe drinking water is more than one km in contrast percent of households with a distance to safe drinking water greater than one km is less than in baluchistan and kp provinces fig 2f and g displayed the percent of households with access to internet and television facilities respectively both panels f and g depicted similar patterns still there is a cluster of districts where the population with internet accessibility in the northern part of the country most of these districts are located in fata and kp provinces some of the districts from punjab province have low accessibility to internet facilities which ranges from 0 to 66 percent in contrast to internet facilities there exists no clear pattern of districts concerning the percentage of households with access to television facilities all districts were found to be dispersed randomly 4 2 global moran s i and lisa analysis the household s expenditure on safe drinking water presents some sorts of clusters across the districts of pakistan especially in districts located in baluchistan province fig 2a to understand whether the contiguous districts of pakistan are spatially associated with one another or to estimate the spatial relationship among the neighboring districts the global moran s i statistic was used fig 3 a shows that concerning the household expenditure on safe drinking water the adjacent districts of pakistan were substantially spatially correlated with one another by 15 percent with a pseudo p value of 0 0002 these spatial associations or spatial clusters may be in four different quadrants 1 high high clustered quadrant also known as hotspots 2 low low clustered quadrant also knowns as cold spots 3 high low quadrant and 4 low high quadrant both high low and low high quadrants are known as outliers to identify these spatial clusters local indicators of spatial association lisa analysis has been performed fig 3b a significant cluster of high high districts was found in the central part of the country located in baluchistan province where districts with higher expenditure on safe drinking water were surrounded by the higher expenditure districts similarly the low low clustered districts were found in the northern as well as southern districts of the country where the low expenditure districts were surrounded by the districts whose expenditures were also low moreover the high low and low high clusters were noted in baluchistan and kp provinces respectively which means that high low districts concerning expenditure on safe drinking water are surrounded by low high expenditure districts 4 3 gwr results before exploring the detailed results of gwr it is necessary to compare first the non spatial regression model simple ols with the spatial regression model of gwr from table 2 it is apparent that gwr results are comparatively robust and accurate as the residual sum of squares ml based global sigma estimates 2 log likelihood aic and classic aic scores are significantly reduced with gwr application also r2 coefficient of determination has improved significantly from 34 percent to 53 percent in geographically weighted regression results according to the global ols results all variables are significant and positively associated with household expenditure on safe drinking water except head education and internet facility which have insignificantly influenced expenditure on water however the gwr results are local ones which means that each district has its coefficient these results are interpreted in detail as under income and education of households were regressed on household expenditure on safe drinking water these results are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively for income and heads education the empirical findings showed that both income and education of the head are positively related to the expenditure on safe drinking water however the education of the head was found to be insignificant across all districts of the country on average a one percent increase in per year household income has significantly increased expenditure on water from 0 07 to 0 89 percent ceteris paribus fig 4a the size of the impact is higher in the northern and eastern districts of pakistan which ranges from 0 769 to 0 851 these districts are mainly located in punjab and kp provinces in contrast a swath of the districts whose impact is relatively lower is found in the western and southern areas of the country the majority of these districts are from baluchistan and sindh provinces fig 5 a depicts that the local varying coefficients are highly significant at 1 and 5 percent except for some of the districts from baluchistan and sindh similarly fig 4b shows that keeping the other variables constant an increase by 1 year in education level generated an average decrease in the household expenditure on safe drinking water from 0 202 to 0 125 percent the highest impact range 0 044 0 125 is found in the eastern and southern districts of pakistan whereas the lowest range 0 202 to 0 085 districts are located in the central part of the country as well as in the north western part the effect of education on expenditure on safe drinking water is insignificant all over the country fig 5b the regression results of family size and internet facility are presented in fig 4c and d respectively the impact of family size is positive whereas the internet facility is negatively associated with expenditure on safe drinking water table 2 fig 4c visually displayed the locally varying coefficients of family size which range from 0 086 to 0 189 the empirical findings showed that the impact of family size on household expenditure on safe drinking water in the central districts of the country which touches almost four provinces is higher whereas districts from baluchistan and a few from punjab province have less impact score fig 5c shows that these varying coefficients are significant almost in all districts of pakistan unlike family size internet facility has negatively impacted household expenditure on safe drinking water ceteris paribus an increase of 1 percent in the population with internet accessibility on average reduces the household water expenditure by the range of 0 008 to 0 fig 4d a cluster of districts whose impact is relatively lower was found in the central part of the country whereas the outer boundary districts have higher impacts these districts were mainly from all four provinces of pakistan the local varying coefficients of almost all districts are insignificant except some of the central districts where internet accessibility is significantly associated with water expenditure fig 4d households with access to television and household distance to drinking water are regressed on expenditure on safe drinking water and their results are shown in fig 4e and f respectively the varying local coefficients of households with television facilities are lower in the southern and southwestern districts fig 4e these lower range coefficients districts are mainly located in sindh and baluchistan provinces whereas the higher range coefficients are located in punjab kp provinces as well as in the newly merged areas of kp fata television accessibility is positively associated with expenditure on safe drinking water throughout the country on average an additional percentage increase in the population with television accessibility will increase the range of the impacts on water expenditure from 0 001 to 0 006 percent fig 5e showed that the impact of television accessibility on water expenditure is significant at a 5 percent level of significance in some of the sindh and baluchistan provinces and insignificant for the rest of the country similar to television accessibility the local varying coefficients of household distance to the water are directly associated with expenditure on water the range of local coefficients is from 0 004 to 0 008 which means that some of the districts are inversely associated with water expenditure fig 4f districts with inverse coefficients were mainly located in the central part of the country whereas the districts having positive influence are located in the rest of the country fig 5f depicts that these local varying coefficients are insignificant except for some of the districts from baluchistan province which are significant at a 5 percent level of significance 5 discussion households accessibility to safe drinking water is very important as only 30 percent of the global population has access to safe drinking water undp 2019 also it is one of the significant sdgs goal 6 ensure clean water and sanitation of the united nations development program undp 2015a due to its less accessibility research on clean drinking water became the new hot spot of today s researchers and academicians the present study in this regard measured the spatial variability in household expenditure on safe drinking water across all districts and identified the significant factors that spatially determine the household expenditure on safe drinking water in pakistan it is apparent from the study results that there exist considerable variations across the districts of pakistan concerning expenditure on safe drinking water the majority of the districts from baluchistan province have higher expenditure on safe drinking water households from these districts have no source of own water or if water is available then unable to drink daud et al 2017 as a result such households pay higher expenditures to get safe drinking water some of the districts have lower expenditure on safe drinking water which not only mean that they have access to safe water at a lower cost it may be because 80 percent of people in baluchistan are compelled to drink unsafe water as safe water is not available daud et al 2017 in contrast expenditure on safe drinking water is lower in punjab and some of the districts from sindh province relative to baluchistan the study results confirmed that regional or provincial variations concerning expenditure on safe drinking water exist either due to the differences in good governance political stability or mismanagement of groundwater in provincial governments cooper 2018 qureshi 2020 moreover the variations concerning household expenditure on safe drinking water are significantly dependent upon one another across districts in other words districts with the same characteristics in terms of water expenditure are located together like fig 3a confirmed that districts of pakistan are spatially agglomerated by 15 percent with a pseudo p value of 0 0002 level of significance central districts of the country most of which are from baluchistan province made a cluster of the regions that have higher expenditure on safe drinking water in contrast a pattern of districts where the expenditure on safe drinking water was found to be lower was found in northern and southern areas of pakistan as the simple regression through the ordinary least square technique is non spatial the geographically weighted regression model was applied to analytically evaluate the spatial impacts of various socioeconomic and demographic indicators on household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water the current study s empirical findings revealed that the monthly income of households significantly determined the expenditure on safe drinking water this variable was found to be positively correlated and its impact varied across districts thakur et al 2022 for instance districts from punjab and kp were found to be highly sensitive in comparison with the southern and western areas of the country the reason behind higher and lower sensitivity of income may be the inequalities in the mean or per capita income and accessibility to safe drinking water across districts deshpande et al 2020 jamal 2016 interestingly gwr results confirmed that the size of the positive impact of the monthly income of households varied geographically across districts our study results showed an insignificant contribution of household head education in the determination of expenditure on safe drinking water however it is obvious from the results that like income the impact of education varied across districts of pakistan household expenditure on safe drinking water mainly depends on the size of the family as the number of persons in a family increase the quantity of safe drinking water also increases which in turn increases the household expenditure on drinking water our findings are consistent with the previous studies of aziz et al 2022 fotue and sikod 2012 the study s empirical findings confirmed the positive significant effects of family size on household expenditure on safe water however the size of the impact is diverse across districts for instance central districts of pakistan have higher effects concerning family size whereas in some regions of baluchistan as well as punjab their impact on expenditure on safe water is low nowadays the internet is considered the best source of information awareness as it facilitates and keeps up to date people through online magazines newspapers news and so on george 2022 the study results revealed that household access to internet facilities helped in reducing the expenditure on safe drinking water with varied impacts across districts crampton and ragusa 2016 in other words internet accessibility is inversely related to expenditure on safe drinking water but the impact is insignificant it may be because only 25 percent of the total population has access to the internet bank 2020 it is also clear from fig 2f that there are considerable variations in internet accessibility across districts and most of the districts have less accessibility to the internet like the internet access to television is also considered a source of information george 2022 household expenditure on safe drinking water has been significantly reduced with the increased percentage of households with television accessibility also the results confirmed the varied impact of television accessibility on expenditure on safe drinking water access to television is found to be highly sensitive in districts from punjab whereas it is less sensitive in the areas of sindh and baluchistan provinces finally household distance to safe drinking water is found to be highly significant through conventional or non spatial ordinary least squares the conventional ols results showed that expenditure on safe drinking water is substantially increased with a one percent increase in the population with a distance 1 km to safe drinking water pichel et al 2021 in contrast the gwr results of local varying coefficients indicated the distance variable as insignificant in most of the districts it is also apparent from gwr results that for some districts the impact of distance is negative which means that household expenditure on safe drinking water declines as the percentage of households with a distance 1 km to water increases such inverse varying coefficients are opposite to the expected sign of a relationship between the distance and the expenditure on safe drinking water 6 limitations this study was limited based on some important grounds first variables other than the study may determine the household monthly expenditure on safe drinking water we used only six indicators because the available datasets lacked additional information that could influence the expenditure on safe drinking water second factors other than our study variables can be used to identify the spatially varying local coefficients of household expenditure on safe drinking water third due to the unavailability of data on socio cultural aspects this study has been limited only to socioeconomic factors fourth the variable distance was measured as the percentage of households with a distance greater than one km to safe drinking water it is because distance information was available only as to whether a household distance to safe drinking water is greater than or less than one km no information on the exact distance to the drinking water facility was available finally the gwr results were obtained at the district level as this survey was conducted at the district level spatial analysis at the union council level or even at more micro units is appropriate to better understand the spatial clusters as well as spatial local coefficients of expenditure on safe drinking water this analysis was also restricted to the district level due to the lack of spatial information such as latitude and longitude on the micro union council or village level in the surveys 7 conclusion the prompt results concluded spatial clusters of the districts with high expenditure on safe drinking water in the western part of the country on the other hand a spatial cluster of low expenditure districts was found in the southern part such higher and lower clusters occurred due to the geographical disparities in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households tirumala and tiwari 2022 moreover the clusters of high and low expenditure districts were found to be significantly associated with their neighboring districts it is concluded from the lisa analysis that districts of baluchistan have presented a spatial cluster of high high expenditure districts and districts from the northern and southern parts of the country have presented a spatial cluster of low low expenditure districts the findings of spatial dependency are worth consideration for government to reduce disparities the local varying coefficients significantly improved the coefficient of determination r2 to 53 from the conventional ols model where it was 34 monthly income of a household family size and household access to television have significantly determined the safe drinking water expenditure across all districts except some districts where the coefficients were found to be insignificant akinyemi et al 2018 further the household head s education access to internet facilities and distance to safe drinking water were found to be insignificant almost in all districts however the local varying slopes of education internet and distance to safe drinking water were found to be significant for some of the districts the robust results of gwr are useful in the identification of the areas where the government and policymakers need to focus the most as access to the internet is insignificant future studies are required to assess why people s access to the internet is insignificant the most important variable of distance was also found to be insignificant almost in all districts and in some districts its impact was recorded as negative which means the higher the population with a distance 1 km to safe drinking water the lower the expenditure on water such controversial results concluded to reconduct a separate survey in identifying the true impact of distance on household expenditure on safe drinking water finally our study results concluded that the gwr model outperformed the global model in terms of fit to the empirical dataset apart from study variables employment status socio cultural aspects access to water and sanitation facilities household locations concerning regional peripheries and so on could improve the spatial analysis thakur et al 2022 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

however the chemical and physical colour removal techniques are not economical have low elimination potential and poor reusability capability and are the source of secondary pollutants as a result research on developing novel technologies and materials is a continuous process for dye removal from wastewater adsorption appears to be the most promising removal approach with excellent dye adsorption capacity due to basic design cost effectiveness and sludge free operation li et al 2019 baidya and kumar 2021 several studies have reported dye removal using agro industrial wastes for

studies showed that agricultural waste such as walnut shells had cellulose structures with huge surface area and suitable physical properties such as mechanical strength chemical stability and efficient regeneration for reproducing adsorbents cao et al 2014 dahri et al 2014 almasi et al 2016 ashrafi et al 2017 uddin and nasar 2020 therefore in this study we have synthesized chemically modified walnut shells with cationic amino functional groups from the powdered walnut shell to increase their affinity for cr dye thus in this work a adsorption capacities of chemically modified

reagent walnut shells biomass was purchased from the local market of sirsa haryana india analytical grade chemicals were used to modify the walnut shells and to conduct the cr dye removal experiments sodium hydroxide epichlorohydrin diethylenetriamine and sodium chloride were acquired from himedia laboratory pvt ltd india sulphuric acid ethanol and cr dye were obtained from thermo fisher scientific india pvt ltd india 2 2 synthesis of cationic amino modified walnut shell cmws locally available walnut shells were washed 3 4 times to remove surface deposited impurities such as dust afterward the walnut shells were boiled for 60 min to eliminate the pulp and residual seed capsules the walnut shell was rinsed with deionized di water multiple times and soaked in di water for 24 h to remove residual adhesive flesh fig 1 the cleaned walnut shell was then oven dried for 24 h at 105 c after which it was crushed and sieved to acquire particle sizes less than 300 μm further powdered walnut shells are stored in a desiccator before modification considered raw walnut shells rws the procedure for modification of rws was followed by cao et al 2014 in brief 150 ml of sodium hydroxide 1 25 m was mixed with 100 ml epichlorohydrin at 30 c the solution was agitated with 10 g of prepared rws for 30 min at 40 c after multiple washes to neutral ph the resulting material was oven dried at 65 c fig 1 afterward 150 ml of sodium hydroxide 0 125 m and 25 ml of diethylenetriamine solution were agitated with dried materials the mixtures were then manually agitated at 65 c for 60 min before being rinsed with di water to raise the ph to be neutral fig 1 lastly the washed powder was oven dried at 65 c for 3 h to yield chemically modified walnut shells known as cationic amino modified walnut shell cmws 2 3 characterization of cmws fesem make jeol japan was used for morphological features of rws and cmws fourier transforms infrared ftir spectrometer make perkinelmer usa spectrum two

regenerated adsorbent was utilized repeatedly for cr dye removal and followed the same procedure until the third cycle 2 8 response surface design this study considered ccd to understand optimal process conditions in removing cr dye using cmws ccd is useful for optimizing process variables and investigating their interactions with minimal experimentation the removal efficiency of cr dye was analyzed as a function of ph a contact time b adsorbent dose c and initial dye concentration d table 1 these parameters were investigated at five levels coded as α 1 0 1 and α where α as 24 0 25 2 0 the 1 code represents low and the 1 code represents the high levels of the independent variables the experimental error and data reproducibility are determined based on the central points this research included 30 experiments containing 16 facsimiles of central points and 8 axial points roy et al 2022 see section 2 supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of rws and cmws fesem images are commonly used to explore the morphological characteristics of adsorbent the surface characteristics of rws cmws and cr dye loaded cmws were observed using fesem fig 2 the surface of rws is highly compact with fewer irregular cellulose fibers hemicellulose and lignin rws has a highly closed structure due to its smooth and solid composition fig 2a however the cmws has a more heterogenous glossy surface with cavities ledges and pores of various sizes and shapes for better dye adsorption fig 2b sodium hydroxide presence eliminates the pore blocking compounds and liberates the reactive functional groups like hydroxyl groups and organic modifiers filled during the chemical modification process making the surface smoother and glossier the surface alteration after modification pre treatment and dye adsorption process confirm the adsorbent absorbate interaction the surface morphology of cmws changes significantly after cr dye loading with holes filled and covered and the glossy and smooth surface appearance becoming rough fig 2c adsorption occurred once cmws encountered cr dye as evidenced by the micrographs ftir spectrum of powdered rws cmws and cr dye loaded cmws showed several peaks corresponding to o h stretching c h bending and stretching co stretching cc stretching n h bending and stretching and c o stretching indicating the presence of various functional groups like hydroxyl carboxylic alkanes aldehydes amines alkenes methyl and methylene groups for example the pronounced hydroxyl group has been attributed at 3321 3350 cm 1 in rws cmws and cr dye loaded cmws which is assigned to o h and n h stretching vibrations in addition peaks at 2881 2919 cm 1 indicate c h stretching vibrations observed in methyl and methylene groups after modification a peak at 2352 cm 1 in cmws and cr dye loaded cmws indicated the ch and cn bonds the intense band was located at 1027 1031 cm 1 and 1224 1231 cm 1 allocated to c o stretching in alcohol phenol or ether groups i e cellulose and lignin presence in all three walnut shells however the peak intensity at1228 cm 1 and 1224 cm 1 was reduced in cmws and cr dye loaded cmws respectively compared to rws 1231 cm 1 indicated delignification due to the use of sodium hydroxide in the modification process the presence of hemicellulose at 1729 cm 1 observed in rws which was assigned to co stretching vibrations revealed carboxyl groups presence which vanished in the cmws due to reactions between cationic amino and carboxyl groups in the modification of walnut shell peaks at 1592 1593 cm 1 and 1505 cm 1 indicate cc stretching vibrations and cc skeletal vibrations to rws cmws and cr dye loaded cmws fig 3 the ftir spectrum of epichlorohydrin and diethylenetriamine treated walnut shell indicated new peaks at 2352 cm 1 ch and cn stretching 1414 cm 1 c h stretching and slight deviations from 1231 cm 1 to 1228 cm 1 c o stretching and 1031 cm 1 to 1027 cm 1 c o bending indicating the change in surface functionality of cmws a peak at 1729 cm 1 co stretching proved carboxyl groups on rws that disappeared after modification with epichlorohydrin and diethylenetriamine which indicated an acylated condensation reaction between carboxyl groups of rws and the amino group of diethylenetriamine further the generation of new peaks at broadband in the range of 3321 3350 cm 1 n h stretching indicates the presence of numerous amino groups generated because of diethylenetriamine modification fig 3 3 2 effect of ph and phpzc water chemistry is crucial for understanding cr dye adsorption on walnut shells therein batch sorption experiments were conducted at ph 2 10 using rws and cmws maximum adsorption capacity and removal efficiency for cr dye using rws was observed to be 6 09 mg g and 24 36 respectively at ph 2 fig 4 a similarly cmws indicated optimal removal efficiency of 94 12 observed at ph 2 which showed 23 53 mg g adsorptive capacity using cmws due to the easy accessibility of cr dye molecules to optimal active sites based on the above observations fig 4a depicts that modification of the walnut shell increased the adsorption capacities similar to this study functionalized powder walnut shell showed 94 53 removal of cr dye at ph 3 12 ojo et al 2019 dovi et al 2021a have shown 95 cr dye removal efficiency using amine functionalized walnut shells acwns at ph 5 for cr dye of 200 mg l concentration to understand the ph influence on cr dye removal the point of zero charges phpzc of cmws was measured which had a net zero charge at ph 5 9 fig 4b similarly

studies have also analyzed various adsorption kinetics to understand the mechanism li et al 2020 dovi et al 2021b for example dovi et al 2021b reported that cr dye removal using cationic surfactant modified walnut shells showed a pseudo second order kinetic mechanism 3 6 regeneration and reusability of cmws to understand the practical applicability the modified walnut shell cmws was reused further for cr dye removal fig 7 cr dye removal was reduced to 90 34 using the regenerated cmws in the first cycle further the removal efficiency was reduced to 82 18 under similar experimental conditions in the third adsorption cycle at the same time desorption of cr dye was also observed which states that adsorbed cr dye gets removed from the surface of cmws during regeneration therefore during regeneration a desorption efficiency of 82 26 for cr dye was observed in the first cycle which reduced to 68 18 desorption in the third cycle the decline in the cr dye removal efficiency in various cycles was observed due to less dye desorption in the respective regeneration of adsorbent in addition biomass losses were also observed during the regeneration of modified walnut shells after

2014 dovi et al 2021a 2021b the phpzc of cmws was around 5 9 indicating hydrogen ions h presence which protonated the surface fig 4b modification incorporates various amino groups on cmws which also protonated and dispersed on the surface cr dye was removed via electrostatic action anionic attraction ph phpzc between so3 groups and the protonated nh3 groups of cr dye and cmws respectively further a slight drop in the wide band range of 3300 3600 cm 1 in cr dye adsorbed adsorbent indicated the protonated o h groups implicated for cr dye adsorption fig 3 peaks at 1593 cm 1 decreased which demonstrated the involvement of nh group of cmws in the hydrogen bonding cationic surfaces can produce strong electrostatic attraction with anionic dyes ftir phpzc and surface charges revealed hydrogen bonding i e dipole dipole interaction between oxygen groups of cr dye and nitrogen containing functional groups of cmws surface encouraging cr dye adsorption moreover electrostatic adsorption was major involved for example charged cr dye with functional groups of so3 and positively charged cmws surface in addition the fesem image makes clear that cr dye was filled in the porous structure of cmws therefore hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction are significant interactions along with pore filling in cr dye adsorption on the cmws surface fig 8 the currently proposed method is proven to be a high adsorption capacity of cr dye molecules onto cmws 3 8 comparative discussion for cr dye removal based on previous studies table 4 shows comparative experimental conditions and the adsorptive nature of raw or modified walnut shells to remove cr dye in aqueous solutions it has been observed that modifications of walnut shells improve the characteristics of adsorbents and enhance the adsorption potential for example powdered walnut shell showed 18 55 mg g uptake capacity for cr dye at ph 3 12 whereas walnut shell powder based activated carbon exhibited a higher uptake capacity of 40 mg g at a removal efficiency of 94 53 therein the dye adsorption mechanism shows that removal was supported via langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order ojo et al 2019 significant adsorption capacities 281 45 442 56 mg g were observed to be increased at temperatures 24 85 44 85 oc 298 318 k using zncl2 based modification of walnut shell li et al 2020 dovi et al 2021a recently revealed an adsorption capacity of 104 4 mg g by cationic surfactant modified walnut shell observed for cr dye removal further amino functionalized walnut shells demonstrated an increased adsorption capacity of 224 4 mg g for cr dye supported with langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order dovi et al 2021b however in this study the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed an adsorption capacity of 44 36 mg g at ph 3 for 150 mg l of dye concentration interestingly the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed uniform distribution of binding sites for cr dye i e temkin was the best fitted isotherm unlike other modified walnut shells that showed langmuir isotherm in addition in this case pseudo second order is considered the best fit among kinetics for cr dye using cationic amino modified walnut shells like those possessed by other modified walnut shells 4 conclusion removing dyes from water bodies is crucial from an environmental and ecological security viewpoint this work aims to investigate the removal of cr dye using rws and cmws and optimize the experimental conditions surface modification improved dye adsorption and confirmed adsorbent absorbate interactions the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed uniform distribution of binding sites for cr dye i e temkin was the best fitted isotherm and pseudo second order is considered the best fit among kinetics for cr dye using cationic amino modified walnut shells the surface morphology of cmws changes significantly after cr dye loading with holes filled and covered and the glossy and smooth surface becoming rough thus this study revealed that cr dye was adsorbed using cmws via electrostatic attraction pore fillings and hydrogen bonding this work concluded with further recommendations worth to be explored for

surface of rws is highly compact with fewer irregular cellulose fibers hemicellulose and lignin rws has a highly closed structure due to its smooth and solid composition fig 2a however the cmws has a more heterogenous glossy surface with cavities ledges and pores of various sizes and shapes for better dye adsorption fig 2b sodium hydroxide presence eliminates the pore blocking compounds and liberates the reactive functional groups like hydroxyl groups and organic modifiers filled during the chemical modification process making the surface smoother and glossier the surface alteration after modification pre treatment and dye adsorption process confirm the adsorbent absorbate interaction the surface morphology of cmws changes significantly after cr dye loading with holes filled and

adsorptive nature of raw or modified walnut shells to remove cr dye in aqueous solutions it has been observed that modifications of walnut shells improve the characteristics of adsorbents and enhance the adsorption potential for example powdered walnut shell showed 18 55 mg g uptake capacity for cr dye at ph 3 12 whereas walnut shell powder based activated carbon exhibited a higher uptake capacity of 40 mg g at a removal efficiency of 94 53 therein the dye adsorption mechanism shows that removal was supported via langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order ojo et al 2019 significant adsorption capacities 281 45 442 56 mg g were observed to be increased at temperatures 24 85 44 85 oc 298 318 k using zncl2 based modification of walnut shell li et al 2020 dovi et al 2021a recently revealed an adsorption capacity of 104 4 mg g by cationic surfactant modified walnut shell observed for cr dye removal further amino functionalized walnut shells demonstrated an increased adsorption capacity of 224 4 mg g for cr dye supported with langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order dovi et al 2021b however in this study the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed an adsorption capacity of 44 36 mg g at ph 3 for 150 mg l of dye concentration interestingly the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed uniform distribution of binding sites for cr dye i e temkin was the best fitted isotherm unlike other modified walnut shells that showed langmuir isotherm in addition in this case pseudo second order is considered the best fit among kinetics for cr dye using cationic amino modified walnut shells like those possessed by other modified walnut shells 4 conclusion removing dyes from water bodies is crucial from an environmental and ecological security viewpoint this work aims to investigate the removal of cr dye using rws and cmws and optimize the experimental conditions surface modification improved dye adsorption and confirmed adsorbent absorbate interactions the cationic amino modified walnut shell showed uniform distribution of binding sites for cr dye i e temkin was the best fitted isotherm and pseudo second order is considered the best fit among kinetics for cr dye using cationic amino modified walnut shells the surface morphology of cmws changes significantly after cr dye loading with holes filled and covered and the glossy and smooth surface becoming rough thus this study revealed that cr dye was adsorbed using cmws via electrostatic attraction pore fillings and hydrogen bonding this work concluded with further recommendations worth to be explored for cr dye removal using walnut shells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
