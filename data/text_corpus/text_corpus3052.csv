15260,seawater for toilet flushing conserves the scarce freshwater resources in hong kong and similar densely populated coastal cities saline sewage treatment using energy efficient anammox based processes appears to be beneficial with notable potential for the future however the feasibility of this process remains uncharted especially from its start up to its steady state cooperation in this study a pilot scale mainstream anammox process was succeeded in a granular activated carbon fluidized bed membrane bioreactor fmbr with only inoculating saline anaerobic digestion sludge the fmbr operating at the dissolved oxygen do of 0 04 0 16 mg l achieved comparable nitrogen removal rates of 50 1 78 3 g n m3 d while treating real chemically enhanced primary treatment saline sewage at 3 2 m3 d excluding scalindua 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed a high abundance of common freshwater observed kuenenia from 0 2 day 259 to 1 3 day 332 in biofilms nitrosomonas responsible for ammonium oxidation dominated in biofilms and accounted for 1 8 9 2 nitrite oxidizing bacteria incursion happened unexpectedly due to high oxygen exposure supply from temporary on site technical difficulties however nob suppression was achieved by controlling do at 0 16 mg l leading the fmbr s stability over the 343 day operation sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur dependent denitrifiers propagated with high abundance representing 14 0 10 6 and 6 0 2 0 in suspensions and 7 2 1 8 and 15 9 2 3 in biofilms respectively further metagenomic sequencing analysis indicated the c n s synergy of nitritation anammox sulfate reduction and mixotrophic denitrification in the fmbr importantly this research found that such a novel c n s synergy was made by the scavenges of hydrogen sulfide by gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and b19 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and b04 species having ascendancy subsisting in the presence of oxygen owing to their aptitude of detoxifying reactive oxygen species knowledge gleaned from this study as well as a complete set of pilot experimental data could serve as a strong technical base for the larger scale application of this process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline mainstream anammox fluidized membrane bioreactor kuenenia synergetic c n s loop saline sewage data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the scarcity of clean fresh water has become an unrelenting undeniably serious global problem due to the rapidly increasing world population this insufficiency highlights the pressing need for alternative water resources globally since more than half the world s population resides in coastal areas merkens et al 2016 the utilization of seawater for toilet flushing has been adopted in many places to alleviate the freshwater resources shortage li et al 2005 mackey et al 2019 sun et al 2009 hong kong has used seawater for toilet flushing swtf for over 60 years li et al 2005 thereby reducing freshwater consumption by over 22 while serving up to 80 of the city s population leung et al 2012 however the introduction of swtf produces sewage salinity ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 and approximately 2 million m3 day of saline sewage yang et al 2015 this requires a new process to supplement the nitrification denitrification n dn approach which is commonly applied for freshwater municipal wastewater treatment currently anammox is being applied for treating ammonium rich wastewater this is known as the sidestrea anammox lackner et al 2014 mainstream anammox has been successfully tested at the laboratory bench and pilot scale in many locations hoekstra et al 2019 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 full scale anammox is an encouraging process in temperate and tropical areas such as south america singapore and hong kong for example a full scale mainstream anammox application was first achieved at the changi water reclamation plant in singapore contributing to about 38 of total nitrogen removal cao et al 2016 however its mainstream saline anammox has not yet been sufficiently studied saline mainstream anammox inherits two restrictions 1 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob induced process instability and 2 saline anammox bioaugmentation firstly nob incursion could provoke the process deterioration by competing with anammox bacteria for nitrite recent studies have proven that nob suppression is feasible in hybrid floc biofilm mainstream anammox processes in long term operation despite its consistent presence laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 malovanyy et al 2015 this feasibility was explained by proof of concept nob in biofilms is suppressed by limited dos and selective nob washout from flocs is achievable via a decrease in do and or an increase in floc discharge laureni et al 2019 for this process a low do supply was suggested e g 0 15 0 18 mgo2 l laureni et al 2016 0 17 0 04 mgo2 l laureni et al 2019 below 0 3 mgo2 l gilbert et al 2015 and 0 1 0 16 mgo2 l full scale cao et al 2016 secondly excellent biomass retention with fouling mitigated efficient membrane bioreactor shen et al 2012 has been proven to be an ideal tool to grow anammox bacteria van der star et al 2008 granular activated carbon gac fluidized membrane bioreactor fmbr has been successfully developed to treat diluted wastewater for methane generation shin et al 2016 shin et al 2014 in these applications membrane fouling was effectively controlled over long term operations i e 485 days shin et al 2014 and 2 years shin et al 2016 the introduction of gac served as biomass carrier and membrane fouling mitigator via scouring force in this regard the fmbr could be nominated as a suitable approach to implementing the mainstream anammox processes thirdly the detection of scalindua in saline sewage treatment facilities wu et al 2019 demonstrated the feasibility of saline mainstream anammox evidence also stemmed from the ubiquity of scalindua brocadia and kuenenia in saline ecosystems sonthiphand et al 2014 zheng et al 2016 providing analogous niches for the mainstream treatment low ammonium and varied seasonal temperatures the toxic concern of hydrogen sulfide derived from sulfate reduction on nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms is likely to be exempted this result was reported in a study of sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated process known as sani with saline sewage wang et al 2009 taking the extant research into consideration the saline mainstream anammox seemed feasible in the gac fmbr in this study mainstream anammox was implemented in a pilot scale gac fmbr to treat chemically enhanced primary treatment cept saline sewage such sewage has a lower c n ratio e g 2 1 4 7 suitable for mainstream anammox applications the pilot scale gac fmbr was initially seeded with saline anaerobic digestion sludge to start and its long term performance under variable nitrogen loads and temperatures was monitored in addition microbial community analyses were carried out using 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing the overarching objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the feasibility of the saline mainstream anammox and 2 disclose symbiotic patterns of functional microbial consortia especially for s metabolism linking with c and n by finding a spatially ordered oxygen gradient i e 0 08 0 03 mg l of the c n s synergic microbial consortia the outcome of this study should aid the significant broadening of anammox technology to the treatment of saline sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant description and operation strategies a pilot scale fmbr fig 1 installed at the stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw in hong kong was used to treat the effluent of the cept process scistw the fourth largest wwtp in the world is currently serving up to 80 of the local sewage treatment with 1 7 million m3 saline sewage generated daily the characteristics of cept sewage were ph 7 0 0 2 alkalinity 240 2 81 3 mg l salinity 1 1 0 1 ammonium 21 5 5 1 mgn l bod5 80 4 19 6 mg l cod 142 3 35 5 mg l and tn 26 8 6 7 mgn l the rectangular shaped stainless steel sts 304 fmbr had an effective working volume of 1 06 m3 0 85 m by 0 51 m in area with 2 84 m depth a settler 1 25 m by 0 91 m in area with 0 7 m depth containing a submerged weir 0 85 m by 0 51 m with 1 5 cm v notch height with a total liquid volume of 0 49 m3 was connected on the reactor top to prevent gac overflow into the recycle line five membrane modules each consisting of 2 36 m long hollow fiber polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with the pore size of 0 1 Âµm provided by kolon membrane korea were installed in the fmbr the total surface area of the membranes was 55 m2 the fmbr was introduced with 332 3 kg of granular activated carbon gac calgon f300 usa occupying approximately 56 of the reactor working volume when settled the recycle flow rate was set to 30 m3 h responding to an up flow velocity of 1 15 m min which was sufficient to expand the gac to 100 of the reactor working volume this enabled effective scouring of all membrane surfaces a tubular diffuser was installed at the reactor bottom to implement efficient aeration the pilot scale fmbr was automated using an integrated programmable logic controller plc unit fig s1 operational ph and temperature were monitored by the submerged sensors installed on the reactor top sodium carbonate solution was added automatically when ph was below 7 2 temperature was not controlled and varied according to the actual temperature of the scistw sewage 14 5 34 5 c table 1 the dissolved oxygen do was automatically controlled using a sub plc unit burkert gmbh co kg ingelfingen germany throughout the trial and its set value was 0 1 mg l the do was measured by taking the mean of readings obtained from five do sensors which were vertically installed on the reactor wall aeration was implemented with an air compressor however the aeration was stopped while the fmbr was operating under the anoxic condition temporarily this occurred when incidents happened onsite i e power supply circuit the plc crash water level sensor malfunction sewage supply shortage due to power outrage breakage and or damage of influent pipeline and influent sewage pump malfunction as documented in table s1 the transmembrane pressure was recorded with a pressure gauge installed in the effluent line calibrations of the do sensor and ph sensor were conducted monthly the temperature sensor was calibrated when starting up the system it functioned stably during the entire operation a 2 0 mm mesh sieve was installed on the top of the influent storage tank to sort sundries e g leaves foam rubber plastic and hair the sieve was cleaned every week and replaced every month due to saline sewage corrosion in this study the pilot scale fmbr was started with inoculating 500 l of digested sludge obtained from a full scale anaerobic digester operated at tai po sewage treatment works in hong kong it contained 5 7 g l total suspended solids tss and 4 3 g l volatile suspended solids vss the reactor was initially operated in an intermittent mode for the first stage lasting 146 days during the first 33 days tap water was used to replenish the liquid loss via evaporation and sampling ammonium chloride of 70 g d equivalent to 10 0 mgn l was fed on days 10 33 from day 34 onwards the fmbr was fed with the saline cept sewage on days 34 82 0 2 0 4 m3 d sewage and 115 g d ammonium chloride equivalent to 16 5 mgn l were supplemented from days 83 146 supplementation of ammonium chloride was suspended and the sewage load was increased from 0 5 to 1 2 m3 d this suggests that the fmbr began to operate under mainstream conditions from this point onward in addition ammonium chloride dosing of 140 g d equivalent to 20 0 mgn l was supplemented on days 98 107 when the sewage supply was not available due to influent sewage pump failure from day 147 onwards the fmbr was changed to a continuous flow mode with a starting hrt of 12 hr from day 162 the hrt was prolonged to 30 hr since elevated ammonium remained in the effluent i e 24 4 4 7 mgn l furthermore the hrt was halved on day 178 and then progressively reduced to 10 hr on day 278 and 8 hr on day 321 respectively during the continuous flow operation period ammonium chloride i e approximately 30 mgn l ammonium was added when sewage supply was not available due to the incidents listed in table s1 2 2 analytical methods the determination of nitrogen compounds tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n tss vss alkalinity salinity chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were carried out according to the standard

approximately 30 gbp of metagenomic sequence data were generated for each dna sample the raw 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequence data have been deposited in ncbi under the bioproject prjna544020 sequences of the c n s metabolizing microorganisms are accessible with mw136667 mw136692 2 4 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing analyses the analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences was described in our previous study huang and lee 2021 alpha diversity statistics were calculated with mothur the weighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis pcoa was employed to evaluate the beta diversity the pcoa plot was carried out with the vegan package and visualized via ggplot2 the phylogenetic tree of observed microorganisms and reported relatives was constructed with mega7 microbial symbiotic patterns were investigated with a co occurrence network the linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was applied to explore the hub microbes of the microbial community in suspension sludge and biofilms tax4fun and faprotax were utilized to exploit the functional profiles of the microbial community the analysis of metagenomic sequences was conducted according to bolger et al 2014 khmer scripts were used for digital normalization to remove redundant sequences the trimmed clean paired end reads were further de novo assembled using spades genome assembler ver 3

characterization was determined with local blastp and kegg blastkoala while blastkoala was further utilized to reconstruct functional pathways kanehisa et al 2016 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the pilot scale fmbr operated at an intermittent flow mode from day 1 to 146 and a continuous flow mode from day 147 to 343 table 1 initially ammonium chloride was supplemented to foster the growth of aob and anammox bacteria on days 10 82 the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated in the range of 27 5 24 1 mgn l whilst 10 0 16 5 mgn l of ammonium chloride was supplemented the effluent nitrite concentration was first kept below 5 mgn l on days 10 27 thereafter it was accumulated at the elevated levels of 21 2 105 7 mgn l on days 30 82 corresponding to over 94 1 of nitrite accumulation efficiency on days 83 146 the reactor was fed with an incremental sewage flow from 0 5 to 1 2 m3 d the nitrite dominated effluent demonstrated a diminishing trend from 79 8 to 1 5 mgn l effluent ammonium remained at the levels of 9 3 11 3 mgn l nitrate was detected at 1 6 1 5 mgn l and 0 4 0 4 mgn l on days 10 82 and 83 146 respectively at the intermittent operation phase partial ammonium oxidation and high efficient nitrite accumulation i e 90 2 100 were achieved concurrently subsequently the fmbr operated with the continuous feeding at varied hrts table 1 initially the reactor was overrated and started with an hrt of 12 h leading to poor conversion of ammonium with the high remaining of over 19 2 mg nh4 n l afterwards the hrt was prolonged to 30 h and on average the reactor achieved 88 3 ammonium conversion when an hrt of 15 h was implemented the system obtained an average nre of 65 6 with the effluent ammonium below 5 0 mgn l except for the incidental periods for instance from day 220 to 234 effluent ammonium ranging 6 9 12 3 mgn l was detected due to insufficient oxygen supply i e malfunction of air compressor during the last forty days at the hrt of 15 h the fmbr reached a quasi steady state and achieved an average nre of 69 8 with a mean effluent tn of 8 1 mgn l further the fmbr was operated at the hrt of 10 h and 8 h successively achieving average nres of 69 4 and 71 1 respectively the pilot plant eventually obtained nrrs ranging 50 1 78 3 60 6 13 3 g n m3 d with the effluent tn below 10 mgn l at the hrt of 8 h this was comparable with the levels of the reported mainstream anammox treating freshwater wastewaters e g 47 0 83 2 g n m3 d ji et al 2020 kao et al 2022 laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 malovanyy et al 2015 the operating do was controlled at 0 16 mg l consistently which led nitrate the dominant nitrogen species in the effluent to remain at below 4 5 mgn l on days 147 270 this finding suggested a robust suppression of nob theretofore on day 278 the fmbr system encountered a water level sensor failure as a consequence a certain amount of biomass including gac and suspended sludge sloped over the reactor unsurprisingly the exposure of biomass to air rendered rising nitrate in the effluent on days 279 343 i e 6 8 2 2 mgn l however the fmbr system retained nres of 70 0 8 9 in this time suggesting the resilience of the fmbr system during a short shock furthermore the fmbr established relatively steady nres of 66 8 11 4 over the 180 days continuous operation days 162 343 despite confronting sundry incidents table s1 this echoed the materiality of insuring low dos during the operation of mainstream anammox processes as for cod the fmbr obtained effluent cod of 2 1 7 1 mg l at intermittent flow operation period and cod removals of 90 at the continuous flow operation phase table 1 in brief the pilot plant obtained the effluent quality of bod5 below 10 mg l cod below 20 mg l tss below 30 mg l ammonium below 5 mgn l and tn below 10 mgn l while treating the cept sewage at a capacity of 3 2 m3 d 3 2 microbiomes statistical results of 16s and meta genomics 3 2 1 microbial population dynamics based on 16s rrna gene table s2 contains the summary of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis good s coverage 95 7 was obtained for all samples suggesting a satisfactory sequencing depth claesson et al 2010 the microbial consortia associated with the gac was enriched as inferred by the increasing diversity and richness indices table s2 as for the taxonomic classification at phylum level bacteroidetes and proteobacteria dominated all samples and in total represented 69 1 77 4 60 0 56 2 70 9 93 4 90 6 77 0 and 76 3 in seed s1 s4 and b1 b4 respectively at genus level nitrosomonas was detected as the corresponding aob and dominated in biofilm ranging between 1 8 9 2 fig 2 a nitrospira a typical nob was detected at below 0 04 in all suspension and biofilm samples collected at the hrts of 30 h and 15 h this finding was in line with the reactor performance since nitrate was mostly detected at below 1 mgn l later nitrospira proliferated to 0 8 and 0 9 in relation to s3 and b3 day 308 and further rose to 1 2 and 1 3 in s4 and b4 day 332 respectively this nitrospira incursion was ascribed to refilling overflowed sludge that was exposed to air for several hours on day 278 as noted above as for the denitrifying populations arcobacter and pseudomonas which accounted for 21 5 and 17 3 in seed respectively were eliminated along with the operation instead typical denitrifiers i e hyphomicrobium and paracoccus proliferated and dominated in biofilms representing 1 5 and 0 7 on average respectively fig 2a meanwhile microbe affiliated with thalassospira a known facultative denitrifier liu et al 2007 was significantly enriched from below 0 05 in seed to 6 1 in s3 3 2 in s4 2 1 in b3 and 1 7 in b4 respectively remarkably microorganism affiliated with phaeodactylibacter fig 2b which performs aerobic denitrification lei et al 2015 was enriched from 1 0 to 20 5 in bulk sludge and from 0 2 to 4 7 in biofilms lutimonas and ulvibacter which are capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite aerobically kim et al 2014 nedashkovskaya et al 2004 were detected with high abundances and in total accounted for 10 1 4 9 4 5 and 3 7 in s1 s4 and 24 0 26 2 19 5 and 17 6 in b1 b4 respectively furthermore microbes otu19 22 39 and 48 sharing the best hit with lewinella xylanilytica a bacterium capable of reducing nitrate to nitric oxide aerobically sung et al 2015 occupied 3 8 2 1 in suspension sludge and 2 0 0 9 in biofilms in total these aerobic and facultative anaerobic denitrifiers either require na for growth thalassospira lutimonas and ulvibacter or prefer to live in the presence of nacl phaeodactylibacter and lewinella with the optimal value of 2 0 w v the propagation of halophilic and facultative denitrifying populations coincides with the operation conditions of the fmbr in this study candidatus kuenenia sp freshwater anammox bacteria rather than scalindua marine anammox bacteria proliferated in the fmbr and performed anaerobic ammonium oxidation kuenenia was detected in biofilms only and accounted for 0 2 in b2 1 1 in b3 and 1 3 in b4 respectively notably kuenenia was enriched while nob invaded and persisted in the system when b3 and b4 were sampled indicating that kuenenia could contend for a survival niche with nob at the saline mainstream conditions in addition diverse sulfur cycling populations proliferated and occupied high abundances membranicola performing sulfate reduction initially established high abundances of 2 1 in s1 and 8 0 in s2 and thereafter reduced to 0 5 in s3 and 0 2 in s4 while keeping relatively stable proportions in biofilms 1 0 0 3 thiohalophilus coupling sulfur oxidation and denitrification was enriched in biofilms representing 2 3 1 2 sulfuriflexus sedimenticola and thiosocius which are capable of sulfur oxidation and reduction of nitrate and nitrite were detected in high abundances sulfuriflexus and sedimenticola dominated in biofilms and occupied average 5 9 and 3 5 respectively thiosocius represented 4 3 3 1 3 3 and 5 8 in s1 s4 and 1 4 2 3 8 1 and 5 4 in b1 b4 respectively correspondingly otu6 and otu17 shared 97 2 similarity of the partial 16s rrna sequence with thiosocius teredinicola a facultative denitrifying sob altamia et al 2019 in particular otu2 and otu3 with their respective closest relatives of desulfovibrio indonesiensis and desulfovibrio salexigens also known as sulfate reducing bacteria srb feio et al 1998 accounted for an average of 10 9 in suspension sludge and 3 0 in biofilms in total together these microbes actuated the sulfur turnover in the saline mainstream anammox process the microbial co occurrence network analysis implied the c n s symbiosis in positive patterns fig s2 exploitations of microbial functional profiles also supported the finding that nitritation anammox denitrification sulfate respiration and oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds synchronized in the fmbr fig s3 the lefse analysis further identified the srb unclassified desulfovibrionales and sulfur dependent autotrophic denitrifiers thiohalophilus sedimenticola sulfuriflexus and thiosocius lda 3 7 as biomarkers fig s4 this suggested their pivotal roles in constituting the c n s network accomplishing the co removal of nitrogen and cod from the saline sewage 3 2 2 metagenomic insights into the metabolic versatilities of the microbiome to explore the symbiotic metabolic pathways metagenomic analysis was performed with s4 and b4 collected on day 332 in total 29 and 32 high quality bins 85 genome completeness and 10 contamination were assembled from s4 and b4 respectively see details of the genome quality in table s3 23 out of the 29 bins and 25 out of the 32 bins accounting for 32 3 and 26 6 respectively were annotated with nitrogen and or sulfur metabolizing properties for b4 14 12 and 9 out of the 32 bins were annotated with the functions of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra denitrification and nitrate reduction to nitrite respectively these occupied 15 4 16 9 and 9 3 in sequence in addition 13 4 and 4 out of the 32 bins were annotated with the function of assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation amounting for 11 5 9 2 and 9 2 respectively in particular bin b01 occupying 6 8 shows the best hit with sedimenticola thiotaurini aai 53 9 which was a known sob capable of coupling oxidation of thiosulfate tetrathionate elemental sulfur and sulfide with reduction of nitrate nitrite and selenate flood et al 2015 this bin harbored a full set of genes encoding proteins responding to dnra thiosulfate oxidation denitrification and dissimilatory sulfate reduction table s4 bin b19 accounted for 1 0 shares the ani of 84 2 with and all the n s metabolizing genes of b01 its closest relative was identified to be sedimenticola thiotaurini aai 53 41 bin b03 and b04 representing 3 3 and 1 9 in sequence showed the best hit to sulfurivermis fontis known for coupling nitrate reduction and oxidation of reduced sulfur kojima et al 2017 with the aai score of 47 8 and 50 2 respectively both bins possessed the full set of genes encoding the proteins carrying out assimilatory sulfate reduction table s4 not sulfur oxidation in addition bin b01 b03 b04 and b19 were temporarily designated as gammaproteobacteria sp b01 thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 thioalkalispiraceae sp b04 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 respectively for s4 15 26 1 and 14 10 2 out of the 29 bins were annotated with nitrogen and sulfur metabolizing functions respectively table s3 among them 7 5 and 8 bins were annotated with the capabilities of dnra denitrification and nitrate to nitrite reduction respectively in total these bins successively accounted for 4 6 3 2 and 21 9 specially bin s02 occupying 10 7 and showing the best hit to chitinophaga pinensis aai 44 5 was annotated with the function of nitrate to nitrite reduction table s4 bin s04 occupying 6 7 was also annotated with the aptitude of nitrate to nitrite reduction table s4 its closest relative was identified to be geoalkalibacter subterraneus aai 41 7 a species gaining energy from the reduction of ferric iron nitrate and elemental sulfur with various electron donors e g alcohols organic acids and hydrogen greene et al 2009 bin s02 and s04 were designated as chitinophagaceae sp s02 and desulfuromonadales sp s04 respectively besides the 14 bins identified as s metabolizing microbes are restricted to assimilatory sulfate reduction high quality genomes of sulfur facilitated autotrophic denitrifying bacteria were assembled only for b4 further the key bioprocesses and symbiotic metabolic pathways of the representative microbes actuating the c n s cycle in biofilms were constructed fig 3 see table s4 for the respective coding dna sequences predicted to involve these key pathways in brief microorganisms participating in denitrification dnra nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction resided in both suspension sludge and biofilms with the dominance on gac this was in line with the 16s rrna gene based sequencing result that shows denitrifying bacteria and srb dominated on gac fig 2 unfortunately high quality genome bins of nitrosomonas sp and ca kuenenia sp were not obtained this may be due to the limitations of assembly and binning methods donovan h parks et al 2015 even so the metagenomics approach revealed that a synergetic c n s loop formulated and responded in the fmbr with cept saline sewage 4 discussion 4 1 factors determining the success of pilot scale saline mainstream anammox from conventional sludge source the present study successfully started a pilot scale mainstream anammox process from a conventional anaerobic digestion sludge with the gac fluidized membrane bioreactor this result subverts the stereotype that the mature anammox seed is necessary to initiate a mainstream anammox scale up the utilization of gac and membrane facilitated the fast start up by improving sludge retention and stability of the fmbr operation firstly the hollow fiber membrane 0 1 Âµm enabled complete retention of the biomass through microfiltration which is crucial for the cultivation of slow growth anammox bacteria van der star et al 2008 secondly the application of gac yielded multiple benefits 1 enforcing membrane fouling prevention with the aid of gac scouring kim et al 2011 2 expediting the formation of biofilms which helped retain denser biomass and provided an optimal ecological niche of a spatially ordered oxygen gradient enabling the symbiosis of aerobic and anaerobic functional microbiota and 3 probably created a microenvironment with concentrated ammonium and nitrite via adsorption the biofilm based biomass averaged 1 6 times while hrt was 10 hr and 1 8 times while hrt was 8 hr the biomass of the suspension sludge table s5 this finding was in accordance with peer studies that the media based high density polyethylene k series carriers and pe synthetic porous fleece sheet biofilms dominated the biomass and were crucial to as well as effective in the maintenance of sufficient aob and anammox bacteria during the long term operation of mainstream anammox processes lackner et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 results also demonstrated that limited oxygen supply was crucial to the robust performance of the saline mainstream anammox based community in particular nob repression and the cultivation of anammox bacteria and aob were the determinant for the stability of partial nitritation and anammox pn a processes regardless of the reactor s configuration lackner et al 2014 given that the ammonium and operating temperature stayed at low values under mainstream conditions it was not feasible to adopt free ammonium fa to inhibit the nob in this study the pilot scale fmbr was persistently operated at the do of 0 16 mg l which facilitated the progressive gemination of the anammox bacteria this process delivered stable nitrogen removal although it encountered unpredicted incidents in pilot trials table s1 more notably the steady proliferation of kuenenia on biofilms occurred while the nitrospira erupted and persisted in the system days 279 343 this finding conflicts with the previous assumption that overgrowth of nob traditionally depressed the growth of anammox bacteria therefore the research team for this study proposes two potential explanations for our impactful findings firstly although nob subsisted in the fmbr its activity might be halted due to the oxygen deficiency this was mutually validated by laureni et al 2016 who found that stable repression of nob was achieved during a 400 day operation by controlling do as low as 0 18 mg l this explanation is supported by a recent study concluding that nob inactivation through a short term anaerobic anoxic operation is effective in suppressing the regrowth of nob in the long term operation of bench and large scale 8 m3 mainstream pn a processes hausherr et al 2022 secondly bacteria capable of dnra and nitrate to nitrite reduction inhabited both suspension sludge and biofilms and redirected nitrate produced by the nob to ammonium and nitrite respectively this situation might offer a better survival niche for anammox bacteria in particular chitinophagaceae sp bin s02 10 7 and desulfuromonadales sp bin s04 6 7 were observed in the suspension sludge their presence likely served the conversion of nitrate to nitrite given that nob dominated in an oxygen accessible niche this further implied a simultaneous nitrogen removal path through partial denitrification and anammox deng et al 2021 ji et al 2020 kao et al 2022 additionally the no forming bacteria in total accounting for 12 8 in s4 and 10 8 in b4 fig 2a potentially supported the metabolism of anammox bacteria given its versatility of no dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation hu et al 2019 in summary this study supports and intensifies our understanding that it is feasible to suppress nob further nob washout would not be required towards stable mainstream anammox processes even if unexpected germination occurred hausherr et al 2022 laureni et al 2016 4 2 metagenomic insights into the microbe driven c n s loop in the gac biofilms due to the unique features of sulfate in the saline sewage i e approximately 0 5 g l yang et al 2015 compared with the freshwater s metabolizing bacteria concatenating the c n s loop were identified fig 3 hydrogen sulfide produced from srb remained a concern due to its potential threat to other c n s functionalizing microorganisms in this study of biofilms diverse bacteria dominated by thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b04 performed the sulfate reduction occupying 20 7 meanwhile dominant bacteria capable of respiring nitrate with reduced sulfur compounds as the electron donor i e gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 were identified in total these bacteria consisting of 7 8 of the b4 s microbial community not only contributed to the tn removal through denitrification but also scavenged hydrogen sulfide this property endowed these bacteria with competitive advantages over others in the presence of hydrogen sulfide this quality also protected other microbes from the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide significantly the bacteria functioning dnra occupied 15 4 of the b4 s populations when only high quality genomes were accounted therein this unique function not only pointed to the versatility and superiority of these bacteria in harnessing nitrogen source at substrate scarcity especially for cept sewage but also potentially led to improved tn removal whilst the ammonium was retaken by the anammox bacterium thus far two scenarios in support of dnra have been proposed 1 low c concentration with cept saline sewage triggers dnra friedl et al 2018 li et al 2020 and 2 low redox potential by low do supply 0 5 mg l favors the no3 partitioning via dnra rather denitrification friedl et al 2018 therefore the operation conditions likely fostered the bacteria with dnra function collectively these novel bacteria along with nitrosomonas and kuenenia established the c n s loop in the fmbr system and responded to the removal of nitrogen cod and properly sulfate from the saline sewage another compelling finding was that gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 have bi directional sulfur metabolism i e reducing sulfate to sulfide through assimilatory and or dissimilatory paths and oxidizing sulfide to sulfate via the sox system table s4 moreover this study documented that gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 possessed the detoxification pathways of reactive oxygen species ros 1 ros reduction to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen by superoxide dismutase sod and 2 hydrogen peroxide reduction to water and oxygen via catalase peroxidase cat and peroxiredoxin prdx table s6 more interestingly these bacteria might have led an alternative ros detoxification trick by integrating sod and cytochrome c551 peroxidase ccp table s6 however it is worth noting that the ccp expressed only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and the absence of oxygen khademian and imlay 2017 this further complicated the oxygen tradeoff of these two bacteria in addition a full set of proteins involving the ros detoxification were also annotated in b03 b04 s02 and s04 table s6 indicating their ascendancy subsisting in the presence of limited oxygen thus three routes were hereby proposed for the oxidation of reduced sulfur by coupling 1 respiration of nitrate or nitrite 2 dnra and 3 respiration of oxygen collectively this indicates that the role of n s co metabolizing microorganisms i e b01 b03 b04 and b19 in regulating the ecological c n s flux might be underrated thus the evolution of these n s co metabolizing bacteria associated with oxygen deserves extensive future research 5 conclusions and implications this study investigated the feasibility of the gac fmbr configuration with cept saline sewage operating the gac fmbr at a limited do supply i e 0 08 0 03 mg l was determined to be the vital factor leading to stable performance the gac aggregated rich functional bacteria and higher nitrogen strength in microenvironment insured robust removals of nitrogen and cod the integrated nitritation anammox sulfate reduction and mixotrophic denitrification scenario manifested in the saline sewage treatment exploitation of the synergetic microbial symbiosis patterns rendered insights into the scavenging of hydrogen sulfide by gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and b19 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and b04 associating with nitrogen transforming anammox based microbes in

15260,seawater for toilet flushing conserves the scarce freshwater resources in hong kong and similar densely populated coastal cities saline sewage treatment using energy efficient anammox based processes appears to be beneficial with notable potential for the future however the feasibility of this process remains uncharted especially from its start up to its steady state cooperation in this study a pilot scale mainstream anammox process was succeeded in a granular activated carbon fluidized bed membrane bioreactor fmbr with only inoculating saline anaerobic digestion sludge the fmbr operating at the dissolved oxygen do of 0 04 0 16 mg l achieved comparable nitrogen removal rates of 50 1 78 3 g n m3 d while treating real chemically enhanced primary treatment saline sewage at 3 2 m3 d excluding scalindua 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed a high abundance of common freshwater observed kuenenia from 0 2 day 259 to 1 3 day 332 in biofilms nitrosomonas responsible for ammonium oxidation dominated in biofilms and accounted for 1 8 9 2 nitrite oxidizing bacteria incursion happened unexpectedly due to high oxygen exposure supply from temporary on site technical difficulties however nob suppression was achieved by controlling do at 0 16 mg l leading the fmbr s stability over the 343 day operation sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur dependent denitrifiers propagated with high abundance representing 14 0 10 6 and 6 0 2 0 in suspensions and 7 2 1 8 and 15 9 2 3 in biofilms respectively further metagenomic sequencing analysis indicated the c n s synergy of nitritation anammox sulfate reduction and mixotrophic denitrification in the fmbr importantly this research found that such a novel c n s synergy was made by the scavenges of hydrogen sulfide by gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and b19 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and b04 species having ascendancy subsisting in the presence of oxygen owing to their aptitude of detoxifying reactive oxygen species knowledge gleaned from this study as well as a complete set of pilot experimental data could serve as a strong technical base for the larger scale application of this process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline mainstream anammox fluidized membrane bioreactor kuenenia synergetic c n s loop saline sewage data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the scarcity of clean fresh water has become an unrelenting undeniably serious global problem due to the rapidly increasing world population this insufficiency highlights the pressing need for alternative water resources globally since more than half the world s population resides in coastal areas merkens et al 2016 the utilization of seawater for toilet flushing has been adopted in many places to alleviate the freshwater resources shortage li et al 2005 mackey et al 2019 sun et al 2009 hong kong has used seawater for toilet flushing swtf for over 60 years li et al 2005 thereby reducing freshwater consumption by over 22 while serving up to 80 of the city s population leung et al 2012 however the introduction of swtf produces sewage salinity ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 and approximately 2 million m3 day of saline sewage yang et al 2015 this requires a new process to supplement the nitrification denitrification n dn approach which is commonly applied for freshwater municipal wastewater treatment currently anammox is being applied for treating ammonium rich wastewater this is known as the sidestrea anammox lackner et al 2014 mainstream anammox has been successfully tested at the laboratory bench and pilot scale in many locations hoekstra et al 2019 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 lotti et al 2014 full scale anammox is an encouraging process in temperate and tropical areas such as south america singapore and hong kong for example a full scale mainstream anammox application was first achieved at the changi water reclamation plant in singapore contributing to about 38 of total nitrogen removal cao et al 2016 however its mainstream saline anammox has not yet been sufficiently studied saline mainstream anammox inherits two restrictions 1 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob induced process instability and 2 saline anammox bioaugmentation firstly nob incursion could provoke the process deterioration by competing with anammox bacteria for nitrite recent studies have proven that nob suppression is feasible in hybrid floc biofilm mainstream anammox processes in long term operation despite its consistent presence laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 malovanyy et al 2015 this feasibility was explained by proof of concept nob in biofilms is suppressed by limited dos and selective nob washout from flocs is achievable via a decrease in do and or an increase in floc discharge laureni et al 2019 for this process a low do supply was suggested e g 0 15 0 18 mgo2 l laureni et al 2016 0 17 0 04 mgo2 l laureni et al 2019 below 0 3 mgo2 l gilbert et al 2015 and 0 1 0 16 mgo2 l full scale cao et al 2016 secondly excellent biomass retention with fouling mitigated efficient membrane bioreactor shen et al 2012 has been proven to be an ideal tool to grow anammox bacteria van der star et al 2008 granular activated carbon gac fluidized membrane bioreactor fmbr has been successfully developed to treat diluted wastewater for methane generation shin et al 2016 shin et al 2014 in these applications membrane fouling was effectively controlled over long term operations i e 485 days shin et al 2014 and 2 years shin et al 2016 the introduction of gac served as biomass carrier and membrane fouling mitigator via scouring force in this regard the fmbr could be nominated as a suitable approach to implementing the mainstream anammox processes thirdly the detection of scalindua in saline sewage treatment facilities wu et al 2019 demonstrated the feasibility of saline mainstream anammox evidence also stemmed from the ubiquity of scalindua brocadia and kuenenia in saline ecosystems sonthiphand et al 2014 zheng et al 2016 providing analogous niches for the mainstream treatment low ammonium and varied seasonal temperatures the toxic concern of hydrogen sulfide derived from sulfate reduction on nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms is likely to be exempted this result was reported in a study of sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated process known as sani with saline sewage wang et al 2009 taking the extant research into consideration the saline mainstream anammox seemed feasible in the gac fmbr in this study mainstream anammox was implemented in a pilot scale gac fmbr to treat chemically enhanced primary treatment cept saline sewage such sewage has a lower c n ratio e g 2 1 4 7 suitable for mainstream anammox applications the pilot scale gac fmbr was initially seeded with saline anaerobic digestion sludge to start and its long term performance under variable nitrogen loads and temperatures was monitored in addition microbial community analyses were carried out using 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing the overarching objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the feasibility of the saline mainstream anammox and 2 disclose symbiotic patterns of functional microbial consortia especially for s metabolism linking with c and n by finding a spatially ordered oxygen gradient i e 0 08 0 03 mg l of the c n s synergic microbial consortia the outcome of this study should aid the significant broadening of anammox technology to the treatment of saline sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant description and operation strategies a pilot scale fmbr fig 1 installed at the stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw in hong kong was used to treat the effluent of the cept process scistw the fourth largest wwtp in the world is currently serving up to 80 of the local sewage treatment with 1 7 million m3 saline sewage generated daily the characteristics of cept sewage were ph 7 0 0 2 alkalinity 240 2 81 3 mg l salinity 1 1 0 1 ammonium 21 5 5 1 mgn l bod5 80 4 19 6 mg l cod 142 3 35 5 mg l and tn 26 8 6 7 mgn l the rectangular shaped stainless steel sts 304 fmbr had an effective working volume of 1 06 m3 0 85 m by 0 51 m in area with 2 84 m depth a settler 1 25 m by 0 91 m in area with 0 7 m depth containing a submerged weir 0 85 m by 0 51 m with 1 5 cm v notch height with a total liquid volume of 0 49 m3 was connected on the reactor top to prevent gac overflow into the recycle line five membrane modules each consisting of 2 36 m long hollow fiber polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with the pore size of 0 1 Âµm provided by kolon membrane korea were installed in the fmbr the total surface area of the membranes was 55 m2 the fmbr was introduced with 332 3 kg of granular activated carbon gac calgon f300 usa occupying approximately 56 of the reactor working volume when settled the recycle flow rate was set to 30 m3 h responding to an up flow velocity of 1 15 m min which was sufficient to expand the gac to 100 of the reactor working volume this enabled effective scouring of all membrane surfaces a tubular diffuser was installed at the reactor bottom to implement efficient aeration the pilot scale fmbr was automated using an integrated programmable logic controller plc unit fig s1 operational ph and temperature were monitored by the submerged sensors installed on the reactor top sodium carbonate solution was added automatically when ph was below 7 2 temperature was not controlled and varied according to the actual temperature of the scistw sewage 14 5 34 5 c table 1 the dissolved oxygen do was automatically controlled using a sub plc unit burkert gmbh co kg ingelfingen germany throughout the trial and its set value was 0 1 mg l the do was measured by taking the mean of readings obtained from five do sensors which were vertically installed on the reactor wall aeration was implemented with an air compressor however the aeration was stopped while the fmbr was operating under the anoxic condition temporarily this occurred when incidents happened onsite i e power supply circuit the plc crash water level sensor malfunction sewage supply shortage due to power outrage breakage and or damage of influent pipeline and influent sewage pump malfunction as documented in table s1 the transmembrane pressure was recorded with a pressure gauge installed in the effluent line calibrations of the do sensor and ph sensor were conducted monthly the temperature sensor was calibrated when starting up the system it functioned stably during the entire operation a 2 0 mm mesh sieve was installed on the top of the influent storage tank to sort sundries e g leaves foam rubber plastic and hair the sieve was cleaned every week and replaced every month due to saline sewage corrosion in this study the pilot scale fmbr was started with inoculating 500 l of digested sludge obtained from a full scale anaerobic digester operated at tai po sewage treatment works in hong kong it contained 5 7 g l total suspended solids tss and 4 3 g l volatile suspended solids vss the reactor was initially operated in an intermittent mode for the first stage lasting 146 days during the first 33 days tap water was used to replenish the liquid loss via evaporation and sampling ammonium chloride of 70 g d equivalent to 10 0 mgn l was fed on days 10 33 from day 34 onwards the fmbr was fed with the saline cept sewage on days 34 82 0 2 0 4 m3 d sewage and 115 g d ammonium chloride equivalent to 16 5 mgn l were supplemented from days 83 146 supplementation of ammonium chloride was suspended and the sewage load was increased from 0 5 to 1 2 m3 d this suggests that the fmbr began to operate under mainstream conditions from this point onward in addition ammonium chloride dosing of 140 g d equivalent to 20 0 mgn l was supplemented on days 98 107 when the sewage supply was not available due to influent sewage pump failure from day 147 onwards the fmbr was changed to a continuous flow mode with a starting hrt of 12 hr from day 162 the hrt was prolonged to 30 hr since elevated ammonium remained in the effluent i e 24 4 4 7 mgn l furthermore the hrt was halved on day 178 and then progressively reduced to 10 hr on day 278 and 8 hr on day 321 respectively during the continuous flow operation period ammonium chloride i e approximately 30 mgn l ammonium was added when sewage supply was not available due to the incidents listed in table s1 2 2 analytical methods the determination of nitrogen compounds tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n tss vss alkalinity salinity chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were carried out according to the standard

approximately 30 gbp of metagenomic sequence data were generated for each dna sample the raw 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequence data have been deposited in ncbi under the bioproject prjna544020 sequences of the c n s metabolizing microorganisms are accessible with mw136667 mw136692 2 4 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing analyses the analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences was described in our previous study huang and lee 2021 alpha diversity statistics were calculated with mothur the weighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis pcoa was employed to evaluate the beta diversity the pcoa plot was carried out with the vegan package and visualized via ggplot2 the phylogenetic tree of observed microorganisms and reported relatives was constructed with mega7 microbial symbiotic patterns were investigated with a co occurrence network the linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was applied to explore the hub microbes of the microbial community in suspension sludge and biofilms tax4fun and faprotax were utilized to exploit the functional profiles of the microbial community the analysis of metagenomic sequences was conducted according to bolger et al 2014 khmer scripts were used for digital normalization to remove redundant sequences the trimmed clean paired end reads were further de novo assembled using spades genome assembler ver 3 9 0 with the default kmer settings of 19 33 47 61 75 nurk et al 2013 the quality of assembled contigs was assessed with quast gurevich et al 2013 based on research by wu et al 2014 maxbin was applied to divide cluster contigs into individual draft genomes the quality of recovered genome bins was evaluated with checkm donovan h parks et al 2015 the abundance of genome bins was calculated as per the previous study langmead and salzberg 2012 gene annotation was performed with prokka ver 1 11 seemann 2014 genome wide average nucleotide identity ani and average amino acid identity aai were used to differentiate the draft genomes taxa classification followed the aai cutoff of 40 55 and 85 for the family genus and species respectively rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 the genome functions characterization was determined with local blastp and kegg blastkoala while blastkoala was further utilized to reconstruct functional pathways kanehisa et al 2016 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the pilot scale fmbr operated at an intermittent flow mode from day 1 to 146 and a continuous flow mode from day 147 to 343 table 1 initially ammonium chloride was supplemented to foster the growth of aob and anammox bacteria on days 10 82 the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated in the range of 27 5 24 1 mgn l whilst 10 0 16 5 mgn l of ammonium chloride was supplemented the effluent nitrite concentration was first kept below 5 mgn l on days 10 27 thereafter it was accumulated at the elevated levels of 21 2 105 7 mgn l on days 30 82 corresponding to over 94 1 of nitrite accumulation efficiency on days 83 146 the reactor was fed with an incremental sewage flow from 0 5 to 1 2 m3 d the nitrite dominated effluent demonstrated a diminishing trend from 79 8 to 1 5 mgn l effluent ammonium remained at the levels of 9 3 11 3 mgn l nitrate was detected at 1 6 1 5 mgn l and 0 4 0 4 mgn l on days 10 82 and 83 146 respectively at the intermittent operation phase partial ammonium oxidation and high efficient nitrite accumulation i e 90 2 100 were achieved concurrently subsequently the fmbr operated with the continuous feeding at varied hrts table 1 initially the reactor was overrated and started with an hrt of 12 h leading to poor conversion of ammonium with the high remaining of over 19 2 mg nh4 n l afterwards the hrt was prolonged to 30 h and on average the reactor achieved 88 3 ammonium conversion when an hrt of 15 h was implemented the system obtained an average nre of 65 6 with the effluent ammonium below 5 0 mgn l except for the incidental periods for instance from day 220 to 234 effluent ammonium ranging 6 9 12 3 mgn l was detected due to insufficient oxygen supply i e malfunction of air compressor during the last forty days at the hrt of 15 h the fmbr reached a quasi steady state and achieved an average nre of 69 8 with a mean effluent tn of 8 1 mgn l further the fmbr was operated at the hrt of 10 h and 8 h successively achieving average nres of 69 4 and 71 1 respectively the pilot plant eventually obtained nrrs ranging 50 1 78 3 60 6 13 3 g n m3 d with the effluent tn below 10 mgn l at the hrt of 8 h this was comparable with the levels of the reported mainstream anammox treating freshwater wastewaters e g 47 0 83 2 g n m3 d ji et al 2020 kao et al 2022 laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 malovanyy et al 2015 the operating do was controlled at 0 16 mg l consistently which led nitrate the dominant nitrogen species in the effluent to remain at below 4 5 mgn l on days 147 270 this finding suggested a robust suppression of nob theretofore on day 278 the fmbr system encountered a water level sensor failure as a consequence a certain amount of biomass including gac and suspended sludge sloped over the reactor unsurprisingly the exposure of biomass to air rendered rising nitrate in the effluent on days 279 343 i e 6 8 2 2 mgn l however the fmbr system retained nres of 70 0 8 9 in this time suggesting the resilience of the fmbr system during a short shock furthermore the fmbr established relatively steady nres of 66 8 11 4 over the 180 days continuous operation days 162 343 despite confronting sundry incidents table s1 this echoed the materiality of insuring low dos during the operation of mainstream anammox processes as for cod the fmbr obtained effluent cod of 2 1 7 1 mg l at intermittent flow operation period and cod removals of 90 at the continuous flow operation phase table 1 in brief the pilot plant obtained the effluent quality of bod5 below 10 mg l cod below 20 mg l tss below 30 mg l ammonium below 5 mgn l and tn below 10 mgn l while treating the cept sewage at a capacity of 3 2 m3 d 3 2 microbiomes statistical results of 16s and meta genomics 3 2 1 microbial population dynamics based on 16s rrna gene table s2 contains the summary of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis good s coverage 95 7 was obtained for all samples suggesting a satisfactory sequencing depth claesson et al 2010 the microbial consortia associated with the gac was enriched as inferred by the increasing diversity and richness indices table s2 as for the taxonomic classification at phylum level bacteroidetes and proteobacteria dominated all samples and in total represented 69 1 77 4 60 0 56 2 70 9 93 4 90 6 77 0 and 76 3 in seed s1 s4 and b1 b4 respectively at genus level nitrosomonas was detected as the corresponding aob and dominated in biofilm ranging between 1 8 9 2 fig 2 a nitrospira a typical nob was detected at below 0 04 in all suspension and biofilm samples collected at the hrts of 30 h and 15 h this finding was in line with the reactor performance since nitrate was mostly detected at below 1 mgn l later nitrospira proliferated to 0 8 and 0 9 in relation to s3 and b3 day 308 and further rose to 1 2 and 1 3 in s4 and b4 day 332 respectively this nitrospira incursion was ascribed to refilling overflowed sludge that was exposed to air for several hours on day 278 as noted above as for the denitrifying populations arcobacter and pseudomonas which accounted for 21 5 and 17 3 in seed respectively were eliminated along with the operation instead typical denitrifiers i e hyphomicrobium and paracoccus proliferated and dominated in biofilms representing 1 5 and 0 7 on average respectively fig 2a meanwhile microbe affiliated with thalassospira a known facultative denitrifier liu et al 2007 was significantly enriched from below 0 05 in seed to 6 1 in s3 3 2 in s4 2 1 in b3 and 1 7 in b4 respectively remarkably microorganism affiliated with phaeodactylibacter fig 2b which performs aerobic denitrification lei et al 2015 was enriched from 1 0 to 20 5 in bulk sludge and from 0 2 to 4 7 in biofilms lutimonas and ulvibacter which are capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite aerobically kim et al 2014 nedashkovskaya et al 2004 were detected with high abundances and in total accounted for 10 1 4 9 4 5 and 3 7 in s1 s4 and 24 0 26 2 19 5 and 17 6 in b1 b4 respectively furthermore microbes otu19 22 39 and 48 sharing the best hit with lewinella xylanilytica a bacterium capable of reducing nitrate to nitric oxide aerobically sung et al 2015 occupied 3 8 2 1 in suspension sludge and 2 0 0 9 in biofilms in total these aerobic and facultative anaerobic denitrifiers either require na for growth thalassospira lutimonas and ulvibacter or prefer to live in the presence of nacl phaeodactylibacter and lewinella with the optimal value of 2 0 w v the propagation of halophilic and facultative denitrifying populations coincides with the operation conditions of the fmbr in this study candidatus kuenenia sp freshwater anammox bacteria rather than scalindua marine anammox bacteria proliferated in the fmbr and performed anaerobic ammonium oxidation kuenenia was detected in biofilms only and accounted for 0 2 in b2 1 1 in b3 and 1 3 in b4 respectively notably kuenenia was enriched while nob invaded and persisted in the system when b3 and b4 were sampled indicating that kuenenia could contend for a survival niche with nob at the saline mainstream conditions in addition diverse sulfur cycling populations proliferated and occupied high abundances membranicola performing sulfate reduction initially established high abundances of 2 1 in s1 and 8 0 in s2 and thereafter reduced to 0 5 in s3 and 0 2 in s4 while keeping relatively stable proportions in biofilms 1 0 0 3 thiohalophilus coupling sulfur oxidation and denitrification was enriched in biofilms representing 2 3 1 2 sulfuriflexus sedimenticola and thiosocius which are capable of sulfur oxidation and reduction of nitrate and nitrite were detected in high abundances sulfuriflexus and sedimenticola dominated in biofilms and occupied average 5 9 and 3 5 respectively thiosocius represented 4 3 3 1 3 3 and 5 8 in s1 s4 and 1 4 2 3 8 1 and 5 4 in b1 b4 respectively correspondingly otu6 and otu17 shared 97 2 similarity of the partial 16s rrna sequence with thiosocius teredinicola a facultative denitrifying sob altamia et al 2019 in particular otu2 and otu3 with their respective closest relatives of desulfovibrio indonesiensis and desulfovibrio salexigens also known as sulfate reducing bacteria srb feio et al 1998 accounted for an average of 10 9 in suspension sludge and 3 0 in biofilms in total together these microbes actuated the sulfur turnover in the saline mainstream anammox process the microbial co occurrence network analysis implied the c n s symbiosis in positive patterns fig s2 exploitations of microbial functional profiles also supported the finding that nitritation anammox denitrification sulfate respiration and oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds synchronized in the fmbr fig s3 the lefse analysis further identified the srb unclassified desulfovibrionales and sulfur dependent autotrophic denitrifiers thiohalophilus sedimenticola sulfuriflexus and thiosocius lda 3 7 as biomarkers fig s4 this suggested their pivotal roles in constituting the c n s network accomplishing the co removal of nitrogen and cod from the saline sewage 3 2 2 metagenomic insights into the metabolic versatilities of the microbiome to explore the symbiotic metabolic pathways metagenomic analysis was performed with s4 and b4 collected on day 332 in total 29 and 32 high quality bins 85 genome completeness and 10 contamination were assembled from s4 and b4 respectively see details of the genome quality in table s3 23 out of the 29 bins and 25 out of the 32 bins accounting for 32 3 and 26 6 respectively were annotated with nitrogen and or sulfur metabolizing properties for b4 14 12 and 9 out of the 32 bins were annotated with the functions of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra denitrification and nitrate reduction to nitrite respectively these occupied 15 4 16 9 and 9 3 in sequence in addition 13 4 and 4 out of the 32 bins were annotated with the function of assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation amounting for 11 5 9 2 and 9 2 respectively in particular bin b01 occupying 6 8 shows the best hit with sedimenticola thiotaurini aai 53 9 which was a known sob capable of coupling oxidation of thiosulfate tetrathionate elemental sulfur and sulfide with reduction of nitrate nitrite and selenate flood et al 2015 this bin harbored a full set of genes encoding proteins responding to dnra thiosulfate oxidation denitrification and dissimilatory sulfate reduction table s4 bin b19 accounted for 1 0 shares the ani of 84 2 with and all the n s metabolizing genes of b01 its closest relative was identified to be sedimenticola thiotaurini aai 53 41 bin b03 and b04 representing 3 3 and 1 9 in sequence showed the best hit to sulfurivermis fontis known for coupling nitrate reduction and oxidation of reduced sulfur kojima et al 2017 with the aai score of 47 8 and 50 2 respectively both bins possessed the full set of genes encoding the proteins carrying out assimilatory sulfate reduction table s4 not sulfur oxidation in addition bin b01 b03 b04 and b19 were temporarily designated as gammaproteobacteria sp b01 thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 thioalkalispiraceae sp b04 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 respectively for s4 15 26 1 and 14 10 2 out of the 29 bins were annotated with nitrogen and sulfur metabolizing functions respectively table s3 among them 7 5 and 8 bins were annotated with the capabilities of dnra denitrification and nitrate to nitrite reduction respectively in total these bins successively accounted for 4 6 3 2 and 21 9 specially bin s02 occupying 10 7 and showing the best hit to chitinophaga pinensis aai 44 5 was annotated with the function of nitrate to nitrite reduction table s4 bin s04 occupying 6 7 was also annotated with the aptitude of nitrate to nitrite reduction table s4 its closest relative was identified to be geoalkalibacter subterraneus aai 41 7 a species gaining energy from the reduction of ferric iron nitrate and elemental sulfur with various electron donors e g alcohols organic acids and hydrogen greene et al 2009 bin s02 and s04 were designated as chitinophagaceae sp s02 and desulfuromonadales sp s04 respectively besides the 14 bins identified as s metabolizing microbes are restricted to assimilatory sulfate reduction high quality genomes of sulfur facilitated autotrophic denitrifying bacteria were assembled only for b4 further the key bioprocesses and symbiotic metabolic pathways of the representative microbes actuating the c n s cycle in biofilms were constructed fig 3 see table s4 for the respective coding dna sequences predicted to involve these key pathways in brief microorganisms participating in denitrification dnra nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction resided in both suspension sludge and biofilms with the dominance on gac this was in line with the 16s rrna gene based sequencing result that shows denitrifying bacteria and srb dominated on gac fig 2 unfortunately high quality genome bins of nitrosomonas sp and ca kuenenia sp were not obtained this may be due to the limitations of assembly and binning methods donovan h parks et al 2015 even so the metagenomics approach revealed that a synergetic c n s loop formulated and responded in the fmbr with cept saline sewage 4 discussion 4 1 factors determining the success of pilot scale saline mainstream anammox from conventional sludge source the present study successfully started a pilot scale mainstream anammox process from a conventional anaerobic digestion sludge with the gac fluidized membrane bioreactor this result subverts the stereotype that the mature anammox seed is necessary to initiate a mainstream anammox scale up the utilization of gac and membrane facilitated the fast start up by improving sludge retention and stability of the fmbr operation firstly the hollow fiber membrane 0 1 Âµm enabled complete retention of the biomass through microfiltration which is crucial for the cultivation of slow growth anammox bacteria van der star et al 2008 secondly the application of gac yielded multiple benefits 1 enforcing membrane fouling prevention with the aid of gac scouring kim et al 2011 2 expediting the formation of biofilms which helped retain denser biomass and provided an optimal ecological niche of a spatially ordered oxygen gradient enabling the symbiosis of aerobic and anaerobic functional microbiota and 3 probably created a microenvironment with concentrated ammonium and nitrite via adsorption the biofilm based biomass averaged 1 6 times while hrt was 10 hr and 1 8 times while hrt was 8 hr the biomass of the suspension sludge table s5 this finding was in accordance with peer studies that the media based high density polyethylene k series carriers and pe synthetic porous fleece sheet biofilms dominated the biomass and were crucial to as well as effective in the maintenance of sufficient aob and anammox bacteria during the long term operation of mainstream anammox processes lackner et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 results also demonstrated that limited oxygen supply was crucial to the robust performance of the saline mainstream anammox based community in particular nob repression and the cultivation of anammox bacteria and aob were the determinant for the stability of partial nitritation and anammox pn a processes regardless of the reactor s configuration lackner et al 2014 given that the ammonium and operating temperature stayed at low values under mainstream conditions it was not feasible to adopt free ammonium fa to inhibit the nob in this study the pilot scale fmbr was persistently operated at the do of 0 16 mg l which facilitated the progressive gemination of the anammox bacteria this process delivered stable nitrogen removal although it encountered unpredicted incidents in pilot trials table s1 more notably the steady proliferation of kuenenia on biofilms occurred while the nitrospira erupted and persisted in the system days 279 343 this finding conflicts with the previous assumption that overgrowth of nob traditionally depressed the growth of anammox bacteria therefore the research team for this study proposes two potential explanations for our impactful findings firstly although nob subsisted in the fmbr its activity might be halted due to the oxygen deficiency this was mutually validated by laureni et al 2016 who found that stable repression of nob was achieved during a 400 day operation by controlling do as low as 0 18 mg l this explanation is supported by a recent study concluding that nob inactivation through a short term anaerobic anoxic operation is effective in suppressing the regrowth of nob in the long term operation of bench and large scale 8 m3 mainstream pn a processes hausherr et al 2022 secondly bacteria capable of dnra and nitrate to nitrite reduction inhabited both suspension sludge and biofilms and redirected nitrate produced by the nob to ammonium and nitrite respectively this situation might offer a better survival niche for anammox bacteria in particular chitinophagaceae sp bin s02 10 7 and desulfuromonadales sp bin s04 6 7 were observed in the suspension sludge their presence likely served the conversion of nitrate to nitrite given that nob dominated in an oxygen accessible niche this further implied a simultaneous nitrogen removal path through partial denitrification and anammox deng et al 2021 ji et al 2020 kao et al 2022 additionally the no forming bacteria in total accounting for 12 8 in s4 and 10 8 in b4 fig 2a potentially supported the metabolism of anammox bacteria given its versatility of no dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation hu et al 2019 in summary this study supports and intensifies our understanding that it is feasible to suppress nob further nob washout would not be required towards stable mainstream anammox processes even if unexpected germination occurred hausherr et al 2022 laureni et al 2016 4 2 metagenomic insights into the microbe driven c n s loop in the gac biofilms due to the unique features of sulfate in the saline sewage i e approximately 0 5 g l yang et al 2015 compared with the freshwater s metabolizing bacteria concatenating the c n s loop were identified fig 3 hydrogen sulfide produced from srb remained a concern due to its potential threat to other c n s functionalizing microorganisms in this study of biofilms diverse bacteria dominated by thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b04 performed the sulfate reduction occupying 20 7 meanwhile dominant bacteria capable of respiring nitrate with reduced sulfur compounds as the electron donor i e gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 were identified in total these bacteria consisting of 7 8 of the b4 s microbial community not only contributed to the tn removal through denitrification but also scavenged hydrogen sulfide this property endowed these bacteria with competitive advantages over others in the presence of hydrogen sulfide this quality also protected other microbes from the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide significantly the bacteria functioning dnra occupied 15 4 of the b4 s populations when only high quality genomes were accounted therein this unique function not only pointed to the versatility and superiority of these bacteria in harnessing nitrogen source at substrate scarcity especially for cept sewage but also potentially led to improved tn removal whilst the ammonium was retaken by the anammox bacterium thus far two scenarios in support of dnra have been proposed 1 low c concentration with cept saline sewage triggers dnra friedl et al 2018 li et al 2020 and 2 low redox potential by low do supply 0 5 mg l favors the no3 partitioning via dnra rather denitrification friedl et al 2018 therefore the operation conditions likely fostered the bacteria with dnra function collectively these novel bacteria along with nitrosomonas and kuenenia established the c n s loop in the fmbr system and responded to the removal of nitrogen cod and properly sulfate from the saline sewage another compelling finding was that gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 have bi directional sulfur metabolism i e reducing sulfate to sulfide through assimilatory and or dissimilatory paths and oxidizing sulfide to sulfate via the sox system table s4 moreover this study documented that gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and gammaproteobacteria sp b19 possessed the detoxification pathways of reactive oxygen species ros 1 ros reduction to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen by superoxide dismutase sod and 2 hydrogen peroxide reduction to water and oxygen via catalase peroxidase cat and peroxiredoxin prdx table s6 more interestingly these bacteria might have led an alternative ros detoxification trick by integrating sod and cytochrome c551 peroxidase ccp table s6 however it is worth noting that the ccp expressed only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and the absence of oxygen khademian and imlay 2017 this further complicated the oxygen tradeoff of these two bacteria in addition a full set of proteins involving the ros detoxification were also annotated in b03 b04 s02 and s04 table s6 indicating their ascendancy subsisting in the presence of limited oxygen thus three routes were hereby proposed for the oxidation of reduced sulfur by coupling 1 respiration of nitrate or nitrite 2 dnra and 3 respiration of oxygen collectively this indicates that the role of n s co metabolizing microorganisms i e b01 b03 b04 and b19 in regulating the ecological c n s flux might be underrated thus the evolution of these n s co metabolizing bacteria associated with oxygen deserves extensive future research 5 conclusions and implications this study investigated the feasibility of the gac fmbr configuration with cept saline sewage operating the gac fmbr at a limited do supply i e 0 08 0 03 mg l was determined to be the vital factor leading to stable performance the gac aggregated rich functional bacteria and higher nitrogen strength in microenvironment insured robust removals of nitrogen and cod the integrated nitritation anammox sulfate reduction and mixotrophic denitrification scenario manifested in the saline sewage treatment exploitation of the synergetic microbial symbiosis patterns rendered insights into the scavenging of hydrogen sulfide by gammaproteobacteria sp b01 and b19 and thioalkalispiraceae sp b03 and b04 associating with nitrogen transforming anammox based microbes in

15261,studies have found ca nitrospira nitrosa like bacteria to be the principal or sole comammox bacteria in nitrogen removal systems for wastewater treatment in contrast multiple populations of strict ammonia and nitrite oxidizers co exist in similar systems this apparent lack of diversity is surprising and could impact the feasibility of leveraging comammox bacteria for nitrogen removal we used full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and genome resolved metagenomics to compare the species level diversity of comammox bacteria with that of strict nitrifiers in full scale wastewater treatment systems and assess whether this comparison is consistent or diverged at the strain level full length 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that nitrosomonas like bacteria exhibited higher species level diversity in comparison with other nitrifying bacteria while the strain level diversity also called microdiversity of most nitrospira like bacteria were higher than nitrosomonas like bacteria with few exceptions one nitrospira lineage ii population comammox bacterial metagenome assembled genomes mags were associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa the average amino acid identity between principal comammox bacterial mags 93 3 across systems was significantly higher than that of the nitrosomonas like ammonia oxidizers 73 8 the nitrospira a like nitrite oxidizer 85 4 and the nitrospira d like nitrite oxidizer 83 1 this demonstrated the low species level diversity of comammox bacteria compared with strict nitrifiers and further suggests that the same comammox population was detected in all systems comammox bacteria nitrospira lineage ii nitrosomonas and nitrospira d nitrospira lineage ii mags were significantly less microdiverse than the nitrospira a lineage i mags interestingly strain resolved analysis also indicates that different nitrogen removal systems harbor different comammox bacterial strains within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster these results suggest that comammox bacteria associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa have low species and strain level diversity in nitrogen removal systems and may thus harbor specific adaptations to the wastewater ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords comammox bacteria nitrification wastewater microdiversity amplicon sequencing metagenomics data availability all raw sequencing data from illumina and nanopore platforms and nitrifiers mags are available on ncbi under bioproject number prjna846349 1 introduction aerobic nitrification processes for nitrogen removal from wastewater are largely centered around biotransformation and growth kinetics of strict ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob klotz and stein 2008 since their discovery daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 several studies have detected comammox bacteria in a wide range of environmental and engineered systems palomo et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 including laboratory and full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 in contrast to oligotrophic engineered systems with low nitrogen concentrations such as drinking water palomo et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 and even tertiary treatment systems at full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps spasov et al 2020 where several comammox species co exist most studies have identified candidatus nitrospira nitrosa like comammox as the principal or sole comammox bacteria in lab and full scale wastewater secondary treatment systems camejo et al 2017 xia et al 2018b zhao et al 2019 this apparent lack of diversity at the species level of comammox bacteria in secondary treatment processes is not only surprising but has the potential to impact treatment strategies centered around comammox bacteria gottshall et al 2021 d li et al 2021 as functional outcomes reliant on low diversity communities may be less resilient to environmental fluctuations and perturbations studies often report the coexistence of multiple nitrosomonas like aob and nitrospira like nob populations j f gao et al 2013 ofiÅ£eru et al 2010 siripong and rittmann 2007 likely occupying different ecological niches i e adapted to different conditions within a complex community the functional redundancy of multiple co exiting populations can confer stability to microbial ecosystems ensuring the long term persistence konopka et al 2015 schloter et al 2000 despite the apparent low species level diversity of comammox bacteria compared with strict nitrifiers they have exhibited remarkable stability in secondary treatment systems camejo et al 2017 cotto et al 2020 roots et al 2019 one plausible reason for their temporal persistence could be that comammox bacteria may harbor intra population i e strain level diversity also known as microdiversity compared with population i e species level diversity in this manuscript the words diversity and microdiversity will refer to the species level diversity and strain level diversity respectively previous studies have demonstrated that microdiversity within populations can not only allow them to adapt to rapidly changing conditions but also contribute to their persistence meziti et al 2019 orellana et al 2019 further small variations in metabolic capacity may underpin metabolic diversity and thus enable the co existence of multiple closely related strains within a single population nitrospira like bacteria have been shown to harbor high levels of microdiversity in drinking water gÃ¼lay et al 2016 palomo et al 2022 and wastewater gruber dorninger et al 2015 systems moreover studies have reported that closely related co existing nitrospira lineage i strains can exhibit differences in substrate affinities and utilization rates gruber dorninger et al 2015 since both levels of diversity i e species and strain level have been associated with microbial persistence and ecosystem stability it is plausible that the persistence of comammox bacteria may be associated with higher levels of microdiversity this would be consistent with observations for nitrospira like bacteria gruber dorninger et al 2015 to test this hypothesis we used a combination of full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and hybrid assembly and binning approaches to systematically explore the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers in three full scale nitrogen removal systems with different process configurations these systems were selected to investigate the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers due to the high abundance and temporal persistence of similar comammox bacterial species despite the differences in process configuration cotto et al 2020 while 16s rrna gene sequencing cannot provide information on genome content or metabolic potential the single nucleotide resolution across the full length 16s rrna gene can help determine differences in micro diversity among nitrifying populations garcÃ­a garcÃ­a et al 2019 gruber dorninger et al 2015 nevertheless 16s rrna gene sequences cannot be used to reliably distinguish comammox bacteria from strict nitrospira nob one approach to differentiate between the different guilds within nitrospira bacteria and to analyze their diversity at high resolution is to leverage a genome resolved approach to obtain high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags various methods exist to quantify diversity e g average nucleotide identity ani and average amino acid identity aai and microdiversity e g average nucleotide identity from reads and nucleotide diversity from single nucleotide polymorphisms snps within populations nevertheless their applicability depends on the quality of mags which can be impacted when relying on short read sequencing e g illumina in the presence of closely related strains bertrand et al 2019 while long read sequencing on the nanopore platform can help mitigate this constraint mantere et al 2019 singleton et al 2021 this requires high levels of coverage to obtain polished consensus sequences with lower error rates compared with the raw data bertrand et al 2019 here we utilize a hybrid metagenomic assembly approach including long and short read data in an effort to assemble high quality mags for subsequent microdiversity analyses bertrand et al 2019 thus the overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the widespread distribution and persistence of nearly identical comammox bacterial populations in multiple secondary wastewater treatment systems was due to the co existence of multiple strains i e high microdiversity to accomplish this we used a combination of full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and hybrid metagenome assembly and binning approach to systematically explore the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers in three full scale nitrogen removal systems with different process configurations in doing so we also aimed to assess factors that may influence the inter population i e strain and intra population i e species level diversity of co existing nitrifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples selection and processing

the two genera were obtained from the silva ssu 138 1 database tables s2 and s3 comammox bacterial 16s rrna genes were extracted from references genomes downloaded from ncbi table s4 muscle v3 8 1551

retained for manual refinement with anvi o v6 1 dastool v1 1 2 sieber et al 2018 was used to combine and curate the refined bins from the three binning methods and generate a non redundant set of bins from each co assembly i e one set of bins per system for the short read only and for the hybrid assemblies in total 43 nitrifiers bins from the short read co assemblies and 30 from the hybrid assemblies were obtained these bins were de replicated using drep v2 5 4 at 95 ani with completeness and contamination thresholds set to 50 and 10 respectively this resulted in 44 nitrifier mags with

re assembly using nitrifying bacterial mags we performed re assemblies from reads mapped to the 44 nitrifying bacterial mags to improve mag quality first contigs associated with nitrospira including

between the samples where they were detected nucleotide diversity is a measurement of genetic microdiversity at every position along the genome using mapped reads while popani is a unique ani

denitrification systems with high absolute abundance of comammox bacteria were selected for this time series study on the basis of our previous findings cotto et al 2020 since high sequencing coverage

asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively each asv set was rarefied to the sample with the smallest library size per system resulting in 7040 4349 and 5749 asvs from gre jammsm and neu respectively and a total of 16 651 unique asvs across all three systems asvs with a total of 100 reads in each system were clustered into otus at 98 7 identity resulting in 846 otus figure 1a table s7 the most abundant otus at gre and neu were from the classes gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and the phylum bacteroidota while the class nitrospiria had the highest relative abundance in jammsm pcoa using weighted wuf and unweighted unifrac uuf distance metrics fig 1 b demonstrated that samples clustered by system and the community structure between gre and neu wuf 0 18 0 03 uuf 0 46 0 03 were significantly more similar than gre and jammsm wuf 0 28 0 02 uuf 0 56 0 05 and neu and jammsm wuf 0 29 0 03 uuf 0 52 0 04 p 0 05 figure s2a and b the higher similarity between gre and neu is likely due to the fact that these were suspended phase communities as compared with attached phase i e biofilm samples communities collected from the ifas system at jammsm nitrosomonas 31 25 and 14 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively and nitrospira like bacteria 37 36 and 29 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively were the only nitrifiers present in the systems nitrospira lineage i asvs were the most abundant group across all systems with average relative abundances of 2 91 25 13 and 2 88 followed by nitrospira lineage ii with average relative abundances 1 41 7 07 and 0 64 in gre jammsm and neu respectively fig 1c n oligotropha cluster 6a and n communis cluster 8 like asvs were present in all systems with relative abundances of 0 5 and 0 33 1 68 and 0 93 and 0 58 and 0 19 in gre jammsm and neu respectively n europaea mobilis cluster 7 like asvs were also detected in gre and jammsm at very low abundances compared with the other two nitrosomonas linages average 0 032 and 0 002 respectively 3 2 16s rrna gene sequence based diversity and microdiversity of nitrifiers the nitrospira like asvs belonged to lineage i 20 24 and 22 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively or lineage

at gre and jammsm respectively and n communis 3 3 and 4 at gre jammsm and neu respectively lineages figure s3b there are five nitrospira related genera e g nitrospira a nitrospira c nitrospira d nitrospira e and nitrospira f according to the genome taxonomy database d h parks et al 2018 with high metabolic flexibility and physiological diversity sampara et al 2022 however the taxonomy of the 16s rrna asvs was evaluated with the silva ssu 138 1 database which classified all nitrospira like bacteria as the same genus since lineage i appears to be represented by the gtdb nitrospira a and lineage ii by the other gtdb genera including nitrospira c f sampara et al 2022 and taking into consideration that nitrospira a nitrospira d and nitrospira f where the only nitrospira like bacteria found in the systems see section 3 4 the micro diversity analysis was performed separately by nitrospira lineages i e lineage i and ii the nitrospira lineage i nitrospira lineage ii and nitrosomonas like asvs clustered into 1 2 and 21 otus for gre 1 2 and 14 otus for jammsm and 1 1 and 10 otus for neu respectively the shannon diversity a species level diversity parameter of nitrosomonas like otus was significantly higher than nitrospira like otus from both lineages while the effective microdiversity a measurement of strain level diversity of nitrospira lineage i otus was significantly higher than nitrosomonas like otus in all systems p 0 05 fig 2 a nitrospira lineage i otus consistently showed the highest microdiversity fig 2b while two nitrospira lineage ii otus from gre and jammsm had a lower effective microdiversity than most nitrifier otus these results suggest high diversity more otus and low microdiversity less asvs per otus for nitrosomonas like bacteria while the opposite was observed for nitrospira like bacteria in lineage i 3 3 improving the recovery of metagenome assembled genomes of nitrifying bacteria we pursued taxonomy aware re assembly uritskiy et al 2018 of 44 non redundant nitrifer mags after dereplicating bins from short read and hybrid assembly approach see supplemental information for discussion of multiple assembly and bin approaches used the resultant 36 nitrifier mags had completeness greater than 70 and redundancy lower than 10 table s8 with nitrification genes present in 24 mags although the number of retrieved nitrifier mags was a little lower after the reassembly process there was significant improvement in quality i e higher completeness lower redundancy and less fragmentation table s8 especially for comammox and aob genomes for example both analyses before and after reassembly resulted in 4 nitrospira comammox mags however 2 of the 4 comammox mags recovered after reassembly contained the entire genetic repertoire required for nitrification and the other two lack only one gene in contrast all pre reassembly comammox mags lacked at least one nitrification gene these improvements resulted from longer contigs created during the reassembly process compared with previous co assemblies in contrast to comammox and aob despite becoming less fragmented post reassembly fewer nitrospira nob mags contained all genes associated with nitrite oxidation 3 4 phylogenomic placement and abundance of nitrifier mags the 11 canonical nob and 4 comammox were associated with nitrospira lineage i 8 nitrospira a nob and nitrospira lineage ii 3 nitrospira d nob and 4 nitrospira comammox with all comammox mags closely related with ca nitrospira nitrosa fig 3 a and belonged to nitrospira comammox clade a 1 based on the hao gene phylogenetic inference figure s4 this is in agreement with a previous study that suggests comammox clade a 1 usually co occur with the nitrospira lineage i populations in wastewater treatment plants wwtps while clade a 2 and most clade b are typically found in drinking water treatment plants dwtps palomo et al 2019 while non wwtp settings e g soils sediments lakes rivers dwtps harbor diverse comammox bacteria palomo et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 shi et al 2020 xia et al 2018a y xu et al 2020 our findings suggest very low diversity of comammox bacteria in wastewater systems which is consistent with other wastewater studies beach and noguera 2019 m wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 all aob mags n 20 were associated with the n oligotropha n 14 and n communis n 3 lineages fig 3b although several members of the n europaea mobilis lineage have been detected in sewage treatment plants h p koops et al 2005 only three aob mags related to this lineage were recovered from jammsm at very low abundances and less than 50 genome coverage thus these mags were excluded from subsequent analyses the three n communis cluster mags gre aob 1 jammsm aob 4 neu aob 3 were nearly 100 identical but shared less than 75 ani with all reference genomes this lineage can be divided into the n communis and the n nitrosa clusters pommerening rÃ¶ser et al 1996 with n communis species being urease negative and detected primarily in agricultural soils and isolates of n nitrosa being urease positive preferring aquatic habitats and often found in wastewater treatment plants h p koops et al 1991 our three mags contain urease encoding genes but were still distant to n nitrosa in the phylogenomic analysis fig 3b suggesting the presence of a novel phylogenetic lineage lastly most species of the n oligotropha lineage have been recovered from oligotrophic freshwaters and almost all are urease positive h p koops et al 1991 h p koops et al 2005 accordingly 12 of the 14 aob mags placed within this nitrosomonas lineage contain urease encoding genes nitrospira a nob was the most abundant functional group in all three systems for the duration of the study with higher abundances in jammsm 305 2 48 2 rpkm as compared with neu 178 2 12 5 rpkm and gre 106 0 16 8 rpkm this suggests that nitrospira a bacteria may prefer biofilm based growth over suspended phase navada et al 2020 nitrospira d nob were only present in gre 43 3 6 4 rpkm and jamms 9 3 2 1 rpkm at lower concentrations compared with nitrospira a nob nitrosomonas like mags were more abundant in neu 105 2 23 rpkm and gre 86 15 8 rpkm as compared with jammsm 53 2 27 4 nitrospira comammox relative abundances were very similar in all systems ranging from 55 5 to 64 9 rpkm in jammsm and neu respectively fig 3c the abundances of nitrifying mags were weakly correlated with each other with only 37 of 195 correlations significant p value 0 05 most of the significant correlations between nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob were positive figure s5 likely arising as consequence of metabolic interactions of these groups within the nitrification process comammox bacteria had very few correlations with other nitrifiers with primarily negative correlations with mags from n oligotropha like bacteria cluster 6a 3 5 species level diversity of nitrifying bacteria within and between systems post dereplication at 95 ani jain et al 2018 konstantinidis et al 2022 pairwise ani and aai were calculated between all mags within the same functional group i e nitrosomonas nitrospira a nob nitrospira d nob and nitrospira comammox fig 4 a b tables s9a b of the 136 pairwise comparisons between the 17 nitrosomonas mags only 18 13 2 had ani values higher than 80 ani values lower than 80 are not reported suggesting high species level diversity within and between nitrogen removal systems for the nitrosomonas like aob fig 4a pairwise aais for nitrospira nob mags within the same genus i e nitrospira a within or across systems were usually 85 table s9b which typically represent members of the same species luo et al 2014 these results suggest that while multiple nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob coexist in each system nitrosomonas aob were substantially more diverse than all nitrospira nob genus in contrast three of the four comammox mags one from each system share ani values between 95 and 97 and are closely related with ca nitrospira nitrosa cotto et al 2020 although a comammox mag from jammsm jammsm cmx 2 has lower than 95 with the other three mags it still exhibited greater than 85 aai fig 4b with them and also falls within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster fig 3a luo et al 2014 pairwise aai comparisons which are highly correlated with ani figure s6 indicated that nitrospira comammox mags have significantly higher aai compared with aob and nob while aob were the most diverse functional group at the population level p 0 05 fig 4b moreover similar to the asv analysis nitrospira a nob lineage i and nitrospira d nob lineage ii mags have highly similar populations within each genus lineage fig 4b being detected across systems these findings further confirm that in contrast to aob that demonstrate high diversity comammox bacteria show very low diversity and in fact may all be associated with the same population across multiple wastewater systems 3 6 microdiversity of nitrifying bacteria the anir distributions for nitrospira comammox nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira d nob mags were not significantly different from each other and significantly higher than for nitrospira d nob mags fig 5 a while nitrospira a nob overall demonstrated lower anir indicating higher microdiversity compared with the other three groups there was some variability within each system figure s7 these observed trends were similar between anir and instrain estimated nucleotide diversity fig 5b with nitrosomonas aob showing on average lowest microdiversity and nitrospira a nob the highest specifically the average nucleotide diversity of nitrosomonas aob was significantly lower than nitrospira a nob and nitrospira comammox p 0 05 while with anir only nitrospira a nob were significantly more microdiverse than the three other functional groups this difference arises from the fact that the two measures of microdiversity i e anir and nucleotide diversity are calculated differently for instance anir considers only the major alleles in the consensus sequence to call a substitution while nucleotide diversity is calculated using base pair frequencies at each position nonetheless both approaches indicate that nitrospira a nob exhibit significantly higher microdiversity as compared with the other groups these results are consistent with the 16s rrna gene analysis where nitrospira lineage i and some lineage ii otus had significantly higher effective microdiversity than the nitrosomonas like otus and the remaining nitrospira lineage ii otus based on these results we speculate that the nitrospira lineage ii otus with the lower effective microdiversity likely correspond to comammox bacteria fig 2b finally popani a microdiversity aware ani calculation was used to discriminate between strains across samples using the recommended popani threshold of 99 999 olm et al 2021 all popani values from gre cmx 1 jammsm cmx 1 and neu cmx 1 were above or very close to the 99 999 threshold suggesting low strain level diversity of comammox bacteria fig 5c only one comammox genome retrieved from jammsm jammsm cmx 2 had popani values lower than the recommended threshold however the average relative abundance of this comammox rpkm 7 2 was particularly low as compared with the more abundant comammox in jammsm rpkm 48 21 and those retrieved from gre rpkm 60 19 and neu rpkm 65 17 therefore the principal or sole comammox bacteria in each system is not only a single population but likely also a specific strain the anir for each comammox mag estimated by mapping reads from a different system e g mapping gre or neu reads to mags assembled from jammsm were lower than when mapping of reads from the system from where the mag was obtained e g mapping jammsm reads to mags assembled from jammsm figure s8 this suggests that on the one hand the comammox bacterial population within a single system is restricted to a specific ca nitrospira nitrosa like strain but on the other hand that different systems contain different strains 4 discussion 4 1 comammox bacteria exhibit lower diversity in secondary wastewater treatment as compare with strict aob and nob and comammox species in other environments structural diversity and functional redundancy are inherently linked to process stability when environmental and process conditions vary siripong and rittmann 2007 both metagenomics and 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that nitrosomonas and nitrospira like bacteria were the only known nitrifiers present in the systems investigated this is consistent with numerous studies dionisi et al 2002 j f gao et al 2013 gruber dorninger et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 suggesting the specific adaptation of these genera to the wastewater environment the majority of the nitrosomonas like aob mags within and between systems had aai values below 85 fig 4 indicating that this functional group exhibited high species level diversity meanwhile nitrospira like mags within the same genus e g nitrospira a or nitrospira d reported aai values above 85 in most cases the high diversity of the nitrosomonas like bacteria was also confirmed with full length 16s rrna gene sequencing figure s3b and corroborates earlier studies on their diversity in wastewater j gao et al 2014 j f gao et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 although n europaea n oligotropha and the nitrosomonas like cluster closely associated with n communis nitrosa are often the most abundant groups in wastewater systems different nitrosomonas populations dominate different processes configuration j f gao et al 2013 for example n europaea are often the major aob in high ammonia concentration environments e g anammox reactors due to their low ammonia affinity j gao et al 2014 the observed dominance of n oligotropha and n communis in this study are consistent with previous studies of wwtps with relatively lower ammonia concentrations j gao et al 2014 j f gao et al 2013 wells et al 2009 comammox bacteria exhibited significantly lower diversity as compared with strict aob and most nob fig 4 all comammox nitrospira mags independent of the system they were recovered from belong to nitrospira lineage ii and were closely associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa these findings are consistent with several studies that have found ca nitrospira nitrosa like bacteria as the unique or principal comammox bacteria present in their lab and full scale wastewater treatment systems beach and noguera 2019 camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 using metagenomics and gene targeted analyses in contrast other engineered and natural habitats e g soils sediments lakes drinking water groundwater and estuaries typically harbor multiple co existing species across the two primary clades i e comammox clade a and b palomo et al 2022 pjevac et al 2017 vilardi et al 2022 x wang et al 2021 y xu et al 2020 however this co existence of comammox populations across clades does not seem to be prevalent in wastewater treatment systems beach and noguera 2019 m wang et al 2018 these findings suggest that the diversity of comammox bacteria in wwtps is lower than in other habitats where several comammox species co exist in contrast spasov et al 2020 reported the detection of multiple comammox mags in samples collected from rotating biological contactors rbcs used for tertiary treatment at a municipal wwtp in ontario canada the difference in diversity between that study and other wwtp investigations including this one may be associated with ammonia availability specifically tertiary treatment systems are typically employed as a polishing step designed and operated to remove low residual amounts of nitrogen the influent ammonium concentrations reported for the rbc tertiary treatment system range from 0 2 to 16 3 Âµm spasov et al 2020 while the three systems in this study have influent ammonia concentrations between 2 and 3 mm the comammox nitrospira mags with overall higher abundances in the tertiary plant rbc001 and rbc083 were less abundant at the beginning of the train higher ammonium concentrations than at the end of the train lower ammonium concertation in contrast the abundance of rbc035 the only mag phylogenetically associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa ani 95 decreased in abundance with decreasing ammonium concentrations the high comammox diversity in the rbcs and other ammonium limited systems suggest that ammonium concentration and or flux through the system may be a key factor driving comammox bacteria diversity in nitrification systems in fact palomo et al 2022 reported that the influent ammonium concentration was the key explanatory variable associated with comammox bacterial diversity in 12 groundwater fed sand filters when higher comammox population diversity was detected in systems receiving lower ammonium concentrations ca nitrospira inopinata and ca nitrospira kreftii two comammox species with known kinetic parameters have high apparent ammonia affinities kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 assuming this is a conserved trait in comammox bacteria this explains their prevalence and diversity in ammonium limited systems however the kinetic parameters i e affinity constant growth rate of other comammox species especially of the ca nitrospira nitrosa clade have not yet been reported and our findings suggest that at least this comammox clade may have substantially different kinetic traits that allow it to thrive in systems with higher ammonium concentrations low do has also been associated with the prevalence of comammox bacteria over canonical nitrifiers in wastewater systems beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 however the high do concentrations 2 mg l in this and other studies m wang et al 2018 s xu et al 2022 suggest do is not a crucial factor for the proliferation of ca nitrospira nitrosa in nitrogen removal systems 4 2 comammox bacteria not only exhibit low diversity at the species level but also at the strain level across wastewater systems the high abundance and microdiversity of nitrospira a nob have been previously reported in wastewater and other engineered and natural environments gruber dorninger et al 2015 gÃ¼lay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 however it is unclear whether the high microdiversity of nitrospira is associated with high functional diversity or is indicative of the coexistence of functionally identical nitrospira with allelic diversity gruber dorninger et al gruber dorninger et al 2015 reported variable responses of closely related bacteria within nitrospira lineage i sequence identities ranging from 95 8 to 99 6 to different nitrite availabilities similarly ecological niche partitioning was also identified as potential mechanisms for co existence of three nitrospira lineage i strains that used formate under different conditions two used formate when incubated with nitrite and ammonia respectively while the third used formate efficiently as the sole substrate gruber dorninger et al 2015 although these results shed light on the possible niche partitioning of nitrospira sub species this does not shed light on whether the microdiversity in our study represents coexisting nitrospira strains with slight functional differences although functional implications of such high microdiversity are not clear the persistence of high microdiversity may suggest it plays an important role in the distribution and success of nitrospira populations in wastewater systems few studies in other environments have shown that persistent populations exhibit increased intra population sequence diversity meziti et al 2019 orellana et al 2019 for example a study in a saltern pond suggested that the ecologically important genes of the major archaeal population were carried by distinct sub populations strains indicating that the adaptation to different salinity concentrations had led to sub population differentiation and speciation niche partitioning konstantinidis et al 2022 moreover a study in eight different temperate bog lakes concluded that high microdiversity is associated with the maintenance of functional microbial communities during changes in environmental conditions garcÃ­a garcÃ­a et al 2019 in contrast comammox bacteria not only exhibited an unexpected low diversity within and between systems but also showed significantly lower microdiversity as compared with strict nob within the genus nitrospira a these results may indicate specific adaptations of comammox bacteria within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster to the wastewater environment and particularly secondary treatment systems we confirmed that the principal or sole comammox bacteria in each system was not only a single population but likely also a specific ca nitrospira nitrosa like strain however each system was dominated by a different strain this is in accordance with wang et al 2018 who found in their study that most comammox otus were associated with the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster 94 34 of all comammox amoa sequences with different otus representing the dominant comammox species in different systems palomo et al 2022 observed a negative correlation between the species level diversity of comammox nitrospira and ammonium concentrations in groundwater sand filters however that was not the case for microdiversity suggesting that different mechanisms may shape inter versus intra population diversities or that the range of ammonium concentrations in the investigated drinking water systems was too narrow to capture any underlying associations for instance the comammox nucleotide diversity in our study ranged from 0 002 to 0 008 while for the mags obtained from these drinking water systems was from 0 005 to 0 013 with only three of the twelve comammox mags presenting nucleotide diversities lower than 0 008 palomo et al 2022 this may suggest that comammox microdiversity is also associated with ammonium concentrations and or flux through the system with the observed low microdiversity in wastewater systems associated with the higher prevailing ammonium concentrations the low microdiversity of comammox bacteria compared with other nitrifier groups rejected the hypothesis that the persistence of comammox bacteria in wastewater secondary treatment is associated with high levels of microdiversity suggesting other possible reasons the reasons for their persistence could include higher growth yield as compared with aob and preference for biofilm based growth costa et al 2006 kits et al 2017 further their metabolic versatility could help them adapt to changes in environmental conditions and thus contribute to their persistence finally several metabolic differences between comammox bacteria and canonical nitrifiers e g ammonia and nitrite affinity co2 fixation mechanisms etc koch et al 2015 can potentially create a unique niche which may contribute to their persistence nevertheless further research is required to clearly identify factors that explain the presence and temporal stability of comammox bacterial strains in wwtps despite the broad detection of comammox bacteria in wwtps their role and process relevance are as yet unclear in contrast to other environments comammox nitrospira present very low species and strain level diversity in wastewater treatment systems for nitrogen removal this observed lack of diversity and consequently lack of functional redundancy may influence the feasibility of potential design and operational strategies relying primarily on comammox nitrospira for nitrogen removal although ammonium concentration and or availability apparently influences the diversity of comammox bacteria further studies are necessary to determine other factors driving the success of their clonal community in wastewater moreover studies are required to estimate the activity of comammox bacteria specifically ca nitrospira nitrosa and to assess their contribution to nitrification in full scale nitrogen removal systems it is also important to note that the strain level diversity cannot be solely studied with shotgun metagenomic methods since high microdiversity can prevent robust assembly of individual genomes konstantinidis et al 2022 therefore more accurate techniques are needed to obtain high quality strain level genome assemblies for nitrospira a and other highly microdiverse bacteria 5 conclusion full length 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis demonstrated high diversity and low microdiversity for nitrosomonas like bacteria while the opposite was observed for nitrospira lineage i bacteria meanwhile nitrospira lineage ii which include comammox bacteria had lower microdiversity than nitrospira lineage i hybrid assembly was not completely suitable for the reconstruction of nitrospira nob genomes this is likely caused by the high levels of microdiversity within nitrospira a nob lineage i which may impact the read mapping and de novo assembly process comammox bacteria exhibited significantly lower diversity compared with strict aob i e nitrosomonas like bacteria and comammox bacteria present in other environments and lower microdiversity compared with strict nitrospira a nob these results may indicate specific adaptations of comammox bacteria within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster to the

15261,studies have found ca nitrospira nitrosa like bacteria to be the principal or sole comammox bacteria in nitrogen removal systems for wastewater treatment in contrast multiple populations of strict ammonia and nitrite oxidizers co exist in similar systems this apparent lack of diversity is surprising and could impact the feasibility of leveraging comammox bacteria for nitrogen removal we used full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and genome resolved metagenomics to compare the species level diversity of comammox bacteria with that of strict nitrifiers in full scale wastewater treatment systems and assess whether this comparison is consistent or diverged at the strain level full length 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that nitrosomonas like bacteria exhibited higher species level diversity in comparison with other nitrifying bacteria while the strain level diversity also called microdiversity of most nitrospira like bacteria were higher than nitrosomonas like bacteria with few exceptions one nitrospira lineage ii population comammox bacterial metagenome assembled genomes mags were associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa the average amino acid identity between principal comammox bacterial mags 93 3 across systems was significantly higher than that of the nitrosomonas like ammonia oxidizers 73 8 the nitrospira a like nitrite oxidizer 85 4 and the nitrospira d like nitrite oxidizer 83 1 this demonstrated the low species level diversity of comammox bacteria compared with strict nitrifiers and further suggests that the same comammox population was detected in all systems comammox bacteria nitrospira lineage ii nitrosomonas and nitrospira d nitrospira lineage ii mags were significantly less microdiverse than the nitrospira a lineage i mags interestingly strain resolved analysis also indicates that different nitrogen removal systems harbor different comammox bacterial strains within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster these results suggest that comammox bacteria associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa have low species and strain level diversity in nitrogen removal systems and may thus harbor specific adaptations to the wastewater ecosystem graphical

centered around biotransformation and growth kinetics of strict ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob klotz and stein 2008 since their discovery daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 several studies have detected comammox bacteria in a wide range of environmental and engineered systems palomo et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 including laboratory and full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 in contrast to oligotrophic engineered systems with low nitrogen concentrations such as drinking water palomo et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 and even tertiary treatment systems at full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps spasov et al 2020 where several comammox species co exist most studies have identified candidatus nitrospira nitrosa like comammox as the principal or sole comammox bacteria in lab and full scale wastewater secondary treatment systems camejo et al 2017 xia et al 2018b zhao et al 2019 this apparent lack of diversity at the species level of comammox bacteria in secondary treatment processes is not only surprising but has the potential to impact treatment strategies centered around comammox bacteria gottshall et al 2021 d li et al 2021 as functional outcomes reliant on low diversity communities may be less resilient to environmental fluctuations and perturbations studies often report the coexistence of multiple nitrosomonas like aob and nitrospira like nob populations j f gao et al 2013 ofiÅ£eru et al 2010 siripong and rittmann 2007 likely occupying different ecological niches i e adapted to different conditions within a complex community the functional redundancy of multiple co exiting populations can confer stability to microbial ecosystems ensuring the long term persistence konopka et al 2015 schloter et al 2000 despite the apparent low species level diversity of comammox bacteria compared with strict nitrifiers they have exhibited remarkable stability in secondary treatment systems camejo et al 2017 cotto et al 2020 roots et al 2019 one plausible reason for their temporal persistence could be that comammox bacteria may harbor intra population i e strain level diversity also known as microdiversity compared with population i e species level diversity in this manuscript the words diversity and microdiversity will refer to the species level diversity and strain level diversity respectively previous studies have demonstrated that microdiversity within populations can not only allow them to adapt to rapidly changing conditions but also contribute to their persistence meziti et al 2019 orellana et al 2019 further small variations in metabolic capacity may underpin metabolic diversity and thus enable the co existence of multiple closely related strains within a single population nitrospira like bacteria have been shown to harbor high levels of microdiversity in drinking water gÃ¼lay et al 2016 palomo et al 2022 and wastewater gruber dorninger et al 2015 systems moreover studies have reported that closely related co existing nitrospira lineage i strains can exhibit differences in substrate affinities and utilization rates gruber dorninger et al 2015 since both levels of diversity i e species and strain level have been associated with microbial persistence and ecosystem stability it is plausible that the persistence of comammox bacteria may be associated with higher levels of microdiversity this would be consistent with observations for nitrospira like bacteria gruber dorninger et al 2015 to test this hypothesis we used a combination of full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and hybrid assembly and binning approaches to systematically explore the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers in three full scale nitrogen removal systems with different process configurations these systems were selected to investigate the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers due to the high abundance and temporal persistence of similar comammox bacterial species despite the differences in process configuration cotto et al 2020 while 16s rrna gene sequencing cannot provide information on genome content or metabolic potential the single nucleotide resolution across the full length 16s rrna gene can help determine differences in micro diversity among nitrifying populations garcÃ­a garcÃ­a et al 2019 gruber dorninger et al 2015 nevertheless 16s rrna gene sequences cannot be used to reliably distinguish comammox bacteria from strict nitrospira nob one approach to differentiate between the different guilds within nitrospira bacteria and to analyze their diversity at high resolution is to leverage a genome resolved approach to obtain high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags various methods exist to quantify diversity e g average nucleotide identity ani and average amino acid identity aai and microdiversity e g average nucleotide identity from reads and nucleotide diversity from single nucleotide polymorphisms snps within populations nevertheless their applicability depends on the quality of mags which can be impacted when relying on short read sequencing e g illumina in the presence of closely related strains bertrand et al 2019 while long read sequencing on the nanopore platform can help mitigate this constraint mantere et al 2019 singleton et al 2021 this requires high levels of coverage to obtain polished consensus sequences with lower error rates compared with the raw data bertrand et al 2019 here we utilize a hybrid metagenomic assembly approach including long and short read data in an effort to assemble high quality mags for subsequent microdiversity analyses bertrand et al 2019 thus the overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the widespread distribution and persistence of nearly identical comammox bacterial populations in multiple secondary wastewater treatment systems was due to the co existence of multiple strains i e high microdiversity to accomplish this we used a combination of full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and hybrid metagenome assembly and binning approach to systematically explore the species and strain level diversity of nitrifiers in three full scale nitrogen removal systems with different process configurations in doing so we also aimed to assess factors that may influence the inter population i e strain and intra population i e species level diversity of co existing nitrifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples selection and processing samples were taken from the nitrifying bioreactors of three municipal wastewater treatment plants with different process configurations i e sequencing batch reactor sbr integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas and bardenpho 5 stages activated sludge system and high abundances of comammox bacteria reported in our previous study cotto et al 2020 the process parameters of these systems are discussed elsewhere cotto et al 2020 biomass samples were collected in 2017 2018 and stored at 80 c until subsequent analysis post dna extraction a total of thirty three twenty and six samples were selected for full length 16s rrna gene sequencing on the pacbio sequel iie platform short read metagenomic sequencing on the illumina novaseq platform and long read metagenomic sequencing on the nanopore minion platform respectively table 1 sample collection and processing including dna extraction and process data collection were described previously cotto et al 2020 and are outlined in the supplementary text 2 2 pacbio full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and data analysis sample dna extracts table 1 were sent for full length 16s rrna gene sequencing at the roy j carver biotechnology center sequencing core university of illinois urbana champaign the full length 16s rrna gene amplicons were generated with universal barcoded primers 27f and 1492r frank et al 2008 pcr products were subject to library preparation and sequenced on the pacbio sequel iie using the circular consensus sequencing ccs mode raw reads were demultiplexed and ccs analyses were performed to obtain consensus reads further details on pcr library preparation and sequencing are provided in the supplementary text downstream data processing was performed on a system by system basis using the dada2 v1 19 2 callahan et al 2016 in r v4 0 4 specifically we used the dada2 sample inference method for full length 16s rrna gene with single nucleotide resolution the dada2 workflow included primer removal quality filtering dereplication learning the dataset specific error model amplicon sequence variants asvs inference chimera removal and taxonomic assignment with the silva ssu 138 ref nr database using default settings further details on the downstream data processing are provided in the supplementary text table s1a summarizes the reads per samples at different stages of data processing in dada2 asvs with 100 reads in any of the three systems 0 01 relative abundance were clustered into operational taxonomy units otus using the function idclusters in decipher v2 16 1 wright 2020 at 98 7 sequence identity a previously recommended threshold for clustering full length 16s rrna gene sequences at the species level stackebrandt 2006 yarza et al 2014 the most abundant asv within each otu was used as representative sequence and its taxonomic affiliation determined using the silva ssu 138 1 database was used as the consensus taxonomy for the otu additional details on asv to otu data processing are provided in the supplementary text representative asv sequence from all otus were aligned with muscle v3 8 1551 edgar 2004 and the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed and visualized using iq tree v2 0 3 nguyen et al 2015 and itol v2 1 7 price et al 2010 respectively principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed with the weighted and unweighted unifrac distance metric lozupone and knight 2005 using the ordinate function of phyloseq v1 32 0 and the plot ordination function of ggplot2 v3 3 5 wickham 2016 asvs classified at the genus level as nitrospira and nitrosomonas the only two nitrifying genera detected in this study were extracted from the rarefied asv table rarefied to the sample with lowest read count and reference 16s rrna gene sequences for the two genera were obtained from the silva ssu 138 1 database tables s2 and s3 comammox bacterial 16s rrna genes were extracted from references genomes downloaded from ncbi table s4 muscle v3 8 1551 was used to align asvs sequences from each genus with their respective references and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of each species was generated using iq tree v2 0 3 and visualized in itol v2 1 7 to assess the species otus level diversity the shannon diversity was calculated per sample from the relative abundance of the otus classified as the same genus lineage as the exponential of the shannon index to estimate the strain asv level diversity the effective microdiversity of each otu was calculated on a per sample basis from the relative abundance of its asvs as the exponential of the shannon index which is analogous to the effective number of strains i e asvs within a species i e otu garcÃ­a garcÃ­a et al 2019 2 3 illumina and oxford nanopore sequencing co assembly and hybrid assembly seven samples from gre and neu and six samples from jammsm were sent for sequencing on the illumina novaseq 6000 platform and two samples from each system on the oxford nanopore technologies gridionx5 table 1 to the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois urbana champaign sequencing core library preparation and sequencing details are provided in the supplementary text these runs resulted in 1 78 billion paired end short reads 2 150 nt reads and 45 3 gbps of long read data table s1b and c raw short reads were filtered using fastp v0 20 0 chen et al 2018 and the univec database was used to remove contamination from the filtered reads as previously described cotto et al 2020 the resulting bam files were sorted using samtools v1 9 danecek et al 2021 and converted into fastq files with bedtools v2 29 0 quinlan and hall 2010 all reads from the same system were co assembled into contigs using metaspades v3 13 0 nurk et al 2017 co assemblies were performed with kmer sizes of 21 33 55 and 77 contigs smaller than 500 bp were removed from the co assemblies using the anvi o v6 1 command anvi script reformat fasta eren et al 2015 the reformatted assembly fasta files were indexed with bwa index v0 7 17 h li and durbin 2009 and the paired end reads from each metagenome were mapped to the respective co assembly using bwa mem v0 7 17 the resulting sam files were converted to bam files using samtools view f 4 bhs to retain only mapped reads hybrid metagenomic assemblies were performed using opera ms v0 9 0 which combines the advantages of short and long read technologies to improve genome assemblies bertrand et al 2019 the opera ms inputs were short read metagenomic assemblies to provide a good representation of the sequences in the metagenome and long and short reads to identify connections between the contigs and obtain contiguous assemblies with low base pair error opera ms was executed with the flags no ref clustering and long read mapper minimap2 both sets of co assemblies were evaluated using quast v5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 table s5 2 4 recovery annotation refining and dereplication of metagenome assembled genomes mags binning was performed separately with co assemblies from illumina short reads only and hybrid assemblies from each system using metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2019 concoct v1 1 0 alneberg et al 2014 and maxbin2 v2 2 7 wu et al 2016 using contigs greater than 2000 bp pilon v1 23 warren et al 2019 was used for polishing to improve the draft bins obtained from the hybrid assemblies the quality and taxonomy of the resulting bins were determined with checkm v1 1 2 d h parks et al 2015 and the genome taxonomy database toolkit gtdb tk 1 1 1 database release r86 v3 d h parks et al 2018 respectively bins were subject to gene calling using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and gene annotation against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 using kofamscan v1 2 0 aramaki et al 2020 only bins that were taxonomically assigned to known nitrifying genera or those containing genes associated with nitrification i e amoa ko number k10944 amob k10945 amoc k10946 hao k10535 nxra k00370 nxrb k00371 were retained for manual refinement with anvi o v6 1 dastool v1 1 2 sieber et al 2018 was used to combine and curate the refined bins from the three binning methods and generate a non redundant set of bins from each co assembly i e one set of bins per system for the short read only and for the hybrid assemblies in total 43 nitrifiers bins from the short read co assemblies and 30 from the hybrid assemblies were obtained these bins were de replicated using drep v2 5 4 at 95 ani with completeness and contamination thresholds set to 50 and 10 respectively this resulted in 44 nitrifier mags with completeness and redundancy estimates higher than 50 and lower than 10 respectively of which 21 contained genes associated with nitrification i e amoa amob amoc hao nxra and or nxrb 2 5 taxonomy aware re assembly using nitrifying bacterial mags we performed re assemblies from reads mapped to the 44 nitrifying bacterial mags to improve mag quality first contigs associated with nitrospira including comammox and nitrosomonas mags from each system i e gre jammsm neu were collated into a single fasta file per system the resulting fasta files were indexed using bwa index v0 7 17 and short reads from the respective system were mapped using bwa mem v0 7 17 the resultant bam file was split into nitrospira and nitrosomonas specific bam files per system and respective fastq files were generated per using samtools fastq long reads were also recruited by mapping the reads from nanopore sequencing to the fasta files with bwa mem x ont2d short reads mapping to the contigs of the mags classified as nitrospira and nitrosomonas were re assembled using metaspades v3 13 0 with kmers 21 33 55 and 77 on a system by system basis the new genus specific assemblies and fastq files of mapped long reads were used as input for opera ms to perform hybrid metagenomic re assemblies n 9 quality assessment binning taxonomy annotation manual refining and gene calling were performed as described before this resulted in 36 nitrifier mags with completeness and redundancy estimates higher than 50 and lower than 10 respectively of which 24 contained genes associated with nitrification amoa amob amoc hao nxra and or nxrb the abundance of each mag per sample reads per kilobase million rpkm and proportion of genome covered was calculated with coverm woodcroft and newell 2021 four low abundance mags 3 aob and 1 nitrospira nob with less than 50 genome coverage in any of the samples were removed from subsequent analyses the entire workflow for assembly and re assembly of mags is outlined in figure s1 the nitrifier mags were subsequently phylogenetically placed in the context of reference nitrospira table s4 and nitrosomonas table s6 genomes supplementary text 2 6 diversity and microdiversity analysis of nitrifiers fastani v1 3 jain et al 2018 was used to calculate the pairwise average nucleotide identity ani between mags within each functional group i e aob nitrospira a nob nitrospira d nob and nitrospira comammox ani represents the mean nucleotide identity of the orthologous genes shared between two genomes offering a robust resolution between similar or identical species i e 80 100 ani jain et al 2018 since ani values lower than 80 are not reported we also calculated the average amino acid identity aai to estimate similarity between two genomes at the amino acid level using comparem d parks et al 2020 to determine strain level diversity i e microdiversity we calculated the average nucleotide identity from reads anir meziti et al 2019 with 90 read identity threshold as recommended for intra population comparisons instrain v1 3 9 olm et al 2021 was used to determine the nucleotide diversity for each mag in each sample and their population average nucleotide identity popani between the samples where they were detected nucleotide diversity is a measurement of genetic microdiversity at every position along the genome using mapped reads while popani is a unique ani calculation performed by instrain that considers both major and minor alleles this is different from the traditional ani called consensus ani conani in instrain which only considers major alleles to call or not a substitution details on parameters and procedures associated with the implementation of anir and instrain are presented in the supplementary text 2 7 statistical analyses statistical tests were performed using r v4 0 4 all correlations were performed using a linear regression model the spearman s rank correlation coefficients between mag abundances were performed with the rcorr function of the r package hmisc v4 5 0 pair wise significances were calculated with the kruskal wallis test a nonparametric approach to the one anova principal coordinates analysis pcoa with the weighted and unweighted unifrac distance metrics was used to compare the community composition among systems 3 results 3 1 community composition in nitrogen removal systems three nitrification denitrification systems with high absolute abundance of comammox bacteria were selected for this time series study on the basis of our previous findings cotto et al 2020 since high sequencing coverage is critical for evaluation of strain level diversity specifically over the sampling period june 2017 to june 2018 comammox bacterial amob genes constituted approximately 0 77 0 32 4 7 4 21 and 0 45 0 24 of total bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances at gre jammsm and neu respectively the pacbio full length 16s rrna gene sequencing resulted in 2317 019 total reads table s1a with 7501 5783 and 8260 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively each asv set was rarefied to the sample with the smallest library size per system resulting in 7040 4349 and 5749 asvs from gre jammsm and neu respectively and a total of 16 651 unique asvs across all three systems asvs with a total of 100 reads in each system were clustered into otus at 98 7 identity resulting in 846 otus figure 1a table s7 the most abundant otus at gre and neu were from the classes gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and the phylum bacteroidota while the class nitrospiria had the highest relative abundance in jammsm pcoa using weighted wuf and unweighted unifrac uuf distance metrics fig 1 b demonstrated that samples clustered by system and the community structure between gre and neu wuf 0 18 0 03 uuf 0 46 0 03 were significantly more similar than gre and jammsm wuf 0 28 0 02 uuf 0 56 0 05 and neu and jammsm wuf 0 29 0 03 uuf 0 52 0 04 p 0 05 figure s2a and b the higher similarity between gre and neu is likely due to the fact that these were suspended phase communities as compared with attached phase i e biofilm samples communities collected from the ifas system at jammsm nitrosomonas 31 25 and 14 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively and nitrospira like bacteria 37 36 and 29 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively were the only nitrifiers present in the systems nitrospira lineage i asvs were the most abundant group across all systems with average relative abundances of 2 91 25 13 and 2 88 followed by nitrospira lineage ii with average relative abundances 1 41 7 07 and 0 64 in gre jammsm and neu respectively fig 1c n oligotropha cluster 6a and n communis cluster 8 like asvs were present in all systems with relative abundances of 0 5 and 0 33 1 68 and 0 93 and 0 58 and 0 19 in gre jammsm and neu respectively n europaea mobilis cluster 7 like asvs were also detected in gre and jammsm at very low abundances compared with the other two nitrosomonas linages average 0 032 and 0 002 respectively 3 2 16s rrna gene sequence based diversity and microdiversity of nitrifiers the nitrospira like asvs belonged to lineage i 20 24 and 22 asvs at gre jammsm and neu respectively or lineage ii 17 12 and 7 at gre jammsm and neu respectively figure s3a while nitrosomonas like asvs were associated with n oligotropha 23 21 and 10 at gre jammsm and neu respectively n europaea mobilis 5 and 1 at gre and jammsm respectively and n communis 3 3 and 4 at gre jammsm and neu respectively lineages figure s3b there are five nitrospira related genera e g nitrospira a nitrospira c nitrospira d nitrospira e and nitrospira f according to the genome taxonomy database d h parks et al 2018 with high metabolic flexibility and physiological diversity sampara et al 2022 however the taxonomy of the 16s rrna asvs was evaluated with the silva ssu 138 1 database which classified all nitrospira like bacteria as the same genus since lineage i appears to be represented by the gtdb nitrospira a and lineage ii by the other gtdb genera including nitrospira c f sampara et al 2022 and taking into consideration that nitrospira a nitrospira d and nitrospira f where the only nitrospira like bacteria found in the systems see section 3 4 the micro diversity analysis was performed separately by nitrospira lineages i e lineage i and ii the nitrospira lineage i nitrospira lineage ii and nitrosomonas like asvs clustered into 1 2 and 21 otus for gre 1 2 and 14 otus for jammsm and 1 1 and 10 otus for neu respectively the shannon diversity a species level diversity parameter of nitrosomonas like otus was significantly higher than nitrospira like otus from both lineages while the effective microdiversity a measurement of strain level diversity of nitrospira lineage i otus was significantly higher than nitrosomonas like otus in all systems p 0 05 fig 2 a nitrospira lineage i otus consistently showed the highest microdiversity fig 2b while two nitrospira lineage ii otus from gre and jammsm had a lower effective microdiversity than most nitrifier otus these results suggest high diversity more otus and low microdiversity less asvs per otus for nitrosomonas like bacteria while the opposite was observed for nitrospira like bacteria in lineage i 3 3 improving the recovery of metagenome assembled genomes of nitrifying bacteria we pursued taxonomy aware re assembly uritskiy et al 2018 of 44 non redundant nitrifer mags after dereplicating bins from short read and hybrid assembly approach see supplemental information for discussion of multiple assembly and bin approaches used the resultant 36 nitrifier mags had completeness greater than 70 and redundancy lower than 10 table s8 with nitrification genes present in 24 mags although the number of retrieved nitrifier mags was a little lower after the reassembly process there was significant improvement in quality i e higher completeness lower redundancy and less fragmentation table s8 especially for comammox and aob genomes for example both analyses before and after reassembly resulted in 4 nitrospira comammox mags however 2 of the 4 comammox mags recovered after reassembly contained the entire genetic repertoire required for nitrification and the other two lack only one gene in contrast all pre reassembly comammox mags lacked at least one nitrification gene these improvements resulted from longer contigs created during the reassembly process compared with previous co assemblies in contrast to comammox and aob despite becoming less fragmented post reassembly fewer nitrospira nob mags contained all genes associated with nitrite oxidation 3 4 phylogenomic placement and abundance of nitrifier mags the 11 canonical nob and 4 comammox were associated with nitrospira lineage i 8 nitrospira a nob and nitrospira lineage ii 3 nitrospira d nob and 4 nitrospira comammox with all comammox mags closely related with ca nitrospira nitrosa fig 3 a and belonged to nitrospira comammox clade a 1 based on the hao gene phylogenetic inference figure s4 this is in agreement with a previous study that suggests comammox clade a 1 usually co occur with the nitrospira lineage i populations in wastewater treatment plants wwtps while clade a 2 and most clade b are typically found in drinking water treatment plants dwtps palomo et al 2019 while non wwtp settings e g soils sediments lakes rivers dwtps harbor diverse comammox bacteria palomo et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 shi et al 2020 xia et al 2018a y xu et al 2020 our findings suggest very low diversity of comammox bacteria in wastewater systems which is consistent with other wastewater studies beach and noguera 2019 m wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 all aob mags n 20 were associated with the n oligotropha n 14 and n communis n 3 lineages fig 3b although several members of the n europaea mobilis lineage have been detected in sewage treatment plants h p koops et al 2005 only three aob mags related to this lineage were recovered from jammsm at very low abundances and less than 50 genome coverage thus these mags were excluded from subsequent analyses the three n communis cluster mags gre aob 1 jammsm aob 4 neu aob 3 were nearly 100 identical but shared less than 75 ani with all reference genomes this lineage can be divided into the n communis and the n nitrosa clusters pommerening rÃ¶ser et al 1996 with n communis species being urease negative and detected primarily in agricultural soils and isolates of n nitrosa being urease positive preferring aquatic habitats and often found in wastewater treatment plants h p koops et al 1991 our three mags contain urease encoding genes but were still distant to n nitrosa in the phylogenomic analysis fig 3b suggesting the presence of a novel phylogenetic lineage lastly most species of the n oligotropha lineage have been recovered from oligotrophic freshwaters and almost all are urease positive h p koops et al 1991 h p koops et al 2005 accordingly 12 of the 14 aob mags placed within this nitrosomonas lineage contain urease encoding genes nitrospira a nob was the most abundant functional group in all three systems for the duration of the study with higher abundances in jammsm 305 2 48 2 rpkm as compared with neu 178 2 12 5 rpkm and gre 106 0 16 8 rpkm this suggests that nitrospira a bacteria may prefer biofilm based growth over suspended phase navada et al 2020 nitrospira d nob were only present in gre 43 3 6 4 rpkm and jamms 9 3 2 1 rpkm at lower concentrations compared with nitrospira a nob nitrosomonas like mags were more abundant in neu 105 2 23 rpkm and gre 86 15 8 rpkm as compared with jammsm 53 2 27 4 nitrospira comammox relative abundances were very similar in all systems ranging from 55 5 to 64 9 rpkm in jammsm and neu respectively fig 3c the abundances of nitrifying mags were weakly correlated with each other with only 37 of 195 correlations significant p value 0 05 most of the significant correlations between nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob were positive figure s5 likely arising as consequence of metabolic interactions of these groups within the nitrification process comammox bacteria had very few correlations with other nitrifiers with primarily negative correlations with mags from n oligotropha like bacteria cluster 6a 3 5 species level diversity of nitrifying bacteria within and between systems post dereplication at 95 ani jain et al 2018 konstantinidis et al 2022 pairwise ani and aai were calculated between all mags within the same functional group i e nitrosomonas nitrospira a nob nitrospira d nob and nitrospira comammox fig 4 a b tables s9a b of the 136 pairwise comparisons between the 17 nitrosomonas mags only 18 13 2 had ani values higher than 80 ani values lower than 80 are not reported suggesting high species level diversity within and between nitrogen removal systems for the nitrosomonas like aob fig 4a pairwise aais for nitrospira nob mags within the same genus i e nitrospira a within or across systems were usually 85 table s9b which typically represent members of the same species luo et al 2014 these results suggest that while multiple nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob coexist in each system nitrosomonas aob were substantially more diverse than all nitrospira nob genus in contrast three of the four comammox mags one from each system share ani values between 95 and 97 and are closely related with ca nitrospira nitrosa cotto et al 2020 although a comammox mag from jammsm jammsm cmx 2 has lower than 95 with the other three mags it still exhibited greater than 85 aai fig 4b with them and also falls within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster fig 3a luo et al 2014 pairwise aai comparisons which are highly correlated with ani figure s6 indicated that nitrospira comammox mags have significantly higher aai compared with aob and nob while aob were the most diverse functional group at the population level p 0 05 fig 4b moreover similar to the asv analysis nitrospira a nob lineage i and nitrospira d nob lineage ii mags have highly similar populations within each genus lineage fig 4b being detected across systems these findings further confirm that in contrast to aob that demonstrate high diversity comammox bacteria show very low diversity and in fact may all be associated with the same population across multiple wastewater systems 3 6 microdiversity of nitrifying bacteria the anir distributions for nitrospira comammox nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira d nob mags were not significantly different from each other and significantly higher than for nitrospira d nob mags fig 5 a while nitrospira a nob overall demonstrated lower anir indicating higher microdiversity compared with the other three groups there was some variability within each system figure s7 these observed trends were similar between anir and instrain estimated nucleotide diversity fig 5b with nitrosomonas aob showing on average lowest microdiversity and nitrospira a nob the highest specifically the average nucleotide diversity of nitrosomonas aob was significantly lower than nitrospira a nob and nitrospira comammox p 0 05 while with anir only nitrospira a nob were significantly more microdiverse than the three other functional groups this difference arises from the fact that the two measures of microdiversity i e anir and nucleotide diversity are calculated differently for instance anir considers only the major alleles in the consensus sequence to call a substitution while nucleotide diversity is calculated using base pair frequencies at each position nonetheless both approaches indicate that nitrospira a nob exhibit significantly higher microdiversity as compared with the other groups these results are consistent with the 16s rrna gene analysis where nitrospira lineage i and some lineage ii otus had significantly higher effective microdiversity than the nitrosomonas like otus and the remaining nitrospira lineage ii otus based on these results we speculate that the nitrospira lineage ii otus with the lower effective microdiversity likely correspond to comammox bacteria fig 2b finally popani a microdiversity aware ani calculation was used to discriminate between strains across samples using the recommended popani threshold of 99 999 olm et al 2021 all popani values from gre cmx 1 jammsm cmx 1 and neu cmx 1 were above or very close to the 99 999 threshold suggesting low strain level diversity of comammox bacteria fig 5c only one comammox genome retrieved from jammsm jammsm cmx 2 had popani values lower than the recommended threshold however the average relative abundance of this comammox rpkm 7 2 was particularly low as compared with the more abundant comammox in jammsm rpkm 48 21 and those retrieved from gre rpkm 60 19 and neu rpkm 65 17 therefore the principal or sole comammox bacteria in each system is not only a single population but likely also a specific strain the anir for each comammox mag estimated by mapping reads from a different system e g mapping gre or neu reads to mags assembled from jammsm were lower than when mapping of reads from the system from where the mag was obtained e g mapping jammsm reads to mags assembled from jammsm figure s8 this suggests that on the one hand the comammox bacterial population within a single system is restricted to a specific ca nitrospira nitrosa like strain but on the other hand that different systems contain different strains 4 discussion 4 1 comammox bacteria exhibit lower diversity in secondary wastewater treatment as compare with strict aob and nob and comammox species in other environments structural diversity and functional redundancy are inherently linked to process stability when environmental and process conditions vary siripong and rittmann 2007 both metagenomics and 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that nitrosomonas and nitrospira like bacteria were the only known nitrifiers present in the systems investigated this is consistent with numerous studies dionisi et al 2002 j f gao et al 2013 gruber dorninger et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 suggesting the specific adaptation of these genera to the wastewater environment the majority of the nitrosomonas like aob mags within and between systems had aai values below 85 fig 4 indicating that this functional group exhibited high species level diversity meanwhile nitrospira like mags within the same genus e g nitrospira a or nitrospira d reported aai values above 85 in most cases the high diversity of the nitrosomonas like bacteria was also confirmed with full length 16s rrna gene sequencing figure s3b and corroborates earlier studies on their diversity in wastewater j gao et al 2014 j f gao et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 although n europaea n oligotropha and the nitrosomonas like cluster closely associated with n communis nitrosa are often the most abundant groups in wastewater systems different nitrosomonas populations dominate different processes configuration j f gao et al 2013 for example n europaea are often the major aob in high ammonia concentration environments e g anammox reactors due to their low ammonia affinity j gao et al 2014 the observed dominance of n oligotropha and n communis in this study are consistent with previous studies of wwtps with relatively lower ammonia concentrations j gao et al 2014 j f gao et al 2013 wells et al 2009 comammox bacteria exhibited significantly lower diversity as compared with strict aob and most nob fig 4 all comammox nitrospira mags independent of the system they were recovered from belong to nitrospira lineage ii and were closely associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa these findings are consistent with several studies that have found ca nitrospira nitrosa like bacteria as the unique or principal comammox bacteria present in their lab and full scale wastewater treatment systems beach and noguera 2019 camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 using metagenomics and gene targeted analyses in contrast other engineered and natural habitats e g soils sediments lakes drinking water groundwater and estuaries typically harbor multiple co existing species across the two primary clades i e comammox clade a and b palomo et al 2022 pjevac et al 2017 vilardi et al 2022 x wang et al 2021 y xu et al 2020 however this co existence of comammox populations across clades does not seem to be prevalent in wastewater treatment systems beach and noguera 2019 m wang et al 2018 these findings suggest that the diversity of comammox bacteria in wwtps is lower than in other habitats where several comammox species co exist in contrast spasov et al 2020 reported the detection of multiple comammox mags in samples collected from rotating biological contactors rbcs used for tertiary treatment at a municipal wwtp in ontario canada the difference in diversity between that study and other wwtp investigations including this one may be associated with ammonia availability specifically tertiary treatment systems are typically employed as a polishing step designed and operated to remove low residual amounts of nitrogen the influent ammonium concentrations reported for the rbc tertiary treatment system range from 0 2 to 16 3 Âµm spasov et al 2020 while the three systems in this study have influent ammonia concentrations between 2 and 3 mm the comammox nitrospira mags with overall higher abundances in the tertiary plant rbc001 and rbc083 were less abundant at the beginning of the train higher ammonium concentrations than at the end of the train lower ammonium concertation in contrast the abundance of rbc035 the only mag phylogenetically associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa ani 95 decreased in abundance with decreasing ammonium concentrations the high comammox diversity in the rbcs and other ammonium limited systems suggest that ammonium concentration and or flux through the system may be a key factor driving comammox bacteria diversity in nitrification systems in fact palomo et al 2022 reported that the influent ammonium concentration was the key explanatory variable associated with comammox bacterial diversity in 12 groundwater fed sand filters when higher comammox population diversity was detected in systems receiving lower ammonium concentrations ca nitrospira inopinata and ca nitrospira kreftii two comammox species with known kinetic parameters have high apparent ammonia affinities kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 assuming this is a conserved trait in comammox bacteria this explains their prevalence and diversity in ammonium limited systems however the kinetic parameters i e affinity constant growth rate of other comammox species especially of the ca nitrospira nitrosa clade have not yet been reported and our findings suggest that at least this comammox clade may have substantially different kinetic traits that allow it to thrive in systems with higher ammonium concentrations low do has also been associated with the prevalence of comammox bacteria over canonical nitrifiers in wastewater systems beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 however the high do concentrations 2 mg l in this and other studies m wang et al 2018 s xu et al 2022 suggest do is not a crucial factor for the proliferation of ca nitrospira nitrosa in nitrogen removal systems 4 2 comammox bacteria not only exhibit low diversity at the species level but also at the strain level across wastewater systems the high abundance and microdiversity of nitrospira a nob have been previously reported in wastewater and other engineered and natural environments gruber dorninger et al 2015 gÃ¼lay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 however it is unclear whether the high microdiversity of nitrospira is associated with high functional diversity or is indicative of the coexistence of functionally identical nitrospira with allelic diversity gruber dorninger et al gruber dorninger et al 2015 reported variable responses of closely related bacteria within nitrospira lineage i sequence identities ranging from 95 8 to 99 6 to different nitrite availabilities similarly ecological niche partitioning was also identified as potential mechanisms for co existence of three nitrospira lineage i strains that used formate under different conditions two used formate when incubated with nitrite and ammonia respectively while the third used formate efficiently as the sole substrate gruber dorninger et al 2015 although these results shed light on the possible niche partitioning of nitrospira sub species this does not shed light on whether the microdiversity in our study represents coexisting nitrospira strains with slight functional differences although functional implications of such high microdiversity are not clear the persistence of high microdiversity may suggest it plays an important role in the distribution and success of nitrospira populations in wastewater systems few studies in other environments have shown that persistent populations exhibit increased intra population sequence diversity meziti et al 2019 orellana et al 2019 for example a study in a saltern pond suggested that the ecologically important genes of the major archaeal population were carried by distinct sub populations strains indicating that the adaptation to different salinity concentrations had led to sub population differentiation and speciation niche partitioning konstantinidis et al 2022 moreover a study in eight different temperate bog lakes concluded that high microdiversity is associated with the maintenance of functional microbial communities during changes in environmental conditions garcÃ­a garcÃ­a et al 2019 in contrast comammox bacteria not only exhibited an unexpected low diversity within and between systems but also showed significantly lower microdiversity as compared with strict nob within the genus nitrospira a these results may indicate specific adaptations of comammox bacteria within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster to the wastewater environment and particularly secondary treatment systems we confirmed that the principal or sole comammox bacteria in each system was not only a single population but likely also a specific ca nitrospira nitrosa like strain however each system was dominated by a different strain this is in accordance with wang et al 2018 who found in their study that most comammox otus were associated with the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster 94 34 of all comammox amoa sequences with different otus representing the dominant comammox species in different systems palomo et al 2022 observed a negative correlation between the species level diversity of comammox nitrospira and ammonium concentrations in groundwater sand filters however that was not the case for microdiversity suggesting that different mechanisms may shape inter versus intra population diversities or that the range of ammonium concentrations in the investigated drinking water systems was too narrow to capture any underlying associations for instance the comammox nucleotide diversity in our study ranged from 0 002 to 0 008 while for the mags obtained from these drinking water systems was from 0 005 to 0 013 with only three of the twelve comammox mags presenting nucleotide diversities lower than 0 008 palomo et al 2022 this may suggest that comammox microdiversity is also associated with ammonium concentrations and or flux through the system with the observed low microdiversity in wastewater systems associated with the higher prevailing ammonium concentrations the low microdiversity of comammox bacteria compared with other nitrifier groups rejected the hypothesis that the persistence of comammox bacteria in wastewater secondary treatment is associated with high levels of microdiversity suggesting other possible reasons the reasons for their persistence could include higher growth yield as compared with aob and preference for biofilm based growth costa et al 2006 kits et al 2017 further their metabolic versatility could help them adapt to changes in environmental conditions and thus contribute to their persistence finally several metabolic differences between comammox bacteria and canonical nitrifiers e g ammonia and nitrite affinity co2 fixation mechanisms etc koch et al 2015 can potentially create a unique niche which may contribute to their persistence nevertheless further research is required to clearly identify factors that explain the presence and temporal stability of comammox bacterial strains in wwtps despite the broad detection of comammox bacteria in wwtps their role and process relevance are as yet unclear in contrast to other environments comammox nitrospira present very low species and strain level diversity in wastewater treatment systems for nitrogen removal this observed lack of diversity and consequently lack of functional redundancy may influence the feasibility of potential design and operational strategies relying primarily on comammox nitrospira for nitrogen removal although ammonium concentration and or availability apparently influences the diversity of comammox bacteria further studies are necessary to determine other factors driving the success of their clonal community in wastewater moreover studies are required to estimate the activity of comammox bacteria specifically ca nitrospira nitrosa and to assess their contribution to nitrification in full scale nitrogen removal systems it is also important to note that the strain level diversity cannot be solely studied with shotgun metagenomic methods since high microdiversity can prevent robust assembly of individual genomes konstantinidis et al 2022 therefore more accurate techniques are needed to obtain high quality strain level genome assemblies for nitrospira a and other highly microdiverse bacteria 5 conclusion full length 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis demonstrated high diversity and low microdiversity for nitrosomonas like bacteria while the opposite was observed for nitrospira lineage i bacteria meanwhile nitrospira lineage ii which include comammox bacteria had lower microdiversity than nitrospira lineage i hybrid assembly was not completely suitable for the reconstruction of nitrospira nob genomes this is likely caused by the high levels of microdiversity within nitrospira a nob lineage i which may impact the read mapping and de novo assembly process comammox bacteria exhibited significantly lower diversity compared with strict aob i e nitrosomonas like bacteria and comammox bacteria present in other environments and lower microdiversity compared with strict nitrospira a nob these results may indicate specific adaptations of comammox bacteria within the ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster to the

15262,in this study changes in the reactivity of nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi in five different groundwater gw systems under anoxic and oxic conditions were examined over a wide range of aging time 0 60 d p nitrophenol p np was used as a redox sensitive probe whereas nalidixic acid na a typical antibiotic found in the natural environment was used as a sorbing compound investigation of the p np reduction in pure water systems showed that nzvi lost 41 and 98 of its reductive activity under anoxic and oxic conditions after 60 d while enhancement of its reactivity was observed after short term aging in gw 1 5 d followed by a further decline this behavior has been ascribed to the formation of secondary fe ii bearing phases including magnetite and green rust resulting from nzvi aging in gw adsorption experiments revealed that gw anoxic aged nzvi samples exhibited a good affinity toward na and a greater na adsorption 27 Âµmol g 1 than that of pristine nzvi 2 Âµmol g 1 at alkaline ph values surface complexation modeling showed that the enhanced adsorption of na onto secondary minerals can be attributed to the fe ii na surface complexation this considerable change in the reductive ability and the adsorption capacity of nzvi arising from groundwater corrosion calls for greater attention to be paid in assessment studies where nzvi is injected for long term remediation in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nzvi aging effect groundwater reactivity secondary minerals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi is one of the most extensively studied nanomaterials of environmental clean up technologies li et al 2017 phenrat et al 2016 wei et al 2010 xia et al 2017 because nzvi is an environmentally safe material with high surface area and great reactivity it has been widely applied in treatments of contaminants including persistent organic compounds joo et al 2004 toxic inorganic contaminants ryu et al 2011 and even radioactive nuclides tsarev et al 2017 despite nzvi having been frequently applied in situ groundwater remediation libralato et al 2017 mueller et al 2012 the remedial performance of nzvi is sensitive to many geochemical factors in groundwater such as organic matter giasuddin et al 2007 zhou et al 2022 cations chen et al 2018 and anions su et al 2012 for instance inhibition of as v and as iii removal by nzvi was reported in the presence of humic acid giasuddin et al 2007 while the presence of cl so4 2 cu2 enhanced the reduction of hexachlorobenzene su et al 2012 groundwater constituents may affect not only the nzvi reactivity but also its fate or mineralogical transformation over long term aging in the natural environment indeed nzvi can be completely or partially oxidized into various fe ii fe iii hydr oxides depending on the groundwater conditions bae et al 2018 in the presence of hco3 the formation of magnetite carbonate green rust iron carbonate hydroxide as aging products of nzvi have been observed xie and cwiertny 2012 whereas the presence of so4 2 enabled the formation of magnetite schwertmannite reinsch et al 2010 further investigations of nzvi aging in synthetic groundwater revealed that magnetite was a major aging product with traces of goethite amakinite under anoxic conditions schÃ¶ftner et al 2015 with lepidocrocite being the only iron phase found after 60 d aging under oxic conditions dong et al 2012 however a comprehensive understanding of short and long term aging effects on nzvi behavior in real groundwater is still limited despite very few investigations adeleye et al 2013 on the long term environmental fate of commercial nzvi in groundwater little is known about the reactivity of the generated secondary iron phases which can further influence interactions with co existing contaminants herein a comprehensive kinetic assessment of reductive and adsorptive capacities of nzvi and aged nzvi in various real groundwater was performed under oxic and anoxic conditions to determine the nzvi reactivity versus corrosion over a wide range of aging time 0 60 d specifically the main aim was to assess the interaction mechanisms of aged nzvi particles with p nitrophenol p np a redox sensitive probe and nalidixic acid na a sorbing antibiotic contaminant in natural systems five different groundwater samples from different places in france were used in this study the reduction of p np by fresh nzvi in pure water pw and the five groundwater samples was first evaluated and the mineral transformation of nzvi particles after the reaction was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem structural and compositional analyses were performed for aging products at the desired aging time under anoxic and oxic conditions and additional reduction experiments were performed to investigate the changes in the reductive activity of nzvi aging products na adsorption on the nzvi aging products was also evaluated as a function of ph and a surface complexation model was developed to describe the impact of surface bound fe ii of aged nzvi samples on na adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials complete information on chemicals used in this study is presented in the supporting

eaton et al 1966 2 3 characterizations of nzvi and aged nzvi particles the aged nzvi was prepared by using nzvi 10 g l 1 suspensions in 15 ml vials containing ddiw or deoxygenated gw1 subsequently the nzvi suspension was placed under ambient air condition oxic aging or in an anaerobic chamber anoxic aging and allowed to age for 1 5 15 30 and 60 d given that the particles settle in the vial with increasing aging time thus potentially reducing the contact time with water the suspensions were vigorously mixed by hand shaking once a day dong et al 2018 the ph variation during aging was monitored using a portable ph meter aged nzvi particles were separated by centrifugation at the desired aging time and dried in a vacuum freeze drier 52 c 24 h for further characterization and experiments xrd bruker d8 advance cu kÎ±1 radiation Î» 1 5406 Ã¥ was used to identify the aging products of nzvi the samples were transferred to sample holders and treated with 1 1 v v glycerol solution to avoid surface oxidation during the xrd analysis bae and lee 2014 the morphological information of aged nzvi particles was obtained by hr tem jem 2100 jeol tokyo japan with selected area electron diffraction saed the dried nzvi aging products were transferred to ethanol solution and sonicated for 30 min finally a drop of the diluted suspension was placed on the copper tem grid and analyzed at an acceleration voltage of 200 kv 2 4 reduction and adsorption experiments experiments to measure the reactivity of fresh nzvi in different waters were carried out in 200 ml flasks in an anaerobic chamber to avoid the effect of dissolved oxygen during the reaction an exact amount 1 ml of 20 mm p np stock solution was transferred to the flask containing 200 ml of filtered groundwater or ddiw followed by stirring at 500 rpm to prepare an initial p np concentration of 0 1 mm then 10 mg of nzvi was introduced into the solution to initiate the reduction of p np by nzvi at each sampling time 1 ml of the sample was taken from the suspension and filtered through a 0 2 Âµm filter whatman for high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis similar procedures were conducted to investigate the reductive activity of aged nzvi particles briefly aged nzvi suspension 10 g l 1 was firstly bath sonicated for 1 h the aged nzvi suspension 1 ml was added to 200 ml of p np solution 0 1 mm then samples were taken at the desired time intervals and analyzed by hplc in contrast to the reduction experiments adsorption batch experiments of nzvi aging products were initiated by transferring 10 mg

performed in triplicate and the data reported here were the average of the three replicated experiments and error bars represent the relative standard deviation 2 5 analytical methods the aqueous

acetonitrile water 50 50 v v containing 0 1 formic acid was prepared and used at the flow rate of 1 ml min 1 in the isocratic mode for the measurement of p np p ap or na the dissolved fe ii concentration was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer u 3310 hitachi hitachi ltd tokyo japan fadrus and malÃ½ 1975 2 6 surface complexation modeling the na adsorption by nzvi aging products at different ph values was described using surface complexation modeling the geochemical speciation code phreeqc and the minteq database were used d l parkhurst and c a j appelo 1999 the pka of na is 6 19 and the logarithm of the formation constant of na fe aq is 3 99 vincent et al 1981 the surface complexation model for iron oxides was used as previously reported and the protonation of fe surface sites was formulated following a 2 pka approach eq 1 and 2 cheng et al 2018 hanna 2007 1 f e o h 2 f e o h h p k a 1 2 f e o h f e o h p k a 2 the charge potential relationship was described according to the constant capacitance model ccm and the modeling parameters are presented in table s2 we adapted the parameters of the three plane model tpm to use the ccm in phreeqc version 2 cheng et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of p np by nzvi suspensions in various groundwater systems the removal kinetics of p np in various water matrices showed that p np was completely removed by nzvi within a 2 h reaction in all experiments under anoxic conditions fig s2 the aqueous concentrations of p ap after the reaction revealed a complete mass balance of the conversion reaction of p np into p ap table s3 indicating the negligible adsorption of p np or p ap on nzvi surfaces in this study the pseudo first order kinetic rate constants kobs min 1 were determined by considering the early stage of kinetics data over 30 min of reaction time fig 1a the highest rate constant was observed in gw2 0 07 min 1 compared to pw and other groundwater systems in contrast to the black color of nzvi in the pw system a change of suspension color to bluish green was observed in the groundwater samples the xrd analysis revealed various corrosion products of nzvi depending on the water matrix fig 1b in pw diffraction peaks were observed at 18 4 30 2 35 5 43 2 53 6 57 2 and 62 8 these peaks can be assigned to maghemite Î³ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 carbonate green rust was detected in all groundwater systems together with calcite in gw3 and gw5 and aragonite in gw4 fig 1b dong et al 2020 kontoyannis and vagenas 2000 the ph and concentration of the main dissolved species including anions and toc in the five groundwater matrices were determined after the reaction table s4 the suspension ph in groundwater systems increased to approximately 9 owing to the anaerobic corrosion of nzvi fe 0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 deng et al 2020 as the distribution of carbonate species is strongly dependent on the ph value fig s3 an increase in co3 2 species is expected which can result in the formation of carbonate bearing minerals e g caco3 and carbonate green rust the precipitation of caco3 occurred mainly in gw3 gw4 and gw5 systems because of the relatively higher initial concentration of calcium 2 44 2 61 mm and bicarbonate 4 2 4 3 mm table s1 indeed a drop in the aqueous concentration of dissolved carbonates was observed especially in gw3 gw4 and gw5 which was comparable to the cl and so4 2 concentrations after the reaction table s4 up to 88 of the initial no3 concentration was eliminated in groundwater samples after the reaction likely because of the reductive removal of no3 by nzvi hwang et al 2011 su et al 2014 for silicate concentration up to 90 loss was detected after the reaction probably due to its strong binding affinity toward iron minerals kanematsu et al 2018 however no significant change in total organic carbon toc was observed before and after reaction with nzvi table s4 in contrast the nzvi corrosion products particularly fe ii containing minerals could further contribute to the reduction of p np indeed previous studies have reported the greater reductive ability of green rust than that of magnetite digiacomo et al 2020 usman et al 2018 an independent set of experiments using synthetic fe minerals confirmed that carbonate green rust led to 43 of p np removal in 5 h whereas only 8 of p np was removed by magnetite and almost no removal of p np by fe iii oxyhydroxides was observed fig s4 therefore the carbonate green rust generated in nzvi groundwater suspensions could additionally reduce p np other groundwater constituents such as nitrate and silicate may decrease the p np reduction efficiency owing to the inhibitory effects caused by the competitive reduction reaction of nitrate with p np alowitz and scherer 2002 westerhoff and james 2003 and the blocking of the reactive sites by silicate meng et al 2002 this may explain why the highest rate constant for p np reduction was observed for gw2 which contained a lower nitrate concentration nevertheless to avoid the formation of caco3 phases which could potentially interfere with the nzvi aging process gw1 was selected and used for the kinetic assessment reduction and adsorption of aged samples 3 2 effects of nzvi aging products on the reduction of p np kinetics of removal of p np by different aged nzvi particles were monitored to check the impact of aging time on the overall reduction ability of nzvi suspension fig s5 for pw systems kobs values continuously decreased as the aging time increased under both anoxic and oxic conditions fig 2 almost 50 of p np was reduced into p ap in the 60 d aging sample under anoxic conditions while no reduction was observed for the 60 d aged samples under oxic conditions fig s5 a bell shaped curve was observed for kobs variation with aging time for gw1 aged nzvi i e kobs values increased over the early stage of aging 0 5 d and then decreased with further aging in particular the reductive ability of nzvi in groundwater reached a maximum after 5 d aging which was much higher 1 8 times than that of the fresh materials in general the samples of anoxic aged nzvi showed better p np reduction than that of the oxic aged nzvi similar trend of nzvi reactivity against aging time in simulated groundwater under anoxic conditions has been previously reported xiao et al 2022 this behavior could be explained by the preservation of fresh nzvi and or the occurrence of more reactive fe phases under anoxic conditions in order to assess the phase transformation of nzvi in pw and gw1 systems xrd analyses of secondary iron minerals were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions fig 3 the abundance of the Î± fe phase decreased gradually for all the samples for pw anoxic aged nzvi the xrd peaks of fe 0 remained until 5 d and magnetite maghemite was detected as the main aging product fig 3a while the disappearance of the fe 0 peak coupled with the appearance of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite was observed in the 5 d aged sample of pw oxic aged nzvi fig 3c in contrast peaks of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite were detected in gw1 anoxic aged nzvi with the disappearance of fe 0 observed at longer aging times fig 3b in gw1 oxic aged nzvi an increase in peaks of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite was observed at only 1 d of aging fig 3d then a significant increase in fe iii oxyhydroxides lepidocrocite and or goethite with a decrease in peaks of carbonate green rust at 60 d was observed suggesting the conversion of carbonate green rust into lepidocrocite and or goethite under oxic conditions legrand et al 2004 schwertmann and fechter 1994 more details about the changes in solution chemistry and ph values of nzvi suspensions along the aging process are given in the si fig s6 collectively these results showed that nzvi gradually lost its reactivity under both anoxic and oxic conditions in the pw system probably due to the consumption of fe 0 and accumulation of an oxyhydroxide layer coating the nzvi surface in groundwater systems though an initial enhancement of p np removal was observed over a short aging time 1 5 d a decline was observed at later aging times the greater reduction ability of carbonate green rust compared to that of magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite or goethite see fig s4 may explain the higher kobs values observed in groundwater systems over the initial aging period previous work has also shown that the breakdown of the iron oxide shell coating of the zvi may occur during the early stage of aging thereby allowing better access to the core fe 0 xie and cwiertny 2012 furthermore as previously reported the divalent cationic metal contained in groundwater may bind to surface coatings and induce surface oxide layer dissolution or nzvi depassivation liu et al 2014 3 3 effects of nzvi aging products on the adsorption of nalidixic acid na adsorption to differently aged nzvi particles was investigated over a wide ph range 5 12 fig 4 the na adsorption of nzvi aging products generally increased with increasing aging time especially under acidic neutral conditions however a different scenario of na adsorption was observed for groundwater aged nzvi samples na adsorption by gw1 anoxic aged nzvi decreased sharply as the ph increased but the adsorption envelope exhibited a bell shaped curve with increasing aging time in contrast gw1 oxic aged nzvi exhibited an inversed s shaped adsorption curve considering the different binding affinity of na to different iron minerals cheng et al 2018 xu et al 2017b this adsorption behavior by aged nzvi could be attributed to the change in mineral composition of nzvi aging products the adsorption capacity of individual fe oxyhydroxides including magnetite maghemite carbonate green rust lepidocrocite and goethite were evaluated over the same ph range 5 12 fig s7 a negligible amount of na was adsorbed by fresh nzvi whereas fe hydro oxides exhibited significant na adsorption capacity especially in acidic to neutral ph under alkaline conditions green rust exhibited better na adsorption performance when the adsorbed amount was normalized to mass and not surface area than magnetite however a quantitative comparison of adsorption capacities must be made with caution since these synthetic minerals have different properties including crystallinity specific surface area and surface charge according to the shape of the na adsorption envelope fig s7 more adsorption at circumneutral ph was observed with fe ii fe iii mixed valent minerals e g magnetite and carbonate green rust while fe iii bearing minerals e g lepidocrocite goethite and maghemite exhibited an s shaped curve or downward trend generally organic ligands binding to metal oxides show maximum adsorption at a ph near the pka value 6 19 for na indeed previous reports showed typical na adsorption by fe oxides with maximum na adsorption at ph around 6 robberson et al 2006 xu et al 2017b however the ph adsorption curve of na shifted to larger ph values in the case of magnetite and green rust probably because of the presence of released fe ii in solution as previously observed for magnetite the addition of dissolved fe ii in suspension increased the na adsorption at neutral to alkaline ph values cheng et al 2018 here fe ii release during na adsorption was monitored for the 60 d aged sample and presented in fig s8 ferrous ion release was detected in all cases at ph 5 and 7 and became negligible at ph above 9 interestingly the ph dependence of na adsorption is fully consistent with that of dissolved fe ii concentration for instance a high dissolved fe ii amount was observed for anoxic aged nzvi samples which exhibited greater adsorption performance even at high ph values pw oxic aged nzvi samples showed more na adsorption than gw oxic aged nzvi under alkaline conditions this correlation suggests that the amount of dissolved fe ii or the mineral bound fe ii plays a key role in na adsorption behavior onto nzvi secondary phases 3 4 surface complexation modeling for nalidixic acid binding onto the 60 d aged sample first determining the mineral composition of the aged samples is a prerequisite to describing the na binding to secondary iron phases in this study the most aged sample 60 d was selected to determine the proportion of identified secondary minerals see table s5 almost 100 of the magnetite maghemite phase was present in pw anoxic aged nzvi while gw1 anoxic aged nzvi contained approximately 55 of magnetite maghemite 10 of goethite and 35 of carbonate green rust for pw oxic aged nzvi magnetite maghemite was the main aging product 86 with 14 of carbonate green rust while gw1 oxic aged nzvi contained various fe mineral phases magnetite maghemite 55 goethite 8 carbonate green rust 7 and lepidocrocite 30 hr tem images confirmed that the initial chain like aggregated structures and large sized spherical aggregates approximately 200 nm of nzvi fig s1 were transformed into magnetite maghemite after 60 d of aging in a pw anoxic system fig 5a in gw1 anoxic aged nzvi samples the particle size of magnetite maghemite decreased significantly approximately 5 nm and magnetite maghemite seemed to be attached to the surface of the hexagonal shape of carbonate green rust fig 5b under oxic conditions carbonate green rust was observed in both pw and gw1 aged products figs 5c d particularly the co existence of magnetite with carbonate green rust was detected in pw oxic aged nzvi samples while needle shaped particles of lepidocrocite were observed in gw1 oxic aged nzvi all the saed patterns of specific fe mineral phases in fig 5 are also provided in fig 6 which shows the typical patterns of each mineral araÃºjo neto et al 2014 gÃ©nin et al 2005 krystofiak et al 2013 liao et al 2020 to describe the mechanism underlying na adsorption onto the 60 d aged sample we applied a surface complexation model we assumed that na binds to two surface hydroxy groups by involving its carboxylate and its keto group as follows cheng et al 2018 3 only the predominant phases were taken into consideration and the mixed valent iron minerals i e magnetite and green rust were supposed to exhibit similar behavior with respect to na adsorption consequently the magnetite parameters were used in the adsorption model in pw anoxic aged nzvi gw1 anoxic aged nzvi and pw oxic aged nzvi samples in the case of gw1 oxic aged nzvi the dominant phases were maghemite and lepidocrocite na adsorption to maghemite or lepidocrocite was first calculated and all modeling parameters are shown in table s2 the complexation of na fe ii was accounted for by using dissolved fe ii concentration as input parameters in this model the model satisfactorily predicted the ph dependence of na adsorption to aged nzvi but overestimated the na adsorption at ph 5 in the anoxic aged nzvi system fig 7 this may be ascribed to the higher amount of dissolved fe ii under acidic conditions see fig s8 which can affect na fe ii complexation in solution and thus ternary surface complexation i e surface metal ligand complex cheng et al 2018 we also simplified the model by considering only the predominant phase of mixed valence oxides magnetite in anoxic aged nzvi samples despite the co existence of green rust nevertheless the good accuracy of the experimental and modeling data at neutral and alkaline ph confirms the key role of surface bound fe ii in the adsorption of na in summary aged nzvi samples showed a good capacity for na adsorption which increased with aging time the high na adsorption onto nzvi products at neutral to alkaline ph can be ascribed to the surface bound fe ii in the secondary phases 4 conclusions we investigated the aging and reactivity of nzvi in various groundwater systems first the nature of secondary iron phases resulting from nzvi aging in groundwater is strongly dependent on the groundwater composition the final products of nzvi after reaction were mainly magnetite in pure water system while green rust was predominant in groundwater systems with the aging process up to 60 d nzvi continuously lost its reductive activity in the pw system however in the groundwater this reductive ability was first enhanced in the short term 1 5 d and then declined at longer aging times adsorption tests revealed higher na binding to nzvi aging products 30 Âµmol g at ph 7 while na uptake by fresh nzvi was negligible notably the adsorption capacity of na generally increased with aging time with unexpected greater adsorption at neutral to alkaline ph values additional experiments and surface complexation modeling suggested that this strong adsorption at alkaline

15262,in this study changes in the reactivity of nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi in five different groundwater gw systems under anoxic and oxic conditions were examined over a wide range of aging time 0 60 d p nitrophenol p np was used as a redox sensitive probe whereas nalidixic acid na a typical antibiotic found in the natural environment was used as a sorbing compound investigation of the p np reduction in pure water systems showed that nzvi lost 41 and 98 of its reductive activity under anoxic and oxic conditions after 60 d while enhancement of its reactivity was observed after short term aging in gw 1 5 d followed by a further decline this behavior has been ascribed to the formation of secondary fe ii bearing phases including magnetite and green rust resulting from nzvi aging in gw adsorption experiments revealed that gw anoxic aged nzvi samples exhibited a good affinity toward na and a greater na adsorption 27 Âµmol g 1 than that of pristine nzvi 2 Âµmol g 1 at alkaline ph values surface complexation modeling showed that the enhanced adsorption of na onto secondary minerals can be attributed to the fe ii na surface complexation this considerable change in the reductive ability and the adsorption capacity of nzvi arising from groundwater corrosion calls for greater attention to be paid in assessment studies where nzvi is injected for long term remediation in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nzvi aging effect groundwater reactivity secondary minerals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi is one of the most extensively studied nanomaterials of environmental clean up technologies li et al 2017 phenrat et al 2016 wei et al 2010 xia et al 2017 because nzvi is an environmentally safe material with high surface area and great reactivity it has been widely applied in treatments of contaminants including persistent organic compounds joo et al 2004 toxic inorganic contaminants ryu et al 2011 and even radioactive nuclides tsarev et al 2017 despite nzvi having been frequently applied in situ groundwater remediation libralato et al 2017 mueller et al 2012 the remedial performance of nzvi is sensitive to many geochemical factors in groundwater such as organic matter giasuddin et al 2007 zhou et al 2022 cations chen et al 2018 and anions su et al 2012 for instance inhibition of as v and as iii removal by nzvi was reported in the presence of humic acid giasuddin et al 2007 while the presence of cl so4 2 cu2 enhanced the reduction of hexachlorobenzene su et al 2012 groundwater constituents may affect not only the nzvi reactivity but also its fate or mineralogical transformation over long term aging in the natural environment indeed nzvi can be completely or partially oxidized into various fe ii fe iii hydr oxides depending on the groundwater conditions bae et al 2018 in the presence of hco3 the formation of magnetite carbonate green rust iron carbonate hydroxide as aging products of nzvi have been observed xie and cwiertny 2012 whereas the presence of so4 2 enabled the formation of magnetite schwertmannite reinsch et al 2010 further investigations of nzvi aging in synthetic groundwater revealed that magnetite was a major aging product with traces of goethite amakinite under anoxic conditions schÃ¶ftner et al 2015 with lepidocrocite being the only iron phase found after 60 d aging under oxic conditions dong et al 2012 however a comprehensive understanding of short and long term aging effects on nzvi behavior in real groundwater is still limited despite very few investigations adeleye et al 2013 on the long term environmental fate of commercial nzvi in groundwater little is known about the reactivity of the generated secondary iron phases which can further influence interactions with co existing contaminants herein a comprehensive kinetic assessment of reductive and adsorptive capacities of nzvi and aged nzvi in various real groundwater was performed under oxic and anoxic conditions to determine the nzvi reactivity versus corrosion over a wide range of aging time 0 60 d specifically the main aim was to assess the interaction mechanisms of aged nzvi particles with p nitrophenol p np a redox sensitive probe and nalidixic acid na a sorbing antibiotic contaminant in natural systems five different groundwater samples from different places in france were used in this study the reduction of p np by fresh nzvi in pure water pw and the five groundwater samples was first evaluated and the mineral transformation of nzvi particles after the reaction was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem structural and compositional analyses were performed for aging products at the desired aging time under anoxic and oxic conditions and additional reduction experiments were performed to investigate the changes in the reductive activity of nzvi aging products na adsorption on the nzvi aging products was also evaluated as a function of ph and a surface complexation model was developed to describe the impact of surface bound fe ii of aged nzvi samples on na adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials complete information on chemicals used in this study is presented in the supporting

eaton et al 1966 2 3 characterizations of nzvi and aged nzvi particles the aged nzvi was prepared by using nzvi 10 g l 1 suspensions in 15 ml vials containing ddiw or deoxygenated gw1 subsequently the nzvi suspension was placed under ambient air condition oxic aging or in an anaerobic chamber anoxic aging and allowed to age for 1 5 15 30 and 60 d given that the particles settle in the vial with increasing aging time thus potentially reducing the contact time with water the suspensions were vigorously mixed by hand shaking once a day dong et al 2018 the ph variation during aging was monitored using a portable ph meter aged nzvi particles were separated by centrifugation at the desired aging time and dried in a vacuum freeze drier 52 c 24 h for further characterization and experiments xrd bruker d8 advance cu kÎ±1 radiation Î» 1 5406 Ã¥ was used to identify the aging products of nzvi the samples were transferred to sample holders and treated with 1 1 v v glycerol solution to avoid

saed the dried nzvi aging products were transferred to ethanol solution and sonicated for 30 min finally a drop of the diluted suspension was placed on the copper tem grid and analyzed at an acceleration voltage of 200 kv 2 4 reduction and adsorption experiments experiments to measure the reactivity of fresh nzvi in different waters were carried out in 200 ml flasks in an anaerobic chamber to avoid the effect of dissolved oxygen during the reaction an exact amount 1 ml of 20 mm p np stock solution was transferred to the flask containing 200 ml of filtered groundwater or ddiw followed by stirring at 500 rpm to prepare an initial p np concentration of 0 1 mm then 10 mg of nzvi was introduced into the solution to initiate the reduction of p np by nzvi at each sampling time 1 ml of the sample was taken from the suspension and filtered through a 0 2 Âµm filter whatman for high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis similar procedures were conducted to investigate the reductive activity of aged nzvi particles briefly aged nzvi suspension 10 g l 1 was firstly bath sonicated for 1 h the aged nzvi suspension 1 ml was added to 200 ml of p np solution 0 1 mm then samples were taken at the desired time intervals and analyzed by hplc in contrast to the reduction experiments adsorption batch experiments of nzvi aging products were initiated by transferring 10 mg

filtered 0 2 Î¼m whatman to measure na and dissolved fe ii to investigate the role of each mineral phase on the reactivity of aged nzvi additional reduction and adsorption assessments of iron

performed in triplicate and the data reported here were the average of the three replicated experiments and error bars represent the relative standard deviation 2 5 analytical methods the aqueous

reversed phase c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm i d 5 Î¼m the uv detector was set to 273 317 and 258 nm for p np p ap and na analyses respectively bae et al 2016 xu et al 2017c the mobile phase mixture of acetonitrile water 50 50 v v containing 0 1 formic acid was prepared and used at the flow rate of 1 ml min 1 in the isocratic mode for the measurement of p np p ap or na the dissolved fe ii

complexation modeling the na adsorption by nzvi aging products at different ph values was described using surface complexation modeling the geochemical speciation code phreeqc and the minteq database were used d l parkhurst and c a j appelo 1999 the pka of na is 6 19 and the logarithm of the formation constant of na fe aq is 3 99 vincent et al 1981 the surface complexation model for iron oxides was used as previously reported and the protonation of fe surface sites was formulated following a 2 pka approach eq 1 and 2 cheng et al 2018 hanna 2007 1 f e o h 2 f e o h h p k a 1 2 f e o h f e o h p k a 2 the charge potential relationship was described according to the constant capacitance model ccm and the modeling parameters are presented in table s2 we adapted the parameters of the three plane model tpm to use the ccm in phreeqc version 2 cheng et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of p np by nzvi suspensions in various groundwater systems the removal kinetics of p np in various water matrices showed that p np was completely removed by nzvi within a 2 h reaction in all experiments under anoxic conditions fig s2 the aqueous concentrations of p ap after the reaction revealed a complete mass balance of the conversion reaction of p np into p ap table s3 indicating the negligible adsorption of p np or p ap on nzvi surfaces in this study the pseudo first order kinetic rate constants kobs min 1 were determined by considering the early stage of kinetics data over 30 min of reaction time fig 1a the highest rate constant was observed in gw2 0 07 min 1 compared to pw and other groundwater systems in contrast to the black color of nzvi in the pw system a change of suspension color to bluish green was observed in the groundwater samples the xrd analysis revealed various corrosion products of nzvi depending on the water matrix fig 1b in pw diffraction peaks were observed at 18 4 30 2 35 5 43 2 53 6 57 2 and 62 8 these peaks can be assigned to maghemite Î³ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 carbonate green rust was detected in all groundwater systems together with calcite in gw3 and gw5 and aragonite in gw4 fig 1b dong et al 2020 kontoyannis and vagenas 2000 the ph and concentration of the main dissolved species including anions and toc in the five groundwater matrices were determined after the reaction table s4 the suspension ph in groundwater systems increased to approximately 9 owing to the anaerobic corrosion of nzvi fe 0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 deng et al 2020 as the distribution of carbonate species is strongly dependent on the ph value fig s3 an increase in co3 2 species is expected which can result in the formation of carbonate bearing minerals e g caco3 and carbonate green rust the precipitation of caco3 occurred mainly in gw3 gw4 and gw5 systems because of the relatively higher initial concentration of calcium 2 44 2 61 mm and bicarbonate 4 2 4 3 mm table s1 indeed a drop in the aqueous concentration of dissolved carbonates was observed especially in gw3 gw4 and gw5 which was comparable to the cl and so4 2 concentrations after the reaction table s4 up to 88 of the initial no3 concentration was eliminated in groundwater samples after the reaction likely because of the reductive removal of no3 by nzvi hwang et al 2011 su et al 2014 for silicate concentration up to 90 loss was detected after the reaction probably due to its strong binding affinity toward iron minerals kanematsu et al 2018 however no significant change in total organic carbon toc was observed before and after reaction with nzvi table s4 in contrast the nzvi corrosion products particularly fe ii containing minerals could further contribute to the reduction of p np indeed previous studies have reported the greater reductive ability of green rust than that of magnetite digiacomo et al 2020 usman et al 2018 an independent set of experiments using synthetic fe minerals confirmed that carbonate green rust led to 43 of p np removal in 5 h whereas only 8 of p np was removed by magnetite and almost no removal of p np by fe iii oxyhydroxides was observed fig s4 therefore the carbonate green rust generated in nzvi groundwater suspensions could additionally reduce p np other groundwater constituents such as nitrate and silicate may decrease the p np reduction efficiency owing to the inhibitory effects caused by the competitive reduction reaction of nitrate with p np alowitz and scherer 2002 westerhoff and james 2003 and the blocking of the reactive sites by silicate meng et al 2002 this may explain why the highest rate constant for p np reduction was observed for gw2 which contained a lower nitrate concentration nevertheless to avoid the formation of caco3 phases which could potentially interfere with the nzvi aging process gw1 was selected and used for the kinetic assessment reduction and adsorption of aged samples 3 2 effects of nzvi aging products on the reduction of p np kinetics of removal of p np by different aged nzvi particles were monitored to check the impact of aging time on the overall reduction ability of nzvi suspension fig s5 for pw systems kobs values continuously decreased as the aging time increased under both anoxic and oxic conditions fig 2 almost 50 of p np was reduced into p ap in the 60 d aging sample under anoxic conditions while no reduction was observed for the 60 d aged samples under oxic conditions fig s5 a bell shaped curve was observed for kobs variation with aging time for gw1 aged nzvi i e kobs values increased over the early stage of aging 0 5 d and then decreased with further aging in particular the reductive ability of nzvi in groundwater reached a maximum after 5 d aging which was much higher 1 8 times than that of the fresh materials in general the samples of anoxic aged nzvi showed better p np reduction than that of the oxic aged nzvi similar trend of nzvi reactivity against aging time in simulated groundwater under anoxic conditions has been previously reported xiao et al 2022 this behavior could be explained by the preservation of fresh nzvi and or the occurrence of more reactive fe phases under anoxic conditions in order to assess the phase transformation of nzvi in pw and gw1 systems xrd analyses of secondary iron minerals were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions fig 3 the abundance of the Î± fe phase decreased gradually for all the samples for pw anoxic aged nzvi the xrd peaks of fe 0 remained until 5 d and magnetite maghemite was detected as the main aging product fig 3a while the disappearance of the fe 0 peak coupled with the appearance of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite was observed in the 5 d aged sample of pw oxic aged nzvi fig 3c in contrast peaks of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite were detected in gw1 anoxic aged nzvi with the disappearance of fe 0 observed at longer aging times fig 3b in gw1 oxic aged nzvi an increase in peaks of carbonate green rust and magnetite maghemite was observed at only 1 d of aging fig 3d then a significant increase in fe iii oxyhydroxides lepidocrocite and or goethite with a decrease in peaks of carbonate green rust at 60 d was observed suggesting the conversion of carbonate green rust into lepidocrocite and or goethite under oxic conditions legrand et al 2004 schwertmann and fechter 1994 more details about the changes in solution chemistry and ph values of nzvi suspensions along the aging process are given in the si fig s6 collectively these results showed that nzvi gradually lost its reactivity under both anoxic and oxic conditions in the pw system probably due to the consumption of fe 0 and accumulation of an oxyhydroxide layer coating the nzvi surface in groundwater systems though an initial enhancement of p np removal was observed over a short aging time 1 5 d a decline was observed at later aging times the greater reduction ability of carbonate green rust compared to that of magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite or goethite see fig s4 may explain the higher kobs values observed in groundwater systems over the initial aging period previous work has also shown that the breakdown of the iron oxide shell coating of the zvi may occur during the early stage of aging thereby allowing better access to the core fe 0 xie and cwiertny 2012 furthermore as previously reported the divalent cationic metal contained in groundwater may bind to surface coatings and induce surface oxide layer dissolution or nzvi depassivation liu et al 2014 3 3 effects of nzvi aging products on the adsorption of nalidixic acid na adsorption to differently aged nzvi particles was investigated over a wide ph range 5 12 fig 4 the na adsorption of nzvi aging products generally increased with increasing aging time especially under acidic neutral conditions however a different scenario of na adsorption was observed for groundwater aged nzvi samples na adsorption by gw1 anoxic aged nzvi decreased sharply as the ph increased but the adsorption envelope exhibited a bell shaped curve with increasing aging time in contrast gw1 oxic aged nzvi exhibited an inversed s shaped adsorption curve considering the different binding affinity of na to different iron minerals cheng et al 2018 xu et al 2017b this adsorption behavior by aged nzvi could be attributed to the change in mineral composition of nzvi aging products the adsorption capacity of individual fe oxyhydroxides including magnetite maghemite carbonate green rust lepidocrocite and goethite were evaluated over the same ph range 5 12 fig s7 a negligible amount of na was adsorbed by fresh nzvi whereas fe hydro oxides exhibited significant na adsorption capacity especially in acidic to neutral ph under alkaline conditions green rust exhibited better na adsorption performance when the adsorbed amount was normalized to mass and not surface area than magnetite however a quantitative comparison of adsorption capacities must be made with caution since these synthetic minerals have different properties including crystallinity specific surface area and surface charge according to the shape of the na adsorption envelope fig s7 more adsorption at circumneutral ph was observed with fe ii fe iii mixed valent minerals e g magnetite and carbonate green rust while fe iii bearing minerals e g lepidocrocite goethite and maghemite exhibited an s shaped curve or downward trend generally organic ligands binding to metal oxides show maximum adsorption at a ph near the pka value 6 19 for na indeed previous reports showed typical na adsorption by fe oxides with maximum na adsorption at ph around 6 robberson et al 2006 xu et al 2017b however the ph adsorption curve of na shifted to larger ph values in the case of magnetite and green rust probably because of the presence of released fe ii in solution as previously observed for magnetite the addition of dissolved fe ii in suspension increased the na adsorption at neutral to alkaline ph values cheng et al 2018 here fe ii release during na adsorption was monitored for the 60 d aged sample and presented in fig s8 ferrous ion release was detected in all cases at ph 5 and 7 and became negligible at ph above 9 interestingly the ph dependence of na adsorption is fully consistent with that of dissolved fe ii concentration for instance a high dissolved fe ii amount was observed for anoxic aged nzvi samples which exhibited greater adsorption performance even at high ph values pw oxic aged nzvi samples showed more na adsorption than gw oxic aged nzvi under alkaline conditions this correlation suggests that the amount of dissolved fe ii or the mineral bound fe ii plays a key role in na adsorption behavior onto nzvi secondary phases 3 4 surface complexation modeling for nalidixic acid binding onto the 60 d aged sample first determining the mineral composition of the aged samples is a prerequisite to describing the na binding to secondary iron phases in this study the most aged sample 60 d was selected to determine the proportion of identified secondary minerals see table s5 almost 100 of the magnetite maghemite phase was present in pw anoxic aged nzvi while gw1 anoxic aged nzvi contained approximately 55 of magnetite maghemite 10 of goethite and 35 of carbonate green rust for pw oxic aged nzvi magnetite maghemite was the main aging product 86 with 14 of carbonate green rust while gw1 oxic aged nzvi contained various fe mineral phases magnetite maghemite 55 goethite 8 carbonate green rust 7 and lepidocrocite 30 hr tem images confirmed that the initial chain like aggregated structures and large sized spherical aggregates approximately 200 nm of nzvi fig s1 were transformed into magnetite maghemite after 60 d of aging in a pw anoxic system fig 5a in gw1 anoxic aged nzvi samples the particle size of magnetite maghemite decreased significantly approximately 5 nm and magnetite maghemite seemed to be attached to the surface of the hexagonal shape of carbonate green rust fig 5b under oxic conditions carbonate green rust was observed in both pw and gw1 aged products figs 5c d particularly the co existence of magnetite with carbonate green rust was detected in pw oxic aged nzvi samples while needle shaped particles of lepidocrocite were observed in gw1 oxic aged nzvi all the saed patterns of specific fe mineral phases in fig 5 are also provided in fig 6 which shows the typical patterns of each mineral araÃºjo neto et al 2014 gÃ©nin et al 2005 krystofiak et al 2013 liao et al 2020 to describe the mechanism underlying na adsorption onto the 60 d aged sample we applied a surface complexation model we assumed that na binds to two surface hydroxy groups by involving its carboxylate and its keto group as follows cheng et al 2018 3 only the predominant phases were taken into consideration and the mixed valent iron minerals i e magnetite and green rust were supposed to exhibit similar behavior with respect to na adsorption consequently the magnetite parameters were used in the adsorption model in pw anoxic aged nzvi gw1 anoxic aged nzvi and pw oxic aged nzvi samples in the case of gw1 oxic aged nzvi the dominant phases were maghemite and lepidocrocite na adsorption to maghemite or lepidocrocite was first calculated and all modeling parameters are shown in table s2 the complexation of na fe ii was accounted for by using dissolved fe ii concentration as input parameters in this model the model satisfactorily predicted the ph dependence of na adsorption to aged nzvi but overestimated the na adsorption at ph 5 in the anoxic aged nzvi system fig 7 this may be ascribed to the higher amount of dissolved fe ii under acidic conditions see fig s8 which can affect na fe ii complexation in solution and thus ternary surface complexation i e surface metal ligand complex cheng et al 2018 we also simplified the model by considering only the predominant phase of mixed valence oxides magnetite in anoxic aged nzvi samples despite the co existence of green rust nevertheless the good accuracy of the experimental and modeling data at neutral and alkaline ph confirms the key role of surface bound fe ii in the adsorption of na in summary aged nzvi samples showed a good capacity for na adsorption which increased with aging time the high na adsorption onto nzvi products at neutral to alkaline ph can be ascribed to the surface bound fe ii in the secondary phases 4 conclusions we investigated the aging and reactivity of nzvi in various groundwater systems first the nature of secondary iron phases resulting from nzvi aging in groundwater is strongly dependent on the groundwater composition the final products of nzvi after reaction were mainly magnetite in pure water system while green rust was predominant in groundwater systems with the aging process up to 60 d nzvi continuously lost its reductive activity in the pw system however in the groundwater this reductive ability was first enhanced in the short term 1 5 d and then declined at longer aging times adsorption tests revealed higher na binding to nzvi aging products 30 Âµmol g at ph 7 while na uptake by fresh nzvi was negligible notably the adsorption capacity of na generally increased with aging time with unexpected greater adsorption at neutral to alkaline ph values additional experiments and surface complexation modeling suggested that this strong adsorption at alkaline conditions can be attributed to the surface bound fe ii these results shed light on an overlooked aspect of interactions of environmental compounds with the secondary fe minerals resulting from nzvi corrosion in groundwater our findings will also help to predict the fate of nzvi in groundwater and the impact of the secondary fe minerals on the mobility and transformation of contaminants in soil

15263,municipal wastewater treatment which is associated with high energy consumption and excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions has been facing severe challenges toward carbon emissions in this study a high rate activated sludge two stage vertical up flow constructed wetland hras tvucw system was developed to reduce carbon emissions during municipal wastewater treatment through carbon management optimized mass and energy flows were achieved resulting in high treatment efficiency and low operational energy consumption the carbon emission of the hras tvucw system i e 0 21 kg carbon dioxide

carbon neutrality to 40 2 4 6 folds higher than that of the a2o process results of functional microbial community analysis at the genus level revealed that the controlled dissolved oxygen allocation led to distinctive microbial communities in each unit of hras tvucw system which facilitated denitrification efficiency increase and carbon emissions reduction overall the hras tvucw system could be

2015 kinyua et al 2017 it was reported that the carbon captured through excess sludge in hras process was 2 3 times higher than that of a2o process subsequently mitigated the mineralization of organic carbon in wastewater jimenez et al 2015 sancho et al 2019 however the low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio effluent from hras process caused by its high efficiency of cod recovery and poor nitrogen removal performance cao et al 2020 would result in large amounts of ghg release when being treated with conventional cws mainly due to insufficient electron donors hao et al 2016 therefore optimized carbon flow and oxygen supply are required to enhance nutrient removal and mitigate ghg emissions the integrated cw mode which could form an aerobic anoxic functional zone and promote nitrification denitrification with low energy consumption is regarded as a potential strategy zhao et al 2018 therefore to achieve high nutrient removal and carbon emissions reduction simultaneously the present study developed a system that couples hras with a two stage vertical up flow cw hras tvucw using intermittent aeration and backflow the performance of hras tvucw system was thoroughly investigated from the point of water quality energy recovery and ghg emissions i e water energy ghg nexus furthermore the microbial mechanisms of carbon emissions reduction in the hras tvucw system were also elucidated this study would shed new light on possible process configuration for achieving low carbon wastewater treatment without compromising effluent quality through coupled biological ecological process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental system configuration as shown in fig 1 a lab scale hras tvucw system was constructed at shandong university qingdao china 36 21 n 120 41 e the system consisted of a hras module followed by a tvucw module the hras module consisted of an aeration reactor and a settling tank with effective volumes of 3 5 l and 5 3 l respectively the tvucw module consisted of two equal wetland cells 40 cm in diameter and 110 cm in depth and each with effective volume of 42 l the forward wetland cell and the back wetland cell were named as cw f and cw b respectively both wetland cells had a 10 cm bottom layer of coarse gravel 25 30 mm in diameter to yield uniform diffusion of supplementary oxygen an 80 cm middle layer of biological ceramsite 4 8 mm in diameter as the main substrate and a 10 cm top layer of silica sand 1 2 mm in diameter to facilitate wastewater dispersion and support plant growth a vertical perforated pvc pipe was inserted into the substrate to measure the physical and chemical parameters in situ calami acorus calamus l a locally available plant of similar sizes with approximate height of 10 cm were transplanted into each wetland cell of tvucw module after cultivation in 10 hoagland solution for 2 weeks 2 2 experimental procedure actual municipal wastewater was collected from the reclaimed wastewater treatment plant at shandong university campus daily and used as the influent in this study table s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the hras module was maintained at 2 5 h and the aeration reactor was operated under an hrt of 1 h air compressors equipped with a do controller were used in the hras module to continuously supply air at a rate of 0 15 l min to maintain do concentration in the range of 0 5 1 0 mg l a magnetic stirrer was mounted to keep the sludge in suspension and uniform distribution of oxygen the solids retention time srt was approximately controlled at 1 d by discharging the excess sludge and the returned sludge ratio was set at 100 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was maintained at 2800 3200 mg l each wetland cell of the tvucw module was operated in continuous up flow at an hrt of 1 d the cw f was operated without aeration while the cw b was operated under intermittent aeration within an interval time of 2 h a single intermittent aeration cycle included an aeration stage for 10 min at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min and without aeration stage for 110 min in order to improve effluent water quality effluent of cw b was pumped into cw f at a backflow ratio of 100 al wahaibi et al 2021 2 3 sampling and analytical methods 2 3 1 water sampling and analyses the influent and effluent samples of both the hras module and the tvucw module were taken every two days to measure the concentration of cod nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp according to the standard methods apha 2012 the different fractions of cod including particulate cod pcod colloidal cod ccod and soluble cod scod were determined as per cao et al 2020 the do concentration in the hras tvucw system was monitored using hq40d portable meter hach usa 2 3 2 gas sampling and measurement the direct release rates of ghg including n2o methane ch4 and co2 from the hras tvucw system were measured weekly by gas chromatography equipped with thermal conductivity detector gc tcd 7890b agilent usa after relatively stable effluent quality was achieved zhang et al 2018 in each sampling process an aspirator pump was used to transfer the emitted gas into gas bags pv 500 ml delin china the released gas of the hras module was sampled from the aeration reactor and the volume of ghg emitted from the settling tank was regarded as negligible the release rates of ghg in the hras module and the tvucw module during the aeration phase were calculated based on the average concentration of ghg using a modified equation from zhang et al 2018 the release rate of ghg from the tvucw module with a nonaerated phase was calculated by means of a linear increase in the sampling period according to the equation described by jones et al 2011 the quantity of ammonia volatilization was determined as per wu et al 2013b 2 3 3 sampling and analysis of sludge plant and substrate excess sludge samples were collected from the settling tank of the hras module in order to compare it with the conventional wastewater treatment process the secondary sludge samples were collected from the reclaimed wastewater treatment plant of the shandong university campus qingdao china which was operated under the a2o process since september 2016 table s2 the mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss of excess sludge were determined twice a week the biochemical methane potential bmp test was carried out to determine the amount of ch4 produced from the excess sludge throughout the anaerobic digestion according to xiong et al 2019 the carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p contents of excess sludge were determined according to rahman et al 2019 the total extracellular polymeric substances eps concentration of sludge samples was determined using the modified heat extraction method proposed by kinyua et al 2017 the specific surface area of excess sludge was detected by n2 adsorption at 196 c using a sorptometer yin et al 2017 plant samples were taken from each wetland cell of the tvucw module at the beginning and end of the experiment the harvested plants were dried to estimate dry weight after rinsing with distilled water and then pulverized for tn and tp analysis ji et al 2021 substrate samples were taken from each wetland cell of tvucw module at different heights of substrate layer i e 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm and mixed as one composite sample then the substrate samples were well mixed air dried and crushed before performing tn and tp analysis wu et al 2013a all tn and tp content analyses of plant and substrate samples were conducted with a 3 aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe germany the carbon content of plant and substrate samples was measured by the dichromate digestion titration method song et al 2012 2 4 mass balance in this study it was hypothesized that the average mass inputs c n and p to the system were equal to the average mass outputs and an mass balance model was used to clearly quantify the flow amount from the respective pathways of the system throughout the experimental period wu et al 2013a the considered factors included 1 inflow and outflow of the system 2 gas emissions to the atmosphere 3 sludge biosorption 4 plant uptake 5 substrate adsorption and 6 other losses the carbon balance was carried out between the influent c and all the c forms that left the system as effluent cco2 cch4 excess sludge and other losses the form of excess sludge in the c balance was considered as c captures rahman et al 2019 the c loss part was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 the influent n was divided into seven fractions effluent nn2o excess sludge plant uptake substrate adsorption volatilization nnh3 and nn2 the nn2 including the loss in other forms was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 wu et al 2013a the influent p was divided into five fractions effluent excess sludge plant uptake substrate adsorption and other losses the p loss part was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 ji et al 2021 2 5 microbial community analysis at the end of the experiment the mixed liquor sludge samples were taken from the hras module and a2o process the substrate samples were collected from each wetland cell of the tvucw module according to a five point sampling method in accordance with section 2 3 3 zhang et al 2018 the collected mixed liquor and the substrate samples were treated with a mobio powersand dna isolation kit to extract the total genomic dna and then stored at 20 prior to further analyses to discern the microbial community of each sample illumina miseq was conducted by the novogene biotechnology company tianjin china each of the high quality denoised sequences named amplicon sequence variants asv was obtained by splicing quality filtering chimera removal and denoising on the basis of divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 and their sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance level the construction of a phylogenetic tree and the calculation of taxon abundance were performed by comparing the 16s rrna genes of bacteria using the greengenes database xu et al 2021 the raw data have been uploaded to ncbi with the project id sra prjna866877 2 6 statistical and analysis all statistical analyses were performed by the statistical program spss 11 0 spss inc chicago usa all tables and figures show the results as the means standard deviation in all tests the differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the hras tvucw system variations of cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations in the influent and effluent of the hras tvucw system are presented in fig 2 the hras tvucw system obtained stable effluent quality within two months of the startup period all parameters of water quality of the system effluent met china s class 1b discharge standard gb 18918 2002 and the concentrations of cod nh4 n and tn met the class 1a level during the study period the average cod concentration in the influent was 268 14 mg l fig 2a and the average removal efficiency of the hras tvucw system reached 91 0 0 9 in the hras module the average effluent cod was 93 4 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 65 0 2 3 previous studies reported that cod removal in the hras process suffered from high variability in the range of 35 80 due to fluctuation of multiple operational conditions including influent characteristics do concentration and srt rahman et al 2019 in the tvucw module under the synergistic effects of microbial degradation plant uptake and substrate adsorption the average cod concentration in the effluent of the system was 24 2 mg l the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the hras module and tvucw module were 26 2 0 9 mg l and 2 7 0 2 mg l respectively fig 2b the hras module only removed 11 0 0 6 of the nh4 n from the influent which was mainly attributed to low self assimilation due to microbial growth under low do conditions cao et al 2020 more notably due to plant uptake substrate adsorption and dilution by wastewater backflow of cw b the nh4 n concentration of effluent in cw f decreased by 46 5 14 1 0 6 mg l compared with that of the influent what s more the cw b efficiently oxidized nh4 n to nitrate no3 n owing to high oxygen supply qiang et al 2020 which led to the hras tvucw system s high nh4 n removal efficiency 90 8 0 9 with an influent tn concentration of 30 9 1 3 mg l fig 2c the hras module only removed 6 5 2 1 of tn it was reported that the hras module was mainly responsible for insoluble cod and suspended solids removal while the removal of nitrogen was poor due to the short srt cao et al 2020 the low c n ratio 3 2 0 2 wastewater from the effluent of hras module brought enormous nitrogen pressure to the posterior tvucw module fortunately the backflow from the cw b module increased the c n ratio in the cw f module to higher than 5 0 which subsequently facilitated heterotrophic denitrification this also help the nitrogen removal capability of tvucw module reach 8 8 g n m2 d which is 2 6 5 4 folds higher than that achieved by conventional cws vymazal and krÃ¶pfelovÃ¡ 2015 zhao et al 2018 fluctuations in tp concentration in the hras tvucw system are shown in fig 2d due to biosorption by sludge at a short srt of 1 d the average removal efficiency of tp in the hras module was 29 5 3 0 which was consistent with previous results in which tp removal efficiency ranged from 23 to 38 rahman et al 2019 although the average tp concentration in the influent of the tvucw reached as high as 3 37 0 32 mg l the high tp removal capability of the tvucw module 0 49 g p m2 d caused by cooperation between ion exchange of the substrate and plant uptake wang and tian 2021 ensured low and stable tp concentrations below 1 0 mg l in the effluent of the hras tvucw system 3 2 carbon recovery of the hras tvucw system 3 2 1 mass flow and carbon recovery analysis the mass flows of c n and p in the hras tvucw system are shown in fig 3 results showed that the 43 2 and 37 8 of influent c in hras tvucw system was converted to excess sludge and escaped to the atmosphere as co2 respectively unlike a2o process where only 15 25 of the influent c was channeled into excess sludge and 45 65 ended up as co2 chai et al 2015 taboada santos et al 2020 this was mainly because the low do concentration and short srt of the hras module enhanced its biosorption efficiency and limited the carbon mineralization which resulted in 77 4 of influent pcod and 44 4 of influent ccod flows into excess sludge rahman et al 2019 fig s1 moreover 55 8 of influent scod was allocated to the tvucw module through the regulatory c flow which enabled a higher rate of denitrification meerburg et al 2016 furthermore 52 6 of n and 54 1 of p in the influent were removed via plant uptake substrate adsorption and microbial assimilation in tvucw module this was more diversified and cost effective than the nutrient removal via a2o process liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the sludge return route for n removal in a2o was replaced by wastewater backflow in the tvucw module which mitigated the competition for carbon by microbes in the anoxic sludge and was favorable to stabilized no3 n removal by denitrifying bacteria attached to the cw substrate surface wu et al 2013b similarly the hras tvucw system replaced the sludge return route for p removal with an anaerobic aerobic alternate environment with cost effective adsorption uptake processes by sludge plants and substrate without the need for chemical addition ji et al 2020 overall superior treatment performance was achieved in the hras tvucw system through optimization of mass and energy flows 3 2 2 energy consumption and generation of the hras tvucw system a comparison of estimated energy consumption and generation between the hras tvucw system and the a2o process is presented in table 1 operational energy consumption for wastewater treatment mainly consists of wastewater pumping mixed liquor mixing and aeration and their values for hras tvucw were 0 0898 kwh m3 0 0053 kwh m3 and 0 0713 kwh m3 respectively the hras tvucw system and the a2o process consumed similar amounts of energy for pumping due to continuous operation of the system for wastewater delivery by approximately the same number of pumps qiang et al 2020 on the other hand compared with the a2o process the hras tvucw system consumed half of the energy for mixing by reducing the anaerobic tank and dosing pump most notably due to the greater degree of carbon enrichment toward excess sludge rather than carbon mineralization under much shorter srt and hrt the hras tvucw system decreased the energy requirement for oxygen supply by 0 2307 kwh m3 compared with the average aeration energy of 0 3020 kwh m3 0 178 0 392 kwh m3 for a2o process qiang et al 2020 this value accounted for 96 6 of the total operational energy savings in the hras tvucw system compared with the a2o process for which a high proportion of energy consumption is aeration bertanza et al 2018 energy generation was calculated based on the amount of ch4 recovered during the ad process xiong et al 2019 and the energy efficiency of the conversion of ch4 to electricity was 33 according to kim et al 2011 the average methane yield of the excess sludge from hras tvucw system estimated by results of bmp test was approximately 236 2 8 6 ml ch4 g cod which was in the range of previous study 100 300 ml ch4 g cod of excess sludge xiong et al 2019 interestingly the digestible adsorptive sludge of hras tvucw system significantly increased energy production 0 0901 0 0136 kwh m3 wastewater p 0 05 and could achieve 41 8 energy self sufficiency table 1 which was 2 4 folds higher than that of the a2o process making great progress in carbon offset in addition if chemical costs were considered 0 0077 m3 the operational costs of the hras tvucw system 0 014 m3 would be decreased by 57 6 compared with that of the a2o process 0 033 m3 garfÃ­ et al 2017 3 3 greenhouse gas emissions of the hras tvucw system the direct release of ghg emissions of the hras tvucw system is shown in fig 4 in the hras module the release rates of n2o and co2 were 0 65 0 03 Î¼g min g mlss and 430 62 116 13 Î¼g min g mlss respectively and its total release amount only accounted for 0 3 n and 21 8 c of the influent which were in accord with previous reports cao et al 2020 lim et al 2015 sui et al 2021 the release rate of ch4 in the hras module was 0 12 0 06 Î¼g min g mlss which accounted for 0 006 of the influent c it was reported that cod loss from anaerobic ch4 production could be ignored in comparison to the total cod removal of the hras module and the very little ch4 production from the hras module of this study may have occurred in sewer pipes cao et al 2020 in the tvucw module the total release rate of n2o was 0 17 0 07 mg m2 h it should be noted that the significantly higher n2o release rate was observed in cw b which was 3 7 folds higher than that of cw f p 0 05 mainly because of their differences in do concentration 0 6 4 6 mg l in cw b versus 0 06 0 7 mg l in cw f fig s2 in this study the ammonia oxidation rate of cw b 17 2 mg n l d was 5 7 folds higher than that of cw f due to ample oxygen supply in cw b which explained the greater n2o production during the nitrification process in cw b hu et al 2010 furthermore the carbon source from the wastewater backflow of cw b also facilitated the no3 n removal in cw f by heterotrophic denitrification which reduced n2o emission zhao et al 2018 no ch4 emission was observed in cw b due to the short run anaerobic environment between aeration cycles kong et al 2013 in contrast the ch4 emission rate was 2 42 0 16 mg m2 h in cw f due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter which was lower than the reported average value 2 90 mg m2 h of vertical flow cws hao et al 2016 this was because the do from cw b backflow water avoided the strictly anaerobic environment in cw f and thus reduced the ch4 emission cao et al 2020 in addition the total co2 release amount of tvucw module accounted for 45 7 c of its influent which was in accord with previous reports yan et al 2012 maucieri et al 2019 among them higher release rate of co2 was observed in cw b 1104 41 437 42 mg m2 h compared with that of cw f 889 79 322 63 mg m2 h mainly due to more oxygen supply hao et al 2016 in general due to regulatory carbon flow and do allocation the direct and indirect ghg emissions in the hras tvucw system were effectively reduced by 9 4 folds and 2 8 folds respectively compared to the a2o process this led to a carbon emissions reduction from 0 86 to 0 21 kg co2 eq m3 wastewater table 2 meanwhile the contribution of the hras tvucw system to carbon neutrality i e carbon emissions reduction amount divided by total carbon emissions amount was 40 2 which was significantly higher than that of the a2o process 8 7 however it is insufficient to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by relying on the ad process alone no matter using the hras tvucw system or the a2o process to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality future studies should explore more diverse novel technologies and ecosystems such as heating energy recovery from wastewater nanobubble aeration technology or microalgal system to manage wastewater treatment infrastructure in a sustainable manner hao et al 2015 liu et al 2021 marcelino et al 2022 3 4 microbial community structure of the hras tvucw system 3 4 1 variation of microbial communities at the phylum level the relative abundance of microbial communities of the hras tvucw system and a2o process at the phylum level is shown in fig 5 a the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was increased by 11 2 in the hras module compared with that of the a2o process 47 5 in addition lower otus were also observed in the hras module table s3 these results were attributed to its short srt and hrt meerburg et al 2016 qiang et al 2020 furthermore it was observed that the relative abundance of the phylum nitrospirota between the hras module 0 6 and the a2o process 6 3 differed by 10 5 folds mainly caused by the difference in aeration intensity it was reported that low intensity aeration would decrease the richness and diversity of the microbial community and was adverse to the growth of nitrifying bacteria zhang et al 2018 which also explained the lower chao1 index and shannon index observed in hras module table s3 3 4 2 microbes related to carbon emissions reduction at the genus level as illustrated in fig 5b at genus level hras tvucw system formed the distinctive microbial communities in each unit due to different environmental conditions the dominant genera macellibacteroides and cetobacterium which were mainly involved in the decomposition and transformation of carbohydrates were enriched in the micro aerobic environment of hras module with the relative abundance of 3 9 and 5 3 respectively jabari et al 2012 in addition the relative abundance of genus acinetobacter was 3 9 in the hras module 12 6 folds higher than that of a2o process it was reported that the growth of acinetobacter could be stimulated under short srt and hrt and then secreted more polysaccharide accumulated in the outer layer of sludge meerburg et al 2016 this explained why higher eps production and specific surface area of sludge was observed in hras module which facilitated the bioflocculation of pcod and ccod from wastewater kinyua et al 2017 sancho et al 2019 table s4 moreover these eps attached to the sludge surface also imposed restrictions on carbon mineralization by limiting the oxygen transfer rate huddy et al 2021 the two dominant genera of thiobacillus 6 6 relative abundance and dechloromonas 3 7 relative abundance were observed in cw f due to low c n ratio wastewater these two typical autotrophic denitrifying bacteria could use inorganic carbon source to participate in denitrification process under anoxic anaerobic condition bao et al 2017 it should be noted that this process not only effectively decreased the n2o release rate but also promoted the hydrolysis of co2 and then potentially reduced the co2 release huddy et al 2021 the relative abundance of another dominant genus geothrix a heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacterium that could greatly promote denitrification efficiency under microaerophilic conditions was 4 1 mehta kolte and bond 2012 this was conducive to enhance tn removal in the microaerophilic cw f resulted from the small amount of do delivered by wastewater backflow from cw b in cw b with the alternating aerobic anoxic environment caused by intermittent aeration the dominant genera related to nitrification and denitrification were nitrospira and pseudomonas with the relative abundance of 4 1 and 5 4 respectively it should be noted that the relative abundance of the genus nitrospira was only 0 7 in cw f which explained the higher ammonia oxidation rate and n2o release rate in the cw b pantke et al 2012 in addition pseudomonas was a heterotrophic bacteria and preferentially used scod as carbon source for no3 n reduction and it was more favorable to mitigate tn removal load in cw f pantke et al 2012 4 conclusions the hras tvucw system achieved efficient nutrients removal and carbon emissions reduction by optimizing mass and energy flows during municipal wastewater treatment without the condition compromising effluent quality carbon management increased the contribution of the hras tvucw system to carbon neutrality through lower ghg emissions and higher carbon recovery capacity compared to that of the a2o process in addition controlled do allocation toward the hras tvucw system optimized the microbial community structure related to carbon capture and nitrogen transformation which facilitated denitrification efficiency and carbon emissions reduction the hras tvucw system studied here would provide a low carbon technology to treat municipal wastewater in a cost effective and sustainable way author contributions mingde ji

15263,municipal wastewater treatment which is associated with high energy consumption and excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions has been facing severe challenges toward carbon emissions in this study a high rate activated sludge two stage vertical up flow constructed wetland hras tvucw system was developed to reduce carbon emissions during municipal wastewater treatment through carbon management optimized mass and energy flows were achieved resulting in high treatment efficiency and low operational energy consumption the carbon emission of the hras tvucw system i e 0 21 kg carbon dioxide equivalent m3 wastewater was 4 1 folds lower than that of the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process meanwhile the recovered energy from the hras tvucw system increased its contribution to carbon neutrality to 40 2 4 6 folds higher than that of the a2o process results of functional microbial community analysis at the genus level revealed that the controlled dissolved oxygen allocation led to distinctive microbial communities in each unit of hras tvucw system which facilitated denitrification efficiency increase and carbon emissions reduction overall the hras tvucw system could be considered as a cost effective and sustainable low carbon technology for municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetlands carbon emissions biological ecological process carbon management greenhouse gas mass and energy flows data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the carbon emissions from wastewater treatment accounted for 1 2 of china s total carbon emissions shan et al 2016 2020 which put huge pressure on country s goal of achieving carbon emissions peak before year 2030 mallapaty 2020 lyu et al 2022 generally the conventional wastewater treatment processes e g anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process which is widely employed across china would generate 0 66 1 06 kg carbon dioxide equivalent co2 eq m3 wastewater chai et al 2015 thus innovation approaches are needed to reduce carbon emissions during wastewater treatment hao et al 2019 the new approaches must consider both direct carbon emissions of greenhouse gas ghg and indirect carbon emissions that occur from consumption of energy and or chemicals carbon emissions reduction from wastewater treatment has mainly focused on either biochemical process optimization or energy chemical retrenchment such improvements to existing processes include introduction of carbon fiber carriers which reduced nitrous oxide n2o emissions by 60 yamashita et al 2016 and off grid solar powered mixing which offset indirect carbon emissions by 65 jiang et al 2018 anammox a nutrient removal process that circumvents the conventional nitrification denitrification route has attracted wide attention since it can substantially reduce energy consumption gu et al 2018 yet implementation of these new strategies or technologies has been impeded by high construction or operational costs geographical location and climatic characteristics among others wang et al 2018 a resource oriented approach to wastewater treatment that pragmatically considers economic viability technical effectiveness scalability and ecological sustainability could generate technologies that are feasible to implement in developing countries qu et al 2019 the coupling of biological and ecological biological ecological processes that integrates the activated sludge process mainly in anaerobic or aerobic treatment with constructed wetlands cws would accomplish both energy producing carbon bioconversion and nutrient removal with low energy consumption al wahaibi et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2015 combined an anaerobic baffled reactor with a horizontal flow cw which achieved 44 59 carbon recovery and the effluent quality met china s class 1b discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18 918 2002 later liu et al 2020 combined the high rate activated sludge hras process with a vertical up flow cw to treat municipal wastewater and its effluent met the secondary discharge standard of china gb 18 918 2002 moreover the system which generated 0 85 kg dry sludge per kg chemical oxygen demand cod removed achieved high organic carbon enrichment capacity however studies have thus far primarily focused on either effluent water quality improvement or energy recovery while ignoring carbon emissions more notably high ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentration from biological treatment along with low dissolved oxygen do of wastewater would result in anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and inhibit nitrification in conventional cws which seriously impairs its carbon emissions reduction capacity zhang et al 2018 ultimately carbon emissions from such a biological ecological process would be roughly the same as the a2o process and would lack the benefit of lower carbon emissions and ecological impacts that such a system could render hao et al 2016 adoption of wastewater treatment via biological ecological process will require balancing carbon offset and carbon emissions with an efficient and functional system controlled do allocation might be a feasible approach to optimize carbon management sancho et al 2019 hras a cost effective biologically mediated sorption process could enhance carbon capture capacity by moving more carbon to sludge and then offset carbon emissions through the energy production from anaerobic digestion ad lim et al 2015 kinyua et al 2017 it was reported that the carbon captured through excess sludge in hras process was 2 3 times higher than that of a2o process subsequently mitigated the mineralization of organic carbon in wastewater jimenez et al 2015 sancho et al 2019 however the low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio effluent from hras process caused by its high efficiency of cod recovery and poor nitrogen removal performance cao et al 2020 would result in large amounts of ghg release when being treated with conventional cws mainly due to insufficient electron donors hao et al 2016 therefore optimized carbon flow and oxygen supply are required to enhance nutrient removal and mitigate ghg emissions the integrated cw mode which could form an aerobic anoxic functional zone and promote nitrification denitrification with low energy consumption is regarded as a potential strategy zhao et al 2018 therefore to achieve high nutrient removal and carbon emissions reduction simultaneously the present study developed a system that couples hras with a two stage vertical up flow cw hras tvucw using intermittent aeration and backflow the performance of hras tvucw system was thoroughly investigated from the point of water quality energy recovery and ghg emissions i e water energy ghg nexus furthermore the microbial mechanisms of carbon emissions reduction in the hras tvucw system were also elucidated this study would shed new light on possible process configuration for achieving low carbon wastewater treatment without compromising effluent quality through coupled biological ecological process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental system configuration as shown in fig 1 a lab scale hras tvucw system was constructed at shandong university qingdao china 36 21 n 120 41 e the system consisted of a hras module followed by a tvucw module the hras module consisted of an aeration reactor and a settling tank with effective volumes of 3 5 l and 5 3 l respectively the tvucw module consisted of two equal wetland cells 40 cm in diameter and 110 cm in depth and each with effective volume of 42 l the forward wetland cell and the back wetland cell were named as cw f and cw b respectively both wetland cells had a 10 cm bottom layer of coarse gravel 25 30 mm in diameter to yield uniform diffusion of supplementary oxygen an 80 cm middle layer of biological ceramsite 4 8 mm in diameter as the main substrate and a 10 cm top layer of silica sand 1 2 mm in diameter to facilitate wastewater dispersion and support plant growth a vertical perforated pvc pipe was inserted into the substrate to measure the physical and chemical parameters in situ calami acorus calamus l a locally available plant of similar sizes with approximate height of 10 cm were transplanted into each wetland cell of tvucw module after cultivation in 10 hoagland solution for 2 weeks 2 2 experimental procedure actual municipal wastewater was collected from the reclaimed wastewater treatment plant at shandong university campus daily and used as the influent in this study table s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the hras module was maintained at 2 5 h and the aeration reactor was operated under an hrt of 1 h air compressors equipped with a do controller were used in the hras module to continuously supply air at a rate of 0 15 l min to maintain do concentration in the range of 0 5 1 0 mg l a magnetic stirrer was mounted to keep the sludge in suspension and uniform distribution of oxygen the solids retention time srt was approximately controlled at 1 d by discharging the excess sludge and the returned sludge ratio was set at 100 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was maintained at 2800 3200 mg l each wetland cell of the tvucw module was operated in continuous up flow at an hrt of 1 d the cw f was operated without aeration while the cw b was operated under intermittent aeration within an interval time of 2 h a single intermittent aeration cycle included an aeration stage for 10 min at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min and without aeration stage for 110 min in order to improve effluent water quality effluent of cw b was pumped into cw f at a backflow ratio of 100 al wahaibi et al 2021 2 3 sampling and analytical methods 2 3 1 water sampling and analyses the influent and effluent samples of both the hras module and the tvucw module were taken every two days to measure the concentration of cod nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp according to the standard methods apha 2012 the different fractions of cod including particulate cod pcod colloidal cod ccod and soluble cod scod were determined as per cao et al 2020 the do concentration in the hras tvucw system was monitored using hq40d portable meter hach usa 2 3 2 gas sampling and measurement the direct release rates of ghg including n2o methane ch4 and co2 from the hras tvucw system were measured weekly by gas chromatography equipped with thermal conductivity detector gc tcd 7890b agilent usa after relatively stable effluent quality was achieved zhang et al 2018 in each sampling process an aspirator pump was used to transfer the emitted gas into gas bags pv 500 ml delin china the released gas of the hras module was sampled from the aeration reactor and the volume of ghg emitted from the settling tank was regarded as negligible the release rates of ghg in the hras module and the tvucw module during the aeration phase were calculated based on the average concentration of ghg using a modified equation from zhang et al 2018 the release rate of ghg from the tvucw module with a nonaerated phase was calculated by means of a linear increase in the sampling period according to the equation described by jones et al 2011 the quantity of ammonia volatilization was determined as per wu et al 2013b 2 3 3 sampling and analysis of sludge plant and substrate excess sludge samples were collected from the settling tank of the hras module in order to compare it with the conventional wastewater treatment process the secondary sludge samples were collected from the reclaimed wastewater treatment plant of the shandong university campus qingdao china which was operated under the a2o process since september 2016 table s2 the mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss of excess sludge were determined twice a week the biochemical methane potential bmp test was carried out to determine the amount of ch4 produced from the excess sludge throughout the anaerobic digestion according to xiong et al 2019 the carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p contents of excess sludge were determined according to rahman et al 2019 the total extracellular polymeric substances eps concentration of sludge samples was determined using the modified heat extraction method proposed by kinyua et al 2017 the specific surface area of excess sludge was detected by n2 adsorption at 196 c using a sorptometer yin et al 2017 plant samples were taken from each wetland cell of the tvucw module at the beginning and end of the experiment the harvested plants were dried to estimate dry weight after rinsing with distilled water and then pulverized for tn and tp analysis ji et al 2021 substrate samples were taken from each wetland cell of tvucw module at different heights of substrate layer i e 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm and mixed as one composite sample then the substrate samples were well mixed air dried and crushed before performing tn and tp analysis wu et al 2013a all tn and tp content analyses of plant and substrate samples were conducted with a 3 aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe germany the carbon content of plant and substrate samples was measured by the dichromate digestion titration method song et al 2012 2 4 mass balance in this study it was hypothesized that the average mass inputs c n and p to the system were equal to the average mass outputs and an mass balance model was used to clearly quantify the flow amount from the respective pathways of the system throughout the experimental period wu et al 2013a the considered factors included 1 inflow and outflow of the system 2 gas emissions to the atmosphere 3 sludge biosorption 4 plant uptake 5 substrate adsorption and 6 other losses the carbon balance was carried out between the influent c and all the c forms that left the system as effluent cco2 cch4 excess sludge and other losses the form of excess sludge in the c balance was considered as c captures rahman et al 2019 the c loss part was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 the influent n was divided into seven fractions effluent nn2o excess sludge plant uptake substrate adsorption volatilization nnh3 and nn2 the nn2 including the loss in other forms was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 wu et al 2013a the influent p was divided into five fractions effluent excess sludge plant uptake substrate adsorption and other losses the p loss part was determined by closing the mass balance to 100 ji et al 2021 2 5 microbial community analysis at the end of the experiment the mixed liquor sludge samples were taken from the hras module and a2o process the substrate samples were collected from each wetland cell of the tvucw module according to a five point sampling method in accordance with section 2 3 3 zhang et al 2018 the collected mixed liquor and the substrate samples were treated with a mobio powersand dna isolation kit to extract the total genomic dna and then stored at 20 prior to further analyses to discern the microbial community of each sample illumina miseq was conducted by the novogene biotechnology company tianjin china each of the high quality denoised sequences named amplicon sequence variants asv was obtained by splicing quality filtering chimera removal and denoising on the basis of divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 and their sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance level the construction of a phylogenetic tree and the calculation of taxon abundance were performed by comparing the 16s rrna genes of bacteria using the greengenes database xu et al 2021 the raw data have been uploaded to ncbi with the project id sra prjna866877 2 6 statistical and analysis all statistical analyses were performed by the statistical program spss 11 0 spss inc chicago usa all tables and figures show the results as the means standard deviation in all tests the differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the hras tvucw system variations of cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations in the influent and effluent of the hras tvucw system are presented in fig 2 the hras tvucw system obtained stable effluent quality within two months of the startup period all parameters of water quality of the system effluent met china s class 1b discharge standard gb 18918 2002 and the concentrations of cod nh4 n and tn met the class 1a level during the study period the average cod concentration in the influent was 268 14 mg l fig 2a and the average removal efficiency of the hras tvucw system reached 91 0 0 9 in the hras module the average effluent cod was 93 4 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 65 0 2 3 previous studies reported that cod removal in the hras process suffered from high variability in the range of 35 80 due to fluctuation of multiple operational conditions including influent characteristics do concentration and srt rahman et al 2019 in the tvucw module under the synergistic effects of microbial degradation plant uptake and substrate adsorption the average cod concentration in the effluent of the system was 24 2 mg l the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the hras module and tvucw module were 26 2 0 9 mg l and 2 7 0 2 mg l respectively fig 2b the hras module only removed 11 0 0 6 of the nh4 n from the influent which was mainly attributed to low self assimilation due to microbial growth under low do conditions cao et al 2020 more notably due to plant uptake substrate adsorption and dilution by wastewater backflow of cw b the nh4 n concentration of effluent in cw f decreased by 46 5 14 1 0 6 mg l compared with that of the influent what s more the cw b efficiently oxidized nh4 n to nitrate no3 n owing to high oxygen supply qiang et al 2020 which led to the hras tvucw system s high nh4 n removal efficiency 90 8 0 9 with an influent tn concentration of 30 9 1 3 mg l fig 2c the hras module only removed 6 5 2 1 of tn it was reported that the hras module was mainly responsible for insoluble cod and suspended solids removal while the removal of nitrogen was poor due to the short srt cao et al 2020 the low c n ratio 3 2 0 2 wastewater from the effluent of hras module brought enormous nitrogen pressure to the posterior tvucw module fortunately the backflow from the cw b module increased the c n ratio in the cw f module to higher than 5 0 which subsequently facilitated heterotrophic denitrification this also help the nitrogen removal capability of tvucw module reach 8 8 g n m2 d which is 2 6 5 4 folds higher than that achieved by conventional cws vymazal and krÃ¶pfelovÃ¡ 2015 zhao et al 2018 fluctuations in tp concentration in the hras tvucw system are shown in fig 2d due to biosorption by sludge at a short srt of 1 d the average removal efficiency of tp in the hras module was 29 5 3 0 which was consistent with previous results in which tp removal efficiency ranged from 23 to 38 rahman et al 2019 although the average tp concentration in the influent of the tvucw reached as high as 3 37 0 32 mg l the high tp removal capability of the tvucw module 0 49 g p m2 d caused by cooperation between ion exchange of the substrate and plant uptake wang and tian 2021 ensured low and stable tp concentrations below 1 0 mg l in the effluent of the hras tvucw system 3 2 carbon recovery of the hras tvucw system 3 2 1 mass flow and carbon recovery analysis the mass flows of c n and p in the hras tvucw system are shown in fig 3 results showed that the 43 2 and 37 8 of influent c in hras tvucw system was converted to excess sludge and escaped to the atmosphere as co2 respectively unlike a2o process where only 15 25 of the influent c was channeled into excess sludge and 45 65 ended up as co2 chai et al 2015 taboada santos et al 2020 this was mainly because the low do concentration and short srt of the hras module enhanced its biosorption efficiency and limited the carbon mineralization which resulted in 77 4 of influent pcod and 44 4 of influent ccod flows into excess sludge rahman et al 2019 fig s1 moreover 55 8 of influent scod was allocated to the tvucw module through the regulatory c flow which enabled a higher rate of denitrification meerburg et al 2016 furthermore 52 6 of n and 54 1 of p in the influent were removed via plant uptake substrate adsorption and microbial assimilation in tvucw module this was more diversified and cost effective than the nutrient removal via a2o process liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the sludge return route for n removal in a2o was replaced by wastewater backflow in the tvucw module which mitigated the competition for carbon by microbes in the anoxic sludge and was favorable to stabilized no3 n removal by denitrifying bacteria attached to the cw substrate surface wu et al 2013b similarly the hras tvucw system replaced the sludge return route for p removal with an anaerobic aerobic alternate environment with cost effective adsorption uptake processes by sludge plants and substrate without the need for chemical addition ji et al 2020 overall superior treatment performance was achieved in the hras tvucw system through optimization of mass and energy flows 3 2 2 energy consumption and generation of the hras tvucw system a comparison of estimated energy consumption and generation between the hras tvucw system and the a2o process is presented in table 1 operational energy consumption for wastewater treatment mainly consists of wastewater pumping mixed liquor mixing and aeration and their values for hras tvucw were 0 0898 kwh m3 0 0053 kwh m3 and 0 0713 kwh m3 respectively the hras tvucw system and the a2o process consumed similar amounts of energy for pumping due to continuous operation of the system for wastewater delivery by approximately the same number of pumps qiang et al 2020 on the other hand compared with the a2o process the hras tvucw system consumed half of the energy for mixing by reducing the anaerobic tank and dosing pump most notably due to the greater degree of carbon enrichment toward excess sludge rather than carbon mineralization under much shorter srt and hrt the hras tvucw system decreased the energy requirement for oxygen supply by 0 2307 kwh m3 compared with the average aeration energy of 0 3020 kwh m3 0 178 0 392 kwh m3 for a2o process qiang et al 2020 this value accounted for 96 6 of the total operational energy savings in the hras tvucw system compared with the a2o process for which a high proportion of energy consumption is aeration bertanza et al 2018 energy generation was calculated based on the amount of ch4 recovered during the ad process xiong et al 2019 and the energy efficiency of the conversion of ch4 to electricity was 33 according to kim et al 2011 the average methane yield of the excess sludge from hras tvucw system estimated by results of bmp test was approximately 236 2 8 6 ml ch4 g cod which was in the range of previous study 100 300 ml ch4 g cod of excess sludge xiong et al 2019 interestingly the digestible adsorptive sludge of hras tvucw system significantly increased energy production 0 0901 0 0136 kwh m3 wastewater p 0 05 and could achieve 41 8 energy self sufficiency table 1 which was 2 4 folds higher than that of the a2o process making great progress in carbon offset in addition if chemical costs were considered 0 0077 m3 the operational costs of the hras tvucw system 0 014 m3 would be decreased by 57 6 compared with that of the a2o process 0 033 m3 garfÃ­ et al 2017 3 3 greenhouse gas emissions of the hras tvucw system the direct release of ghg emissions of the hras tvucw system is shown in fig 4 in the hras module the release rates of n2o and co2 were 0 65 0 03 Î¼g min g mlss and 430 62 116 13 Î¼g min g mlss respectively and its total release amount only accounted for 0 3 n and 21 8 c of the influent which were in accord with previous reports cao et al 2020 lim et al 2015 sui et al 2021 the release rate of ch4 in the hras module was 0 12 0 06 Î¼g min g mlss which accounted for 0 006 of the influent c it was reported that cod loss from anaerobic ch4 production could be ignored in comparison to the total cod removal of the hras module and the very little ch4 production from the hras module of this study may have occurred in sewer pipes cao et al 2020 in the tvucw module the total release rate of n2o was 0 17 0 07 mg m2 h it should be noted that the significantly higher n2o release rate was observed in cw b which was 3 7 folds higher than that of cw f p 0 05 mainly because of their differences in do concentration 0 6 4 6 mg l in cw b versus 0 06 0 7 mg l in cw f fig s2 in this study the ammonia oxidation rate of cw b 17 2 mg n l d was 5 7 folds higher than that of cw f due to ample oxygen supply in cw b which explained the greater n2o production during the nitrification process in cw b hu et al 2010 furthermore the carbon source from the wastewater backflow of cw b also facilitated the no3 n removal in cw f by heterotrophic denitrification which reduced n2o emission zhao et al 2018 no ch4 emission was observed in cw b due to the short run anaerobic environment between aeration cycles kong et al 2013 in contrast the ch4 emission rate was 2 42 0 16 mg m2 h in cw f due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter which was lower than the reported average value 2 90 mg m2 h of vertical flow cws hao et al 2016 this was because the do from cw b backflow water avoided the strictly anaerobic environment in cw f and thus reduced the ch4 emission cao et al 2020 in addition the total co2 release amount of tvucw module accounted for 45 7 c of its influent which was in accord with previous reports yan et al 2012 maucieri et al 2019 among them higher release rate of co2 was observed in cw b 1104 41 437 42 mg m2 h compared with that of cw f 889 79 322 63 mg m2 h mainly due to more oxygen supply hao et al 2016 in general due to regulatory carbon flow and do allocation the direct and indirect ghg emissions in the hras tvucw system were effectively reduced by 9 4 folds and 2 8 folds respectively compared to the a2o process this led to a carbon emissions reduction from 0 86 to 0 21 kg co2 eq m3 wastewater table 2 meanwhile the contribution of the hras tvucw system to carbon neutrality i e carbon emissions reduction amount divided by total carbon emissions amount was 40 2 which was significantly higher than that of the a2o process 8 7 however it is insufficient to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by relying on the ad process alone no matter using the hras tvucw system or the a2o process to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality future studies should explore more diverse novel technologies and ecosystems such as heating energy recovery from wastewater nanobubble aeration technology or microalgal system to manage wastewater treatment infrastructure in a sustainable manner hao et al 2015 liu et al 2021 marcelino et al 2022 3 4 microbial community structure of the hras tvucw system 3 4 1 variation of microbial communities at the phylum level the relative abundance of microbial communities of the hras tvucw system and a2o process at the phylum level is shown in fig 5 a the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was increased by 11 2 in the hras module compared with that of the a2o process 47 5 in addition lower otus were also observed in the hras module table s3 these results were attributed to its short srt and hrt meerburg et al 2016 qiang et al 2020 furthermore it was observed that the relative abundance of the phylum nitrospirota between the hras module 0 6 and the a2o process 6 3 differed by 10 5 folds mainly caused by the difference in aeration intensity it was reported that low intensity aeration would decrease the richness and diversity of the microbial community and was adverse to the growth of nitrifying bacteria zhang et al 2018 which also explained the lower chao1 index and shannon index observed in hras module table s3 3 4 2 microbes related to carbon emissions reduction at the genus level as illustrated in fig 5b at genus level hras tvucw system formed the distinctive microbial communities in each unit due to different environmental conditions the dominant genera macellibacteroides and cetobacterium which were mainly involved in the decomposition and transformation of carbohydrates were enriched in the micro aerobic environment of hras module with the relative abundance of 3 9 and 5 3 respectively jabari et al 2012 in addition the relative abundance of genus acinetobacter was 3 9 in the hras module 12 6 folds higher than that of a2o process it was reported that the growth of acinetobacter could be stimulated under short srt and hrt and then secreted more polysaccharide accumulated in the outer layer of sludge meerburg et al 2016 this explained why higher eps production and specific surface area of sludge was observed in hras module which facilitated the bioflocculation of pcod and ccod from wastewater kinyua et al 2017 sancho et al 2019 table s4 moreover these eps attached to the sludge surface also imposed restrictions on carbon mineralization by limiting the oxygen transfer rate huddy et al 2021 the two dominant genera of thiobacillus 6 6 relative abundance and dechloromonas 3 7 relative abundance were observed in cw f due to low c n ratio wastewater these two typical autotrophic denitrifying bacteria could use inorganic carbon source to participate in denitrification process under anoxic anaerobic condition bao et al 2017 it should be noted that this process not only effectively decreased the n2o release rate but also promoted the hydrolysis of co2 and then potentially reduced the co2 release huddy et al 2021 the relative abundance of another dominant genus geothrix a heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacterium that could greatly promote denitrification efficiency under microaerophilic conditions was 4 1 mehta kolte and bond 2012 this was conducive to enhance tn removal in the microaerophilic cw f resulted from the small amount of do delivered by wastewater backflow from cw b in cw b with the alternating aerobic anoxic environment caused by intermittent aeration the dominant genera related to nitrification and denitrification were nitrospira and pseudomonas with the relative abundance of 4 1 and 5 4 respectively it should be noted that the relative abundance of the genus nitrospira was only 0 7 in cw f which explained the higher ammonia oxidation rate and n2o release rate in the cw b pantke et al 2012 in addition pseudomonas was a heterotrophic bacteria and preferentially used scod as carbon source for no3 n reduction and it was more favorable to mitigate tn removal load in cw f pantke et al 2012 4 conclusions the hras tvucw system achieved efficient nutrients removal and carbon emissions reduction by optimizing mass and energy flows during municipal wastewater treatment without the condition compromising effluent quality carbon management increased the contribution of the hras tvucw system to carbon neutrality through lower ghg emissions and higher carbon recovery capacity compared to that of the a2o process in addition controlled do allocation toward the hras tvucw system optimized the microbial community structure related to carbon capture and nitrogen transformation which facilitated denitrification efficiency and carbon emissions reduction the hras tvucw system studied here would provide a low carbon technology to treat municipal wastewater in a cost effective and sustainable way author contributions mingde ji

15264,nitroguanidine nq is a constituent of gas generators for automobile airbags smokeless pyrotechnics insecticides propellants and new insensitive munitions formulations applied by the military during its manufacture and use nq can easily spread in soils ground and surface waters due to its high aqueous solubility very little is known about the microbial biotransformation of nq this study aimed to elucidate important mechanisms operating during nq anaerobic biotransformation to achieve this goal we developed an anaerobic enrichment culture able to reduce nq to nitrosoguanidine nsoq which was further abiotically transformed to cyanamide effective electron donors for nq biotransformation were lactate and to a lesser extent pyruvate the results demonstrate that the enrichment process selected a sulfate reducing culture that utilized lactate as its electron donor and sulfate as its electron acceptor while competing with nq as an electron sink a unique property of the culture was its requirement for exogenous nitrogen e g from yeast extract or nh4cl for nq biotransformation since nq itself did not serve as a nitrogen source the main phylogenetic groups associated with the nq reducing culture were sulfate reducing and fermentative bacteria namely cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus 63 1 relative abundance dendrosporobacter spp 12 0 and raoultibacter massiliens 10 9 the molecular ecology results corresponded to measurable physiological properties of the most abundant members the results establish the conditions for nq anaerobic biotransformation and the microbial community associated with the process improving our present comprehension of nq environmental fate and assisting the development of nq remediation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrosoguanidine lactate sulfate reduction insensitive munitions compounds propellant bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitroguanidine nq is a constituent of triple base propellants rocket propellants gas generators for automobile airbags smokeless pyrotechnics and new insensitive i e safer to handle munitions formulations applied by the military koch 2019 it is also a precursor of neonicotinoid nitroguanidine insecticides kanne et al 2005 as a result nq can reach the environment via the uncontrolled discharge of manufacturing waste streams and the use of nq containing products for example during military training centimeter sized pieces of undetonated insensitive munitions containing nq can remain in the soil and be slowly dissolved by precipitation taylor et al 2013 nq contamination can easily spread in the soil and ground and surface waters due to nq s high water solubility 2 6 5 0 g l arthur et al 2018 richard and weidhaas 2014 furthermore uncontrolled phototransformation of nq in the environment produces mixtures of contaminants with increased toxicity gust et al 2017 kennedy et al 2017 thus it is critical to elucidate nq attenuation processes to understand its environmental fate and consequence nq remediation currently represents a significant challenge because nq has exhibited recalcitrance to biological degradation or transformation in soils for example a previous study observed that soil communities could not biotransform nq from an insensitive munition formulation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions indest et al 2017 differently from nq the other nitro compounds in the formulation namely 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan and 3 nitro 1 2 4 triazol 5 one nto were successfully biotransformed similarly a study investigating the fate of insensitive munitions compounds mixtures in soil columns under a simulated rainfall regime observed only 20 nq removal after 60 days temple et al 2018 earlier efforts on nq biotransformation have focused on aerobic processes for example haag et al 1990 observed that a culture enriched from natural waters could transform nq when nutrient broth and yeast extract were added cyanamide was identified as the only product from the aerobic nq transformation later perreault et al 2012 isolated the variovorax strain vc1 which could grow using 50 Âµm nq as the sole nitrogen source aerobic nq degradation was triggered when oxygen glucose and succinate were provided the products detected were nitrourea nh3 n2o and co2 another study evaluated the aerobic degradation of the constituents of an insensitive munition formulation dnan nto and nq using a soil enrichment culture richard and weidhaas 2014 they observed that dnan and nq were utilized as nitrogen sources and detected nitrourea was the main nq degradation product because contaminated environments are heterogeneous presenting anaerobic aerobic redox zones the uncontrolled transformation of nq can occur in both scenarios thus it is necessary to understand the metabolic pathways end products nutrient requirements and potential microorganisms involved in the nq anaerobic biotransformation unlike nq aerobic degradation only one study has reported nq anaerobic biotransformation so far kaplan et al 1982 the authors reported that nq was cometabolized by anaerobic sludge to nitrosoguanidine nsoq in a rich nutrient broth then nsoq was abiotically transformed into cyanamide cyanoguanidine and melamine although kaplan et al 1982 presented important findings the nq anaerobic biotransformation mechanisms remained elusive besides the input nq and output nsoq very little is known about the mechanisms involved this study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms associated with nq anaerobic biotransformation to expand our understanding of nq environmental fate and improve the process control for engineering applications to achieve this goal we first developed an nq reducing anaerobic enrichment culture and identified the primary products from nq biotransformation then we uncovered the mechanisms by investigating the preference for different electron donors the possible role of nq as a nitrogen source and different strategies to enhance nq reduction additionally we studied the molecular ecology of the nq reducing enrichment culture since no information is available about microbial communities associated with nq anaerobic biotransformation to date 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nq containing 25 water cas 556 88 7

reducing enrichment culture was obtained from a returned activated sludge collected from tres rios water reclamation facility tucson az before the culture started being enriched the sludge was stored at 4 c in a sealed container under anaerobic conditions for about 4 months 2 3 development of the enrichment culture the nq reducing enrichment culture was developed using an initial sludge concentration of 1 5 g volatile suspended solids vss l 1 followed by a subculturing process through successive transfers under anaerobic conditions the basal medium was composed of in mg l 1 kh2po4

culture s development is shown in fig 1 initially the enrichment culture was developed using 10 mm pyruvate as the electron donor and 2500 mg l 1 yeast extract as a vitamin and nitrogen source 34 transfers were carried out this initial enrichment culture is referred to as ec a then a second enrichment culture was initiated using 10 mm lactate and 50 mg l 1 yeast extract around 5 mg n l 1 ec b after 16 transfers we stopped the addition of yeast extract and started adding 25 mg l 1 nh4cl as the nitrogen source ecc 2 4 experiments different batch experiments to investigate nq biotransformation were conducted in triplicate and using the same mineral medium table s1 in the supplementary material ecc was used as inoculum 2 5 v v unless otherwise stated liquid samples were removed at selected time points for analytical measurements 2 4 1 alternative electron donors lactate pyruvate acetate succinate propionate and h2 were evaluated as electron donors for the nq reducing enrichment culture experiment procedures are described in the supplementary material 2 4 2 nitrogen source batch bioassays were performed with and without external nitrogen addition using 1 mm nq and 10 mm lactate as the electron donor to determine if the culture could use nq as a nitrogen source three conditions were assayed as follows 1 nq and lactate 2 nq lactate and 25 mg l 1 of yeast extract and 3 nq and lactate and 25 mg l 1 of nh4cl 2 4 3 effect of different additives in nq degradation nq biotransformation was assessed in the presence of 25 mm besa or 25 mm molybdate aiming to inhibit methanogenesis and sulfate reduction activities respectively nq reduction was also tested under sulfate reducing conditions by adding 1 mm sulfate 2 4 4 nitrosoguanidine transformation nsoq transformation was investigated in biotic and abiotic conditions since the nsoq standard is not commercially available we produced nsoq biologically via the reduction of 1 mm nq in the presence of 10 mm lactate and 2 5 v v ecc once nq was converted to nsoq we monitored the fate of nsoq in the biotic assays the nsoq concentration was monitored in the same medium it was produced in the presence of the cells for abiotic assays cells were removed from the medium using sterile 0 22 Î¼m membranes 25 mm ezflow syringe filter foxx life sciences de usa and the medium containing nsoq was transferred into sterile serum bottles the bottles were incubated under the same conditions as the regular transfers additional biotic and abiotic treatments were prepared following the same protocol and received a spike of 5 mm lactate to stimulate nsoq biological reduction if it occurred 2 5 analytical techniques nq nsoq cyanamide cyanoguanidine and urea were analyzed using an agilent 1260 infinity ii high

rrna gene analysis of the microbial community to appreciate the changes in the microbial community structure throughout generations and different substrates we analyzed the communities from ec a 28th

discussion 3 1 electron donors and products of nq biotransformation the nq reducing culture was initially developed in a rich medium with 10 mm pyruvate and 2500 mg l 1 yeast extract ec a according to fig 1 to simplify the medium composition we evaluated the response of nq reducers to alternative electron donors including pyruvate lactate succinate and acetate under a lower concentration of yeast extract 50 mg l 1 fig s1 the assays amended with pyruvate and lactate presented 17 and 35 nq reduction respectively over 9 days fig s1 the other electron donors did not promote nq reduction since lactate assays reached a higher nq removal than pyruvate we selected lactate as the electron donor for further experiments ec b fig 2 shows that nq was biotransformed in an assay with 10 mm lactate and inoculated with the ec b no nq transformation was observed in the abiotic control or when lactate was absent i e endogenous control indicating that the transformation is biologically mediated and dependent on electron donor availability during the first 10 days around 40 of nq was biotransformed then 5 mm lactate was refed to the culture which allowed for the complete removal of nq this suggests that nq biotransformation stopped because other anaerobic processes depleted the initial 10 mm lactate the role of lactate as the true electron donor for nq reduction and the competition for lactate availability are further discussed in sections 3 3 to 3 5 nq biotransformation started with the reduction of the nitro group and nsoq was observed as the immediate product as previously reported kaplan et al 1982 nsoq was confirmed in our study via mass spectrophotometry lc ms in positive ion mode m h fig s2 it presented a protonated mass at m z 89 0463 corresponding to the molecular formula ch5n4o with an error of 0 40 ppm since the reference standard for nsoq is not commercially available nsoq was semiquantitatively analyzed via hplc dad thus the results are presented as peak areas fig 2 after nq biotransformation to nsoq nsoq gradually disappeared fig 2 its fate was governed by abiotic reactions as discussed in section 3 7 3 2 nitrogen source experiments were conducted to determine whether the anaerobic enrichment culture could use nq as the sole nitrogen source first we examined bioassays with lactate or pyruvate either with or without yeast extract 50 mg l 1 fig s3 after 4 days we refed 5 mm electron donor to ensure the complete reduction of nq both pyruvate and lactate sustained the nq reduction but the transformation was conditioned by the availability of yeast extract fig s3 then we conducted a second experiment to discern if the yeast extract served as a source of nitrogen or vitamins and if nq itself could be used as the nitrogen source in this case yeast extract or nh4cl 25 mg l 1 each were tested as nitrogen sources compared to a treatment without an external nitrogen source lactate 10 mm was used as the electron donor as shown in fig 3 nq reduction required the addition of an external nitrogen source being completed only in the assays with yeast extract or nh4cl in the assay where nq was the sole nitrogen source the nq disappearance was about 20 with a negligible formation of nsoq in contrast with aerobic nq degraders which use nq as the sole nitrogen source perreault et al 2012 richard and weidhaas 2014 the anaerobic nq reducing culture could not benefit from nq s high nitrogen content 53 8 in mass therefore nq anaerobic biotransformation relies on external nitrogen sources 3 3 nq reduction vs methanogenesis in anaerobic enrichment cultures the transformation of organic compounds can be affected by competitive interaction between different microorganisms including fermenters methanogens and sulfate reducers li et al 2021 patidar and tare 2005 therefore we investigated the effect of inhibiting methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in nq reduction by using besa and molybdate respectively biswas et al 2009 liu et al 2011 besa is an analog of coenzyme m in methanogenic archaea whose concentrations between 5 and 50 mm are reported to block ch4 formation liu et al 2011 molybdate is a structural analog of sulfate that inhibits atp sulfurylase the first enzyme involved in sulfate activation in sulfate reducing bacteria when present in concentrations in the order of mm biswas et al 2009 another treatment tested the effect of a higher sulfate concentration 1 mm on nq reduction fig 4 shows the nq transformation in the presence of the different additives i e besa molybdate and sulfate compared with the treatment without additives i e lactate nq only the results show that nq reduction was dependent on lactate availability in the assay without additives lactate nq lactate was 100 depleted by day 4 as a result nq transformation was truncated due to the lack of lactate presenting only 39 of nq removal fig 4a and b on the other hand in the presence of 25 mm besa 1 mm lactate was still available on day 4 enabling the complete removal of nq by day 6 fig 4a the availability of 1 mm of lactate is more than enough to promote the reduction of 1 mm nq for example the incomplete oxidation of 1 mm of lactate to acetate yields 4 reducing milliequivalents e meq whereas the transformation of 1 mm nq to nsoq requires only 2 e meq a separate experiment demonstrated that besa completely inhibited methanogenesis in this culture figs s4 and s5 besa addition alters the electron flux exchanged by microorganisms during the successive bioreactions of the anaerobic digestion i e acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis saady 2013 for example the inhibition of methanogens causes the accumulation of acetate and h2 consequently acidogenic bacteria respond to acetate accumulation by shifting their metabolism from acetate production to more reduced products such as propionate and butyrate or from volatile fatty acids to alcohol production saady 2013 hence this unbalance could allow more lactate to be available for nq reduction we also evaluated the effect of different concentrations of besa on nq transformation and found that besa concentrations as low as 5 mm exhibited the same effect as higher concentrations up to 50 mm allowing the complete reduction of 1 mm nq fig s6 because the enrichment culture was not dominated by a methanogenic community as discussed in section 3 8 a relatively low besa concentration 5 mm could efficiently inhibit methanogenesis liu et al 2011 3 4 nq reduction vs sulfate reduction sulfate reduction preceded nq reduction for the assay amended with 1 mm sulfate sulfide was produced until day 4 with a maximum concentration of 0 91 mm corresponding to 91 s recovery fig 4g only after sulfate reduction to sulfide reached its maximum around 15 of nq was reduced to nsoq fig 4a sulfate reduction preceding nq reduction was also observed in another experiment in which nq and sulfate were present with the same electron acceptor capacity i e 8 e meq 4 mm nq and 1 mm sulfate lactate was available in excess fig s7 the standard reduction potential of sulfate reduction to sulfide is 200 mv connell and patrick 1968 which is higher than that reported for nq reduction 700 mv niedÅºwiecka and finneran 2015 validating our observation that sulfate is a more favorable electron acceptor we also tested whether molybdate a sulfate reduction inhibitor would affect nq reduction the addition of molybdate inhibited our enrichment culture lactate was only partially utilized resulting in low bacterial growth fig 4c and d nq was not transformed despite lactate availability indicating that nq reduction was also inhibited this gives us an initial clue that the nq reducing culture was dominated by sulfate reducing bacteria which was later proven by molecular analysis section 3 8 because nq reduction was hindered by molybdate we performed a separate experiment to investigate whether nq reduction was abiotically driven by the sulfide produced from sulfate reduction fig s8 the experiment followed a previously described protocol menezes et al 2021 no abiotic nq reduction was observed in the presence of sulfide in large excess as a bulk reducing agent which provides evidence that nq was indeed biologically transformed 3 5 evidence of lactate as the true electron donor for nq reduction for all treatments bacterial growth was coupled with lactate consumption fig 4c and d demonstrating that the culture used lactate for growth important growth parameters can be derived from the results presented in fig 4 the cell yield was 2 21 0 06 g vss mol 1 lactate in the same range as those previously reported for anaerobic lactate utilizing communities seeliger et al 2002 additionally the culture presented a specific growth rate of 0 7 0 1 day 1 with a doubling time of 1 0 0 1 days calculated based on the vss increase in the treatment without additives lactate fermentation oxidation formed acetate and propionate however those products accumulated throughout incubation and did not serve as electron donors for nq reduction fig 4e and f to confirm this hypothesis we assessed acetate propionate and h2 products of anaerobic lactate degradation as electron donors for the nq reducing culture in separate experiments figs s9 and s10 no nq reduction was observed when these compounds were provided as electron donors in addition the bacterial growth was visually negligible compared with the growth observed in the presence of lactate thus lactate itself and not its fermentation oxidation products was the true electron donor for nq reduction lactate oxidation is thermodynamically preferred compared to acetate and propionate oxidation detman et al 2018 furthermore lactate is reported as a product of pyruvate fermentation wagner et al 2005 which can explain the effectiveness of pyruvate as an electron donor during the initial stage of the culture ec a the fermentation of lactate to acetate and propionate by diverse fermenting microorganisms is an energetically favorable reaction 56 7 kj per mol lactate the fermentation of 3 mols of lactate is expected to form 2 mols of propionate and 1 mol of acetate reaction 1 seeliger et al 2002 1 3 lactate 2 propionate acetate hco3 h however we observed a similar concentration of acetate and propionate fig 4e and 4f suggesting that propionate was consumed during the incubation time or acetate was produced by an alternative pathway lactate can be oxidized incompletely to acetate coupled with a favorable electron acceptor reduction for instance sulfate reducing bacteria incompletely oxidize lactate to acetate using sulfate reaction 2 newman et al 1997 tebo and obraztsova 1998 2 2 lactate so4 2 2 acetate 2 hco3 hs h based on our results we hypothesized that nq reduction was coupled to incomplete lactate oxidation to acetate reaction 3 3 lactate 2 nq acetate 2 nsoq hco3 h this hypothesis is supported by our results that demonstrate that the simplified substrates of the enrichment culture selected for a sulfate reducing community see section 3 8 that utilizes lactate as a unique electron donor and sulfate as an electron acceptor while competing with nq as an electron sink 3 6 decreasing nq reduction lag phase an extended microbial lag phase represents an important disadvantage for nq reduction since other processes with shorter lag phases can deplete the electron donor and hinder nq transformation for example we observed that the nq biotransformation rate significantly improved when the nq reducing culture was transferred during the exponential phase 4 day old culture compared to a transfer made in the decay phase 14 day old culture fig s11 when the culture in the decay phase was used as inoculum for a new transfer nq reduction was only 39 due to the extended lag phase on the other hand when the culture in the exponential phase was used as inoculum for a new transfer nq was 94 7 reduced within 4 to 5 days without lactate refeeding by eliminating the lag phase nq reduction could outcompete the other process e g lactate fermentation and sulfate reduction and take advantage of the large availability of lactate overall we found three effective strategies to enhance nq reduction against the competition for lactate in the enrichment culture i lactate refeeding or dosage over the incubation time to sustain the nq transformation during longer periods ii inhibition of methanogenesis by besa in concentrations equal or higher than 5 mm and iii use of a culture in the exponential growth phase as inoculum to shorten the lag phase of nq reduction 3 7 fate of nsoq during the nq biotransformation the formation of nsoq as the main product was followed by its gradual disappearance figs 1 and s3 although a previous study suggested that nsoq transformation could be abiotic kaplan et al 1982 the literature lacks experiments showing whether microbial reduction could play any role in nsoq transformation thus we tested nsoq disappearance in both biotic and abiotic conditions with and without a refeeding of lactate nsoq disappeared at the same rate in both biotic and abiotic conditions fig 5a nsoq disappearance 83 0 1 9 over 13 days was accompanied by the formation of 0 49 0 05 mm cyanamide fig 5b these results provide evidence that nsoq transformation was solely abiotic cyanamide is formed from the autodecomposition of nsoq in aqueous solution kaplan et al 1982 additionally previous works focusing on the abiotic transformation of nq cataloged nsoq as a transient unstable intermediate becher et al 2019 however under the anoxic conditions tested in our study nsoq disappeared at a relatively slow rate 0 119 0 008 day 1 other previously reported products from nsoq transformation such as cyanoguanidine and melamine kaplan et al 1982 were not detected guanidine a product recently detected during nq abiotic transformation by reactive minerals rios valenciana et al 2022 was also not detected although nq was reported as a carcinogen and nsoq is a suspected carcinogen previous tests with cyanamide have observed no mutagenic activity suggesting cyanamide may be more benign than nq and nsoq kaplan et al 1982 the intermediate nsoq is considered to cause a higher ecotoxicity than nq becher et al 2019 however more studies are necessary to understand whether cyanamide or the products from its further transformation could cause increased ecotoxicity since the studies so far have only analyzed mixtures of many products from nq phototransformation gust et al 2017 kennedy et al 2017 3 8 bacterial community associated with nq reduction currently no information on bacterial communities able to anaerobically biotransform nq is available only one study characterized a soil microbial community associated with the transformation of an insensitive munitions formulation composed in part of nq however this microbial community could not transform nq indest et al 2017 therefore we explored the microbial composition of the nq reducing culture based on the characterization of the 16s rrna gene fig s12 shows the rarefaction curves of the sequences fig 6 presents the relative abundances of different phylogenetic groups determined in 3 different stages of the nq reducing culture and different assays fig s13 shows a heat map comparing the communities the presented values are averages of triplicate analysis first we analyzed ec a the initial enrichment culture grown in a rich medium with 10 mm pyruvate and 2500 mg l 1 yeast extract it presented the highest diversity among the communities analyzed presenting 253 40 operational taxonomic units otus as explained earlier after we evaluated different electron donors pyruvate was replaced by lactate and yeast extract concentration was decreased to 50 mg l 1 ec b to simplify the culture medium the switch from pyruvate to lactate and the drastic decrease in yeast extract concentration reduced the number of otus to 199 44 and changed the structure of the microbial community the sulfate reducing bacterium cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus which exhibited a relative abundance of only 0 1 in ec a became the dominant phylogenetic group 41 2 in ec b the relative abundances of other phylogenetic groups such as dendrosporobacter spp anaerotignum propionicum raoultibacter massiliensis and acetoanaerobium spp significantly increased in ec b compared to the ec a fig s14 later switching the nitrogen source from yeast extract ec b to ammonium chloride ecc also caused changes in the microbial community the number of otus in ecc 116 20 decreased even more compared to ec b 199 44 which evidences the enrichment process the culture was undergoing cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus became even more abundant 63 1 to the detriment of anaerotignum propionicum and acetoanaerobium spp fig s15 as a guide table 1 presents the closest isolated organisms and some phylogenetic and physiologic features of the main genera involved in the enriched nq reducing microbial community we also explored shifts in the microbial community structure of ecc due to different additives such as besa and sulfate in the presence and absence of nq assays with molybdate were not included in the 16s rrna gene analysis since they exhibited minimal bacterial growth although we observed methane production methanogens were detected in very low abundance for example in the presence of nq and lactate the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter arboriphilus was only 1 3 in ecc although besa improved nq reduction efficiency no statically significant differences were observed between the communities growing with and without besa in the presence of nq which corroborates with the similar profile of bacterial growth and organic acids production between these assays fig 4 finally when sulfate was absent the relative abundance of the primarily sulfate reducing bacterium cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus decreased in contrast raoultibacter massiliensis became relatively more abundant fig s16 the most enriched phylogenetic group in our culture cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus was classified as desulfovibrio oxamicus until very recently wan et al 2021 cupidesulfovibrium oxamicus is a sulfate reducing bacterium enriched and isolated in a modified postgate b medium the main components of this medium are sodium lactate nh4cl and yeast extract li et al 2022 which were also present during the enrichment of our culture additionally previous studies determined that cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus does not grow in acetate propionate succinate or h2 but grows in lactate or pyruvate wan et al 2021 thus the molecular ecology results validate our findings on the electron donors and nitrogen source needed for nq reduction cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus is a versatile bacterium able to reduce sulfate nitrate sb v and u vi in the presence of lactate table 1 li et al 2022 pietzsch and babel 2003 it also presents fermentative growth in the absence of electron acceptors table 1 wan et al 2021 other phylogenetic groups significantly enriched in the nq reducing conditions were dendrosporobacter spp and raoultibacter massiliensis which presented a statistically significant increase when nq was present compared to the assays without nq figs s16 and s17 the dendrosporobacter genus can ferment lactate to acetate and propionate table 1 and has also been found to coexist with sulfate reducing bacteria in sulfidogenic reactors dar et al 2008 in the near absence of sulfate dendrosporobacter like species can outcompete sulfate reducing bacteria dar et al 2008 strÃ¶mpl et al 2000 the other enriched member raoultibacter massiliensis was isolated from the feces of a healthy saudi bedouin traore et al 2019 there are no reports associating raoultibacter massiliensis with the biotransformation or degradation of contaminants so far table 1 overall the microbial ecology results show the enrichment of a sulfate reducing and fermentative culture due to conditions required for nq reduction in agreement cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus and dendrosporobacter are good representatives of sulfate reducing and fermentative activities respectively this is the first description of a microbial community associated with nq anaerobic biotransformation which can be highly enriched by the use of appropriate electron donors and nitrogen sources and later applied for nq reduction additionally our results e g proposed strategies to enhance nq reduction can assist the possible isolation of nq reducing bacteria and the elucidation of specific bacterial functions by future studies on nq anaerobic biotransformation 4 conclusions the results elucidate the mechanisms of nq anaerobic biotransformation establishing conditions under which the process occurs nq transformation is driven by the interaction of biotic and abiotic processes initially nq was microbially reduced to nsoq the further transformation of nsoq was found to be abiotic and coupled with the formation of cyanamide the simplified substrates of the enrichment process selected a sulfate reducing enrichment that utilized lactate as the electron donor and sulfate as an electron acceptor that competed with nq as an electron sink a unique property of the culture was its requirement for exogenous nitrogen since nq itself did not serve as a nitrogen source effective strategies to enhance nq reduction were lactate refeeding over the incubation time besa addition or the use of cells in the exponential growth phase as inoculum the nq reducing culture was mainly composed of sulfate reducing and fermentative microorganisms such as cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus the culture s most abundant member dendrosporobacter spp and raoultibacter massiliensis remarkably the main conditions required for nq reduction such as the preference for lactate and the need for external nitrogen addition corresponded to the physiological properties of cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus the results presented here expand the understanding of nq environmental fate and allow for the development of nq bioremediation strategies declaration of

15264,nitroguanidine nq is a constituent of gas generators for automobile airbags smokeless pyrotechnics insecticides propellants and new insensitive munitions formulations applied by the military during its manufacture and use nq can easily spread in soils ground and surface waters due to its high aqueous solubility very little is known about the microbial biotransformation of nq this study aimed to elucidate important mechanisms operating during nq anaerobic biotransformation to achieve this goal we developed an anaerobic enrichment culture able to reduce nq to nitrosoguanidine nsoq which was further abiotically transformed to cyanamide effective electron donors for nq biotransformation were lactate and to a lesser extent pyruvate the results demonstrate that the enrichment process selected a sulfate reducing culture that utilized lactate as its electron donor and sulfate as its electron acceptor while competing with nq as an electron sink a unique property of the culture was its requirement for exogenous nitrogen e g from yeast extract or nh4cl for nq biotransformation since nq itself did not serve as a nitrogen source the main phylogenetic groups associated with the nq reducing culture were sulfate reducing and fermentative bacteria namely cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus 63 1 relative abundance dendrosporobacter spp 12 0 and raoultibacter massiliens 10 9 the molecular ecology results corresponded to measurable physiological properties of the most abundant members the results establish the conditions for nq anaerobic biotransformation and the microbial community associated with the process improving our present comprehension of nq environmental fate and assisting the development of nq remediation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrosoguanidine lactate sulfate reduction insensitive munitions compounds propellant bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitroguanidine nq is a constituent of triple base propellants rocket propellants gas generators for automobile airbags smokeless pyrotechnics and new insensitive i e safer to handle munitions formulations applied by the military koch 2019 it is also a precursor of neonicotinoid nitroguanidine insecticides kanne et al 2005 as a result nq can reach the environment via the uncontrolled discharge of manufacturing waste streams and the use of nq containing products for example during military training centimeter sized pieces of undetonated insensitive munitions containing nq can remain in the soil and be slowly dissolved by precipitation taylor et al 2013 nq contamination can easily spread in the soil and ground and surface waters due to nq s high water solubility 2 6 5 0 g l arthur et al 2018 richard and weidhaas 2014 furthermore uncontrolled phototransformation of nq in the environment produces mixtures of contaminants with increased toxicity gust et al 2017 kennedy et al 2017 thus it is critical to elucidate nq attenuation processes to understand its environmental fate and consequence nq remediation currently represents a significant challenge because nq has exhibited recalcitrance to biological degradation or transformation in soils for example a previous study observed that soil communities could not biotransform nq from an insensitive munition formulation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions indest et al 2017 differently from nq the other nitro compounds in the formulation namely 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan and 3 nitro 1 2 4 triazol 5 one nto were successfully biotransformed similarly a study investigating the fate of insensitive munitions compounds mixtures in soil columns under a simulated rainfall regime observed only 20 nq removal after 60 days temple et al 2018 earlier efforts on nq biotransformation have focused on aerobic processes for example haag et al 1990 observed that a culture enriched from natural waters could transform nq when nutrient broth and yeast extract were added cyanamide was identified as the only product from the aerobic nq transformation later perreault et al 2012 isolated the variovorax strain vc1 which could grow using 50 Âµm nq as the sole nitrogen source aerobic nq degradation was triggered when oxygen glucose and succinate were provided the products detected were nitrourea nh3 n2o and co2 another study evaluated the aerobic degradation of the constituents of an insensitive munition formulation dnan nto and nq using a soil enrichment culture richard and weidhaas 2014 they observed that dnan and nq were utilized as nitrogen sources and detected nitrourea was the main nq degradation product because contaminated environments are heterogeneous presenting anaerobic aerobic redox zones the uncontrolled transformation of nq can occur in both scenarios thus it is necessary to understand the metabolic pathways end products nutrient requirements and potential microorganisms involved in the nq anaerobic biotransformation unlike nq aerobic degradation only one study has reported nq anaerobic biotransformation so far kaplan et al 1982 the authors reported that nq was cometabolized by anaerobic sludge to nitrosoguanidine nsoq in a rich nutrient broth then nsoq was abiotically transformed into cyanamide cyanoguanidine and melamine although kaplan et al 1982 presented important findings the nq anaerobic biotransformation mechanisms remained elusive besides the input nq and output nsoq very little is known about the mechanisms involved this study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms associated with nq anaerobic biotransformation to expand our understanding of nq environmental fate and improve the process control for engineering applications to achieve this goal we first developed an nq reducing anaerobic enrichment culture and identified the primary products from nq biotransformation then we uncovered the mechanisms by investigating the preference for different electron donors the possible role of nq as a nitrogen source and different strategies to enhance nq reduction additionally we studied the molecular ecology of the nq reducing enrichment

mm lactate and 2 5 v v ecc once nq was converted to nsoq we monitored the fate of nsoq in the biotic assays the nsoq concentration was monitored in the same medium it was produced in the presence of

discussion 3 1 electron donors and products of nq biotransformation the nq reducing culture was initially developed in a rich medium with 10 mm pyruvate and 2500 mg l 1 yeast extract ec a according to fig 1 to simplify the medium composition we evaluated the response of nq reducers to alternative electron donors including pyruvate lactate succinate and acetate under a lower concentration of yeast extract 50 mg l 1 fig s1 the assays amended with pyruvate and lactate presented 17 and 35 nq reduction respectively over 9 days fig s1 the other electron donors did not promote nq reduction since lactate assays reached a higher nq removal than pyruvate we selected lactate as the electron donor for further experiments ec b fig 2 shows that nq was biotransformed in an assay with 10 mm lactate and inoculated with the ec b no nq transformation was observed in the abiotic control or when lactate was absent i e endogenous control indicating that the transformation is biologically mediated and dependent on electron donor availability during the first 10 days around 40 of nq was biotransformed then 5 mm lactate was refed to the culture which allowed for the complete removal of nq this suggests that nq biotransformation stopped because other anaerobic processes depleted the initial 10 mm lactate the role of lactate as the true electron donor for nq reduction and the competition for lactate availability are further discussed in sections 3 3 to 3 5 nq biotransformation started with the reduction of the nitro group and nsoq was observed as the immediate product as previously reported kaplan et al 1982 nsoq was confirmed in our study via mass spectrophotometry lc ms in positive ion mode m h fig s2 it presented a protonated mass at m z 89 0463 corresponding to the molecular formula ch5n4o with an error of 0 40 ppm since the reference standard for nsoq is not commercially available nsoq was semiquantitatively analyzed via hplc dad thus the results are presented as peak areas fig 2 after nq biotransformation to nsoq nsoq gradually disappeared fig 2 its fate was governed by abiotic reactions as discussed in section 3 7 3 2 nitrogen source experiments were conducted to determine whether the anaerobic enrichment culture could use nq as the sole nitrogen source first we examined bioassays with lactate or pyruvate either with or without yeast extract 50 mg l 1 fig s3 after 4 days we refed 5 mm electron donor to ensure the complete reduction of nq both pyruvate and lactate sustained the nq reduction but the transformation was conditioned by the availability of yeast extract fig s3 then we conducted a second experiment to discern if the yeast extract served as a source of nitrogen or vitamins and if nq itself could be used as the nitrogen source in this case yeast extract or nh4cl 25 mg l 1 each were tested as nitrogen sources compared to a treatment without an external nitrogen source lactate 10 mm was used as the electron donor as shown in fig 3 nq reduction required the addition of an external nitrogen source being completed only in the assays with yeast extract or nh4cl in the assay where nq was the sole nitrogen source the nq disappearance was about 20 with a negligible formation of nsoq in contrast with aerobic nq degraders which use nq as the sole nitrogen source perreault et al 2012 richard and weidhaas 2014 the anaerobic nq reducing culture could not benefit from nq s high nitrogen content 53 8 in mass therefore nq anaerobic biotransformation relies on external nitrogen sources 3 3 nq reduction vs methanogenesis in anaerobic enrichment cultures the transformation of organic compounds can be affected by competitive interaction between different microorganisms including fermenters methanogens and sulfate reducers li et al 2021 patidar and tare 2005 therefore we investigated the effect of inhibiting methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in nq reduction by using besa and molybdate respectively biswas et al 2009 liu et al 2011 besa is an analog of coenzyme m in methanogenic archaea whose concentrations between 5 and 50 mm are reported to block ch4 formation liu et al 2011 molybdate is a structural analog of sulfate that inhibits atp sulfurylase the first enzyme involved in sulfate activation in sulfate reducing bacteria when present in concentrations in the order of mm biswas et al 2009 another treatment tested the effect of a higher sulfate concentration 1 mm on nq reduction fig 4 shows the nq transformation in the presence of the different additives i e besa molybdate and sulfate compared with the treatment without additives i e lactate nq only the results show that nq reduction was dependent on lactate availability in the assay without additives lactate nq lactate was 100 depleted by day 4 as a result nq transformation was truncated due to the lack of lactate presenting only 39 of nq removal fig 4a and b on the other hand in the presence of 25 mm besa 1 mm lactate was still available on day 4 enabling the complete removal of nq by day 6 fig 4a the availability of 1 mm of lactate is more than enough to promote the reduction of 1 mm nq for example the incomplete oxidation of 1 mm of lactate to acetate yields 4 reducing milliequivalents e meq whereas the transformation of 1 mm nq to nsoq requires only 2 e meq a separate experiment demonstrated that besa completely inhibited methanogenesis in this culture figs s4 and s5 besa addition alters the electron flux exchanged by microorganisms during the successive bioreactions of the anaerobic digestion i e acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis saady 2013 for example the inhibition of methanogens causes the accumulation of acetate and h2 consequently acidogenic bacteria respond to acetate accumulation by shifting their metabolism from acetate production to more reduced products such as propionate and butyrate or from volatile fatty acids to alcohol production saady 2013 hence this unbalance could allow more lactate to be available for nq reduction we also evaluated the effect of different concentrations of besa on nq transformation and found that besa concentrations as low as 5 mm exhibited the same effect as higher concentrations up to 50 mm allowing the complete reduction of 1 mm nq fig s6 because the enrichment culture was not dominated by a methanogenic community as discussed in section 3 8 a relatively low besa concentration 5 mm could efficiently inhibit methanogenesis liu et al 2011 3 4 nq reduction vs sulfate reduction sulfate reduction preceded nq reduction for the assay amended with 1 mm sulfate sulfide was produced until day 4 with a maximum concentration of 0 91 mm corresponding to 91 s recovery fig 4g only after sulfate reduction to sulfide reached its maximum around 15 of nq was reduced to nsoq fig 4a sulfate reduction preceding nq reduction was also observed in another experiment in which nq and sulfate were present with the same electron acceptor capacity i e 8 e meq 4 mm nq and 1 mm sulfate lactate was available in excess fig s7 the standard reduction potential of sulfate reduction to sulfide is 200 mv connell and patrick 1968 which is higher than that reported for nq reduction 700 mv niedÅºwiecka and finneran 2015 validating our observation that sulfate is a more favorable electron acceptor we also tested whether molybdate a sulfate reduction inhibitor would affect nq reduction the addition of molybdate inhibited our enrichment culture lactate was only partially utilized resulting in low bacterial growth fig 4c and d nq was not transformed despite lactate availability indicating that nq reduction was also inhibited this gives us an initial clue that the nq reducing culture was dominated by sulfate reducing bacteria which was later proven by molecular analysis section 3 8 because nq reduction was hindered by molybdate we performed a separate experiment to investigate whether nq reduction was abiotically driven by the sulfide produced from sulfate reduction fig s8 the experiment followed a previously described protocol menezes et al 2021 no abiotic nq reduction was observed in the presence of sulfide in large excess as a bulk reducing agent which provides evidence that nq was indeed biologically transformed 3 5 evidence of lactate as the true electron donor for nq reduction for all treatments bacterial growth was coupled with lactate consumption fig 4c and d demonstrating that the culture used lactate for growth important growth parameters can be derived from the results presented in fig 4 the cell yield was 2 21 0 06 g vss mol 1 lactate in the same range as those previously reported for anaerobic lactate utilizing communities seeliger et al 2002 additionally the culture presented a specific growth rate of 0 7 0 1 day 1 with a doubling time of 1 0 0 1 days calculated based on the vss increase in the treatment without additives lactate fermentation oxidation formed acetate and propionate however those products accumulated throughout incubation and did not serve as electron donors for nq reduction fig 4e and f to confirm this hypothesis we assessed acetate propionate and h2 products of anaerobic lactate degradation as electron donors for the nq reducing culture in separate experiments figs s9 and s10 no nq reduction was observed when these compounds were provided as electron donors in addition the bacterial growth was visually negligible compared with the growth observed in the presence of lactate thus lactate itself and not its fermentation oxidation products was the true electron donor for nq reduction lactate oxidation is thermodynamically preferred compared to acetate and propionate oxidation detman et al 2018 furthermore lactate is reported as a product of pyruvate fermentation wagner et al 2005 which can explain the effectiveness of pyruvate as an electron donor during the initial stage of the culture ec a the fermentation of lactate to acetate and propionate by diverse fermenting microorganisms is an energetically favorable reaction 56 7 kj per mol lactate the fermentation of 3 mols of lactate is expected to form 2 mols of propionate and 1 mol of acetate reaction 1 seeliger et al 2002 1 3 lactate 2 propionate acetate hco3 h however we observed a similar concentration of acetate and propionate fig 4e and 4f suggesting that propionate was consumed during the incubation time or acetate was produced by an alternative pathway lactate can be oxidized incompletely to acetate coupled with a favorable electron acceptor reduction for instance sulfate reducing bacteria incompletely oxidize lactate to acetate using sulfate reaction 2 newman et al 1997 tebo and obraztsova 1998 2 2 lactate so4 2 2 acetate 2 hco3 hs h based on our results we hypothesized that nq reduction was coupled to incomplete lactate oxidation to acetate reaction 3 3 lactate 2 nq acetate 2 nsoq hco3 h this hypothesis is supported by our results that demonstrate that the simplified substrates of the enrichment culture selected for a sulfate reducing community see section 3 8 that utilizes lactate as a unique electron donor and sulfate as an electron acceptor while competing with nq as an electron sink 3 6 decreasing nq reduction lag phase an extended microbial lag phase represents an important disadvantage for nq reduction since other processes with shorter lag phases can deplete the electron donor and hinder nq transformation for example we observed that the nq biotransformation rate significantly improved when the nq reducing culture was transferred during the exponential phase 4 day old culture compared to a transfer made in the decay phase 14 day old culture fig s11 when the culture in the decay phase was used as inoculum for a new transfer nq reduction was only 39 due to the extended lag phase on the other hand when the culture in the exponential phase was used as inoculum for a new transfer nq was 94 7 reduced within 4 to 5 days without lactate refeeding by eliminating the lag phase nq reduction could outcompete the other process e g lactate fermentation and sulfate reduction and take advantage of the large availability of lactate overall we found three effective strategies to enhance nq reduction against the competition for lactate in the enrichment culture i lactate refeeding or dosage over the incubation time to sustain the nq transformation during longer periods ii inhibition of methanogenesis by besa in concentrations equal or higher than 5 mm and iii use of a culture in the exponential growth phase as inoculum to shorten the lag phase of nq reduction 3 7 fate of nsoq during the nq biotransformation the formation of nsoq as the main product was followed by its gradual disappearance figs 1 and s3 although a previous study suggested that nsoq transformation could be abiotic kaplan et al 1982 the literature lacks experiments showing whether microbial reduction could play any role in nsoq transformation thus we tested nsoq disappearance in both biotic and abiotic conditions with and without a refeeding of lactate nsoq disappeared at the same rate in both biotic and abiotic conditions fig 5a nsoq disappearance 83 0 1 9 over 13 days was accompanied by the formation of 0 49 0 05 mm cyanamide fig 5b these results provide evidence that nsoq transformation was solely abiotic cyanamide is formed from the autodecomposition of nsoq in aqueous solution kaplan et al 1982 additionally previous works focusing on the abiotic transformation of nq cataloged nsoq as a transient unstable intermediate becher et al 2019 however under the anoxic conditions tested in our study nsoq disappeared at a relatively slow rate 0 119 0 008 day 1 other previously reported products from nsoq transformation such as cyanoguanidine and melamine kaplan et al 1982 were not detected guanidine a product recently detected during nq abiotic transformation by reactive minerals rios valenciana et al 2022 was also not detected although nq was reported as a carcinogen and nsoq is a suspected carcinogen previous tests with cyanamide have observed no mutagenic activity suggesting cyanamide may be more benign than nq and nsoq kaplan et al 1982 the intermediate nsoq is considered to cause a higher ecotoxicity than nq becher et al 2019 however more studies are necessary to understand whether cyanamide or the products from its further transformation could cause increased ecotoxicity since the studies so far have only analyzed mixtures of many products from nq phototransformation gust et al 2017 kennedy et al 2017 3 8 bacterial community associated with nq reduction currently no information on bacterial communities able to anaerobically biotransform nq is available only one study characterized a soil microbial community associated with the transformation of an insensitive munitions formulation composed in part of nq however this microbial community could not transform nq indest et al 2017 therefore we explored the microbial composition of the nq reducing culture based on the characterization of the 16s rrna gene fig s12 shows the rarefaction curves of the sequences fig 6 presents the relative abundances of different phylogenetic groups determined in 3 different stages of the nq reducing culture and different assays fig s13 shows a heat map comparing the communities the presented values are averages of triplicate analysis first we analyzed ec a the initial enrichment culture grown in a rich medium with 10 mm pyruvate and 2500 mg l 1 yeast extract it presented the highest diversity among the communities analyzed presenting 253 40 operational taxonomic units otus as explained earlier after we evaluated different electron donors pyruvate was replaced by lactate and yeast extract concentration was decreased to 50 mg l 1 ec b to simplify the culture medium the switch from pyruvate to lactate and the drastic decrease in yeast extract concentration reduced the number of otus to 199 44 and changed the structure of the microbial community the sulfate reducing bacterium cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus which exhibited a relative abundance of only 0 1 in ec a became the dominant phylogenetic group 41 2 in ec b the relative abundances of other phylogenetic groups such as dendrosporobacter spp anaerotignum propionicum raoultibacter massiliensis and acetoanaerobium spp significantly increased in ec b compared to the ec a fig s14 later switching the nitrogen source from yeast extract ec b to ammonium chloride ecc also caused changes in the microbial community the number of otus in ecc 116 20 decreased even more compared to ec b 199 44 which evidences the enrichment process the culture was undergoing cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus became even more abundant 63 1 to the detriment of anaerotignum propionicum and acetoanaerobium spp fig s15 as a guide table 1 presents the closest isolated organisms and some phylogenetic and physiologic features of the main genera involved in the enriched nq reducing microbial community we also explored shifts in the microbial community structure of ecc due to different additives such as besa and sulfate in the presence and absence of nq assays with molybdate were not included in the 16s rrna gene analysis since they exhibited minimal bacterial growth although we observed methane production methanogens were detected in very low abundance for example in the presence of nq and lactate the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter arboriphilus was only 1 3 in ecc although besa improved nq reduction efficiency no statically significant differences were observed between the communities growing with and without besa in the presence of nq which corroborates with the similar profile of bacterial growth and organic acids production between these assays fig 4 finally when sulfate was absent the relative abundance of the primarily sulfate reducing bacterium cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus decreased in contrast raoultibacter massiliensis became relatively more abundant fig s16 the most enriched phylogenetic group in our culture cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus was classified as desulfovibrio oxamicus until very recently wan et al 2021 cupidesulfovibrium oxamicus is a sulfate reducing bacterium enriched and isolated in a modified postgate b medium the main components of this medium are sodium lactate nh4cl and yeast extract li et al 2022 which were also present during the enrichment of our culture additionally previous studies determined that cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus does not grow in acetate propionate succinate or h2 but grows in lactate or pyruvate wan et al 2021 thus the molecular ecology results validate our findings on the electron donors and nitrogen source needed for nq reduction cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus is a versatile bacterium able to reduce sulfate nitrate sb v and u vi in the presence of lactate table 1 li et al 2022 pietzsch and babel 2003 it also presents fermentative growth in the absence of electron acceptors table 1 wan et al 2021 other phylogenetic groups significantly enriched in the nq reducing conditions were dendrosporobacter spp and raoultibacter massiliensis which presented a statistically significant increase when nq was present compared to the assays without nq figs s16 and s17 the dendrosporobacter genus can ferment lactate to acetate and propionate table 1 and has also been found to coexist with sulfate reducing bacteria in sulfidogenic reactors dar et al 2008 in the near absence of sulfate dendrosporobacter like species can outcompete sulfate reducing bacteria dar et al 2008 strÃ¶mpl et al 2000 the other enriched member raoultibacter massiliensis was isolated from the feces of a healthy saudi bedouin traore et al 2019 there are no reports associating raoultibacter massiliensis with the biotransformation or degradation of contaminants so far table 1 overall the microbial ecology results show the enrichment of a sulfate reducing and fermentative culture due to conditions required for nq reduction in agreement cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus and dendrosporobacter are good representatives of sulfate reducing and fermentative activities respectively this is the first description of a microbial community associated with nq anaerobic biotransformation which can be highly enriched by the use of appropriate electron donors and nitrogen sources and later applied for nq reduction additionally our results e g proposed strategies to enhance nq reduction can assist the possible isolation of nq reducing bacteria and the elucidation of specific bacterial functions by future studies on nq anaerobic biotransformation 4 conclusions the results elucidate the mechanisms of nq anaerobic biotransformation establishing conditions under which the process occurs nq transformation is driven by the interaction of biotic and abiotic processes initially nq was microbially reduced to nsoq the further transformation of nsoq was found to be abiotic and coupled with the formation of cyanamide the simplified substrates of the enrichment process selected a sulfate reducing enrichment that utilized lactate as the electron donor and sulfate as an electron acceptor that competed with nq as an electron sink a unique property of the culture was its requirement for exogenous nitrogen since nq itself did not serve as a nitrogen source effective strategies to enhance nq reduction were lactate refeeding over the incubation time besa addition or the use of cells in the exponential growth phase as inoculum the nq reducing culture was mainly composed of sulfate reducing and fermentative microorganisms such as cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus the culture s most abundant member dendrosporobacter spp and raoultibacter massiliensis remarkably the main conditions required for nq reduction such as the preference for lactate and the need for external nitrogen addition corresponded to the physiological properties of cupidesulfovibrio oxamicus the results presented here expand the understanding of nq environmental fate and allow for the development of nq bioremediation strategies declaration of
