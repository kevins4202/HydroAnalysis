entry 1 introduction the water entry for moving objects involves interactions among solid objects water and air this process includes the fluid structure interaction and the multiphase flow the water entry of objects happens usually in nature and has a wide range of applications in ocean engineering previous studies mainly concentrated on variations of geometric parameters of objects and entry angle if variations of the entry velocity and the density of an object are involved into this problem it will become more complex up to now the experimental method the numerical method and the theoretical analysis are widely employed to study the problem of water entry previous investigators conducted many experiments with advanced photography technologies as early as the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century worthington and cole 1900 designed an experimental device to capture the image of the high speed impact dynamics to study the effect of spinning on hydrophobic and hydrophilic spheres techet and truscott 2011 experimentally investigated the trajectories the forces and the cavity formation behind spheres their data showed that compared with spinning motion the cavity formation was more important for the lift force acting on the sphere and the cavity collapse caused the reduction of the lift force on hydrophobic sphere wei and hu 2014 studied the complex fluid dynamics of the cylinder entering water horizontally under low froude numbers they found that the critical velocity of forming a complete cavity for a sphere was much higher than that for a cylinder and the cavity shape inversion behavior was more apparent for a longer cylinder assisted with a high speed camera chen et al 2019 a investigated the relationships between the trajectory stability and the factors including the nose shape the impact velocity and the entry angle they found that the trajectory instability was correlated with the impact velocity and the entry angle zeraatgar et al 2019 studied the effect of sampling rate on impact pressure in experiments for the water entry of a wedge various wedges with deadrise angles of 5 35 entered the water surface and the impact pressure at different sampling rates was recorded the analysis showed that for a wedge with deadrise angles of 25 or higher the sampling rate of 25 khz was a good choice and the sampling rate of 600 khz was suitable for the measurement with deadrise angles 5f recently more researches have turned to numerical methods gu et al 2014 used two fluid free surface solver to study the water entry of the solid bodies with various shapes in a vertical and an oblique entry angle they numerically simulated the water entry processes of semi cylindrical symmetric and asymmetric wedges their results were consistent with experimental data and other numerical results abraham et al 2014 coupled vof gas liquid flow model with shear stress transport sst turbulence model to numerically simulate the water entry process of a sphere with a vertical entry angle they found that the momentum conversion between the entering object and its surrounding flow generated a drag while the friction damping effect could be neglected in the early stage of the entry process liu and ding 2015 combined immersed boundary method diffuse interface model and moving contact lines mcls model to investigate the process of water entry they also studied the process of a droplet impacting on the solid wall for the flow with low froude numbers iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 numerically studied the water entry process of a horizontal cylinder and simulated the solid liquid interactions on the free surface moreover effects of cylinder diameter length impact velocity and the density ratio between a cylinder and water on the trajectory of the cylinder were studied in their simulation nair and bhattacharyya 2018 used vof method to track the free surface and their results had good agreement with experimental data they also calculated the impact pressure generated by the entry of a sphere wang et al 2019 proposed a gd sph method to simulate the slamming force the deflection and the stresses of an object in addition a particle dynamic refinement strategy was proposed and applied to water entry simulations in 1930s von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 calculated the impact load generated by a solid entering into water with theoretical methods their studies provided a solid foundation for studying the water entry problem recently there is a popularity of combining theoretical and experimental methods to study this problem in this way duclaux et al 2007 investigated the entry processes of a sphere and a cylinder with a vertical entry angle when the bond number was higher and the froude number ranged from 1 to 80 they also presented a model to solve the collapse of the spherical cavity in liquid aristoff et al 2010 experimentally and theoretically studied the water entry processes of low density spheres they focused on the sphere dynamics as well as the relationship between the deceleration of a sphere and the shape of a cavity experiments of the vertical water entry and the related theoretical analysis have been conducted by van nuffel et al 2014 to study the local pressure generated by a cylindrical bottom slamming they found that a higher impact velocity could generate a higher impact pressure while the deadrise angle was less important to the impact pressure and in this case the stochastic nature of the slamming event played an important role except these erfanian et al 2015 studied the water entry problem of the spherical nose projectile with a six degree of freedom rigid body motion their numerical method was based on the coupled euler lagrange cel method and the accuracy of their method was also validated experimentally although many valuable results guo et al 2012 t chen et al 2019b have been obtained for the water entry problem recently we would like to present a different numerical method to analyze the cavity shape and the hydrodynamic characteristics during the water entry process of hydrophobic objects in this paper a numerical method based on vof method and boundary data immersion method bdim is presented the effectiveness and the robustness of this method are also tested in addition effects of the density of the object and water entry velocity on numerical results are taken into consideration 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations for hydrophobic objects the numerical method starts from the assumption that the gas and the liquid involved here are both incompressible fluids ignoring the compressibility of the fluid the fluid density can be treated as a constant for incompressible fluids the momentum equation in navier stokes equations can be described as 1 u t u u 1 ρ p υ δ u σ κ δ s m ρ g where ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of fluid u is the velocity vector p is the pressure σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the local curvature of the gas liquid interface m is the normal vector of the interface between the gas and the liquid δ s is the dirac function of the interface and g is the gravity acceleration the curvature κ can be calculated by 2 κ c c where c is the volume fraction function for the liquid phase the above normal vector m can be calculated by the vof method as shown in section 2 3 while it needs to be modified at the position where three phases contact because of the hydrophobicity of the immersed objects as shown in fig 1 θ d is the dynamic contact angle previous study kistler 1993 supply an empirical equation to describe the relationship between it and the static contact angle θ s 3 θ d f h μ u c l σ f h 1 θ s where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and u c l is the spreading velocity of the contact line f h 1 θ s is the inverse form of the hoffman function f h θ s hoffman 1975 which is defined as 4 f h θ s cos 1 1 2 tanh 5 16 θ s 1 1 31 θ s 0 99 0 706 and then the modified normal vector m can be represented as 5 m m l sin θ d m s cos θ d where m l is the unit vector parallel to the solid surface and m s is the unit normal vector directed into the solid surface to apply equation 1 into bdim the equation is arranged as 6 f u p u u 0 δ t u u 1 ρ p υ δ u σ κ δ s m ρ g 0 for incompressible fluids the continuity equation is 7 u 0 then the governing equation of the moving body is introduced the velocity vector of the solid object is u u 1 u 2 u 3 t the angular velocity is ω ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 t the acceleration and the angular acceleration are represented as a a 1 a 2 a 3 t and β β 1 β 2 β 3 t respectively because the non slip boundary condition is applied to the interface between solid body and fluids the motion equation of the solid object is given as 8 b u u 0 u 0 taking the viscous force and the pressure into consideration the force f and the torque t acting on the solid object are 9 f a p m υ ρ u m d a 10 t a r p m υ ρ u m d a where a is the area of the element cell on the solid surface then the acceleration a and the angular acceleration β at the centroid of the solid body can be calculated by 11 a f m g 12a β 1 t 1 j 3 j 2 ω 2 ω 3 j 1 12b β 2 t 2 j 1 j 3 ω 1 ω 3 j 2 12c β 3 t 3 j 2 j 1 ω 1 ω 2 j 3 where j 1 j 2 and j 3 are the moments of inertia about x y and z axes respectively for solid bodies the no slip boundary condition is applied and the velocity u at n 1 moment can be derived as 13 u n 1 u n a β r δ t noting that r refers to the radius for a sphere and the radius of bottom surface for a cylinder 2 2 boundary data immersion method for the problem of the moving solid body immersed in fluids boundary data immersion method bdim weymouth and yue 2011 is a good choice here a simple review is provided as shown in fig 2 the solid domain ω b the fluid domain ω f and the boundary domain ω s between these two fields consist the whole calculation domain governing equations of these three domains are different here they can be represented as 14 b u x b t 0 x b ω b 15 f u p x f t 0 x f ω f 16 s u u p x s t 0 x s ω s to make the simulation effective these three governing equations are combined using bdim the mixture equation which can be used in the whole domain is 17 b u δ ε b f u p 1 δ ε b 0 where the function δ ε b can be calculated as δ ε b x 1 2 1 sin π 2 d ε f o r x ε 1 f o r x ε 0 e l s e 2 3 vof method in this study vof method gueyffier et al 1999 is adapted to track the gas liquid interface the whole calculation domain contains water air and solid body the calculation is operated in the cartesian coordinate system and the interface is tracked and reconstructed by the volume fraction c of the liquid when a cell is filled with liquid the value of c is set 1 if a cell contains no liquid c is 0 the case where c ranges from 0 to 1 means that this cell is defined as the interface the governing equation of the volume fraction c of liquid is 18 c t u c 0 the normal vector m of the free surface can be calculated as 19 m c c the mixture density ρ and the mixture kinematic viscosity υ in the gas liquid flow are calculated by 20 ρ c ρ w a t e r 1 c ρ a i r 21 υ c υ w a t e r 1 c υ a i r where ρ w a t e r is the water density and ρ a i r is the air density υ w a t e r is the water kinematic viscosity and υ a i r is the air kinematic viscosity 2 4 two step projection method the two step projection method pasandidehfard et al 2002 is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations firstly the advection term and the body force are discretized to obtain u n 1 2 22 u n 1 2 u n δ t δ b u n u n 1 δ b u n u n υ n δ u n σ κ δ s m ρ n g n secondly the velocity at n 1 time step can be calculated by 23 u n 1 u n 1 2 δ t 1 δ b ρ n p n if apply the divergence operator to equation 23 the pressure poison equation can be obtained 24 1 ρ n p n 1 u n 1 2 δ t 2 5 simulation setup simulations are firstly performed on the sphere whose diameter is d 0 0254 m the initial entry velocity is u 0 3 43 m s and the initial rotational angular velocity is 0 the calculation domain is filled with 420 240 240 uniform grids and the grid size is 0 05 d the water field height is 8 d and the air field height is 2 d physical variables and parameters involved in simulations are all non dimensional with u 0 and d the second case for the water entry of a spinning sphere has the initial velocity u 0 2 50 m s and the rotational angular velocity ω 95 r a d s simulations are also performed on a cylinder object the diameter of the cylinder bottom surface is d 0 05 m and its length is 4 d the initial entry velocity is u 0 6 22 m s and the initial rotational angular velocity is 0 the calculation domain is filled with 600 600 320 uniform grids and the grid size is 0 05 d the calculation domain contains the water field and the gas field whose heights are 8 d and 2 d respectively physical variables and parameters involved in simulations are all non dimensional with u 0 and d the computational sketch is shown in fig 3 3 validation 3 1 water entry of a sphere without rotation to validate the effectiveness and the accuracy of this numerical method the simulation is performed for the water entry problem of a sphere simulation results are compared with experimental results truscott et al 2012 in same conditions fig 4 shows the comparisons of the dimensionless displacement x d and the dimensionless acceleration a x g both in the vertical direction it can be found that there are good agreements between the simulation results and experimental data truscott et al 2012 in both items comparisons of the cavity shape are also given in fig 5 in fig 5 the two lines of images are experimental results truscott et al 2012 and numerical results at the same time respectively the time interval between every two adjacent pictures is 7 1 m s fig 5 indicates that simulation results are matched well with the experimental results truscott et al 2012 from the sphere entering water to the end of the deep closure and then the discussion of a mesh refinement study and a timestep independence study are conducted here to understand the effect of grid size on simulation results three grid sizes 0 05 d 2 1 3 0 05 d 0 05 d 2 1 3 are adopted in calculations the comparison of the dimensionless vertical displacement x d is shown in fig 6 in can be found that the numerical results can become more consistent with experimental results when a smaller grid size is chosen the grid size 0 05 d is a better choice because it can lead to not only accurate results but also the reduction of calculation time on the other hand the comparison of different timesteps is also presented in fig 7 to study the timestep independence the timestep is cut in half and doubled on the existing basis respectively the comparison shows that the current timestep is suitable because of its accuracy and smaller calculation cost moreover several three dimensional figures are shown in later sections and it can be found that the existence of surrounding boundaries will not affect the process of water entry therefore the current calculation domain is enough 3 2 water entry of a sphere with rotation the validation of the sphere with rotation is conducted in this section here the initial entry velocity of the sphere is u 0 2 50 m s the rotational angular velocity is ω 95 r a d s the froude number is f r u 0 g d 11 4 the density ratio between the sphere and the water is ρ ρ s ρ l 1 74 and the diameter of the sphere is d 57 2 m m fig 8 shows the comparison of the displacement between numerical results and experiment data techet and truscott 2011 as shown in fig 8 the numerical predictions are in a good agreement with the experimental observations techet and truscott 2011 the comparison results of the cavity shape are presented in the 2d cross section views from the top and the side views to give a better insight the time of the first image is 1 8 m s and the time interval between every two adjacent pictures is 15 3 m s from these pictures in fig 9 and fig 10 it can be seen that numerical results match the experimental result well from the sphere entering water to occurring the pinch off 3 3 water entry of a vertical cylinder in this subsection the validation is performed on a cylinder to match the experimental conditions wei and hu 2014 the entry velocity is u 0 6 22 m s the froude number is f r 79 0 the density ratio between the cylinder and the water is ρ 1 37 the bottom surface diameter and the length of cylinder are d 50 m m and l 200 m m respectively fig 11 shows the comparison of the displacement in the vertical direction between numerical calculations and experiment data wei and hu 2014 comparisons of the water entry process are provided in fig 12 and fig 13 from t 12 m s a cavity forms above the cylinder at t 36 m s as the splash grows upward an approximately vertical water crown forms over the free surface when t 12 74 m s the two pairs of intersecting lines at the ends of the cylinder move faster than the other parts of the cavity and begin to approach each other at t 102 m s two pairs of intersecting lines are closed and two new intersecting lines generate and the new lines also move faster than the other parts when t 120 m s as the newly formed two intersecting lines move a cavity shape inversion behavior occurs the cross section of the forming process of this behavior is shown in fig 14 the vortex identification value q and the velocity vector analysis associated with the entering process are also provided in fig 15 and fig 16 in two different views at the beginning positive and negative q values are distributed along the surface of the cylinder alternately when the cylinder is immersed in the water completely these areas gradually decrease the cavity gradually expands as the cylinder falling and the positive and negative q values appear again in the vicinity of the cavity for the velocity term the direction of the fluid velocity around the cylinder is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder and outward at the early stage of the entry the cavity expands shrinks and finally closes during the above process the direction of the fluid velocity near the cavity is always consistent with the direction of the cavity changing 4 results 4 1 simulation results of the sphere with various sphere densities in this subsection the effect of sphere density on numerical results are studied spheres with the density ratios ρ of 0 7 1 2 3 9 7 8 respectively are adopted in these four simulations same water entry velocity u 0 3 43 m s and same sphere diameter d 25 4 m m are chosen numerical results are compared with experimental data and the characteristics analysis on the cavity and the dynamics analysis of the sphere are also conducted 4 1 1 characteristic analysis of cavity when a solid body enters water an air cavity then generates the pinch off phenomenon occurs at the same time of the cavity closure this phenomenon is an important characteristic of the cavity fig 17 shows three dimensional comparisons of the pinch off moments for the spheres with different density ratios it can be seen from this figure that as the density ratio ρ of the sphere decreases the closure time of the cavity decreases the depth of the sphere at the pinch off moment also decreases but the characteristic length of the cavity increases to make comparisons more specific the closure position x p the closure depth x p i n c h and the closure time t p i n c h are shown in table 1 it can be found from the table 1 that as the sphere density ratio ρ decreases the closure position x p has a tendency to decrease slowly while the closure depth x p i n c h decreases faster this is the reason why the ratio of the closure position x p to the closure depth x p i n c h increases moreover the sphere with a larger density ratio has a greater inertia and this makes motions of these spheres less affected by the fluid dynamics fig 18 shows the pressure contour the distributions of the vortex q values and the velocity vectors when the sphere with a density ratio ρ 1 2 and the diameter d 25 4 m m enters the water at the initial velocity u 0 3 43 m s from these pictures we can find that before the cavity closing a high pressure zone appears in the front of the sphere while a low pressure zone appears in the tail region of the sphere and it can be found that the pressure of the pinch off position is higher when the cavity closes after the cavity closing the pressure in the tail region of the sphere increases and the areas of low pressure zones on both sides of the sphere decrease for the q value at the beginning of water entry the positive and negative q values above the free surface are alternately distributed as the sphere falling the cavity gradually expands and areas of positive and negative q value regions gradually decrease from the period of the cavity bubble shrinking to its closing the alternating distributions of positive and negative q values near the cavity closure zone become more apparent again at the moment of cavity closure the q values near the closure point are negative this indicates that the shear effect plays a dominant role in this closure process overall the rotation effect and the shear effect jointly govern the development the closure and the collapse of the cavity in the early stage of entry process the velocity direction of the fluid around the sphere outwards along radial direction of the sphere with the development of the cavity the direction of fluid velocity near the cavity is consistent with the direction of cavity expansion 4 1 2 dynamics analysis of the sphere to analyze the effect of the sphere density the vertical displacement x d and the vertical velocity u x u 0 of four spheres with different density ratios are studied and results are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 from the both figures it can be seen that the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio is more apparent than the larger one in the early stage of water entry this indicates that the inertia effect dominates this process while the hydrodynamics is less important in other words the sphere with a lower density ratio is greatly affected by the hydrodynamic force rather than the inertial force it is worth to note that when the density ratio ρ of a sphere is less than that of water the sphere will rise moreover after the cavity pinch off the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio is obviously slowed down and when the sphere density ratio ρ is larger than a certain value the velocity decay is no longer obvious 4 2 simulation results of a rotating sphere numerical results are obtained by simulating a rotational sphere in same conditions with the subsection 3 1 2 the pressure contour the distributions of the velocity vector and the vortex q value are analyzed fig 21 shows the pressure contour from the sphere impacting water to the cavity pinch off in the early stage of the entry process the high pressure zone distributes in the front of the sphere as the depth of the sphere increases the speed of the sphere decreases in both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction the area of the high pressure zone is gradually reduced because the resistance of the sphere gradually decreases when the cavity closes the pressure at the pinch off zone becomes large and this causes the appearance of the sputtering flow because of the closure of the cavity the high pressure zone in front of the sphere increases suddenly and the pressure in the low pressure zone on the right side of the sphere increases fig 22 shows the distributions of the velocity vector and the vortex q value during the entry process at the beginning the negative q value appears above the free surface and in the front of the sphere s motion while the positive q value appears near the interface between the sphere and the water as the depth of the sphere increases the negative q value zone above the free surface is getting smaller and smaller and the q value turns to be positive at t 78 3 m s while positive q value near the interface between the sphere and the water are gradually becoming larger the negative q value in front of the sphere has changed a little when the depth of the sphere increases at the moment of cavity pinch off the q value below the pinch off position is negative but the upper is positive 4 3 simulation results of the cylinder with various entry velocities to simulate the effect of entry velocity 4 different water entry velocities are chosen in this section in these simulations the cylinder with a density radio ρ 1 37 is adopted geometrical parameters are the same as the section 3 3 numerical results including the vertical displacement x m the vertical velocity ratio u u 0 and the vertical acceleration ratio a g are shown in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 in fig 23 we can find that the displacement trends with time for four different entry velocities are all consistent with the experimental data wei and hu 2014 it can be seen in fig 24 that there is an inflection point in each curve when time varies from 120 m s to 140 m s the change of the velocity is more apparent for the lower entry velocity fig 25 shows accelerations with respect to time it can be found that accelerations all decrease sharply at the early stage because of the impact between the cylinder and the water surface comparing these four curves we can find that the cylinder with a higher entry velocity has a greater acceleration at the same time and this acceleration decays slower between 20 m s and 100 m s the cylinder with a higher water entry velocity has a larger acceleration there are fluctuations which are resulted from the cavity pinch off in each curve during t 100 140 m s and these are consistent with fig 24 fig 26 and fig 27 show the side view and the front view of the cavity shape inversion behavior for four different water entry velocities cases it can be seen from these figures that the cylinders with different entry velocities all have the shape inversion behavior during the water entry process as the entry velocity increases the time of this phenomenon is shortened however depths of the inversion are almost constant and all near 0 3 m detailed data of the shape inversion behavior is shown in table 2 moreover the sizes of the water crown and the cavity in water both increase as the water entry velocity increases fig 28 and fig 29 show the side view and the front view of the cavity pinch off for three different water entry velocities it can be seen that as the entry velocity increases the height of the water crown also increases when the entry velocities are u 0 4 22 m s and u 0 5 22 m s the cavity shows the closure phenomenon but when entry velocity increases to u 0 6 22 m s there is no apparent closure of the cavity in table 3 we can also find that when the cavity closes the ratio between the pinch off position x p and the pinch off time t p i n c h are the same for different entry velocities 5 conclusion in this paper the water entry problem of hydrophobic objects is numerically simulated effects of object density and entry velocity on the trajectory are investigated fluid dynamic characteristics and the cavity formation are also studied here several conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical method of water entry for spheres and cylinders has been established and the effectiveness and the robustness of this method are validated by the comparison between numerical results and the existing experimental data 2 for the water entry process of spheres the decrease of the sphere density ratio ρ makes the closure location x p the closure depth x p i n c h and the closure time t p i n c h all decrease when the density ratio ρ of a sphere is smaller than that of water the sphere will rise inversely in the early entry stage the velocity decay of the sphere with a low density ratio is more apparent than the higher ones after the cavity pinch off the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio obviously decreases when the density ratio ρ is large to a certain value the velocity decay of the sphere does not change significantly 3 by analyzing the cavity shape generated by the sphere with rotation we can find that the high pressure zone distributes in the front of the sphere s motion as the depth of the sphere increases areas of high pressure zone in front of the sphere are gradually reduced when the cavity closes the pressure in the pinch off zone becomes large the high pressure zone in the front of the sphere increases suddenly and the pressure in the low pressure zone on the right side of the sphere increases at the same time 4 through the analysis of the cavity shape generated by a cylinder the following conclusions can be drawn the numerical method can well simulate the motion of the cross line and the cavity shape inversion behavior in the process of the water entry as the entry velocity increases the time of occurring the cavity shape inversion behavior is shortened for cylinders the entry velocity has little influence on the depth where the cavity shape inversion occurs acknowledgement the present study is funded by the national natural science foundation of china 41776194

navier stokes equations can be described as 1 u t u u 1 ρ p υ δ u σ κ δ s m ρ g where ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of fluid u is the velocity vector p is the pressure σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the local curvature of the gas liquid interface m is the normal vector of the interface between the gas and the liquid δ s is the dirac function of the interface and g is the gravity acceleration the curvature κ can be calculated by 2 κ c c where c is the volume fraction function for the liquid phase the above normal vector m can be calculated by the vof method as shown in section 2 3 while it needs to be modified at the position where three phases contact because of the hydrophobicity of the immersed objects as shown in fig 1 θ d is the dynamic contact angle previous study kistler 1993 supply an empirical equation to describe the relationship between it and the static contact angle θ s 3 θ d f h μ u c l σ f h 1 θ s where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and u c l is the spreading velocity of the contact line f h 1 θ s is the inverse form of the hoffman function f h θ s hoffman 1975 which is defined as 4 f h θ s cos 1 1 2 tanh 5 16 θ s 1 1 31 θ s 0 99 0 706 and then the modified normal vector m can be represented as 5 m m l sin θ d m s cos θ d where m l is the unit vector parallel to the solid surface and m s is the unit normal vector directed into the solid surface to apply equation 1 into bdim the equation is arranged as 6 f u p u u 0 δ t u u 1 ρ p υ δ u σ κ δ s m ρ g 0 for incompressible fluids the continuity equation is 7 u 0 then the governing equation of the moving body is introduced the velocity vector of the solid object is u u 1 u 2 u 3 t the angular velocity is ω ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 t the acceleration and the angular acceleration are represented as a a 1 a 2 a 3 t and β β 1 β 2 β 3 t respectively because the non slip boundary condition is applied to the interface between solid body and fluids the motion equation of the solid object is given as 8 b u u 0 u 0 taking the viscous force and the pressure into consideration the force f and the torque t acting on the solid object are 9 f a p m υ ρ u m d a 10 t a r p m υ ρ u m d a where a is the area of the element cell on the solid surface then the acceleration a and the angular acceleration β at the centroid of the solid body can be calculated by 11 a f m g 12a β 1 t 1 j 3 j 2 ω 2 ω 3 j 1 12b β 2 t 2 j 1 j 3 ω 1 ω 3 j 2 12c β 3 t 3 j 2 j 1 ω 1 ω 2 j 3 where j 1 j 2 and j 3 are the moments of inertia about x y and z axes respectively for solid bodies the no slip boundary condition is applied and the velocity u at n 1 moment can be derived as 13 u n 1 u n a β r δ t noting that r refers to the radius for a sphere and the radius of bottom surface for a cylinder 2 2 boundary data immersion method for the problem of the moving solid body immersed in fluids boundary data immersion method bdim weymouth and yue 2011 is a good choice here a simple review is provided as shown in fig 2 the solid domain ω b the fluid domain ω f and the boundary domain ω s between these two fields consist the whole calculation domain governing equations of these three domains are different here they can be represented as 14 b u x b t 0 x b ω b 15 f u p x f t 0 x f ω f 16 s u u p x s t 0 x s ω s to make the simulation effective these three governing equations are combined using bdim the mixture equation which can be used in the whole domain is 17 b u δ ε b f u p 1 δ ε b 0 where the function δ ε b can be calculated as δ ε b x 1 2 1 sin π 2 d ε f o r x ε 1 f o r x ε 0 e l s e 2 3 vof method in this study vof method gueyffier et al 1999 is adapted to track the gas liquid interface the whole calculation domain contains water air and solid body the calculation is operated in the cartesian coordinate system and the interface is tracked and reconstructed by the volume fraction c of the liquid when a cell is filled with liquid the value of c is set 1 if a cell contains no liquid c is 0 the case where c ranges from 0 to 1 means that this cell is defined as the interface the governing equation of the volume fraction c of liquid is 18 c t u c 0 the normal vector m of the free surface can be calculated as 19 m c c the mixture density ρ and the mixture kinematic viscosity υ in the gas liquid flow are calculated by 20 ρ c ρ w a t e r 1 c ρ a i r 21 υ c υ w a t e r 1 c υ a i r where ρ w a t e r is the water density and ρ a i r is the air density υ w a t e r is the water kinematic viscosity and υ a i r is the air kinematic viscosity 2 4 two step projection method the two step projection method pasandidehfard et al 2002 is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations firstly the advection term and the body force are discretized to obtain u n 1 2 22 u n 1 2 u n δ t δ b u n u n 1 δ b u n u n υ n δ u n σ κ δ s m ρ n g n secondly the velocity at n 1 time step can be calculated by 23 u n 1 u n 1 2 δ t 1 δ b ρ n p n if apply the divergence operator to equation 23 the pressure poison equation can be obtained 24 1 ρ n p n 1 u n 1 2 δ t 2 5 simulation setup simulations are firstly performed on the sphere whose diameter is d 0 0254 m the initial entry velocity is u 0 3 43 m s and the initial rotational angular velocity is 0 the calculation domain is filled with 420 240 240 uniform grids and the grid size is 0 05 d the water field height is 8 d and the air field height is 2 d physical variables and parameters involved in simulations are all non dimensional with u 0 and d the second case for the water entry of a spinning sphere has the initial velocity u 0 2 50 m s and the rotational angular velocity ω 95 r a d s simulations are also performed on a cylinder object the diameter of the cylinder bottom surface is d 0 05 m and its length is 4 d the initial entry velocity is u 0 6 22 m s and the initial rotational angular velocity is 0 the calculation domain is filled with 600 600 320 uniform grids and the grid size is 0 05 d the calculation domain contains the water field and the gas field whose heights are 8 d and 2 d respectively physical variables and parameters involved in simulations are all non dimensional with u 0 and d the computational sketch is shown in fig 3 3 validation 3 1 water entry of a sphere without rotation to validate the effectiveness and the accuracy of this numerical method the simulation is performed for the water entry problem of a sphere simulation results are compared with experimental results truscott et al 2012 in same conditions fig 4 shows the comparisons of the dimensionless displacement x d and the dimensionless acceleration a x g both in the vertical direction it can be found that there are good agreements between the simulation results and experimental data truscott et al 2012 in both items comparisons of the cavity shape are also given in fig 5 in fig 5 the two lines of images are experimental results truscott et al 2012 and numerical results at the same time respectively the time interval between every two adjacent pictures is 7 1 m s fig 5 indicates that simulation results are matched well with the experimental results truscott et al 2012 from the sphere entering water to the end of the deep closure and then the discussion of a mesh refinement study and a timestep independence study are conducted here to understand the effect of grid size on simulation results three grid sizes 0 05 d 2 1 3 0 05 d 0 05 d 2 1 3 are adopted in calculations the comparison of the dimensionless vertical displacement x d is shown in fig 6 in can be found that the numerical results can become more consistent with experimental results when a smaller grid size is chosen the grid size 0 05 d is a better choice because it can lead to not only accurate results but also the reduction of calculation time on the other hand the comparison of different timesteps is also presented in fig 7 to study the timestep independence the timestep is cut in half and doubled on the existing basis respectively the comparison shows that the current timestep is suitable because of its accuracy and smaller calculation cost moreover several three dimensional figures are shown in later sections and it can be found that the existence of surrounding boundaries will not affect the process of water entry therefore the current calculation domain is enough 3 2 water entry of a sphere with rotation the validation of the sphere with rotation is conducted in this section here the initial entry velocity of the sphere is u 0 2 50 m s the rotational angular velocity is ω 95 r a d s the froude number is f r u 0 g d 11 4 the density ratio between the sphere and the water is ρ ρ s ρ l 1 74 and the diameter of the sphere is d 57 2 m m fig 8 shows the comparison of the displacement between numerical results and experiment data techet and truscott 2011 as shown in fig 8 the numerical predictions are in a good agreement with the experimental observations techet and truscott 2011 the comparison results of the cavity shape are presented in the 2d cross section views from the top and the side views to give a better insight the time of the first image is 1 8 m s and the time interval between every two adjacent pictures is 15 3 m s from these pictures in fig 9 and fig 10 it can be seen that numerical results match the experimental result well from the sphere entering water to occurring the pinch off 3 3 water entry of a vertical cylinder in this subsection the validation is performed on a cylinder to match the experimental conditions wei and hu 2014 the entry velocity is u 0 6 22 m s the froude number is f r 79 0 the density ratio between the cylinder and the water is ρ 1 37 the bottom surface diameter and the length of cylinder are d 50 m m and l 200 m m respectively fig 11 shows the comparison of the displacement in the vertical direction between numerical calculations and experiment data wei and hu 2014 comparisons of the water entry process are provided in fig 12 and fig 13 from t 12 m s a cavity forms above the cylinder at t 36 m s as the splash grows upward an approximately vertical water crown forms over the free surface when t 12 74 m s the two pairs of intersecting lines at the ends of the cylinder move faster than the other parts of the cavity and begin to approach each other at t 102 m s two pairs of intersecting lines are closed and two new intersecting lines generate and the new lines also move faster than the other parts when t 120 m s as the newly formed two intersecting lines move a cavity shape inversion behavior occurs the cross section of the forming process of this behavior is shown in fig 14 the vortex identification value q and the velocity vector analysis associated with the entering process are also provided in fig 15 and fig 16 in two different views at the beginning positive and negative q values are distributed along the surface of the cylinder alternately when the cylinder is immersed in the water completely these areas gradually decrease the cavity gradually expands as the cylinder falling and the positive and negative q values appear again in the vicinity of the cavity for the velocity term the direction of the fluid velocity around the cylinder is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder and outward at the early stage of the entry the cavity expands shrinks and finally closes during the above process the direction of the fluid velocity near the cavity is always consistent with the direction of the cavity changing 4 results 4 1 simulation results of the sphere with various sphere densities in this subsection the effect of sphere density on numerical results are studied spheres with the density ratios ρ of 0 7 1 2 3 9 7 8 respectively are adopted in these four simulations same water entry velocity u 0 3 43 m s and same sphere diameter d 25 4 m m are chosen numerical results are compared with experimental data and the characteristics analysis on the cavity and the dynamics analysis of the sphere are also conducted 4 1 1 characteristic analysis of cavity when a solid body enters water an air cavity then generates the pinch off phenomenon occurs at the same time of the cavity closure this phenomenon is an important characteristic of the cavity fig 17 shows three dimensional comparisons of the pinch off moments for the spheres with different density ratios it can be seen from this figure that as the density ratio ρ of the sphere decreases the closure time of the cavity decreases the depth of the sphere at the pinch off moment also decreases but the characteristic length of the cavity increases to make comparisons more specific the closure position x p the closure depth x p i n c h and the closure time t p i n c h are shown in table 1 it can be found from the table 1 that as the sphere density ratio ρ decreases the closure position x p has a tendency to decrease slowly while the closure depth x p i n c h decreases faster this is the reason why the ratio of the closure position x p to the closure depth x p i n c h increases moreover the sphere with a larger density ratio has a greater inertia and this makes motions of these spheres less affected by the fluid dynamics fig 18 shows the pressure contour the distributions of the vortex q values and the velocity vectors when the sphere with a density ratio ρ 1 2 and the diameter d 25 4 m m enters the water at the initial velocity u 0 3 43 m s from these pictures we can find that before the cavity closing a high pressure zone appears in the front of the sphere while a low pressure zone appears in the tail region of the sphere and it can be found that the pressure of the pinch off position is higher when the cavity closes after the cavity closing the pressure in the tail region of the sphere increases and the areas of low pressure zones on both sides of the sphere decrease for the q value at the beginning of water entry the positive and negative q values above the free surface are alternately distributed as the sphere falling the cavity gradually expands and areas of positive and negative q value regions gradually decrease from the period of the cavity bubble shrinking to its closing the alternating distributions of positive and negative q values near the cavity closure zone become more apparent again at the moment of cavity closure the q values near the closure point are negative this indicates that the shear effect plays a dominant role in this closure process overall the rotation effect and the shear effect jointly govern the development the closure and the collapse of the cavity in the early stage of entry process the velocity direction of the fluid around the sphere outwards along radial direction of the sphere with the development of the cavity the direction of fluid velocity near the cavity is consistent with the direction of cavity expansion 4 1 2 dynamics analysis of the sphere to analyze the effect of the sphere density the vertical displacement x d and the vertical velocity u x u 0 of four spheres with different density ratios are studied and results are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 from the both figures it can be seen that the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio is more apparent than the larger one in the early stage of water entry this indicates that the inertia effect dominates this process while the hydrodynamics is less important in other words the sphere with a lower density ratio is greatly affected by the hydrodynamic force rather than the inertial force it is worth to note that when the density ratio ρ of a sphere is less than that of water the sphere will rise moreover after the cavity pinch off the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio is obviously slowed down and when the sphere density ratio ρ is larger than a certain value the velocity decay is no longer obvious 4 2 simulation results of a rotating sphere numerical results are obtained by simulating a rotational sphere in same conditions with the subsection 3 1 2 the pressure contour the distributions of the velocity vector and the vortex q value are analyzed fig 21 shows the pressure contour from the sphere impacting water to the cavity pinch off in the early stage of the entry process the high pressure zone distributes in the front of the sphere as the depth of the sphere increases the speed of the sphere decreases in both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction the area of the high pressure zone is gradually reduced because the resistance of the sphere gradually decreases when the cavity closes the pressure at the pinch off zone becomes large and this causes the appearance of the sputtering flow because of the closure of the cavity the high pressure zone in front of the sphere increases suddenly and the pressure in the low pressure zone on the right side of the sphere increases fig 22 shows the distributions of the velocity vector and the vortex q value during the entry process at the beginning the negative q value appears above the free surface and in the front of the sphere s motion while the positive q value appears near the interface between the sphere and the water as the depth of the sphere increases the negative q value zone above the free surface is getting smaller and smaller and the q value turns to be positive at t 78 3 m s while positive q value near the interface between the sphere and the water are gradually becoming larger the negative q value in front of the sphere has changed a little when the depth of the sphere increases at the moment of cavity pinch off the q value below the pinch off position is negative but the upper is positive 4 3 simulation results of the cylinder with various entry velocities to simulate the effect of entry velocity 4 different water entry velocities are chosen in this section in these simulations the cylinder with a density radio ρ 1 37 is adopted geometrical parameters are the same as the section 3 3 numerical results including the vertical displacement x m the vertical velocity ratio u u 0 and the vertical acceleration ratio a g are shown in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 in fig 23 we can find that the displacement trends with time for four different entry velocities are all consistent with the experimental data wei and hu 2014 it can be seen in fig 24 that there is an inflection point in each curve when time varies from 120 m s to 140 m s the change of the velocity is more apparent for the lower entry velocity fig 25 shows accelerations with respect to time it can be found that accelerations all decrease sharply at the early stage because of the impact between the cylinder and the water surface comparing these four curves we can find that the cylinder with a higher entry velocity has a greater acceleration at the same time and this acceleration decays slower between 20 m s and 100 m s the cylinder with a higher water entry velocity has a larger acceleration there are fluctuations which are resulted from the cavity pinch off in each curve during t 100 140 m s and these are consistent with fig 24 fig 26 and fig 27 show the side view and the front view of the cavity shape inversion behavior for four different water entry velocities cases it can be seen from these figures that the cylinders with different entry velocities all have the shape inversion behavior during the water entry process as the entry velocity increases the time of this phenomenon is shortened however depths of the inversion are almost constant and all near 0 3 m detailed data of the shape inversion behavior is shown in table 2 moreover the sizes of the water crown and the cavity in water both increase as the water entry velocity increases fig 28 and fig 29 show the side view and the front view of the cavity pinch off for three different water entry velocities it can be seen that as the entry velocity increases the height of the water crown also increases when the entry velocities are u 0 4 22 m s and u 0 5 22 m s the cavity shows the closure phenomenon but when entry velocity increases to u 0 6 22 m s there is no apparent closure of the cavity in table 3 we can also find that when the cavity closes the ratio between the pinch off position x p and the pinch off time t p i n c h are the same for different entry velocities 5 conclusion in this paper the water entry problem of hydrophobic objects is numerically simulated effects of object density and entry velocity on the trajectory are investigated fluid dynamic characteristics and the cavity formation are also studied here several conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical method of water entry for spheres and cylinders has been established and the effectiveness and the robustness of this method are validated by the comparison between numerical results and the existing experimental data 2 for the water entry process of spheres the decrease of the sphere density ratio ρ makes the closure location x p the closure depth x p i n c h and the closure time t p i n c h all decrease when the density ratio ρ of a sphere is smaller than that of water the sphere will rise inversely in the early entry stage the velocity decay of the sphere with a low density ratio is more apparent than the higher ones after the cavity pinch off the velocity decay of the sphere with a smaller density ratio obviously decreases when the density ratio ρ is large to a certain value the velocity decay of the sphere does not change significantly 3 by analyzing the cavity shape generated by the sphere with rotation we can find that the high pressure zone distributes in the front of the sphere s motion as the depth of the sphere increases areas of high pressure zone in front of the sphere are gradually reduced when the cavity closes the pressure in the pinch off zone becomes large the high pressure zone in the front of the sphere increases suddenly and the pressure in the low pressure zone on the right side of the sphere increases at the same time 4 through the analysis of the cavity shape generated by a cylinder the following conclusions can be drawn the numerical method can well simulate the motion of the cross line and the cavity shape inversion behavior in the process of the water entry as the entry velocity increases the time of occurring the cavity shape inversion behavior is shortened for cylinders the entry velocity has little influence on the depth where the cavity shape inversion occurs acknowledgement the present study is funded by the national natural science foundation of china 41776194 
22466,naval ships are designed to operate in a hostile environment as such vulnerability is an important aspect that needs to be assessed during the design with the increased interest in electrification and automation on board naval ships the vulnerability of distributed systems has become a major topic of interest however assessing this is not trivial especially during the concept phase where the level of detail is limited but consequences of design decisions are large many existing vulnerability methods assess the vulnerability of pre defined concepts and focus on systems rather than capabilities to address this a new method for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in the concept phase has been developed this method not only evaluates the vulnerability of a pre defined concept but also provides direction for finding other potentially better solutions this is done from a capabilities perspective the method helps ship designers and naval staff in setting vulnerability requirements developing new concepts and identifying trade offs in capabilities the method uses a discrete markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix a test case considering vulnerability of a notional ocean going patrol vessel opv with two different powering concepts illustrates the method keywords naval ship vulnerability distributed systems concept ship design markov chain eigenvalues 1 introduction naval ships are designed to operate in a hostile environment which exposes them to an ever present risk of getting hit by weapon deployment of an enemy a hit may result in damage such as failed structures flooded compartments impaired systems or personal injuries consequently the ship and its crew may no longer be able to perform the intended operations in order to mitigate the risk of damage survivability is a major design driver during the design of the ship as explained by e g ball and calvano 1994 various definitions of survivability exist a commonly used definition provided by said 1995 who defines survivability specifically for ships as the capability of a ship and its shipboard systems to avoid and withstand a weapons effects environment without sustaining impairment of their ability to accomplish designated missions survivability consists of three major components susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability susceptibility refers to the inability of a ship to avoid damage while vulnerability refers to the inability to withstand damage recoverability is defined by said 1995 as the ability of a ship and its crew to prevent loss and restore mission essential functions given a hit by one or more threat weapons these three major elements are usually considered with an external man made hostile environment in mind however other circumstances can also impose a need to consider survivability such as accidental fires collisions damage resulting from heavy seas or cascading failures that result from increasingly complex system design examples of non hostile environments that have resulted in damage include the collision of the knm helge ingstad bbc 2018 and repeated power failures on board type 45 destroyers elgot 2016 considering these three major elements vulnerability is in particular governed by the design of the ship as such it is the primary focus of many research efforts susceptibility can also be addressed during the design but it is observed that in some cases hits cannot be avoided even if susceptibility reduction measures have been taken schulte 1994 reese et al 1998 duchateau et al 2018 recoverability is mainly governed by active on board response and is therefore addressed to a lesser extent in ship design research however some examples of dedicated recoverability research exist such as the work of piperakis and andrews 2012 and janssen et al 2016 the present paper focuses on vulnerability various ship design areas can contribute to reducing the vulnerability during the design of the ship reese et al 1998 have identified structural integrity seakeeping floodable length damage stability and system separation as primary topics of interest most of the measures that can be taken with respect to these topics are aimed at obtaining an intelligent layout which is deemed the most effective protective measure by brown 1991 traditionally vulnerability has mainly been addressed from a weapons effect perspective with a focus on fire blast and fragmentation for above water hits and damage stability for underwater hits such topics continue to be relevant for recent research e g boulougouris et al 2017 however developments in the field of naval ship design impose a need for a stronger focus on the vulnerability from a systems perspective as automation and electrification are design drivers of today s naval ships brefort et al 2018 dougal and langland 2016 this trend commenced in the 1980s and has since become more distinct as a result of growing electrical demands for existing and future sensors and weapon systems clayton et al 2000 doerry 2015 doerry 2015 identifies several advantages of an integrated power system ips where the ship s propulsion and the electrical system are combined in one power system these advantages include an improved support of high power mission systems higher efficiencies of prime movers and propulsors and more flexibility in the general arrangement in order to enable an ips complex networks for distributing vital commodities such as electricity fluids air and data are indispensable the systems that provide those commodities are known as either distributed systems a term used by e g doerry 2006 or distribution systems a term used by e g de vos and stapersma 2018 there is a slight and subtle difference between these terms distributed systems are systems that are distributed throughout the ship where distribution systems are systems that distribute vital commodities in practice these systems usually cover both characteristics and the terms can be regarded interchangeable this also applies to the present paper which uses the term distributed systems with the increasing interest in ipss the distributed systems networks become more complex and interdependent this makes them more opaque and difficult to understand during the design as a result latent design errors may occur these may result in cascading failures which have a negative influence on the vulnerability brefort et al 2018 to identify and prevent such cascading failures the vulnerability of distributed systems needs to be addressed in the early design stage goodrum et al 2018 various terminologies exist for the early stage ship design this paper uses the terminology of andrews 2018 which refers to the early design stage as the concept phase a further discussion on the concept phase is provided in section 2 1 the concept phase is associated with several challenges and is often regarded as the most challenging in ship design as discussed by andrews 2018 van oers 2011 and gillespie 2012 among others this is caused by several reasons which include but are not limited to the need for creativity in exploring and defining solutions the large number of potential solutions and the potential variability of the design requirements over time in addition to that the problem knowledge and level of detail are limited in the concept phase while decisions made in this phase have a major influence on the committed costs duchateau 2016 these challenges apply to all ship design areas but are considered from a vulnerability perspective in the present paper more specifically three challenges for assessing vulnerability in the concept phase are identified limited level of detail the level of detail of a vulnerability assessment in the concept phase needs to be limited enough to be used in a short time frame on a potential large number of concepts but detailed enough to provide useful estimations of the vulnerability of these concepts generating vs analyzing concepts in order to investigate whether a concept is likely to meet the requirements a physically realisable model needs to be developed and tested however an assessment of a pre defined concept usually provides results of which the applicability is limited to that specific concept assessing a pre defined concept may therefore be of limited use for generating novel concepts or design space exploration hence a need for a more generalised method for vulnerability assessments arises systems vs capabilities requirements for vulnerability usually are developed and formulated in terms of residual mission capability in combination with a pre defined damage or weapon impact in other words the vulnerability requirements are operationally oriented reese et al 1998 yet concept designs are usually defined in terms of compartments and systems though systems and capabilities are inextricably connected the availability of systems is not necessarily a metric for the availability of residual capabilities in addition to that the required residual capabilities may be dependent on the impact level of a hit this requires a vulnerability assessment from a capabilities perspective in addition to a systems perspective various tools and methods exist for assessing the vulnerability of naval ships these are discussed in more detail in section 2 it turns out that many existing vulnerability tools including some that are aimed at the concept phase require a significant level of detail such as a general arrangement a structural plan or a systems design though some tools with a lower level of detail exist as well none of them addresses both other challenges in order to address this gap a new method for assessing vulnerability has been developed the method uses a basic definition of a ship concept which includes compartments main systems and their routings the probability of availability for various levels of residual capabilities are calculated on the basis of a discrete markov chain due to this mathematical set up it is not only possible to evaluate the vulnerability of a specific concept but also to obtain guidance towards other potentially better concepts this is achieved by an evaluation of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the discrete markov chain the remainder of this paper is organised as follows first a literature overview is provided in section 2 which evaluates existing tools for assessing vulnerability of naval ships and other domains subsequently the new method is explained in section 3 including the mathematical set up of the discrete markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix the application of the method is demonstrated with a test case in section 4 section 5 provides the results of the test case conclusions are drawn in section 6 this section also provides recommendations for further research 2 literature overview 2 1 design process in the concept phase a commonly used approach for the design of a complex product or system is systems engineering kossiakoff et al 2011 this approach has also been adopted for naval ship design and has previously been described as total ship systems engineering tsse this covers all topics of ship design and is not limited to vulnerability the five stages in tsse are requirement definition requirement analysis synthesis verification and validation brouwer 2008 in systems engineering theory defining the requirements is independent of the solution s i e the ship concept s however the second concept phase challenge that has been identified in section 1 reflects that the two are not strictly separated in the case of designing naval ships and several other types structures this has been discussed in more detail by andrews 2011 2018 as such the concept phase of naval ship design benefits from an approach where design requirements and concepts are developed simultaneously with the right level of detail at the right time to bring more structure into the concept phase of naval ship design this phase can be subdivided into three design activities concept exploration concept studies and concept design andrews 2018 in concept exploration a wide exploratory investigation of all possible options for layouts capabilities and technologies is executed this is carried out at a limited level of detail based on the results of concept exploration a limited number of alternatives about 1 5 are investigated in more detail during this stage design drivers and the impact of design decisions on performance and cost are investigated in more detail subsequently the concept design stage aims at providing sufficient information on capability and cost for ensuring that the further design process can be executed coherently the end of this stage usually leads to commitment to a more substantial design and acquisition effort though these three activities are described as subsequent to each other they may overlap in practice the overall objective of the concept phase is to elucidate what is wanted and what is affordable a key feature of the concept phase is that the focus lies on decision making though this is inextricably connected with generating concepts these concepts are not generated for detailed design and production but for elucidating requirements as such the concept phase mostly benefits from generalisations rather than specific information on performance characteristics of individual concepts this is not limited to vulnerability but holds for ship design in general from a vulnerability perspective however most methods carry out an analysis of a pre defined concept which relates to the specific perspective further research into the generalised perspective may contribute to developing methods that are more suitable assessing vulnerability in the concept phase to feed into the concept phase of the ship as a whole 2 2 methods for assessing naval ship vulnerability various vulnerability assessment methods and tools exist some of these methods are aimed to be used in practical ship design by navies or shipyards while others are developed from a more fundamental research perspective examples of the former type include the commercially developed tools resist tno 2018 survive schofield 2009 and surma surma ltd 2018 these tools provide high fidelity assessments of a ship exposed to one or more hits they include damage effects such as pressure flooding and fragmentation the results of these tools comprise overviews of the damage stability availability of critical systems and structural integrity after one or more hits the computations in these tools are based on detailed techniques resist for example uses algorithms that hold an intermediate position between finite element methods fem and computational fluid dynamics cfd in addition to analytical and empirical formulas because of this level of fidelity detailed plans such as a general arrangement a structural arrangement and a systems design are needed as input for these tools this makes them highly useful for detailed design stages for the concept phase they are of limited use due to the required level of detail for the concept phase a simplified version of survive exists known as survive lite schofield 2009 this version can be used for more generic layouts and a reduced level of subdivision another tool called prevent heywood and lear 2006 applies a similar level of detail methods for assessing vulnerability in the concept phase exist as well many of these have a more fundamental or scientific background piperakis 2013 has developed a method that is specifically aimed at the concept phase it integrates susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability in an method for assessing overall survivability the method is layout based it combines existing tools with a newly developed recoverability method the method is suitable for assessing a relatively low number of alternatives but at a relatively high level of detail this fits well in the concept definition phase a comparable level of detail is considered by goodfriend and brown 2017 they only consider vulnerability with a specific focus on distributed systems their method uses a multi objective genetic algorithm to explore the design space with high effectiveness low cost and low risk as objectives the method has an exploratory nature though it still requires a level of detail that may be more suitable for later design stages an method with a lower level of detail has been developed by van oers et al 2012 their method uses an genetic optimisation algorithm that generates routings of distributed systems where low vulnerability is one of the objective functions quantified by minimising the loss of capability the method only considers variations on the shortest path in a follow up study duchateau et al 2018 also consider routings that may be longer but potentially less vulnerable they also use a genetic optimisation algorithm on a similar level of detail the vulnerability of distributed systems is considered by kim and lee 2012 however their aim is not to generate routings but to evaluate the availability of critical systems after one or more hits in a probabilistic fashion they investigate a binomial method a poisson method a tree diagram and a markov chain their method can be used with a limited level of detail but the mathematical set up becomes complex when the number of redundant components is increased furthermore their method is well suited for evaluating pre defined concepts but does not provide guidance towards other potentially better concepts in addition to genetic algorithms and probabilistic models networks are used as well for vulnerability assessments of distributed systems in the concept phase goodrum et al 2018 combine two networks one describing the compartments of the ship and one describing systems design to compute an operability score for damaged compartments all compartments are considered individually the translation from their operability score to residual capabilities is not addressed however since their method is network based it is very robust and quick allowing large numbers of layouts and damage scenarios to be considered networks are also applied by de vos and stapersma 2018 they specifically focus on the logical connections between the components of distributed systems and do not consider physical compartments or routings similar to van oers et al 2012 and duchateau et al 2018 they use a genetic optimisation algorithm trapp 2015 also uses networks to model the logical connections between components of distributed systems optimising for network flow brefort et al 2018 have developed an architectural framework in order to structure all these topics they define the design of distributed systems in terms of the physical logical and operational architecture and their overlaps the framework is not a tool in itself but aids in describing and understanding the various aspects and relationships of the design of distributed systems the method of shields et al 2016 has a similar background while not a design tool in itself it provides an estimation of the complexity of a design with respect to survivability doerry 2007 proposes survivability metrics that enable better definition of power system requirements from the perspective of the operational needs of the ship this is also not a tool in itself but aims to enable a better understanding of the link between design requirements and operational needs 2 3 methods for assessing vulnerability in other fields vulnerability assessments are also carried out in other fields of study they are especially relevant for applications with flows through infrastructures analogous with the flow through distributed naval ship systems the number of applications is extensive but three examples are discussed here in more detail a typical example of a non naval vulnerability assessment is the design of land power grids liu et al 2012 have defined an operational vulnerability index to investigate the possible benefits of decentralised power generation in terms of this index a good network with respect to vulnerability is one in which the long distance large capacity power transmission is minimal a major difference with naval ship applications is that land power grids consider only one type of flow electricity while for naval ships interdependencies with other types of flow e g chilled water data and fuels need to be considered furthermore the operational vulnerability index is not based on damage or loss of systems or compartments but on the efficiency of the transmission another non naval ship design example of a vulnerability assessment is the work of el rashidy and grant muller 2014 who have performed a vulnerability assessment on a highway network this example also considers one type of flow cars but they have taken into account that the vulnerability depends on various operational and external factors such as different threats or traffic speeds this is done by defining vulnerability attributes that are calculated based on basic road traffic parameters such as the number of lanes the speed of the cars and the congestion density a third example is the assessment of a health care facility arboleda et al 2009 have developed a methodology for assessing the operational vulnerability of a health care facility during disaster events in contrast to the two methods mentioned earlier this method takes into account that the system in this case a health care facility is dependent on different types of flow such as water power and the transportation of medical supplies however it takes into account only one default operational scenario 2 4 gap analysis in section 1 three challenges for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in the concept phase have been identified the first one concerns the level of detail based of the review in paragraph 2 2 it can be stated that many of the methods require a considerable level of detail which makes them less suited for the concept phase this also holds for some of the methods and tools that are specifically aimed at the concept phase though less detailed methods exist as well none of them address both other challenges concerning generating vs analyzing concepts and systems vs capabilities it is not uncommon to assess vulnerability at the capability level by describing a capability as a hierarchy of systems yet the higher the level of such hierarchies becomes the more challenging it is to attribute their vulnerability to specific parts of the ship concept especially in the generalised perspective that is needed during the concept phase the examples of vulnerability assessments in different fields of study are not directly applicable since they consider only one type of flow or one default operational scenario hence a vulnerability method that specifically links capabilities to the layout of a concept with the generalised perspective needed for the concept phase is still lacking in literature in order to address this a new method is introduced in this paper during the concept phase relevant feasible and affordable design requirements are set and design drivers and trade offs are identified in order to match with these activities the vulnerability method gives insight on how the design of distributed systems influences the vulnerability this is realised by assessing concepts deliberately at a low level of detail due to the mathematical set up of the method the results have a generalised nature and are not limited to the concepts that are defined upfront in other words specific concepts are used to develop generalised knowledge therefore these concepts are meant to be used for creating insights and requirements and are not necessarily meant to be worked out in more detail during later design stages 3 method in order to assess the vulnerability of distributed systems on board naval ships there is a need to describe the availability of parts of these systems and the probability that the availability changes after one or more hits to enable this a discrete time markov chain has been selected as an appropriate mathematical technique that forms the basis of the method a significant benefit of a discrete time markov chain is that it is based on probability in terms of vulnerability this means that all damage scenarios can inherently be addressed at once which reduces the need for modeling individual damage scenarios the probabilistic nature of this technique is deemed appropriate as it gives an overall indication of the ability of a concept to withstand damage this fits well into the concept phase where the focus is on comparing alternatives rather than working out individual concepts furthermore the probabilistic nature can represent the real life uncertainty as to whether and where hits will occur nevertheless modeling individual damage cases such as worst case scenarios remains indispensable during later design stages the base elements of a discrete markov chain are a state vector s and a transition matrix t these are now discussed in more detail by means of a simple illustrative layout which has been introduced previously in habben jansen et al 2018b this layout comprises 9 compartments positioned as a 3 3 grid the layout contains two systems system a is located in 3 compartments and system b is located in 4 compartments the systems overlap in the central compartment fig 1 gives a graphical representation of this layout it is assumed that both systems can individually be on or off on is defined as functioning and off is defined as not functioning due to a hit hence the state vector becomes 1 s s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 where s 1 is the probability for system a and b both being on s 2 is the probability for only system a being on s 3 is the probability for only system b being on s 4 is the probability for system a and b both being off as a result of this definition s is a stochastic vector meaning its elements sum to 1 this is a requisite for a state vector of a discrete markov chain the transition matrix t describes the probability that s changes over time for the set up of this method time is defined in number of hits and is not related to a physical time scale it is assumed that one hit occurs at each time step disabling one of the compartments the hit probability is uniform regardless of the number or location of previous hits hence compartments can be hit multiple times if one or more systems are located in a compartment they become unavailable repair of systems is not considered hence t is dependent on the layout and is row stochastic with this information the elements in t can be calculated for the illustrative layout the probability for s 1 to s 1 which is element t 1 1 is 3 9 as three of the nine compartments the empty ones can be hit without losing system a or system b the probability for s 1 to s 2 which is element t 1 2 is 3 9 as three compartments can be hit that result in loss of system b while system a remains on similarly elements t 1 3 and t 1 4 become 2 9 and 1 9 respectively the same procedure can be followed for other elements in the transition matrix for example t 2 2 is the probability that given system a is on and system b is off the situation remains like that after a subsequent hit this probability is 6 9 as six compartments can be hit that do not disable system a the three empty compartments and all compartments of system b except for the central compartment that is shared with system a following this procedure t becomes as follows for the illustrative layout 2 t 3 9 3 9 2 9 1 9 0 6 9 0 3 9 0 0 5 9 4 9 0 0 0 1 for the illustrative layout the size of t is limited and its elements were calculated by hand however the size of t quickly increases if more systems are considered hence a script has been made for automatic computation of t for any layout the input for the script is a n s n c matrix where n s is the number of systems and n c is the number of compartments if system x is located in compartment y element x y of the input matrix equals 1 otherwise it equals zero following the same procedure as for the manually derived t the transition matrix is computed by definition its size is 2 n s 2 n s subsequently s and t can be used to calculate the probability for any state after any number of hits using eq 3 3 s h s 0 t h where h denotes the number of hits and s 0 is the initial state vector it is assumed that both systems are initially on so the initial state vector becomes 4 s 0 1 0 0 0 the probabilities of the four states can be plotted for an increasing number of hits which is presented in fig 2 as explained in more detail in habben jansen et al 2018b the fact that the two systems are located in one layout already makes them interdependent from a vulnerability perspective this also holds in situations where there is no physical or logical overlap between the two systems the results of fig 2 are obtained by the matrix vector multiplication of eq 3 these results give information on what the shapes of the curves are but not on why the curves are shaped that way an explicit formulation of the curves can contribute to understanding the latter and is one of the key contributions of this paper as the transition matrix is raised to higher powers of h the explicit formulation can be obtained by applying matrix diagonalisation by definition the associated equation is 5 t h p d h p 1 where d is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of t on the diagonal and p contains the respective eigenvectors this holds if and only if all eigenvectors of t i e all columns of p are linearly independent lay 2006 this paper does not contain a proof that this universally holds for the transition matrix of any layout in general however the authors are not aware of any layout either conceptual or more advanced where the columns of p are not linearly independent this indicates but does not proof that linear independence occurs for any layout the linear independence of the columns of p can be confirmed by computing the rank of p in this study matlab is used for this and for all other computations described in this paper if the rank of p equals the number of columns in p its columns are linearly independent in addition to p the diagonal matrix d needs to be constructed as well this requires the eigenvalues of t since the vulnerability assessment only considers damage of systems and not repairs t is always an upper triangular matrix hence the eigenvalues of t are the entries on its diagonal as a result the diagonal of d contains the same values as the diagonal of t for the illustrative layout this leads to 6 d λ 1 0 0 0 0 λ 2 0 0 0 0 λ 3 0 0 0 0 λ 4 3 9 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0 0 0 5 9 0 0 0 0 1 the associated eigenvectors are the columns of p 7 p 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 the rank of p is 4 so the columns of p are linearly independent as such matrix diagonalisation is indeed possible for this case so the state probabilities can indeed be expressed explicitly for the illustrative layout this leads to 8a p r s 1 λ 1 h 3 9 h 8b p r s 2 λ 1 h λ 2 h 3 9 h 6 9 h 8c p r s 3 λ 1 h λ 3 h 3 9 h 5 9 h 8d p r s 4 λ 1 h λ 2 h λ 3 h λ 4 h 3 9 h 6 9 h 5 9 h 1 these equations show that the state probabilities are only dependent on eigenvalues of t a major advantage is that this holds for any layout with two systems regardless of the number of compartments or the physical location of the systems in the compartments thus a specific pre defined concept is used to generate generalised knowledge this can be used to search for alternative solutions and to evaluate the interdependencies between the states consider for example the situation where there is a desire to maximise the probability that both systems are on i e to maximise p r s 1 this probability is dependent on λ 1 only this is element 1 1 of the transition matrix i e the probability to remain in s 1 given that the previous state was s 1 already in this example this probability is 3 9 corresponding to the number of compartments where no systems are located to increase the probability this value needs to be increased this implies that more compartments need to be empty i e systems a and b need to be concentrated more which is sensible from a physical perspective however this comes at a cost as increasing λ 1 has a negative effect on the probabilities for s 2 and s 3 hence this leads to a high probability that both systems are on after one or more hits but the probability that at least one of the systems is on reduces though this result seems trivial for this illustrative layout this method can be extended to larger more complex concepts as well enabling a better understanding of the trade off between different levels of residual capabilities to scale up this method to layouts that can be used during the concept phase several additional issues need to be addressed these have previously been introduced in habben jansen et al 2018a contrary to the systems in the illustrative layout that contained only two components and a routing between them distributed systems on board naval ships are part of multi layered networks with one or more hub layers between suppliers and consumers de vos and stapersma 2018 in addition to that these networks are often multiplex resulting in interdependencies between the different commodities that flow through the network for example a chilled water unit is represented by a single node while it is a consumer of electrical energy and a supplier of chilled water at the same time as a result it is not possible to simply state that a system is on or off this depends on the availability of multiple components that may provide different types of commodities within the markov chain this is addressed by describing the states as the availability of individual connections these connections contain edges of the distributed systems network including the start node and end node consider fig 3 for an example where it is assumed that consumer 1 and consumer 2 provide the same capability the table at the right shows how the states for this example are defined the capability is available if the network is in state 1 2 or 3 if the network is in state 4 5 6 7 or 8 the capability is not available note that this is independent of the transition matrix hence the distributed systems network is subdivided in individual connections and subsequently the markov chain is calculated the interdependencies between connections i e the fact that capabilities require a combination of certain edges is accounted for after the markov chain has been calculated in the case of this example the probability for having the capability available is found by adding the state probabilities of state 1 2 and 3 together as only they represent states where the capability is available the states that describe the availability of individual connections can be used to calculate the probability that certain levels of residual capability are available after one or more hits these levels could for example be expressed as the ship s ability to perform the main functions fight move and float where full residual capability includes all three functions medium residual capability only contains move and float and minimal residual capability only includes float however other definitions of residual capabilities can be applied as well it is not possible to express the states directly as the availability of the capabilities as multiple connections may contribute to a single capability likewise a single connection may contribute to multiple capabilities to obtain the probability that a certain level of residual capability is available all states that contribute to that capability need to be added together which provides a result that resembles the curves of fig 4 as each state can be expressed as an explicit function of only the eigenvalues of t this also holds for the explicit formulation of the capability curves of fig 4 hence eigenvalues of t are the direct link between the ship concept consisting of the compartments and the routed distributed systems network and the shape of the curves and can be used to study the interdependencies between the different levels of capability 4 test case this section provides a test case to illustrate the application and contributions of the method this is an extension of the test case that has previously been introduced in habben jansen et al 2018a it considers a notional ocean going patrol vessel opv with an offensive weapon system a defensive weapon system and two propellers two powering concepts are considered 1 conventional the propulsion system is mechanical and is separated from the electrical distribution system which powers both weapon systems a forward and aft chilled water unit provide chilled water to the weapon systems 2 ips both the propulsion system and the weapon systems are powered by electrical power the chilled water units for the weapon systems are located in the vicinity of the weapon systems the distributed systems networks and the physical location of the networks in the ship are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively both concepts contain 12 connections as a result the number of states is 2 12 4096 the markov chain has been set up according to the method described in section 3 using the script for automatic generation of the transition matrix the probability for each state has been calculated for up to 8 hits meaning that up to 8 compartments are disabled subsequently the states are combined to four levels of residual capability as specified in table 1 for each individual state it is checked whether it contributes one or more levels of residual capability if so the probability for that state is assigned to that residual capability if not the probability for that state is ignored the result is a sum of contributing state probabilities for each level of residual capability which is a quantitative version of the example result shown in fig 4 for this test case the result is presented in fig 7 the horizontal axis of this figure denotes the number of hits the vertical axis is the probability that at least the level of required residual capability is met for example the probability to have at least minimal residual capability is higher for the conventional concept solid purple line than for the ips concept dashed purple line the higher the number of hits the bigger this difference becomes this indicates that the conventional concept performs better than the ips concept for this level of residual capability i e at least propulsion at one side for the level of considerable residual capability i e at least full propulsion and the defensive weapon the ips concept performs better this illustrates a trade off in residual capabilities that needs to be made for these two particular concepts it should be kept in mind though that the differences between the conventional concept and ips concept are based on ship concepts with a limited level of detail if one concept performs better than another concept at this stage there is no definite guarantee that this also holds when both concepts are developed in more detail however the purpose of this assessment is not to select the best concept but to identify the underlying rationale that leads to these levels of vulnerability the results including the associated trade off have previously been interpreted in a qualitative fashion only with the observation that the curves can be written as a function of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix a formal mathematical description can be obtained and is presented in this paper this gives insight into why the curves are shaped in this particular fashion the resulting knowledge can be used to search for alternative potentially better concepts and to identify and quantify interdependencies between the different levels of residual capability 5 results in order to formulate the probability curves for the states explicitly matrix diagonalisation needs to be applied this is only possible if the rank of p equals its size in this case this means that matrix diagonalisation is possible if the rank of p is 4096 using matlab this is found to be the case for both the conventional concept and the ips concept hence the curves of the different levels of residual capability can be expressed as 9 p r c i k 1 n f k λ k h where c i denotes the i th capability level in this test case i runs from 1 to 4 λ k denotes the k th eigenvalue of the transition matrix in this test case k runs from 1 to 4096 which is n the number of states h is the number of hits and f k is an integer factor that states how strong λ k contributes to the curve and which sign it has the expression of eq 9 can be set up for each individual vulnerability curve table 2 gives the eigenvalues and factors for the curve that represents the probability for full residual capability of the conventional concept as presented in fig 7 the first column provides the state numbers of the eigenvalues that contribute to the curve between 1 and 4096 the second column gives the actual value of these eigenvalues as provided by the transition matrix the third column states whether the eigenvalue corresponds positively or negatively to the curve and how strong the corresponding state definitions are included as well where the numbers 1 12 relate to the individual connections in the concept as defined in fig 5 several observations can be made though there is a total of 4096 states only 12 states have eigenvalues that contribute to the probability for full residual capability of the conventional concept some eigenvalues have a positive contribution while others have a negative contribution many of these eigenvalues occur in pairs that cancel each other out for each pair connection 11 is off in one of the corresponding states while connections 7 10 and 12 are on this state is physically not possible as connection 11 shares routings with these other connections through the same compartments the meaning of the corresponding eigenvalues is strictly mathematical in this case nevertheless they should not be ignored if modifications to connection 11 are made in such way that it no longer routed together with other connections the pair wise cancellation may no longer be present for every eigenvalue the corresponding state includes the availability of at least connections 1 2 7 9 10 and 12 relating this back to the distributed systems network of fig 5 it turns out that these are all non redundant connections for some states connections 6 and 8 are off their unavailability is related individual availability of either connection 6 or connection 8 does not occur for every state where connections 6 and 8 are off there is a fellow state where connection 11 is off for most states either connection 3 4 or 5 is off but no combinations of these states these observations are the result of assessing this specific concept but are not restricted to the physical routings of the concept therefore they provide valuable information that can be used to better understand and improve the existing concept the following procedure is proposed for this 1 from all curves representing the various levels of residual capability select one to study in more detail for this test case the curve of full residual capability for the conventional concept is investigated 2 check how many eigenvalues contribute to the shape of that curve this may be decisive for how the further assessment is carried out in this case 12 eigenvalues contribute to the curve the number of contributing eigenvalues is no metric for the vulnerability it can therefore not be stated that either more or less eigenvalues is better however a smaller number of eigenvalues allows the designer to do a manually oriented assessment while for a larger number of contributing eigenvalues the assessment may require a more computational approach this test case illustrates a manual approach assessment methods for larger numbers of eigenvalues are still subject of further research 3 check for repetitions or pairs in the contributing eigenvalues for this test case four pairs with connection 11 occur leading to eigenvalues that cancel each other out as such only four eigenvalues contribute to the shape of the curve they will be addressed in this test case 4 change the remaining connections in such way that the eigenvalues with positive factors increase and the eigenvalues with negative factors decrease in order to increase an eigenvalue with a positive factor the connections that are on in that state need to be reduced in size or concentrated in order to decrease an eigenvalue with a negative factor the connections that are off in that state need to be reduced in size or concentrated from a mathematical point of view it could also be an option to increase the size of the routings of the other connections but that would lead to increased vulnerability of those connections for the sake of a lower relative vulnerability of the other connections as such recommendations of size reduction and concentration of routings are preferred this can be applied to this test case consider the situation where there is a desire to increase the probability that there is full residual capability after one or more hits the eigenvalues λ 81 λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 have the strongest influence on this as they are not canceled out by other eigenvalues more specifically λ 81 needs to be decreased and λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 need to be increased for all these eigenvalues connections 6 and 8 are off in order to decrease λ 81 the routings of these connections should be made smaller or more concentrated however in order to increase λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 it is the other way around this is a mathematical representation of conflicting requirements that result from interdependencies between the connections however a closer look at λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 shows that either connection 3 4 or 5 is off in their associated states in order to increase these eigenvalues the probability to remain in any of these states should be increased this indicates that all routings related to connections other than 3 4 5 6 or 8 need to be made smaller or more concentrated connections 1 and 2 are related to propulsion and are not easy to modify for the conventional concept however for connections 7 9 10 11 and 12 two modifications are proposed 1 bring cw2 above swb2 closer to the ciws this concentrates the routings of connections 9 10 and 12 and reduces the routing length of connection 11 2 concentrate the routing from swb1 to the ciws connection 7 with the routing between swb1 and swb2 connection 5 this reduces the number of compartments solely occupied by the routing of connection 7 the concept is adjusted accordingly such as presented in fig 8 the results of this adjustment are given in fig 9 it can be observed that the adjustments have the desired effect as the curve for full residual capability lies higher indicating a higher probability for having this level of residual capability after one or more hits at the same time the curves for moderate and considerable residual capability have increased as well hence the positive effect of the modification goes beyond the level of residual capability that was originally considered in this case this effect is positive however for other cases the residual capability of other levels may drop if the residual capability of the level that was originally considered is increased this method elucidates and quantifies these interdependencies the same method can be applied to the ips concept fig 7 shows that the probability for minimal residual capability i e at least propulsion at one side is significantly lower for the ips concept purple dashed curve than for the conventional concept consider the situation where there is a desire to increase this probability the eigenvalues and factors that determine the shape of this curve are presented in table 3 for this case all factors are either 1 or 1 so in order to determine the eigenvalues with the largest influence the magnitude of the eigenvalues need to be considered the largest eigenvalues i e the eigenvalues with the largest influence on the curve are λ 1920 λ 1984 and λ 2944 the corresponding factor is 1 for all these eigenvalues so they make a positive contribution to the curve hence the probability for minimal residual capability increases when the magnitude of these eigenvalues increase the state definitions associated with these eigenvalues show that connections 1 2 5 and 6 are on while the other connections are off in order to increase the probability for minimal residual capability the number of compartments associated with these connections needs to be reduced and concentration and or separation of the associated system components and routings may be beneficial to that end swb1 is relocated one compartment lower compared to the original ips concept that was presented in fig 6 as a result the distance between swb1 and both propellers reduces in addition of that only one compartment is a single point of failure instead of two compartments for the previous situation since swb1 has been relocated the routings from dg1 and dg2 need to be adjusted as well as a result the routing from dg2 to swb1 now has a partial overlap with the routing between swb1 and the starboard propeller however this does not affect the power supply to the port side propeller so the requirement to have a large probability for propulsion at one side at least is still met propulsion power can also be supplied via dg3 and swb2 i e connections 3 and 4 however the results of the eigenvalue assessment shows that these connections have a smaller influence on the shape of the curve these connections are therefore left unchanged the adjusted layout is presented in fig 10 the associated result is given in fig 11 it can be seen that the probability for having at least minimal residual capability has increased significantly hence the proposed solution has the desired effect for the other levels of residual capability the curves remain unchanged so no trade off needs to be made this is because the capability that is considered i e propulsion at one side at least does not include components or routings of other systems 6 conclusions and recommendations in this paper a method for assessing vulnerability of naval distributed ship systems is presented and illustrated this method assesses the vulnerability in a quantitative fashion from a capabilities perspective in the concept phase a major benefit of the method is that it does not only evaluate the vulnerability of an existing pre defined concept but also provides direction for finding other potentially better solutions this is done from a capabilities perspective rather than from a systems perspective the method accounts for the fact that the relation between individual connections and higher level capabilities is not necessarily one to one and that potential trade offs between various levels of capability may exist an explicit mathematical formulation relates the availability of higher level capabilities to specific connections in the distributed systems network that are decisive for this availability in addition to these general contributions several specific conclusions can be drawn from the test case where the vulnerability of a conventional powering concept and an ips concept for a notional opv has been assessed at various levels of required residual capability it differs per level whether the conventional or ips concept performs better though some of the differences are subtle there is a major difference in the probability for minimal residual capability i e having propulsion at one side at least for this level of residual capability the conventional concept performs significantly better than the ips concept this is because the number of compartments that is equipped with propulsion components and routings is larger for the ips concept making it more likely to get hit nevertheless the method has successfully provided directions to modify the concept such that this improves without compromising the performance for other levels of residual capability the conventional concept has also been modified with a goal to obtain a higher probability for full residual capability this has indeed been achieved also without compromising other levels of residual capability it should be kept in mind that these results are based on an assessment with uniform hit probability in earlier work of the authors it has been shown that other user defined hit probability distributions can be applied as well habben jansen et al 2018b these other types of distributions have not yet been applied for obtaining design recommendations such as done in this paper opportunities arise for combining these two aspects but the mathematical set up and design implications are still subject of ongoing research the same holds for scaling up the method to higher numbers of systems and routings as discussed in section 3 the size of the transition matrix increases exponentially with the number of connections that is considered currently this limits the size and complexity of the method to distributed systems comparable to the test case of this paper since this paper aimed to explain how design recommendations for reduced vulnerability can be obtained rather than mimicking an actual design effort this limited complexity is considered appropriate however opportunities for scaling the method and including more representative ship concepts are under consideration in ongoing work the vulnerability method presented in this paper considers system components and routings that can be either on or off in other words the method checks whether the power sources and sinks in the network are connected however in order to meet the various level of residual capabilities there also needs to be sufficient effort and flow of the different commodities adding a network flow assessment to this method would increase the fidelity such an assessment can also evaluate in which damage cases an operational decision needs to be taken because there is a higher power demand than power supply however the design stage for which this method is meant should be taken into consideration while doing this as the concept phase deliberately is associated with a low level of detail acknowledgments funding for this

22466,naval ships are designed to operate in a hostile environment as such vulnerability is an important aspect that needs to be assessed during the design with the increased interest in electrification and automation on board naval ships the vulnerability of distributed systems has become a major topic of interest however assessing this is not trivial especially during the concept phase where the level of detail is limited but consequences of design decisions are large many existing vulnerability methods assess the vulnerability of pre defined concepts and focus on systems rather than capabilities to address this a new method for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in the concept phase has been developed this method not only evaluates the vulnerability of a pre defined concept but also provides direction for finding other potentially better solutions this is done from a capabilities perspective the method helps ship designers and naval staff in setting vulnerability requirements developing new concepts and identifying trade offs in capabilities the method uses a discrete markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix a test case considering vulnerability of a notional ocean going patrol vessel opv with two different powering concepts illustrates the method keywords naval ship vulnerability distributed systems concept ship design markov chain eigenvalues 1 introduction naval ships are designed to operate in a hostile environment which exposes them to an ever present risk of getting hit by weapon deployment of an enemy a hit may result in damage such as failed structures flooded compartments impaired systems or personal injuries consequently the ship and its crew may no longer be able to perform the intended operations in order to mitigate the risk of damage survivability is a major design driver during the design of the ship as explained by e g ball and calvano 1994 various definitions of survivability exist a commonly used definition provided by said 1995 who defines survivability specifically for ships as the capability of a ship and its shipboard systems to avoid and withstand a weapons effects environment without sustaining impairment of their ability to accomplish designated missions survivability consists of three major components susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability susceptibility refers to the inability of a ship to avoid damage while vulnerability refers to the inability to withstand damage recoverability is defined by said 1995 as the ability of a ship and its crew to prevent loss and restore mission essential functions given a hit by one or more threat weapons these three major elements are usually considered with an external man made hostile environment in mind however other circumstances can also impose a need to consider survivability such as accidental fires collisions damage resulting from heavy seas or cascading failures that result from increasingly complex system design examples of non hostile environments that have resulted in damage include the collision of the knm helge ingstad bbc 2018 and repeated power failures on board type 45 destroyers elgot 2016 considering these three major elements vulnerability is in particular governed by the design of the ship as such it is the primary focus of many research efforts susceptibility can also be addressed during the design but it is observed that in some cases hits cannot be avoided even if susceptibility reduction measures have been taken schulte 1994 reese et al 1998 duchateau et al 2018 recoverability is mainly governed by active on board response and is therefore addressed to a lesser extent in ship design research however some examples of dedicated recoverability research exist such as the work of piperakis and andrews 2012 and janssen et al 2016 the present paper focuses on vulnerability various ship design areas can contribute to reducing the vulnerability during the design of the ship reese et al 1998 have identified structural integrity seakeeping floodable length damage stability and system separation as primary topics of interest most of the measures that can be taken with respect to these topics are aimed at obtaining an intelligent layout which is deemed the most effective protective measure by brown 1991 traditionally vulnerability has mainly been addressed from a weapons effect perspective with a focus on fire blast and fragmentation for above water hits and damage stability for underwater hits such topics continue to be relevant for recent research e g boulougouris et al 2017 however developments in the field of naval ship design impose a need for a stronger focus on the vulnerability from a systems perspective as automation and electrification are design drivers of today s naval ships brefort et al 2018 dougal and langland 2016 this trend commenced in the 1980s and has since become more distinct as a result of growing electrical demands for existing and future sensors and weapon systems clayton et al 2000 doerry 2015 doerry 2015 identifies several advantages of an integrated power system ips where the ship s propulsion and the electrical system are combined in one power system these advantages include an improved support of high power mission systems higher efficiencies of prime movers and propulsors and more flexibility in the general arrangement in order to enable an ips complex networks for distributing vital commodities such as electricity fluids air and data are indispensable the systems that provide those commodities are known as either distributed systems a term used by e g doerry 2006 or distribution systems a term used by e g de vos and stapersma 2018 there is a slight and subtle difference between these terms distributed systems are systems that are distributed throughout the ship where distribution systems are systems that distribute vital commodities in practice these systems usually cover both characteristics and the terms can be regarded interchangeable this also applies to the present paper which uses the term distributed systems with the increasing interest in ipss the distributed systems networks become more complex and interdependent this makes them more opaque and difficult to understand during the design as a result latent design errors may occur these may result in cascading failures which have a negative influence on the vulnerability brefort et al 2018 to identify and prevent such cascading failures the vulnerability of distributed systems needs to be addressed in the early design stage goodrum et al 2018 various terminologies exist for the early stage ship design this paper uses the terminology of andrews 2018 which refers to the early design stage as the concept phase a further discussion on the concept phase is provided in section 2 1 the concept phase is associated with several challenges and is often regarded as the most challenging in ship design as discussed by andrews 2018 van oers 2011 and gillespie 2012 among others this is caused by several reasons which include but are not limited to the need for creativity in exploring and defining solutions the large number of potential solutions and the potential variability of the design requirements over time in addition to that the problem knowledge and level of detail are limited in the concept phase while decisions made in this phase have a major influence on the committed costs duchateau 2016 these challenges apply to all ship design areas but are considered from a vulnerability perspective in the present paper more specifically three challenges for assessing vulnerability in the concept phase are identified limited level of detail the level of detail of a vulnerability assessment in the concept phase needs to be limited enough to be used in a short time frame on a potential large number of concepts but detailed enough to provide useful estimations of the vulnerability of these concepts generating vs analyzing concepts in order to investigate whether a concept is likely to meet the requirements a physically realisable model needs to be developed and tested however an assessment of a pre defined concept usually provides results of which the applicability is limited to that specific concept assessing a pre defined concept may therefore be of limited use for generating novel concepts or design space exploration hence a need for a more generalised method for vulnerability assessments arises systems vs capabilities requirements for vulnerability usually are developed and formulated in terms of residual mission capability in combination with a pre defined damage or weapon impact in other words the vulnerability requirements are operationally oriented reese et al 1998 yet concept designs are usually defined in terms of compartments and systems though systems and capabilities are inextricably connected the availability of systems is not necessarily a metric for the availability of residual capabilities in addition to that the required residual capabilities may be dependent on the impact level of a hit this requires a vulnerability assessment from a capabilities perspective in addition to a systems perspective various tools and methods exist for assessing the vulnerability of naval ships these are discussed in more detail in section 2 it turns out that many existing vulnerability tools including some that are aimed at the concept phase require a significant level of detail such as a general arrangement a structural plan or a systems design though some tools with a lower level of detail exist as well none of them addresses both other challenges in order to address this gap a new method for assessing vulnerability has been developed the method uses a basic definition of a ship concept which includes compartments main systems and their routings the probability of availability for various levels of residual capabilities are calculated on the basis of a discrete markov chain due to this mathematical set up it is not only possible to evaluate the vulnerability of a specific concept but also to obtain guidance towards other potentially better concepts this is achieved by an evaluation of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the discrete markov chain the remainder of this paper is organised as follows first a literature overview is provided in section 2 which evaluates existing tools for assessing vulnerability of naval ships and other domains subsequently the new method is explained in section 3 including the mathematical set up of the discrete markov chain and the eigenvalues of the associated transition matrix the application of the method is demonstrated with a test case in section 4 section 5 provides the results of the test case conclusions are drawn in section 6 this section also provides recommendations for further research 2 literature overview 2 1 design process in the concept phase a commonly used approach for the design of a complex product or system is systems engineering kossiakoff et al 2011 this approach has also been adopted for naval ship design and has previously been described as total ship systems engineering tsse this covers all topics of ship design and is not limited to vulnerability the five stages in tsse are requirement definition requirement analysis synthesis verification and validation brouwer 2008 in systems engineering theory defining the requirements is independent of the solution s i e the ship concept s however the second concept phase challenge that has been identified in section 1 reflects that the two are not strictly separated in the case of designing naval ships and several other types structures this has been discussed in more detail by andrews 2011 2018 as such the concept phase of naval ship design benefits from an approach where design requirements and concepts are developed simultaneously with the right level of detail at the right time to bring more structure into the concept phase of naval ship design this phase can be subdivided into three design activities concept exploration concept studies and concept design andrews 2018 in concept exploration a wide exploratory investigation of all possible options for layouts capabilities and technologies is executed this is carried out at a limited level of detail based on the results of concept exploration a limited number of alternatives about 1 5 are investigated in more detail during this stage design drivers and the impact of design decisions on performance and cost are investigated in more detail subsequently the concept design stage aims at providing sufficient information on capability and cost for ensuring that the further design process can be executed coherently the end of this stage usually leads to commitment to a more substantial design and acquisition effort though these three activities are described as subsequent to each other they may overlap in practice the overall objective of the concept phase is to elucidate what is wanted and what is affordable a key feature of the concept phase is that the focus lies on decision making though this is inextricably connected with generating concepts these concepts are not generated for detailed design and production but for elucidating requirements as such the concept phase mostly benefits from generalisations rather than specific information on performance characteristics of individual concepts this is not limited to vulnerability but holds for ship design in general from a vulnerability perspective however most methods carry out an analysis of a pre defined concept which relates to the specific perspective further research into the generalised perspective may contribute to developing methods that are more suitable assessing vulnerability in the concept phase to feed into the concept phase of the ship as a whole 2 2 methods for assessing naval ship vulnerability various vulnerability assessment methods and tools exist some of these methods are aimed to be used in practical ship design by navies or shipyards while others are developed from a more fundamental research perspective examples of the former type include the commercially developed tools resist tno 2018 survive schofield 2009 and surma surma ltd 2018 these tools provide high fidelity assessments of a ship exposed to one or more hits they include damage effects such as pressure flooding and fragmentation the results of these tools comprise overviews of the damage stability availability of critical systems and structural integrity after one or more hits the computations in these tools are based on detailed techniques resist for example uses algorithms that hold an intermediate position between finite element methods fem and computational fluid dynamics cfd in addition to analytical and empirical formulas because of this level of fidelity detailed plans such as a general arrangement a structural arrangement and a systems design are needed as input for these tools this makes them highly useful for detailed design stages for the concept phase they are of limited use due to the required level of detail for the concept phase a simplified version of survive exists known as survive lite schofield 2009 this version can be used for more generic layouts and a reduced level of subdivision another tool called prevent heywood and lear 2006 applies a similar level of detail methods for assessing vulnerability in the concept phase exist as well many of these have a more fundamental or scientific background piperakis 2013 has developed a method that is specifically aimed at the concept phase it integrates susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability in an method for assessing overall survivability the method is layout based it combines existing tools with a newly developed recoverability method the method is suitable for assessing a relatively low number of alternatives but at a relatively high level of detail this fits well in the concept definition phase a comparable level of detail is considered by goodfriend and brown 2017 they only consider vulnerability with a specific focus on distributed systems their method uses a multi objective genetic algorithm to explore the design space with high effectiveness low cost and low risk as objectives the method has an exploratory nature though it still requires a level of detail that may be more suitable for later design stages an method with a lower level of detail has been developed by van oers et al 2012 their method uses an genetic optimisation algorithm that generates routings of distributed systems where low vulnerability is one of the objective functions quantified by minimising the loss of capability the method only considers variations on the shortest path in a follow up study duchateau et al 2018 also consider routings that may be longer but potentially less vulnerable they also use a genetic optimisation algorithm on a similar level of detail the vulnerability of distributed systems is considered by kim and lee 2012 however their aim is not to generate routings but to evaluate the availability of critical systems after one or more hits in a probabilistic fashion they investigate a binomial method a poisson method a tree diagram and a markov chain their method can be used with a limited level of detail but the mathematical set up becomes complex when the number of redundant components is increased furthermore their method is well suited for evaluating pre defined concepts but does not provide guidance towards other potentially better concepts in addition to genetic algorithms and probabilistic models networks are used as well for vulnerability assessments of distributed systems in the concept phase goodrum et al 2018 combine two networks one describing the compartments of the ship and one describing systems design to compute an operability score for damaged compartments all compartments are considered individually the translation from their operability score to residual capabilities is not addressed however since their method is network based it is very robust and quick allowing large numbers of layouts and damage scenarios to be considered networks are also applied by de vos and stapersma 2018 they specifically focus on the logical connections between the components of distributed systems and do not consider physical compartments or routings similar to van oers et al 2012 and duchateau et al 2018 they use a genetic optimisation algorithm trapp 2015 also uses networks to model the logical connections between components of distributed systems optimising for network flow brefort et al 2018 have developed an architectural framework in order to structure all these topics they define the design of distributed systems in terms of the physical logical and operational architecture and their overlaps the framework is not a tool in itself but aids in describing and understanding the various aspects and relationships of the design of distributed systems the method of shields et al 2016 has a similar background while not a design tool in itself it provides an estimation of the complexity of a design with respect to survivability doerry 2007 proposes survivability metrics that enable better definition of power system requirements from the perspective of the operational needs of the ship this is also not a tool in itself but aims to enable a better understanding of the link between design requirements and operational needs 2 3 methods for assessing vulnerability in other fields vulnerability assessments are also carried out in other fields of study they are especially relevant for applications with flows through infrastructures analogous with the flow through distributed naval ship systems the number of applications is extensive but three examples are discussed here in more detail a typical example of a non naval vulnerability assessment is the design of land power grids liu et al 2012 have defined an operational vulnerability index to investigate the possible benefits of decentralised power generation in terms of this index a good network with respect to vulnerability is one in which the long distance large capacity power transmission is minimal a major difference with naval ship applications is that land power grids consider only one type of flow electricity while for naval ships interdependencies with other types of flow e g chilled water data and fuels need to be considered furthermore the operational vulnerability index is not based on damage or loss of systems or compartments but on the efficiency of the transmission another non naval ship design example of a vulnerability assessment is the work of el rashidy and grant muller 2014 who have performed a vulnerability assessment on a highway network this example also considers one type of flow cars but they have taken into account that the vulnerability depends on various operational and external factors such as different threats or traffic speeds this is done by defining vulnerability attributes that are calculated based on basic road traffic parameters such as the number of lanes the speed of the cars and the congestion density a third example is the assessment of a health care facility arboleda et al 2009 have developed a methodology for assessing the operational vulnerability of a health care facility during disaster events in contrast to the two methods mentioned earlier this method takes into account that the system in this case a health care facility is dependent on different types of flow such as water power and the transportation of medical supplies however it takes into account only one default operational scenario 2 4 gap analysis in section 1 three challenges for assessing the vulnerability of distributed systems in the concept phase have been identified the first one concerns the level of detail based of the review in paragraph 2 2 it can be stated that many of the methods require a considerable level of detail which makes them less suited for the concept phase this also holds for some of the methods and tools that are specifically aimed at the concept phase though less detailed methods exist as well none of them address both other challenges concerning generating vs analyzing concepts and systems vs capabilities it is not uncommon to assess vulnerability at the capability level by describing a capability as a hierarchy of systems yet the higher the level of such hierarchies becomes the more challenging it is to attribute their vulnerability to specific parts of the ship concept especially in the generalised perspective that is needed during the concept phase the examples of vulnerability assessments in different fields of study are not directly applicable since they consider only one type of flow or one default operational scenario hence a vulnerability method that specifically links capabilities to the layout of a concept with the generalised perspective needed for the concept phase is still lacking in literature in order to address this a new method is introduced in this paper during the concept phase relevant feasible and affordable design requirements are set and design drivers and trade offs are identified in order to match with these activities the vulnerability method gives insight on how the design of distributed systems influences the vulnerability this is realised by assessing concepts deliberately at a low level of detail due to the mathematical set up of the method the results have a generalised nature and are not limited to the concepts that are defined upfront in other words specific concepts are used to develop generalised knowledge therefore these concepts are meant to be used for creating insights and requirements and are not necessarily meant to be worked out in more detail during later design stages 3 method in order to assess the vulnerability of distributed systems on board naval ships there is a need to describe the availability of parts of these systems and the probability that the availability changes after one or more hits to enable this a discrete time markov chain has been selected as an appropriate mathematical technique that forms the basis of the method a significant benefit of a discrete time markov chain is that it is based on probability in terms of vulnerability this means that all damage scenarios can inherently be addressed at once which reduces the need for modeling individual damage scenarios the probabilistic nature of this technique is deemed appropriate as it gives an overall indication of the ability of a concept to withstand damage this fits well into the concept phase where the focus is on comparing alternatives rather than working out individual concepts furthermore the probabilistic nature can represent the real life uncertainty as to whether and where hits will occur nevertheless modeling individual damage cases such as worst case scenarios remains indispensable during later design stages the base elements of a discrete markov chain are a state vector s and a transition matrix t these are now discussed in more detail by means of a simple illustrative layout which has been introduced previously in habben jansen et al 2018b this layout comprises 9 compartments positioned as a 3 3 grid the layout contains two systems system a is located in 3 compartments and system b is located in 4 compartments the systems overlap in the central compartment fig 1 gives a graphical representation of this layout it is assumed that both systems can individually be on or off on is defined as functioning and off is defined as not functioning due to a hit hence the state vector becomes 1 s s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 where s 1 is the probability for system a and b both being on s 2 is the probability for only system a being on s 3 is the probability for only system b being on s 4 is the probability for system a and b both being off as a result of this definition s is a stochastic vector meaning its elements sum to 1 this is a requisite for a state vector of a discrete markov chain the transition matrix t describes the probability that s changes over time for the set up of this method time is defined in number of hits and is not related to a physical time scale it is assumed that one hit occurs at each time step disabling one of the compartments the hit probability is uniform regardless of the number or location of previous hits hence compartments can be hit multiple times if one or more systems are located in a compartment they become unavailable repair of systems is not considered hence t is dependent on the layout and is row stochastic with this information the elements in t can be calculated for the illustrative layout the probability for s 1 to s 1 which is element t 1 1 is 3 9 as three of the nine compartments the empty ones can be hit without losing system a or system b the probability for s 1 to s 2 which is element t 1 2 is 3 9 as three compartments can be hit that result in loss of system b while system a remains on similarly elements t 1 3 and t 1 4 become 2 9 and 1 9 respectively the same procedure can be followed for other elements in the transition matrix for example t 2 2 is the probability that given system a is on and system b is off the situation remains like that after a subsequent hit this probability is 6 9 as six compartments can be hit that do not disable system a the three empty compartments and all compartments of system b except for the central compartment that is shared with system a following this procedure t becomes as follows for the illustrative layout 2 t 3 9 3 9 2 9 1 9 0 6 9 0 3 9 0 0 5 9 4 9 0 0 0 1 for the illustrative layout the size of t is limited and its elements were calculated by hand however the size of t quickly increases if more systems are considered hence a script has been made for automatic computation of t for any layout the input for the script is a n s n c matrix where n s is the number of systems and n c is the number of compartments if system x is located in compartment y element x y of the input matrix equals 1 otherwise it equals zero following the same procedure as for the manually derived t the transition matrix is computed by definition its size is 2 n s 2 n s subsequently s and t can be used to calculate the probability for any state after any number of hits using eq 3 3 s h s 0 t h where h denotes the number of hits and s 0 is the initial state vector it is assumed that both systems are initially on so the initial state vector becomes 4 s 0 1 0 0 0 the probabilities of the four states can be plotted for an increasing number of hits which is presented in fig 2 as explained in more detail in habben jansen et al 2018b the fact that the two systems are located in one layout already makes them interdependent from a vulnerability perspective this also holds in situations where there is no physical or logical overlap between the two systems the results of fig 2 are obtained by the matrix vector multiplication of eq 3 these results give information on what the shapes of the curves are but not on why the curves are shaped that way an explicit formulation of the curves can contribute to understanding the latter and is one of the key contributions of this paper as the transition matrix is raised to higher powers of h the explicit formulation can be obtained by applying matrix diagonalisation by definition the associated equation is 5 t h p d h p 1 where d is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of t on the diagonal and p contains the respective eigenvectors this holds if and only if all eigenvectors of t i e all columns of p are linearly independent lay 2006 this paper does not contain a proof that this universally holds for the transition matrix of any layout in general however the authors are not aware of any layout either conceptual or more advanced where the columns of p are not linearly independent this indicates but does not proof that linear independence occurs for any layout the linear independence of the columns of p can be confirmed by computing the rank of p in this study matlab is used for this and for all other computations described in this paper if the rank of p equals the number of columns in p its columns are linearly independent in addition to p the diagonal matrix d needs to be constructed as well this requires the eigenvalues of t since the vulnerability assessment only considers damage of systems and not repairs t is always an upper triangular matrix hence the eigenvalues of t are the entries on its diagonal as a result the diagonal of d contains the same values as the diagonal of t for the illustrative layout this leads to 6 d λ 1 0 0 0 0 λ 2 0 0 0 0 λ 3 0 0 0 0 λ 4 3 9 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0 0 0 5 9 0 0 0 0 1 the associated eigenvectors are the columns of p 7 p 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 the rank of p is 4 so the columns of p are linearly independent as such matrix diagonalisation is indeed possible for this case so the state probabilities can indeed be expressed explicitly for the illustrative layout this leads to 8a p r s 1 λ 1 h 3 9 h 8b p r s 2 λ 1 h λ 2 h 3 9 h 6 9 h 8c p r s 3 λ 1 h λ 3 h 3 9 h 5 9 h 8d p r s 4 λ 1 h λ 2 h λ 3 h λ 4 h 3 9 h 6 9 h 5 9 h 1 these equations show that the state probabilities are only dependent on eigenvalues of t a major advantage is that this holds for any layout with two systems regardless of the number of compartments or the physical location of the systems in the compartments thus a specific pre defined concept is used to generate generalised knowledge this can be used to search for alternative solutions and to evaluate the interdependencies between the states consider for example the situation where there is a desire to maximise the probability that both systems are on i e to maximise p r s 1 this probability is dependent on λ 1 only this is element 1 1 of the transition matrix i e the probability to remain in s 1 given that the previous state was s 1 already in this example this probability is 3 9 corresponding to the number of compartments where no systems are located to increase the probability this value needs to be increased this implies that more compartments need to be empty i e systems a and b need to be concentrated more which is sensible from a physical perspective however this comes at a cost as increasing λ 1 has a negative effect on the probabilities for s 2 and s 3 hence this leads to a high probability that both systems are on after one or more hits but the probability that at least one of the systems is on reduces though this result seems trivial for this illustrative layout this method can be extended to larger more complex concepts as well enabling a better understanding of the trade off between different levels of residual capabilities to scale up this method to layouts that can be used during the concept phase several additional issues need to be addressed these have previously been introduced in habben jansen et al 2018a contrary to the systems in the illustrative layout that contained only two components and a routing between them distributed systems on board naval ships are part of multi layered networks with one or more hub layers between suppliers and consumers de vos and stapersma 2018 in addition to that these networks are often multiplex resulting in interdependencies between the different commodities that flow through the network for example a chilled water unit is represented by a single node while it is a consumer of electrical energy and a supplier of chilled water at the same time as a result it is not possible to simply state that a system is on or off this depends on the availability of multiple components that may provide different types of commodities within the markov chain this is addressed by describing the states as the availability of individual connections these connections contain edges of the distributed systems network including the start node and end node consider fig 3 for an example where it is assumed that consumer 1 and consumer 2 provide the same capability the table at the right shows how the states for this example are defined the capability is available if the network is in state 1 2 or 3 if the network is in state 4 5 6 7 or 8 the capability is not available note that this is independent of the transition matrix hence the distributed systems network is subdivided in individual connections and subsequently the markov chain is calculated the interdependencies between connections i e the fact that capabilities require a combination of certain edges is accounted for after the markov chain has been calculated in the case of this example the probability for having the capability available is found by adding the state probabilities of state 1 2 and 3 together as only they represent states where the capability is available the states that describe the availability of individual connections can be used to calculate the probability that certain levels of residual capability are available after one or more hits these levels could for example be expressed as the ship s ability to perform the main functions fight move and float where full residual capability includes all three functions medium residual capability only contains move and float and minimal residual capability only includes float however other definitions of residual capabilities can be applied as well it is not possible to express the states directly as the availability of the capabilities as multiple connections may contribute to a single capability likewise a single connection may contribute to multiple capabilities to obtain the probability that a certain level of residual capability is available all states that contribute to that capability need to be added together which provides a result that resembles the curves of fig 4 as each state can be expressed as an explicit function of only the eigenvalues of t this also holds for the explicit formulation of the capability curves of fig 4 hence eigenvalues of t are the direct link between the ship concept consisting of the compartments and the routed distributed systems network and the shape of the curves and can be used to study the interdependencies between the different levels of capability 4 test case this section provides a test case to illustrate the application and contributions of the method this is an extension of the test case that has previously been introduced in habben jansen et al 2018a it considers a notional ocean going patrol vessel opv with an offensive weapon system a defensive weapon system and two propellers two powering concepts are considered 1 conventional the propulsion system is mechanical and is separated from the electrical distribution system which powers both weapon systems a forward and aft chilled water unit provide chilled water to the weapon systems 2 ips both the propulsion system and the weapon systems are powered by electrical power the chilled water units for the weapon systems are located in the vicinity of the weapon systems the distributed systems networks and the physical location of the networks in the ship are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively both concepts contain 12 connections as a result the number of states is 2 12 4096 the markov chain has been set up according to the method described in section 3 using the script for automatic generation of the transition matrix the probability for each state has been calculated for up to 8 hits meaning that up to 8 compartments are disabled subsequently the states are combined to four levels of residual capability as specified in table 1 for each individual state it is checked whether it contributes one or more levels of residual capability if so the probability for that state is assigned to that residual capability if not the probability for that state is ignored the result is a sum of contributing state probabilities for each level of residual capability which is a quantitative version of the example result shown in fig 4 for this test case the result is presented in fig 7 the horizontal axis of this figure denotes the number of hits the vertical axis is the probability that at least the level of required residual capability is met for example the probability to have at least minimal residual capability is higher for the conventional concept solid purple line than for the ips concept dashed purple line the higher the number of hits the bigger this difference becomes this indicates that the conventional concept performs better than the ips concept for this level of residual capability i e at least propulsion at one side for the level of considerable residual capability i e at least full propulsion and the defensive weapon the ips concept performs better this illustrates a trade off in residual capabilities that needs to be made for these two particular concepts it should be kept in mind though that the differences between the conventional concept and ips concept are based on ship concepts with a limited level of detail if one concept performs better than another concept at this stage there is no definite guarantee that this also holds when both concepts are developed in more detail however the purpose of this assessment is not to select the best concept but to identify the underlying rationale that leads to these levels of vulnerability the results including the associated trade off have previously been interpreted in a qualitative fashion only with the observation that the curves can be written as a function of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix a formal mathematical description can be obtained and is presented in this paper this gives insight into why the curves are shaped in this particular fashion the resulting knowledge can be used to search for alternative potentially better concepts and to identify and quantify interdependencies between the different levels of residual capability 5 results in order to formulate the probability curves for the states explicitly matrix diagonalisation needs to be applied this is only possible if the rank of p equals its size in this case this means that matrix diagonalisation is possible if the rank of p is 4096 using matlab this is found to be the case for both the conventional concept and the ips concept hence the curves of the different levels of residual capability can be expressed as 9 p r c i k 1 n f k λ k h where c i denotes the i th capability level in this test case i runs from 1 to 4 λ k denotes the k th eigenvalue of the transition matrix in this test case k runs from 1 to 4096 which is n the number of states h is the number of hits and f k is an integer factor that states how strong λ k contributes to the curve and which sign it has the expression of eq 9 can be set up for each individual vulnerability curve table 2 gives the eigenvalues and factors for the curve that represents the probability for full residual capability of the conventional concept as presented in fig 7 the first column provides the state numbers of the eigenvalues that contribute to the curve between 1 and 4096 the second column gives the actual value of these eigenvalues as provided by the transition matrix the third column states whether the eigenvalue corresponds positively or negatively to the curve and how strong the corresponding state definitions are included as well where the numbers 1 12 relate to the individual connections in the concept as defined in fig 5 several observations can be made though there is a total of 4096 states only 12 states have eigenvalues that contribute to the probability for full residual capability of the conventional concept some eigenvalues have a positive contribution while others have a negative contribution many of these eigenvalues occur in pairs that cancel each other out for each pair connection 11 is off in one of the corresponding states while connections 7 10 and 12 are on this state is physically not possible as connection 11 shares routings with these other connections through the same compartments the meaning of the corresponding eigenvalues is strictly mathematical in this case nevertheless they should not be ignored if modifications to connection 11 are made in such way that it no longer routed together with other connections the pair wise cancellation may no longer be present for every eigenvalue the corresponding state includes the availability of at least connections 1 2 7 9 10 and 12 relating this back to the distributed systems network of fig 5 it turns out that these are all non redundant connections for some states connections 6 and 8 are off their unavailability is related individual availability of either connection 6 or connection 8 does not occur for every state where connections 6 and 8 are off there is a fellow state where connection 11 is off for most states either connection 3 4 or 5 is off but no combinations of these states these observations are the result of assessing this specific concept but are not restricted to the physical routings of the concept therefore they provide valuable information that can be used to better understand and improve the existing concept the following procedure is proposed for this 1 from all curves representing the various levels of residual capability select one to study in more detail for this test case the curve of full residual capability for the conventional concept is investigated 2 check how many eigenvalues contribute to the shape of that curve this may be decisive for how the further assessment is carried out in this case 12 eigenvalues contribute to the curve the number of contributing eigenvalues is no metric for the vulnerability it can therefore not be stated that either more or less eigenvalues is better however a smaller number of eigenvalues allows the designer to do a manually oriented assessment while for a larger number of contributing eigenvalues the assessment may require a more computational approach this test case illustrates a manual approach assessment methods for larger numbers of eigenvalues are still subject of further research 3 check for repetitions or pairs in the contributing eigenvalues for this test case four pairs with connection 11 occur leading to eigenvalues that cancel each other out as such only four eigenvalues contribute to the shape of the curve they will be addressed in this test case 4 change the remaining connections in such way that the eigenvalues with positive factors increase and the eigenvalues with negative factors decrease in order to increase an eigenvalue with a positive factor the connections that are on in that state need to be reduced in size or concentrated in order to decrease an eigenvalue with a negative factor the connections that are off in that state need to be reduced in size or concentrated from a mathematical point of view it could also be an option to increase the size of the routings of the other connections but that would lead to increased vulnerability of those connections for the sake of a lower relative vulnerability of the other connections as such recommendations of size reduction and concentration of routings are preferred this can be applied to this test case consider the situation where there is a desire to increase the probability that there is full residual capability after one or more hits the eigenvalues λ 81 λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 have the strongest influence on this as they are not canceled out by other eigenvalues more specifically λ 81 needs to be decreased and λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 need to be increased for all these eigenvalues connections 6 and 8 are off in order to decrease λ 81 the routings of these connections should be made smaller or more concentrated however in order to increase λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 it is the other way around this is a mathematical representation of conflicting requirements that result from interdependencies between the connections however a closer look at λ 209 λ 337 and λ 593 shows that either connection 3 4 or 5 is off in their associated states in order to increase these eigenvalues the probability to remain in any of these states should be increased this indicates that all routings related to connections other than 3 4 5 6 or 8 need to be made smaller or more concentrated connections 1 and 2 are related to propulsion and are not easy to modify for the conventional concept however for connections 7 9 10 11 and 12 two modifications are proposed 1 bring cw2 above swb2 closer to the ciws this concentrates the routings of connections 9 10 and 12 and reduces the routing length of connection 11 2 concentrate the routing from swb1 to the ciws connection 7 with the routing between swb1 and swb2 connection 5 this reduces the number of compartments solely occupied by the routing of connection 7 the concept is adjusted accordingly such as presented in fig 8 the results of this adjustment are given in fig 9 it can be observed that the adjustments have the desired effect as the curve for full residual capability lies higher indicating a higher probability for having this level of residual capability after one or more hits at the same time the curves for moderate and considerable residual capability have increased as well hence the positive effect of the modification goes beyond the level of residual capability that was originally considered in this case this effect is positive however for other cases the residual capability of other levels may drop if the residual capability of the level that was originally considered is increased this method elucidates and quantifies these interdependencies the same method can be applied to the ips concept fig 7 shows that the probability for minimal residual capability i e at least propulsion at one side is significantly lower for the ips concept purple dashed curve than for the conventional concept consider the situation where there is a desire to increase this probability the eigenvalues and factors that determine the shape of this curve are presented in table 3 for this case all factors are either 1 or 1 so in order to determine the eigenvalues with the largest influence the magnitude of the eigenvalues need to be considered the largest eigenvalues i e the eigenvalues with the largest influence on the curve are λ 1920 λ 1984 and λ 2944 the corresponding factor is 1 for all these eigenvalues so they make a positive contribution to the curve hence the probability for minimal residual capability increases when the magnitude of these eigenvalues increase the state definitions associated with these eigenvalues show that connections 1 2 5 and 6 are on while the other connections are off in order to increase the probability for minimal residual capability the number of compartments associated with these connections needs to be reduced and concentration and or separation of the associated system components and routings may be beneficial to that end swb1 is relocated one compartment lower compared to the original ips concept that was presented in fig 6 as a result the distance between swb1 and both propellers reduces in addition of that only one compartment is a single point of failure instead of two compartments for the previous situation since swb1 has been relocated the routings from dg1 and dg2 need to be adjusted as well as a result the routing from dg2 to swb1 now has a partial overlap with the routing between swb1 and the starboard propeller however this does not affect the power supply to the port side propeller so the requirement to have a large probability for propulsion at one side at least is still met propulsion power can also be supplied via dg3 and swb2 i e connections 3 and 4 however the results of the eigenvalue assessment shows that these connections have a smaller influence on the shape of the curve these connections are therefore left unchanged the adjusted layout is presented in fig 10 the associated result is given in fig 11 it can be seen that the probability for having at least minimal residual capability has increased significantly hence the proposed solution has the desired effect for the other levels of residual capability the curves remain unchanged so no trade off needs to be made this is because the capability that is considered i e propulsion at one side at least does not include components or routings of other systems 6 conclusions and recommendations in this paper a method for assessing vulnerability of naval distributed ship systems is presented and illustrated this method assesses the vulnerability in a quantitative fashion from a capabilities perspective in the concept phase a major benefit of the method is that it does not only evaluate the vulnerability of an existing pre defined concept but also provides direction for finding other potentially better solutions this is done from a capabilities perspective rather than from a systems perspective the method accounts for the fact that the relation between individual connections and higher level capabilities is not necessarily one to one and that potential trade offs between various levels of capability may exist an explicit mathematical formulation relates the availability of higher level capabilities to specific connections in the distributed systems network that are decisive for this availability in addition to these general contributions several specific conclusions can be drawn from the test case where the vulnerability of a conventional powering concept and an ips concept for a notional opv has been assessed at various levels of required residual capability it differs per level whether the conventional or ips concept performs better though some of the differences are subtle there is a major difference in the probability for minimal residual capability i e having propulsion at one side at least for this level of residual capability the conventional concept performs significantly better than the ips concept this is because the number of compartments that is equipped with propulsion components and routings is larger for the ips concept making it more likely to get hit nevertheless the method has successfully provided directions to modify the concept such that this improves without compromising the performance for other levels of residual capability the conventional concept has also been modified with a goal to obtain a higher probability for full residual capability this has indeed been achieved also without compromising other levels of residual capability it should be kept in mind that these results are based on an assessment with uniform hit probability in earlier work of the authors it has been shown that other user defined hit probability distributions can be applied as well habben jansen et al 2018b these other types of distributions have not yet been applied for obtaining design recommendations such as done in this paper opportunities arise for combining these two aspects but the mathematical set up and design implications are still subject of ongoing research the same holds for scaling up the method to higher numbers of systems and routings as discussed in section 3 the size of the transition matrix increases exponentially with the number of connections that is considered currently this limits the size and complexity of the method to distributed systems comparable to the test case of this paper since this paper aimed to explain how design recommendations for reduced vulnerability can be obtained rather than mimicking an actual design effort this limited complexity is considered appropriate however opportunities for scaling the method and including more representative ship concepts are under consideration in ongoing work the vulnerability method presented in this paper considers system components and routings that can be either on or off in other words the method checks whether the power sources and sinks in the network are connected however in order to meet the various level of residual capabilities there also needs to be sufficient effort and flow of the different commodities adding a network flow assessment to this method would increase the fidelity such an assessment can also evaluate in which damage cases an operational decision needs to be taken because there is a higher power demand than power supply however the design stage for which this method is meant should be taken into consideration while doing this as the concept phase deliberately is associated with a low level of detail acknowledgments funding for this

on shore owc device is modelled in 2d nwt with fluent software nwt model and owc devices placed on different shore structures in cases and can be seen in fig 1 the lengths of the tanks include owc are 211 m and 400 m for generation of waves which periods are 6 s and 9 s other geometrical dimensions are shown in fig 1 the different lengths of wave tanks are tested to get accurate results in wave generation the length of wave tank is dependent to wave period and water depth the wave tank lengths are compared based on the charts in fig 4a b wave heights vs time on sampling line when it comes to comparison with analytical results the wave tank lengths used in simulation as 211m and 400m gives the most accurate data for the waves generated in simulation piston type wave maker used for wave generation is modelled at left side of the tank owc devices and shores at different cases are modelled at right end of the nwt the wavelengths are 55 8 m and 111 4 m for cases the initial water depth is modelled as 24 5 m the wave heights are set to 1 m 2 m 4 m for all cases 2 2 mesh structure and statistics the fluent software works based on fvm in this method the region of interest must be divided into sub regions for discretizing the governing equations to solve them iteratively over each sub region these sub regions create the mesh structure of the model dmt must be applied with layering type for wave generation in nwt layering method needs square mesh structure the reliability of square mesh structure is based on orthogonal quality as one of the mesh statistics the closer the orthogonal quality value is to 1 the better the mesh quality ansys fluent theory guide 15 0 n d the sections in fig 2 shows square mesh cells profile from the sections of left side and different shore types with owc at right side of nwt it is obvious that there are similar mesh structures in cases and this situation means models are useful for comparison in this study face size of each sub regions in mesh structure is set to 0 2 m at fluent mesh module for all cases table 1 shows the orthogonal quality statistics the number of nodes and elements in mesh structure in different geometrical models in cases the orthogonal qualities are similar and reliable 2 3 gravity waves modelled in simulation the generation of regular gravity waves is done with numerical simulation to obtain power output of owc devices if any environmental effect occurs on water particles on surface the gravitational acceleration make them to orient their initial position gravitational acceleration causes sinusoidal shaped waves under horizontal effect these waves are called gravity waves regular waves should be in the same behavior for means of period and length and amplitude according to the water depth modelled regular gravity waves in this study are based on an equation 1 given below mccormick 1973 1 l g t 2 2 π t a n h 2 π h l where l the wavelength g is the gravitational acceleration

utilize the rans equations for numerical analysis rans equations are applied to the system with added variables such as forces caused from motion depends on the user selection equations 5 7 shows the

f y are forces effects on fluid from horizontal and vertical directions vof method is a necessity to simulate immiscible mixture of more than one phase generally fluent is used with this method in time dependent solutions in aforementioned study these immiscible phases are air and water table 2 shows the properties of these phases are selected from fluent database ansys fluent theory guide 15 0 n d there is a need of volume fraction parameter symbolized with α q to use vof method volume fraction which is relevant to regional values is used to apply the appropriate properties and variables to

power output is a scale of available pneumatic power converted from the wave energy via the turbine p o u t is the power output at the turbine equation 10 shows the power output of the owc device kamath et al 2015 10 p o u t 1 t 0 t p t q t d t where p t is the average of pressure in air is chamber and q t is the volume flow rate of air across the turbine the equation of q t is shown in

of nwt width which is assumed 1 because of 2d analysis zhang et al 2012 the magnitude of p o u t can be computed with dividing the area under curve of the integral to wave period at equation 10 this computation is made via matlab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave generation results in nwt in this study simulations are made for four different geometries of shore type at wave heights such as 1m 2m 4m and periods such as 6s 9s the initial water depth is the same and 24 5m for all cases different shore structures are called a6 b6 c6 d6 a9 b9 c9 and d9 cases in the cases names the letter represents the code of shore geometry and the number refer the period of generated wave water volume fraction contours for t 90s can be seen fig 3 in the figure area above represents air and are below represents water phases nwt hole water volume fraction contours are given with case b6 and case c9 for 4m wave heights the onshore owc devices are shown in fig 3 at the end of the nwt water volume fraction is 1 for cells full of liquid water and 0 for cells full of air phases these results show that the shore type have effect on water motion and height near the onshore owc the results data of numerical studies need to be validated with analytical or experimental ones in this study the transient free water surface height results of cases a6 d6 are obtained from the sampling line placed 21m distance from left wall of the nwt the transient free surface water height results of cases a9 d9 are obtained from the sampling line placed 40m distance from left wall of the nwt free water surface heights of the generated waves in simulation can be seen in fig 4 a b at the water free surface height results of simulation for 4m wave heights at 9s as period the difference between numerical results and analytical data are less than 0 2 m free water surface height of 1m and 2m wave height simulation results show less than 0 05 m differences from analytical data the periods are correct for each water heights as can be seen in fig 4 the analysis is transient the contours of water volume fraction turbulence kinetic energy vertical velocity and vorticity are shown in fig 5 the case a9 and h 4m is chosen for representation of all cases to show time dependent change of numerical results from 68s to 77s as one period of wave 9s detailed examination of these results will be done in next section 3 2 turbulence kinetic energy turbulence kinetic energy results can give opinion about pressure difference at owc air chamber outflow turbulence kinetic energy at the outlet of opening is highest this kinetic energy is used for rotating the turbine of owc that generates electrical power fig 6 a shows the turbulence kinetic energy contours for each case at t 70s for wave period as 6s of simulation fig 6 b shows the turbulence kinetic energy contours for each case at t 75s for wave period as 9s of simulation kinetic energy at the outflow and the under water inlet of owc increases with the wave height as can be seen from legends in fig 6a b for 1m wave height at 6s period turbulence kinetic energy vary from almost 0 to 1 3j kg for 1m wave height at 9s period turbulence kinetic energy vary from almost 0 to 2 9j kg at this wave height shore types cause inconsiderable differences at turbulence kinetic energy for 2m wave height highest turbulence kinetic energy magnitude occurs at the outlet of case a9 which reaches 2 9j kg this situation can be explained with concavity of arc in case a9 and exhalation process at this time in this case shore structure let the water flow from inlet with less energy loses for 4m wave height case b6 and case c6 have higher turbulence kinetic energy than other cases as it reaches up to 18j kg 3 3 vorticity vorticity is defined as curl of velocity mathematically occurrence of vorticity demonstrates the circular motion of the fluid vorticity contours of cases for all modelled wave heights can be seen in fig 7 a at t 70s and 7b at t 75s for waves have different periods vorticity counters can be seen in fig 6a b for 4m wave height at 6s period maximum vorticity 35s 1 for 4m wave height at 9s period vorticity reaches up to 35s 1 there is always a vorticity at the bottom of the owc front wall because sharp corners of structure contours appear that there is linear motion of fluids between vorticity areas this is an evidence of laminar flow at inlet of owc and outlet of air chamber for 1m wave height shore type as concavity arc causes vorticity even at 1m wave height increase in wave height means increase in vorticity as expected the convex arc structure in case b6 and case b9 causes less vorticity at outlet for 4m wave height vorticity forms top of the shore at the inlet because of the water motion from free water surface in this height of wave most of vorticity areas are at the out of air chamber 3 4 velocity vertical velocity data are used as parameter of power output equation vertical velocity contours can be seen in fig 8 a and b for both wave periods and 70 and 75 s gravity and piston type wave maker s motion causes the water movement and then this movement effect the air this explains absolute higher velocity near of solid and free water surface areas negative vertical velocity magnitudes mean the velocity in negative direction absolute values of velocities increases with wave height maximum and minimum velocities are respectively 6 0 m s and 2 2 m s for 1m wave height 11 0 m s and 3 9 for 2m wave height 16 0 and 7 3 for 4m wave height wave height and vertical velocity don t change at the same rate as it seemed case b9 and case c9 results are similar and have higher velocities in negative direction in air chamber so this situation means there is inspiration of air chamber at this second 3 5 power output results the average vertical velocity of free water surface and pressure inside air chamber for each cases can be seen in figs 9 16 these data are used for power output calculation of owc devices the power output results have to be obtained after 50s and 53s of the simulation accordance with wave period the reliable values of results can be get from simulation after this time also there is no end limit of sampling time in analysis of aforementioned study seven wave periods time as sampling are considered sufficient then average of the power output is calculated tables 4 and 5 show the power output values in watt with steps as wave periods the results in table are calculated from the code in mentioned in material method section the average value of power output is computed from the simulation results between 53s 95s and 59s 122s for seven periods of waves the highest power output of cases show differences relevant to wave height for 1m wave height the highest and the lowest power outputs can be seen in case d9 and case a9 for 2m wave height the highest and the lowest calculated power outputs are in case d9 and case c6 for 4m wave height the highest and the lowest power outputs occurs in case b9 and case a6 this situation shows that concavity of shore in case a decreases performance of onshore owc more than other types of shore structures but this situation for case a returns to increasing effect of power output more than each cases when wave height becomes 2m if the results compared at t 6s for the figs 14 and 16 there are cut off error at pressure values after 122 seconds fig 17a and 17b show the power output vs wave height chart of the cases 4 conclusion the equations of calculating efficiency are only appropriate for flat surface and offshore owc devices so efficiencies of owc devices are not calculated in this study the aim of the study is to detect the better geometrical structure of coast to increase owc performance at higher wave periods there are four different coastal structures used for comparison when the waves have the same depth height and period with each other this means the comparison of efficiencies at the same rate power output results vary from 34 5 to 45 0 watt for 1m wave height 121 5 to 240 8 watt for 2m wave height and 425 3 to 1227 6 watt for 4m wave height the superiority of performances in sampling cases to each other shows variety based on wave height and period the best performances are obtained from convex arc structure at 4m wave height at 6s and 9s wave periods in this study the better geometrical structure of coast to increase owc performance is found as the coast have convex arc geometry results can be seen negligible for one period of time when considering watts for one wave period of time however annually effect of shore type is considerable the onshore owc shore type must be chosen or need to be adopted based on the yearly averaged maximum and minimum wave height near shore as a result the best geometrical shapes accordance with period and wave height are detected to have better performance from onshore owc numerically acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

potential only in coasts is estimated to be in order of 1 terawatt globally falnes 2007 the devices used for converting wave energy into electrical power are called as wave energy converter wec systems one of the classification of wecs is made according to their location such as offshore nearshore and onshore there are significant number of studies on these systems clément et al 2002 it is expected that offshore wave energy systems can contribute targets of world s energy security elhanafi et al 2017 michailides et al 2016 there is a need for long under water cables and connections in

211 m and 400 m for generation of waves which periods are 6 s and 9 s other geometrical dimensions are shown in fig 1 the different lengths of wave tanks are tested to get accurate results in wave generation the length of wave tank is dependent to wave period and water depth the wave tank lengths are compared based on the charts in fig 4a b wave heights vs time on sampling line when it comes to comparison with analytical results the wave tank lengths used in simulation as 211m and 400m gives the most accurate data for the waves generated in simulation piston type wave maker used for wave generation is modelled at left side of the tank owc devices and shores at different cases are modelled at right end of the nwt the wavelengths are 55 8 m and 111 4 m for cases the initial water depth is modelled as 24 5 m the wave heights are set to 1 m 2 m 4 m for all cases 2 2 mesh structure and statistics the fluent software works based on fvm in this method the region of interest must be divided into sub regions for discretizing the governing equations to solve them iteratively over each sub region these sub regions create the mesh structure of the model dmt must be applied with layering type for wave generation in nwt layering method needs square mesh structure the reliability of square mesh structure is based on orthogonal quality as one of the mesh statistics the closer the orthogonal quality value is to 1 the better the mesh quality ansys fluent theory guide 15 0 n d the sections in fig 2 shows square mesh cells profile from the sections of left side and different shore types with owc at right side of nwt it is obvious that there are similar mesh structures in cases and this situation means models are useful for comparison in this study face size of each sub

geometrical models in cases the orthogonal qualities are similar and reliable 2 3 gravity waves modelled in simulation the generation of regular gravity waves is done with numerical simulation to obtain power output of owc devices if any environmental effect occurs on water particles on surface the gravitational acceleration make them to orient their initial position gravitational acceleration causes sinusoidal shaped waves under horizontal effect these waves are called gravity waves regular waves should be in the same behavior for means of period and length and amplitude according to the water depth modelled regular gravity waves in this study are based on an equation 1 given below mccormick 1973 1 l g t 2 2 π t a n h 2 π h l where l the wavelength g is the gravitational acceleration

utilize the rans equations for numerical analysis rans equations are applied to the system with added variables such as forces caused from motion depends on the user selection equations 5 7 shows the

power output is a scale of available pneumatic power converted from the wave energy via the turbine p o u t is the power output at the turbine equation 10 shows the power output of the owc device kamath et al 2015 10 p o u t 1 t 0 t p t q t d t where p t is the average of pressure in air is chamber and q t is the volume flow rate of air across the turbine the equation of q t is shown in equation 11 kamath et al 2015 11 q t v t l w l is the air chamber length in x direction which is 5 m in this study v t is free water surface average vertical velocity inside air chamber w is the width of nwt width which is assumed 1 because of 2d analysis zhang et al 2012 the magnitude of p o u t can be computed with dividing the area under curve of the integral to wave period at equation 10 this computation is made via matlab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave generation results in nwt in this study simulations are made for four different geometries of shore type at wave heights such as 1m 2m 4m and periods such as 6s 9s the initial water depth is the same and 24 5m for all cases different shore structures are called a6 b6 c6 d6 a9 b9 c9 and d9 cases in the cases names the letter represents the code of shore geometry and the number refer the period of generated wave water volume fraction contours for t 90s can be seen fig 3 in the figure area above represents air and are below represents water phases nwt hole water volume fraction contours are given with case b6 and case c9 for 4m wave heights the onshore owc devices are shown in fig 3 at the end of the nwt water volume fraction is 1 for cells full of liquid water and 0 for cells full of air phases these results show that the shore type have effect on water motion and height near the onshore owc the results data of numerical studies need to be validated with analytical or experimental ones in this study the transient free water surface height results of cases a6 d6 are obtained from the sampling line placed 21m distance from left wall of the nwt the transient free surface water height results of cases a9 d9 are obtained from the sampling line placed 40m distance from left wall of the nwt free water surface heights of the generated waves in simulation can be seen in fig 4 a b at the water free surface height results of simulation for 4m wave heights at 9s as period the difference between numerical results and analytical data are less than 0 2 m free water surface height of 1m and 2m wave height simulation results show less than 0 05 m differences from analytical data the periods are correct for each water heights as can be seen in fig 4 the analysis is transient the contours of water volume fraction turbulence kinetic energy vertical velocity and vorticity are shown in fig 5 the case a9 and h 4m is chosen for representation of all cases to show time dependent change of numerical results from 68s to 77s as one period of wave 9s detailed examination of these results will be done in next section 3 2 turbulence kinetic energy turbulence kinetic energy results can give opinion about pressure difference at owc air chamber outflow turbulence kinetic energy at the outlet of opening is highest this kinetic energy is used for rotating the turbine of owc that generates electrical power fig 6 a shows the turbulence kinetic energy contours for each case at t 70s for wave period as 6s of simulation fig 6 b shows the turbulence kinetic energy contours for each case at t 75s for wave period as 9s of simulation kinetic energy at the outflow and the under water inlet of owc increases with the wave height as can be seen from legends in fig 6a b for 1m wave height at 6s period turbulence kinetic energy vary from almost 0 to 1 3j kg for 1m wave height at 9s period turbulence kinetic energy vary from almost 0 to 2 9j kg at this wave height shore types cause inconsiderable differences at turbulence kinetic energy for 2m wave height highest turbulence kinetic energy magnitude occurs at the outlet of case a9 which reaches 2 9j kg this situation can be explained with concavity of arc in case a9 and exhalation process at this time in this case shore structure let the water flow from inlet with less energy loses for 4m wave height case b6 and case c6 have higher turbulence kinetic energy than other cases as it reaches up to 18j kg 3 3 vorticity vorticity is defined as curl of velocity mathematically occurrence of vorticity demonstrates the circular motion of the fluid vorticity contours of cases for all modelled wave heights can be seen in fig 7 a at t 70s and 7b at t 75s for waves have different periods vorticity counters can be seen in fig 6a b for 4m wave height at 6s period maximum vorticity 35s 1 for 4m wave height at 9s period vorticity reaches up to 35s 1 there is always a vorticity at the bottom of the owc front wall because sharp corners of structure contours appear that there is linear motion of fluids between vorticity areas this is an evidence of laminar flow at inlet of owc and outlet of air chamber for 1m wave height shore type as concavity arc causes vorticity even at 1m wave height increase in wave height means increase in vorticity as expected the convex arc structure in case b6 and case b9 causes less vorticity at outlet for 4m wave height vorticity forms top of the shore at the inlet because of the water motion from free water surface in this height of wave most of vorticity areas are at the out of air chamber 3 4 velocity vertical velocity data are used as parameter of power output equation vertical velocity contours can be seen in fig 8 a and b for both wave periods and 70 and 75 s gravity and piston type wave maker s motion causes the water movement and then this movement effect the air this explains absolute higher velocity near of solid and free water surface areas negative vertical velocity magnitudes mean the velocity in negative direction absolute values of velocities increases with wave height maximum and minimum velocities are respectively 6 0 m s and 2 2 m s for 1m wave height 11 0 m s and 3 9 for 2m wave height 16 0 and 7 3 for 4m wave height wave height and vertical velocity don t change at the same rate as it seemed case b9 and case c9 results are similar and have higher velocities in negative direction in air chamber so this situation means there is inspiration of air chamber at this second 3 5 power output results the average vertical velocity of free water surface and pressure inside air chamber for each cases can be seen in figs 9 16 these data are used for power output calculation of owc devices the power output results have to be obtained after 50s and 53s of the simulation accordance with wave period the reliable values of results can be get from simulation after this time also there is no end limit of sampling time in analysis of aforementioned study seven wave periods time as sampling are considered sufficient then average of the power output is calculated tables 4 and 5 show the power output values in watt with steps as wave periods the results in table are calculated from the code in mentioned in material method section the average value of power output is computed from the simulation results between 53s 95s and 59s 122s for seven periods of waves the highest power output of cases show differences relevant to wave height for 1m wave height the highest and the lowest power outputs can be seen in case d9 and case a9 for 2m wave height the highest and the lowest calculated power outputs are in case d9 and case c6 for 4m wave height the highest and the lowest power outputs occurs in case b9 and case a6 this situation shows that concavity of shore in case a decreases performance of onshore owc more than other types of shore structures but this situation for case a returns to increasing effect of power output more than each cases when wave height becomes 2m if the results compared at t 6s for the figs 14 and 16 there are cut off error at pressure values after 122 seconds fig 17a and 17b show the power output vs wave height chart of the cases 4 conclusion the equations of calculating efficiency are only appropriate for flat surface and offshore owc devices so efficiencies of owc devices are not calculated in this study the aim of the study is to detect the better geometrical structure of coast to increase owc performance at higher wave periods there are four different coastal structures used for comparison when the waves have the same depth height and period with each other this means the comparison of efficiencies at the same rate power output results vary from 34 5 to 45 0 watt for 1m wave height 121 5 to 240 8 watt for 2m wave height and 425 3 to 1227 6 watt for 4m wave height the superiority of performances in sampling cases to each other shows variety based on wave height and period the best performances are obtained from convex arc structure at 4m wave height at 6s and 9s wave periods in this study the better geometrical structure of coast to increase owc performance is found as the coast have convex arc geometry results can be seen negligible for one period of time when considering watts for one wave period of time however annually effect of shore type is considerable the onshore owc shore type must be chosen or need to be adopted based on the yearly averaged maximum and minimum wave height near shore as a result the best geometrical shapes accordance with period and wave height are detected to have better performance from onshore owc numerically acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
22468,vortex induced vibration viv of a top tensioned riser ttr with parametric excitation has recently been receiving increasing attention in the ocean engineering this paper adopts a published and validated numerical model to predict the viv response of a 90 m ttr with bi frequency parametric excitation and the structural stiffness properties will be updated at each time step according to the real time axial tension twenty four bi frequency parametric excitation cases are designed and simulated to investigate viv response characteristics systematically viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation is quite different from that with single frequency one the effect of the phase difference between two harmonic tension components on the structural response is significant which cannot be ignored in dynamic analysis the structural response still has periodicity while the compliant period is the least common period of two harmonic components the combined action of the bi frequency parametric excitation components may excite some secondary sub harmonic response frequencies the individual response characteristics under bi frequency single amplitude cases hf sa lf la cases and hf la lf sa cases are revealed respectively by qualitative comparisons and quantitative analysis the essential mechanism of the presented response characteristics is discussed in detail and some conclusions are obtained keywords vortex induced vibration response characteristics top tensioned riser bi frequency parametric excitation 1 introduction a top tensioned riser ttr an essential component of subsea oil gas production systems acts as a bridge between a floating platform and a well on the seabed fig 1 is the simplified sketch of platform ttr seabed system the riser is connected at the top end to the floating platform through the tensioner and there is usually an appropriate pretension acting in the axial direction the riser system is exposed to harsh marine environmental loads like ocean current and waves with the current acting along the length of the riser vortices generate and alternately shed from the structural sides this vortex shedding process causes periodic pressure variation around the riser producing complicated hydrodynamic forces then leading to the riser s vibration while the waves induce the heave motion of the offshore platform which can be equivalent as a time varying axial tension hereinafter referred to as tension or bending stiffness i e parametric excitation to the dynamic analysis of the riser both the parametric excitation induced by the platform heave and the vortex induced vibration viv can result in the alternating deflections of the riser which may cause a structural failure in the riser system therefore viv with parametric excitation has been a popular research issue in the recent years as there is still no widely accepted analytical methods experiments and numerical simulations are two main approaches to obtain new insight of viv with parametric excitation the relevant experimental researches are relatively scarce franzini et al 2016 published the viv laboratory experiments of a small scale flexible cylinder with time varying tension the numerical investigations on this issue are mainly in time domain since it is still difficult to simulate the time varying tension in the viv frequency domain prediction tools with the development of spectral methods and computational fluid dynamics cfd technique evangelinos et al 1999 karniadakis et al 2005 and josefsson et al 2007 investigated the viv with variable tension or structural bending stiffness more numerical simulations are based on wake oscillator modes using a van der pol oscillator to describe the wake e g wang et al 1998 da silveira et al 2007 tang et al 2013 wu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 force decomposition model is another classic viv numerical simulation method relying on the experimental measurements of the different hydrodynamic force components yuan et al 2018 proposed an alternative force decomposition model to predict the viv response of the flexible cylinders with time varying tension and validated the numerical model well against the experimental results in franzini et al 2016 above numerical investigations all indicated that viv with parametric excitation present quite different response characteristics from those with constant tension besides there are also some researches on the dynamic buckling and stability region of the time varying tension system with simplified hydrodynamic force models e g simos et al 1997 park et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 cabrera miranda et al 2018 lou et al 2019 under the actual marine environment the waves are usually superposed by multi frequency components rather than only including a single frequency one as shown in fig 1 if the waves consists of two components with different frequencies the wave induced heave motion of the floating platform would also contains bi frequency response which means the riser s tension should follow the bi frequency variation with time the dynamic response of a ttr under combined vortex and multi frequency parametric excitations is inevitably more complicated and closer to the reality than single frequency or constant tension cases there seems still no experimental research on viv with multi frequency excitation and the above mentioned numerical simulations all assume the tension varies simply with single frequency the existing numerical investigations on multi frequency excitation are mainly concerning about the structural instability analysis yang et al 2013 2014 2017 few to focus on the dynamic response characteristic as a consequent research of yuan et al 2018 this paper attempts to investigate the more complicated viv with bi frequency parametric excitation the published and validated numerical model in yuan et al 2018 is adopted and twenty four designed bi frequency cases are simulated systematically by qualitative comparisons and quantitative analysis the individual response characteristics under three different types of cases are revealed respectively and the mechanism explanations of the captured response characteristics are given as well 2 numerical model and analysis methodology the adopted numerical model by this paper has been published and validated in yuan et al 2018 here just gives a brief introduction for the sake of conciseness note that the same numerical analysis method is used to investigate more complicated cases i e viv with bi frequency parametric excitation in this paper 2 1 viv hydrodynamic force and lock in judgement criterion cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the adopted viv model where x axis is parallel with current velocity y axis is perpendicular to flow direction and z axis is along the axial direction of the riser in the undeformed configuration based on viv force decomposition models the cross flow hydrodynamic force f h y d r o can be written as eq 1 which is composed of three force components i e excitation force f v damping force f d and inertia force f m 1 f h y d r o f v f d f m 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v 2 cos 2 π f t 1 2 c f a d f d v t y t π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 where c v is the excitation force coefficient a is the response amplitude d is the diameter f is the response frequency v is the current velocity t is the time ρ f is the fluid density c f is the hydrodynamic damping coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient which is assumed as a constant 1 0 in this paper viv hydrodynamic force coefficients c v and c f are the kernel of force decomposition models both of them changes with the non dimensional response amplitude and frequency as a function of time during each time step before obtaining the viv hydrodynamic force coefficients the displacement y and velocity v of nodes as well as time t should be extracted to calculate the real time vibration amplitude a and frequency f for every riser element as shown by eq 2 2 a y j y i 2 f 1 2 t j t i where y i y j t i t j are the displacement and time corresponding to the adjacent two time points i and j with the local response velocity v 0 fig 2 is the contour of viv excitation force coefficient i e c v originated from the cylinder forced vibration experiments in mit towing tank gopalkrishnan 1993 the thick line marks the important boundary between energy in and out zones the viv excitation center corresponds to fd v 0 17 approximately the strouhal number under test circumstance is 0 193 this database has been well verified by several mature frequency domain software such as shear7 and vivana lock in is the most significant feature of viv according to the recent experimental research by zheng 2014 the lock in region is set as the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 it needs to be corrected for the difference of the strouhal number between the actual and test circumstance by eq 3 3 f d v s t t e s t f d v s t a c t u a l if the non dimensional response frequency locates within the lock in region lock in will occur the riser element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to fd v 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient here fd v 0 17 also needs to be corrected by eq 3 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force truly in phase with the local velocity of the riser the control loop is a regulator system consisting of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase error detector monitors the phase difference between a reference signal calculated by prony s algorithm and the real time oscillation phase of the excitation force the reference signal can be switched according to the lock in state the phase differences between the local velocity of the riser and the excitation force at lock in state appear as a step function to the control system the phase difference will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time then the control loop remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero as another active subject of viv research hydrodynamic damping is also worthy of attention if the non dimensional response frequency is outside the lock in region c v will be negative which means the hydrodynamic damping force will act on the riser in that case the dominant frequency is regarded equal to the response frequency and the equivalent hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be calculated in eq 4 4 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical damping model by venugopal 1996 is adopted where the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 respectively 2 2 axial parametric excitation and structural dynamic analysis small response displacements are generally true in the case of viv the riser can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of motion in the cross flow direction can be expressed as eq 5 the third and fourth terms at the left side correspond to the bending stiffness and additional lateral stiffness respectively 5 m π 4 c a ρ

analysis flow chart during each time step is drawn in fig 3 2 3 numerical model validation to the knowledge of the authors there seems few comparable experimental investigations on the riser s viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation so it is still difficult to directly validate the numerical model against experimental measurements under bi frequency parametric excitation cases whereas when the adopted analysis methodology is concerned the essential eq 1 eq 9 are actually compatible for both constant tension and time varying tension including single frequency and bi frequency situations cases therefore the availability of the adopted numerical model for parametric excitation cases not only limited to single frequency situation could be reasonably verified with the corresponding test results under constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation cases the laboratory experiments of a small scale riser with constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation franzini et al 2016 are utilized to validate the adopted numerical model the 2 552 m riser model was laid vertically at towing tank the stretched and immersed lengths are 2 602 m and 2 257 m the diameter is 0 022 m and the bending stiffness is 0 056nm2 the mass ratio and immersed weight are 3 48 and 7 88 n m the top end static tension is 40n harmonic top motion was imposed at the riser top end by a servomotor device andδt t 0 is about 0 51 fig 4 and fig 5 give the comparisons of the riser s viv response between predicted and experimental results under constant tension and ω t ω c t 3 cases ω t is the circular frequency of time varying tension and ω c t is the excited circular frequency by the viv with constant tension fig 4 is the maximum amplitude envelop along the riser and the local response at monitoring point z z l0 0 43 are shown in fig 5 a is the constant tension case and b is the single frequency parametric excitation case the reduced velocity satisfies v r 1 v f n 1 d 5 63 where f n 1 is the first structural natural frequency in still water viv under the constant tension case has an obvious feature of single mode excited the predicted amplitude envelop along the riser is consistent with experimental observation the third mode appears in both the predicted and experimental envelops under the ω t ω c t 3 case and the magnitudes of the predicted amplitudes along the riser are basically in a good agreement with experiment the displacement time histories with constant tension present a standard sinusoidal shape and the predicted as well as experimental amplitudes both practically keep constant for the ω t ω c t 3 case the predicted and experimental amplitudes both slightly modulate around 0 6d under the constant tension case a single frequency is excited and the predicted dominant frequency is consistent with experimental data both close to the first structural natural frequency while new phenomena are captured under the ω t ω c t 3 case two outstanding peak frequencies near ω ω c t 1 and 3 are revealed and the one near ω ω c t 1 is weaker than ω ω c t 3 for the ω t ω c t 3 case the extra sub harmonic components in experimental observations seem not as strong as the predicted ones but they were actually verified in some other researches e g chen et al 2014 and yuan et al 2018 based on the validation against laboratory experiments the adopted numerical model is verified available for constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation cases it is believed able to provide reasonable prediction results under the following bi frequency cases in this study 2 4 data post processing when post processing the predicted dynamic response data the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to obtain the time frequency distributions of response displacement eq 10 is the continuous wavelet transform equation grossmann et al 1984 10 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where w t f a τ is the coefficient after wavelet transformation which represents the change of frequency on the time scale while a is the scale factor t is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet this paper selects morlet wavelet as the mother wavelet which is defined as eq 11 the response frequency spectra of displacement are obtained with fast fourier transform fft 11 ψ t c e i 2 2 cos 5 x 3 simulated cases design the 90 m riser model in lie et al 2006 is chosen as the simulation object and its physical parameters are listed in table 1 the vertical riser is uniformly discretized into 450 beam elements along the axial direction and a constant pretension is acted on the top end α 0 05 is used to control the numerical solution convergence of hht method the calculated time and increment are set as 500s and 0 002s which has been found sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results all the simulated cases are under uniform flow and the current velocity is set as 0 54 m s based on modal analysis viv approximately excites the 15th natural frequency f n 15 3 022 hz of the riser with constant pretension t 0 3700n a bi frequency time varying top end tension consisting of two harmonic components can be expressed in eq 12 12 t t t 0 δ t 1 sin 2 π p 1 t δ t 2 sin 2 π p 2 t φ where t 0 is the pretension at the riser s top end δ t 1 and δ t 2 are the amplitudes of the two tension time varying component i and ii p 1 and p 2 are the corresponding periods respectively φ is the initial phase difference between the two tension harmonic components if p 1 p 2 p i e single frequency bi frequency it is a quite special condition under which eq 12 can be deduced as eq 13 13 t t t 0 δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ sin ω t θ where ω 2 π p and θ arctan δ t 2 sin φ δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ above analytical deduction means a single frequency bi frequency case can actually be equivalent to a corresponding single frequency single frequency case and the equivalent tension amplitude is δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ therefore under the two conditions with φ β and φ β the structural dynamic response should be basically identical just existing a phase lag caused by different θ when φ increases from 0 to π the equivalent tension amplitude decreases so it can be speculated that the excited frequency bandwidth will become narrower and the response energy at the main excited frequency will turn stronger since the weaker sub harmonic components participate in viv of the riser the displacement time histories gradually show simpler regularity above analysis has already been mentioned in yuan et al 2018 so this paper will not in detail investigate the single frequency bi frequency cases any more and mainly focuses on bi frequency cases according to the magnitude relation of two harmonic components amplitude and frequency bi frequency cases can be classified into three types 1 bi frequency single amplitude cases i e δ t 1 δ t 2 2 high frequency small amplitude low frequency large amplitude hereinafter referred to as hf sa lf la cases i e p 1 p 2 and δ t 1 δ t 2 3 high frequency large amplitude low frequency small amplitude hereinafter referred to as hf la lf sa cases i e p 1 p 2 and δ t 1 δ t 2 in this paper three types of cases are all included in the simulated cases design under the actual marine environment the tension fluctuation of a top tensioned riser is usually less than 30 and the heave motion period of a floating platform is generally within 10s 15s he 2010 tang et al 2013 two different amplitudes of δ t t 0 1 and 0 2 as well as two different periods of p 10s and 15s are selected and eight uniformly distributed phases cover π π twenty four bi frequency cases are simulated to investigate three types of cases the controlled parameter values are listed in table 2 4 viv response under bi frequency single amplitude cases fig 6 gives the time histories of the riser s top end tension under bi frequency single amplitude cases quite different from single frequency cases the time varying tension no longer follows standard sinusoidal rule and presents individual time histories under different phases the tension still varies with periodicity however the corresponding period is not p 1 10s or p 2 15s but the least common multiple of p 1 and p 2 i e 30s according to the extreme values marked in pink the fluctuation range of tension is approximate t min is around 3000n and t max is around 4440n the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under a typical bi frequency single amplitude case φ 3 π 4 are shown in fig 7 as marked in pink the response displacement modulates with obvious periodicity of 30s corresponding to the tension variation it means the structural dynamic response will follow the least common period of two tension harmonic components under bi frequency cases from the time frequency distribution plot response frequency transits around 3 02 hz with time varying also following the time varying tension period p 30s viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation presents significant time sharing characteristics fig 8 gives time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under bi frequency single amplitude cases with φ 0 π 2 and π different phases make the structural local response displacement present quite different modulation processes during a complete period the displacement with every phase has individual sequence of many increase and decrease segments and the amplitude fluctuation range also changes with phase varying above differences are caused by the respective tension time histories with different phases according to the amplitude spectra the excited frequency bandwidths under three cases are basically same approximately within 2 5 hz 4 hz this is because the different phases would not change the tension variation ranges evidently which has been shown in fig 6 to investigate the effect of phase on the riser s dynamic response furtherly fig 9 collects the maximum response displacements and maximum rms displacements of the riser under the eight designed bi frequency single amplitude cases and the response peak frequency at the riser s midpoint as well as the dominant modal order of the structural dynamic response under every case are shown in fig 10 in fig 9 the initial phase difference between two tension harmonic components affects the displacement extreme value significantly the maximum displacement a max d 0 45 when φ 0 while it turns to be 0 31 when φ π 2 and 3 π 4 for the rms displacement a rms max d 0 45 when φ 3 π 4 while it becomes 0 14 when φ π 2 with φ increases from π to π the extreme displacement varies correspondingly but its variation regularity is not clear enough yet fig 10 shows that phase has a strong influence on the local response peak frequencies and the dominant modal order can even change under bi frequency single amplitude cases with different phases unfortunately the explicit influence laws of φ on the tension time history and structural response are still hard to be given considering the uncertainty of the initial phase difference between two tension harmonic components on affecting the structural response it cannot be ignored when investigating the viv response characteristics with bi frequency parametric excitation although the structural response under single frequency and bi frequency cases shows obvious differences there are also some inherent relations between these two types of cases another two typical bi frequency single amplitude cases with φ π 4 and 3 π 4 are selected to compare to the two corresponding single frequency cases i e two harmonic components the displacement amplitude spectrum comparisons at the riser s midpoint are presented in fig 11 where first two rows denote two comparable single frequency cases while next two rows denote bi frequency single amplitude cases yuan et al 2018 indicated that single frequency parametric excitation may excite the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t k ω t where ω t is the frequency of the varying tension and ω c t is the excited frequency by the viv with constant tension for the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s ω t corresponds to 0 1 hz and 0 067 hz respectively as mentioned in section 3 ω c t in this paper should be 3 02 hz so two types of sub harmonic components i e 3 02 k 0 1 hz marked in black and 3 02 k 0 067 hz marked in red are obviously captured from the displacement amplitude spectra in fig 11 note that for bi frequency single amplitude cases apart from above standard sub harmonic components another type of frequency components may also be excited which is marked in blue this type of frequency components has the values of 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 3 19 hz 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 3 05 hz 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 2 99 hz or 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 2 85 hz where m n 0 1 2 3 it can be easily deduced that these extra excited frequencies are owing to the superposition effect of high frequency 0 1 hz and low frequency 0 067 hz sub harmonic components caused by two single frequency parametric excitation such excited frequencies can be called secondary sub harmonic components therefore when expanding single frequency cases to bi even multi frequency cases the sub harmonic frequencies will also expand from ω c t k ω t to ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 where ω v t 1 ω v t 2 are the frequencies of each harmonic components of the time varying tension compared with two single frequency cases the tension of bi frequency single amplitude cases inevitably has broader fluctuation range which makes the excited frequency bandwidth also broader since more sub harmonic components participate in viv which is detrimental to concentrating response energy the energy strength at peak frequencies under bi frequency single amplitude cases is obviously weaker than that under single frequency cases the rms displacement distribution comparisons along the riser between single frequency cases and bi frequency single amplitude cases are shown in fig 12 according to the whole vibration shape of the riser the dominant modal order of two single frequency cases is 15 while it increases to 16 under two bi frequency single amplitude cases since the combination of two harmonic components broadens not only the tension variation range but also the excited frequency bandwidth more higher frequency response appears and the structural whole vibration tends to present higher order modal shape as marked in pink the maximum rms displacement a rms max d of two bi frequency single amplitude cases is within the corresponding values of two single frequency cases yuan et al 2018 found ω t ω c t 2 is the kernel condition most prone to mathieu type resonance under which the viv response will be significantly amplified by the parametric excitation deviating from the resonance center in both directions the maximum displacement is in a decrease tendency towards the value of the constant tension case the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s correspond to ω t ω c t 0 033 and ω t ω c t 0 022 respectively it means the parametric excitation with p 10s is closer to the mathieu type resonance center than that with p 15s so a rms max d of the single frequency case with p 10s is larger while the excitation frequency of two bi frequency single amplitude cases should be deemed within p 10s and p 15s so a rms max d should also be located between the corresponding values of the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s 5 viv response under bi frequency bi amplitude cases assuming δ t 1 δ t 2 is actually a simplification for the bi frequency parametric excitation both the frequencies and amplitudes of diverse tension harmonic components are usually different under the actual marine environment when δ t 1 δ t 2 and p 1 p 2 bi frequency cases can generally be classified into two types i e hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa as described in section 3 viv under these two types of cases is supposed to present respective response characteristics which will be discussed in detail as follows 5 1 hf sa lf la cases the time histories of the riser s top end tension under hf sa lf la cases are shown in fig 13 the tension presents different variation processes with different φ while the extreme values are approximate in general compared with fig 6 with the controlled parameter changing from δ t 2 t 0 0 1 to δ t 2 t 0 0 2 i e the amplitude of tension harmonic component ii enlarging the time varying tension has broader fluctuation range moreover as marked with gray circles in figs 6 and 13 φ will not change the number of points across the tension time histories and pretension under the same type of cases during each variation period the time varying tension intersects five times with t 0 3700 n under bi frequency single amplitude cases but does four times under hf sa lf la cases taking φ 0 π 4 and π 2 as examples fig 14 gives the time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under hf sa lf la cases similar with bi frequency single amplitude cases the effect of φ on the structural dynamic response is also significant and the response displacement modulates with individual regularities but same periodicity of p 30s under different hf sa lf la cases when δ t 1 p 1 δ t 2 and p 2 are fixed φ has little influence on the tension fluctuation range so the excited frequency bandwidths in different amplitude spectra are basically 2 hz 4 2 hz compared with fig 8 there are more frequencies excited in fig 14 this is because the tension has broader fluctuation range under hf sa lf la cases than bi frequency single amplitude cases the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under a typical hf sa lf la case with φ 3 π 4 are presented in fig 15 since the structural response has explicit periodicity here just provides the predicted results during a complete period of 150s 180s the displacement at the riser s midpoint obviously modulates with time varying and has a feature of multi frequency response superposition during the time interval of 30s the time history generally presents the mountain shape twice from the time frequency distribution plot the response frequency also transits around 3 02 hz twice corresponding to the variation of the displacement in fact fig 13 indicates that the time varying tension intersects four times with pretension t 0 3700 n during each period under hf sa lf la cases it means the tension has two similar variation processes of increasing first and then decreasing yuan et al 2018 indicated that the response displacement generally follows the tension variation under such parametric excitation with long period i e low frequency which could explain why the structural response would change with similar regularity twice during each period under hf sa lf la cases fig 16 is the time spatial distributions of the riser s response displacement and time histories of the main excited modal weight under the above hf sa lf la case φ 3 π 4 from the whole vibration of the riser amplitude modulation even mode jumps are easily captured under hf sa lf la cases there are unequal wave numbers along the structural axial direction at different time points and the structural dynamic response presents standing wave characteristic consistent with the riser s local response the whole vibration also changes twice during each period following a certain regularity according to the time histories of the main excited modal weight the modal weight of a specific order does not keep constant in time domain and the maximum weight may correspond to different modal order at different time points the weight time histories of 14th 17th modes all show the mountain shape twice during each 30s 5 2 hf la lf sa cases the time histories of the riser s top end tension under hf la lf sa cases are shown in fig 17 compared with the hf sa lf la cases in fig 13 controlled parameters varying from p 1 10s p 2 15s to p 1 15s p 2 10s does not change the variation period and fluctuation range of the tension however the value exchange between p 1 and p 2 still affects the time history shapes evidently under hf la lf sa cases the time varying tension intersects six times with t 0 3700 n during each variation period more than bi frequency single amplitude cases five times and hf sa lf la cases four times therefore the tension under hf la lf sa cases presents more intensive variation process than another two types of bi frequency cases to intuitively compare the viv response characteristics between the two types of bi frequency bi amplitude cases the typical case with the same phase and identical time interval in figs 14 16 are chosen to present the predicted results under hf la lf sa cases fig 18 is the time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under hf la lf sa cases with φ 0 π 4 and π 2 the variation processes of the response displacement under these three cases are different from each other which means the effect of φ on the structural response is indeed important the periodicity of p 30s is still easy to be captured the excited frequency components with different phases are basically identical just the response energy at a specific frequency may be unequal since the tension fluctuation range between hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases is approximate the excited frequency bandwidths in fig 18 are generally 2 hz 4 2 hz consistent with those in fig 14 the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under the typical hf la lf sa case with φ 3 π 4 are shown in fig 19 the presented amplitude modulation and frequency transition of the structural local response as well as their essential mechanism are similar with the analysis on hf sa lf la cases in section 5 1 the significant difference is that the number of times for the dynamic response changing with a certain regularity turns from two to three as shown by the pink arrows and lines the displacement increases first then decreases and repeats three times with the marked ① ② and ③ three similar transition processes of the response frequency could also be obviously captured in the time frequency distribution plot this is because the number of the intersect points between the tension time histories and pretension during each period has changed from 4 to 6 when p 1 and p 2 exchanges their values with each other fig 20 gives the time spatial distributions of the riser s response displacement and time histories of the main excited modal weight under above typical hf la lf sa case φ 3 π 4 from the displacement time spatial distributions similar with hf sa lf la cases mode jump phenomena and standing wave characteristics under hf la lf sa cases are also clear according to the color depth distributions there are obvious three regions concentrating response energy during each period the time histories of the main excited modal weight show that viv response of the riser is superposed by multi mode components 14th 17th modes being mainly excited and three outstanding peaks could be captured evidently with the help of the number marks 6 discussions for further investigations on the viv response characteristics and essential mechanism with bi frequency parametric excitation the predicted results under hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases will be compared directly in the same figures taking φ π 2 as an example the displacement amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint are compared in fig 21 where black solid line denotes hf sa lf la case while red dotted line denotes hf la lf sa case as mentioned in section 4 apart from ω c t 3 02 hz viv with bi frequency parametric excitation may excite the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 such extra excited frequency components are captured in fig 21 clearly as far as the energy strength at a specific frequency is concerned under hf sa lf la case the lower frequency sub harmonic components ω c t m 0 067 hz e g 2 96 hz and 3 09 hz in black caused by p 15s are stronger than those under hf la lf sa case contrarily the higher frequency sub harmonic components ω c t n 0 1 hz e g 2 92 hz and 3 12 hz in red caused by p 10s under hf la lf sa case are also stronger compared with hf sa lf la case it means the strength relation between two types of sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 and ω c t n ω v t 2 is actually consistent with the magnitude relation between δ t 1 and δ t 2 fig 22 collects the dominant modal number of the structural dynamic response under bi frequency bi amplitude cases the mode who occupies the maximum weight during the whole time interval is deemed as the dominant one the dominant modal order basically keeps at 15 to 17 the variation of dominant modal order with φ changing is more significant under hf la lf sa cases than hf sa lf la cases which means the effect of φ on the structural response is relatively stronger under the former condition in fact since the time varying tension intersects with the pretension six and four times respectively under hf la lf sa and hf sa lf la cases the tension variation under the former condition is relatively more intensive and the deviation induced by different phases tends to be amplified the maximum and average rms displacements under bi frequency bi amplitude cases are given in fig 23 under the same type of cases the response displacement fluctuates with the variation of φ compared with the two different types of cases the displacement under hf sa lf la cases is generally larger than the corresponding value under hf la lf sa cases the tension variation under hf la lf sa cases is more intensive which means this type of bi frequency parametric excitations are relatively unstable the structural dynamic response with such unstable parametric excitations also tends to present some instabilities so the time varying characteristics of viv response under hf la lf sa cases are indeed more obvious which is a detrimental to the accumulation of displacement amplitude 7 conclusions viv of the long flexible risers with time varying axial tension i e parametric excitation is a realistic research issue in the engineering applications based on a published and validated numerical model this paper tries to reveal the viv response with bi frequency excitation twenty four cases are designed and the viv response characteristics under bi frequency single amplitude cases hf sa lf la cases and hf la lf sa cases are investigated respectively several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 a single frequency bi frequency case can be deemed as a single frequency single amplitude case with the equivalent amplitude of δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ the structural dynamic response under the cases with φ β and φ β should be basically identical just existing a phase lag caused by different θ with φ increasing from 0 to π the excited frequency bandwidth would become narrower the response energy at the main excited frequency would turn stronger and the displacement time histories gradually show simpler regularity 2 the viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation is quite different from that with single frequency one the structural response still has periodicity while the compliant period is not any one of the two tension harmonic components but their least common multiple the effect of φ on the dynamic response is significant which cannot be ignored but its influence laws are still not clear enough the combined action of two harmonic components would excite some secondary sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 compared with single frequency cases bi frequency parametric excitation is more propitious to excite high frequency response and enlarge the dominant modal order the rms displacement under bi frequency single amplitude cases is within the corresponding values under the two pure harmonic components 3 the excited frequency bandwidths under the designed bi frequency bi amplitude cases are generally approximate viv response changes with a certain regularity twice and three times under hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases the effect of φ on the structural response is also important and it is relatively stringer under hf la lf sa cases the strength relation of the response energy between the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 and ω c t n ω v t 2 is consistent with the magnitude relation between δ t 1 and δ t 2 compared with hf sa lf la cases the time varying characteristics of the viv response under hf la lf sa cases is more obvious and the response displacement is smaller overall the effect of bi frequency parametric excitation on viv response of a tensioned riser is investigated systematically the obtained conclusions are able to make contributions to a deeper understanding of the deepwater riser s dynamic response under the actual marine environment and the predicted results could provide some references in the engineering design field in fact the wave induced heave motion of floating platform always has more than two frequency components and the actual parametric excitation on deepwater riser would be more complicated than the simulated ones in this study future work could focus on the riser s dynamic response with multi frequency at least three components even stochastic parametric excitations with the help of the relevant experimental researches to be carried out acknowledgement this paper is based on the projects supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51909163 51979166 51579146 
22468,vortex induced vibration viv of a top tensioned riser ttr with parametric excitation has recently been receiving increasing attention in the ocean engineering this paper adopts a published and validated numerical model to predict the viv response of a 90 m ttr with bi frequency parametric excitation and the structural stiffness properties will be updated at each time step according to the real time axial tension twenty four bi frequency parametric excitation cases are designed and simulated to investigate viv response characteristics systematically viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation is quite different from that with single frequency one the effect of the phase difference between two harmonic tension components on the structural response is significant which cannot be ignored in dynamic analysis the structural response still has periodicity while the compliant period is the least common period of two harmonic components the combined action of the bi frequency parametric excitation components may excite some secondary sub harmonic response frequencies the individual response characteristics under bi frequency single amplitude cases hf sa lf la cases and hf la lf sa cases are revealed respectively by qualitative comparisons and quantitative analysis the essential mechanism of the presented response characteristics is discussed in detail and some conclusions are obtained keywords vortex induced vibration response characteristics top tensioned riser bi frequency parametric excitation 1 introduction a top tensioned riser ttr an essential component of subsea oil gas production systems acts as a bridge between a floating platform and a well on the seabed fig 1 is the simplified sketch of platform ttr seabed system the riser is connected at the top end to the floating platform through the tensioner and there is usually an appropriate pretension acting in the axial direction the riser system is exposed to harsh marine environmental loads like ocean current and waves with the current acting along the length of the riser vortices generate and alternately shed from the structural sides this vortex shedding process causes periodic pressure variation around the riser producing complicated hydrodynamic forces then leading to the riser s vibration while the waves induce the heave motion of the offshore platform which can be equivalent as a time varying axial tension hereinafter referred to as tension or bending stiffness i e parametric excitation to the dynamic analysis of the riser both the parametric excitation induced by the platform heave and the vortex induced vibration viv can result in the alternating deflections of the riser which may cause a structural failure in the riser system therefore viv with parametric excitation has been a popular research issue in the recent years as there is still no widely accepted analytical methods experiments and numerical simulations are two main approaches to obtain new insight of viv with parametric excitation the relevant experimental researches are relatively scarce franzini et al 2016 published the viv laboratory experiments of a small scale flexible cylinder with time varying tension the numerical investigations on this issue are mainly in time domain since it is still difficult to simulate the time varying tension in the viv frequency domain prediction tools with the development of spectral methods and computational fluid dynamics cfd technique evangelinos et al 1999 karniadakis et al 2005 and josefsson et al 2007 investigated the viv with variable tension or structural bending stiffness more numerical simulations are based on wake oscillator modes using a van der pol oscillator to describe the wake e g wang et al 1998 da silveira et al 2007 tang et al 2013 wu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 force decomposition model is another classic viv numerical simulation method relying on the experimental measurements of the different hydrodynamic force components yuan et al 2018 proposed an alternative force decomposition model to predict the viv response of the flexible cylinders with time varying tension and validated the numerical model well against the experimental results in franzini et al 2016 above numerical investigations all indicated that viv with parametric excitation present quite different response characteristics from those with constant tension besides there are also some researches on the dynamic buckling and stability region of the time varying tension system with simplified hydrodynamic force models e g simos et al 1997 park et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 cabrera miranda et al 2018 lou et al 2019 under the actual marine environment the waves are usually superposed by multi frequency components rather than only including a single frequency one as shown in fig 1 if the waves consists of two components with different frequencies the wave induced heave motion of the floating platform would also contains bi frequency response which means the riser s tension should follow the bi frequency variation with time the dynamic response of a ttr under combined vortex and multi frequency parametric excitations is inevitably more complicated and closer to the reality than single frequency or constant tension cases there seems still no experimental research on viv with multi frequency excitation and the above mentioned numerical simulations all assume the tension varies simply with single frequency the existing numerical investigations on multi frequency excitation are mainly concerning about the structural instability analysis yang et al 2013 2014 2017 few to focus on the dynamic response characteristic as a consequent research of yuan et al 2018 this paper attempts to investigate the more complicated viv with bi frequency parametric excitation the published and validated numerical model in yuan et al 2018 is adopted and twenty four designed bi frequency cases are simulated systematically by qualitative comparisons and quantitative analysis the individual response characteristics under three different types of cases are revealed respectively and the mechanism explanations of the captured response characteristics are given as well 2 numerical model and analysis methodology the adopted numerical model by this paper has been published and validated in yuan et al 2018 here just gives a brief introduction for the sake of conciseness note that the same numerical analysis method is used to investigate more complicated cases i e viv with bi frequency parametric excitation in this paper 2 1 viv hydrodynamic force and lock in judgement criterion cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the adopted viv model where x axis is parallel with current velocity

coefficients c v and c f are the kernel of force decomposition models both of them changes with the non dimensional response amplitude and frequency as a function of time during each time step before obtaining the viv hydrodynamic force coefficients the displacement y and velocity v of nodes as well as time t should be extracted to calculate the real time vibration amplitude a and frequency f for every riser element as shown by eq 2 2 a y j y i 2 f 1 2 t j t i where y i y j t i t j are the displacement and time corresponding to the adjacent two time points i and j with the local response velocity v 0 fig 2 is the contour of viv excitation force coefficient i e c v originated from the cylinder forced vibration experiments in mit towing tank gopalkrishnan 1993 the thick line marks the important boundary between energy in and out zones the viv excitation center corresponds to fd v 0 17 approximately the strouhal number under test circumstance is 0 193 this database has been well verified by several mature frequency domain software such as shear7 and vivana lock in is the most significant feature of viv according to the recent experimental research by zheng 2014 the lock in region is set as the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 it needs to be corrected for the difference of the strouhal number between the actual and test circumstance by eq 3 3 f d v s t t e s

closest to fd v 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient here fd v 0 17 also needs to be corrected by eq 3 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force truly in phase with the local velocity of the riser the control loop is a regulator system consisting of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase error detector monitors the phase difference between a reference signal calculated by prony s algorithm and the real time oscillation phase of the excitation force the reference signal can be switched according to the lock in state the phase differences between the local velocity of the riser and the excitation force at lock in state appear as a step function to the control system the phase difference will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time then the control loop remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero as another active subject of viv research hydrodynamic damping is also worthy of attention if the non dimensional response frequency is outside the lock in region c v will be negative which means the hydrodynamic damping force will act on the riser in that case the dominant frequency is regarded equal to the response frequency and the equivalent hydrodynamic damping coefficient can be calculated in eq 4 4 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical damping model by venugopal 1996 is

displacements are generally true in the case of viv the riser can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of

analysis flow chart during each time step is drawn in fig 3 2 3 numerical model validation to the knowledge of the authors there seems few comparable experimental investigations on the riser s viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation so it is still difficult to directly validate the numerical model against experimental measurements under bi frequency parametric excitation cases whereas when the adopted analysis methodology is concerned the essential eq 1 eq 9 are actually compatible for both constant tension and time varying tension including single frequency and bi frequency situations cases therefore the availability of the adopted numerical model for parametric excitation cases not only limited to single frequency situation could be reasonably verified with the corresponding test results under constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation cases the laboratory experiments of a small scale riser with constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation franzini et al 2016 are utilized to validate the adopted numerical model the 2 552 m riser model was laid vertically at towing tank the stretched and immersed lengths are 2 602 m and 2 257 m the diameter is 0 022 m and the bending stiffness is 0 056nm2 the mass ratio and immersed weight are 3 48 and 7 88 n m the top end static tension is 40n harmonic top motion was imposed at the riser top end by a servomotor device andδt t 0 is about 0 51 fig 4 and fig 5 give the comparisons of the riser s viv response between predicted and experimental results under constant tension and ω t ω c t 3 cases ω t is the circular frequency of time varying tension and ω c t is the excited circular frequency by the viv with constant tension fig 4 is the maximum amplitude envelop along the riser and the local response at monitoring point z z l0 0 43 are shown in fig 5 a is the constant tension case and b is the single frequency parametric excitation case the reduced velocity satisfies v r 1 v f n 1 d 5 63 where f n 1 is the first structural natural frequency in still water viv under the constant tension case has an obvious feature of single mode excited the predicted amplitude envelop along the riser is consistent with experimental observation the third mode appears in both the predicted and experimental envelops under the ω t ω c t 3 case and the magnitudes of the predicted amplitudes along the riser are basically in a good agreement with experiment the displacement time histories with constant tension present a standard sinusoidal shape and the predicted as well as experimental amplitudes both practically keep constant for the ω t ω c t 3 case the predicted and experimental amplitudes both slightly modulate around 0 6d under the constant tension case a single frequency is excited and the predicted dominant frequency is consistent with experimental data both close to the first structural natural frequency while new phenomena are captured under the ω t ω c t 3 case two outstanding peak frequencies near ω ω c t 1 and 3 are revealed and the one near ω ω c t 1 is weaker than ω ω c t 3 for the ω t ω c t 3 case the extra sub harmonic components in experimental observations seem not as strong as the predicted ones but they were actually verified in some other researches e g chen et al 2014 and yuan et al 2018 based on the validation against laboratory experiments the adopted numerical model is verified available for constant tension and single frequency parametric excitation cases it is believed able to provide reasonable prediction results under the following bi frequency cases in this study 2 4 data post processing when post processing the predicted dynamic response data the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to obtain the time frequency distributions of response displacement eq 10 is the continuous wavelet transform equation grossmann et al 1984 10 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where w t f a τ is the coefficient after wavelet transformation which represents the change of frequency on the time scale while a is the scale factor t is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet this paper selects morlet wavelet as the mother wavelet which is defined as eq 11 the response frequency spectra of displacement are obtained with fast fourier transform fft 11 ψ t c e i 2 2 cos 5 x 3 simulated cases design the 90 m riser model in lie et al 2006 is chosen as the simulation object and its physical parameters are listed in table 1 the vertical riser is uniformly discretized into 450 beam elements along the axial direction and a constant pretension is acted on the top end α 0 05 is used to control the numerical solution convergence of hht method the calculated time and increment are set as 500s and 0 002s which has been found sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results all the simulated cases are under uniform flow and the current velocity is set as 0 54 m s based on modal analysis viv approximately excites the 15th natural frequency f n 15 3 022 hz of the riser with constant pretension t 0 3700n a bi frequency time varying top end tension consisting of two harmonic components can be expressed in eq 12 12 t t t 0 δ t 1 sin 2 π p 1 t δ t 2 sin 2 π p 2 t φ where t 0 is the pretension at the riser s top end δ t 1 and δ t 2 are the amplitudes of the two tension time varying component i and ii p 1 and p 2 are the corresponding periods respectively φ is the initial phase difference between the two tension harmonic components if p 1 p 2 p i e single frequency bi frequency it is a quite special condition under which eq 12 can be deduced as eq 13 13 t t t 0 δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ sin ω t θ where ω 2 π p and θ arctan δ t 2 sin φ δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ above analytical deduction means a single frequency bi frequency case can actually be equivalent to a corresponding single frequency single frequency case and the equivalent tension amplitude is δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ therefore under the two conditions with φ β and φ β the structural dynamic response should be basically identical just existing a phase lag caused by different θ when φ increases from 0 to π the equivalent tension amplitude decreases so it can be speculated that the excited frequency bandwidth will become narrower and the response energy at the main excited frequency will turn stronger since the weaker sub harmonic components participate in viv of the riser the displacement time histories gradually show simpler regularity above analysis has already been mentioned in yuan et al 2018 so this paper will not in detail investigate the single frequency bi frequency cases any more and mainly focuses on bi frequency cases according to the magnitude relation of two harmonic components amplitude and frequency bi frequency cases can be classified into three types 1 bi frequency single amplitude cases i e δ t 1 δ t 2 2 high frequency small amplitude low frequency large amplitude hereinafter referred to as hf sa lf la cases i e p 1 p 2 and δ t 1 δ t 2 3 high frequency large amplitude low frequency small amplitude hereinafter referred to as hf la lf sa cases i e p 1 p 2 and δ t 1 δ t 2 in this paper three types of cases are all included in the simulated cases design under the actual marine environment the tension fluctuation of a top tensioned riser is usually less than 30 and the heave motion period of a floating platform is generally within 10s 15s he 2010 tang et al 2013 two different amplitudes of δ t t 0 1 and 0 2 as well as two different periods of p 10s and 15s are selected and eight uniformly distributed phases cover π π twenty four bi frequency cases are simulated to investigate three types of cases the controlled parameter values are listed in table 2 4 viv response under bi frequency single amplitude cases fig 6 gives the time histories of the riser s top end tension under bi frequency single amplitude cases quite different from single frequency cases the time varying tension no longer follows standard sinusoidal rule and presents individual time histories under different phases the tension still varies with periodicity however the corresponding period is not p 1 10s or p 2 15s but the least common multiple of p 1 and p 2 i e 30s according to the extreme values marked in pink the fluctuation range of tension is approximate t min is around 3000n and t max is around 4440n the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under a typical bi frequency single amplitude case φ 3 π 4 are shown in fig 7 as marked in pink the response displacement modulates with obvious periodicity of 30s corresponding to the tension variation it means the structural dynamic response will follow the least common period of two tension harmonic components under bi frequency cases from the time frequency distribution plot response frequency transits around 3 02 hz with time varying also following the time varying tension period p 30s viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation presents significant time sharing characteristics fig 8 gives time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under bi frequency single amplitude cases with φ 0 π 2 and π different phases make the structural local response displacement present quite different modulation processes during a complete period the displacement with every phase has individual sequence of many increase and decrease segments and the amplitude fluctuation range also changes with phase varying above differences are caused by the respective tension time histories with different phases according to the amplitude spectra the excited frequency bandwidths under three cases are basically same approximately within 2 5 hz 4 hz this is because the different phases would not change the tension variation ranges evidently which has been shown in fig 6 to investigate the effect of phase on the riser s dynamic response furtherly fig 9 collects the maximum response displacements and maximum rms displacements of the riser under the eight designed bi frequency single amplitude cases and the response peak frequency at the riser s midpoint as well as the dominant modal order of the structural dynamic response under every case are shown in fig 10 in fig 9 the initial phase difference between two tension harmonic components affects the displacement extreme value significantly the maximum displacement a max d 0 45 when φ 0 while it turns to be 0 31 when φ π 2 and 3 π 4 for the rms displacement a rms max d 0 45 when φ 3 π 4 while it becomes 0 14 when φ π 2 with φ increases from π to π the extreme displacement varies correspondingly but its variation regularity is not clear enough yet fig 10 shows that phase has a strong influence on the local response peak frequencies and the dominant modal order can even change under bi frequency single amplitude cases with different phases unfortunately the explicit influence laws of φ on the tension time history and structural response are still hard to be given considering the uncertainty of the initial phase difference between two tension harmonic components on affecting the structural response it cannot be ignored when investigating the viv response characteristics with bi frequency parametric excitation although the structural response under single frequency and bi frequency cases shows obvious differences there are also some inherent relations between these two types of cases another two typical bi frequency single amplitude cases with φ π 4 and 3 π 4 are selected to compare to the two corresponding single frequency cases i e two harmonic components the displacement amplitude spectrum comparisons at the riser s midpoint are presented in fig 11 where first two rows denote two comparable single frequency cases while next two rows denote bi frequency single amplitude cases yuan et al 2018 indicated that single frequency parametric excitation may excite the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t k ω t where ω t is the frequency of the varying tension and ω c t is the excited frequency by the viv with constant tension for the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s ω t corresponds to 0 1 hz and 0 067 hz respectively as mentioned in section 3 ω c t in this paper should be 3 02 hz so two types of sub harmonic components i e 3 02 k 0 1 hz marked in black and 3 02 k 0 067 hz marked in red are obviously captured from the displacement amplitude spectra in fig 11 note that for bi frequency single amplitude cases apart from above standard sub harmonic components another type of frequency components may also be excited which is marked in blue this type of frequency components has the values of 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 3 19 hz 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 3 05 hz 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 2 99 hz or 3 02 m0 1 n0 067 hz e g 2 85 hz where m n 0 1 2 3 it can be easily deduced that these extra excited frequencies are owing to the superposition effect of high frequency 0 1 hz and low frequency 0 067 hz sub harmonic components caused by two single frequency parametric excitation such excited frequencies can be called secondary sub harmonic components therefore when expanding single frequency cases to bi even multi frequency cases the sub harmonic frequencies will also expand from ω c t k ω t to ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 where ω v t 1 ω v t 2 are the frequencies of each harmonic components of the time varying tension compared with two single frequency cases the tension of bi frequency single amplitude cases inevitably has broader fluctuation range which makes the excited frequency bandwidth also broader since more sub harmonic components participate in viv which is detrimental to concentrating response energy the energy strength at peak frequencies under bi frequency single amplitude cases is obviously weaker than that under single frequency cases the rms displacement distribution comparisons along the riser between single frequency cases and bi frequency single amplitude cases are shown in fig 12 according to the whole vibration shape of the riser the dominant modal order of two single frequency cases is 15 while it increases to 16 under two bi frequency single amplitude cases since the combination of two harmonic components broadens not only the tension variation range but also the excited frequency bandwidth more higher frequency response appears and the structural whole vibration tends to present higher order modal shape as marked in pink the maximum rms displacement a rms max d of two bi frequency single amplitude cases is within the corresponding values of two single frequency cases yuan et al 2018 found ω t ω c t 2 is the kernel condition most prone to mathieu type resonance under which the viv response will be significantly amplified by the parametric excitation deviating from the resonance center in both directions the maximum displacement is in a decrease tendency towards the value of the constant tension case the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s correspond to ω t ω c t 0 033 and ω t ω c t 0 022 respectively it means the parametric excitation with p 10s is closer to the mathieu type resonance center than that with p 15s so a rms max d of the single frequency case with p 10s is larger while the excitation frequency of two bi frequency single amplitude cases should be deemed within p 10s and p 15s so a rms max d should also be located between the corresponding values of the two single frequency cases with p 10s and p 15s 5 viv response under bi frequency bi amplitude cases assuming δ t 1 δ t 2 is actually a simplification for the bi frequency parametric excitation both the frequencies and amplitudes of diverse tension harmonic components are usually different under the actual marine environment when δ t 1 δ t 2 and p 1 p 2 bi frequency cases can generally be classified into two types i e hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa as described in section 3 viv under these two types of cases is supposed to present respective response characteristics which will be discussed in detail as follows 5 1 hf sa lf la cases the time histories of the riser s top end tension under hf sa lf la cases are shown in fig 13 the tension presents different variation processes with different φ while the extreme values are approximate in general compared with fig 6 with the controlled parameter changing from δ t 2 t 0 0 1 to δ t 2 t 0 0 2 i e the amplitude of tension harmonic component ii enlarging the time varying tension has broader fluctuation range moreover as marked with gray circles in figs 6 and 13 φ will not change the number of points across the tension time histories and pretension under the same type of cases during each variation period the time varying tension intersects five times with t 0 3700 n under bi frequency single amplitude cases but does four times under hf sa lf la cases taking φ 0 π 4 and π 2 as examples fig 14 gives the time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under hf sa lf la cases similar with bi frequency single amplitude cases the effect of φ on the structural dynamic response is also significant and the response displacement modulates with individual regularities but same periodicity of p 30s under different hf sa lf la cases when δ t 1 p 1 δ t 2 and p 2 are fixed φ has little influence on the tension fluctuation range so the excited frequency bandwidths in different amplitude spectra are basically 2 hz 4 2 hz compared with fig 8 there are more frequencies excited in fig 14 this is because the tension has broader fluctuation range under hf sa lf la cases than bi frequency single amplitude cases the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under a typical hf sa lf la case with φ 3 π 4 are presented in fig 15 since the structural response has explicit periodicity here just provides the predicted results during a complete period of 150s 180s the displacement at the riser s midpoint obviously modulates with time varying and has a feature of multi frequency response superposition during the time interval of 30s the time history generally presents the mountain shape twice from the time frequency distribution plot the response frequency also transits around 3 02 hz twice corresponding to the variation of the displacement in fact fig 13 indicates that the time varying tension intersects four times with pretension t 0 3700 n during each period under hf sa lf la cases it means the tension has two similar variation processes of increasing first and then decreasing yuan et al 2018 indicated that the response displacement generally follows the tension variation under such parametric excitation with long period i e low frequency which could explain why the structural response would change with similar regularity twice during each period under hf sa lf la cases fig 16 is the time spatial distributions of the riser s response displacement and time histories of the main excited modal weight under the above hf sa lf la case φ 3 π 4 from the whole vibration of the riser amplitude modulation even mode jumps are easily captured under hf sa lf la cases there are unequal wave numbers along the structural axial direction at different time points and the structural dynamic response presents standing wave characteristic consistent with the riser s local response the whole vibration also changes twice during each period following a certain regularity according to the time histories of the main excited modal weight the modal weight of a specific order does not keep constant in time domain and the maximum weight may correspond to different modal order at different time points the weight time histories of 14th 17th modes all show the mountain shape twice during each 30s 5 2 hf la lf sa cases the time histories of the riser s top end tension under hf la lf sa cases are shown in fig 17 compared with the hf sa lf la cases in fig 13 controlled parameters varying from p 1 10s p 2 15s to p 1 15s p 2 10s does not change the variation period and fluctuation range of the tension however the value exchange between p 1 and p 2 still affects the time history shapes evidently under hf la lf sa cases the time varying tension intersects six times with t 0 3700 n during each variation period more than bi frequency single amplitude cases five times and hf sa lf la cases four times therefore the tension under hf la lf sa cases presents more intensive variation process than another two types of bi frequency cases to intuitively compare the viv response characteristics between the two types of bi frequency bi amplitude cases the typical case with the same phase and identical time interval in figs 14 16 are chosen to present the predicted results under hf la lf sa cases fig 18 is the time histories and amplitude spectra of the riser midpoint s response displacement under hf la lf sa cases with φ 0 π 4 and π 2 the variation processes of the response displacement under these three cases are different from each other which means the effect of φ on the structural response is indeed important the periodicity of p 30s is still easy to be captured the excited frequency components with different phases are basically identical just the response energy at a specific frequency may be unequal since the tension fluctuation range between hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases is approximate the excited frequency bandwidths in fig 18 are generally 2 hz 4 2 hz consistent with those in fig 14 the time history and time frequency distribution plot of the riser midpoint s response displacement under the typical hf la lf sa case with φ 3 π 4 are shown in fig 19 the presented amplitude modulation and frequency transition of the structural local response as well as their essential mechanism are similar with the analysis on hf sa lf la cases in section 5 1 the significant difference is that the number of times for the dynamic response changing with a certain regularity turns from two to three as shown by the pink arrows and lines the displacement increases first then decreases and repeats three times with the marked ① ② and ③ three similar transition processes of the response frequency could also be obviously captured in the time frequency distribution plot this is because the number of the intersect points between the tension time histories and pretension during each period has changed from 4 to 6 when p 1 and p 2 exchanges their values with each other fig 20 gives the time spatial distributions of the riser s response displacement and time histories of the main excited modal weight under above typical hf la lf sa case φ 3 π 4 from the displacement time spatial distributions similar with hf sa lf la cases mode jump phenomena and standing wave characteristics under hf la lf sa cases are also clear according to the color depth distributions there are obvious three regions concentrating response energy during each period the time histories of the main excited modal weight show that viv response of the riser is superposed by multi mode components 14th 17th modes being mainly excited and three outstanding peaks could be captured evidently with the help of the number marks 6 discussions for further investigations on the viv response characteristics and essential mechanism with bi frequency parametric excitation the predicted results under hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases will be compared directly in the same figures taking φ π 2 as an example the displacement amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint are compared in fig 21 where black solid line denotes hf sa lf la case while red dotted line denotes hf la lf sa case as mentioned in section 4 apart from ω c t 3 02 hz viv with bi frequency parametric excitation may excite the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 such extra excited frequency components are captured in fig 21 clearly as far as the energy strength at a specific frequency is concerned under hf sa lf la case the lower frequency sub harmonic components ω c t m 0 067 hz e g 2 96 hz and 3 09 hz in black caused by p 15s are stronger than those under hf la lf sa case contrarily the higher frequency sub harmonic components ω c t n 0 1 hz e g 2 92 hz and 3 12 hz in red caused by p 10s under hf la lf sa case are also stronger compared with hf sa lf la case it means the strength relation between two types of sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 and ω c t n ω v t 2 is actually consistent with the magnitude relation between δ t 1 and δ t 2 fig 22 collects the dominant modal number of the structural dynamic response under bi frequency bi amplitude cases the mode who occupies the maximum weight during the whole time interval is deemed as the dominant one the dominant modal order basically keeps at 15 to 17 the variation of dominant modal order with φ changing is more significant under hf la lf sa cases than hf sa lf la cases which means the effect of φ on the structural response is relatively stronger under the former condition in fact since the time varying tension intersects with the pretension six and four times respectively under hf la lf sa and hf sa lf la cases the tension variation under the former condition is relatively more intensive and the deviation induced by different phases tends to be amplified the maximum and average rms displacements under bi frequency bi amplitude cases are given in fig 23 under the same type of cases the response displacement fluctuates with the variation of φ compared with the two different types of cases the displacement under hf sa lf la cases is generally larger than the corresponding value under hf la lf sa cases the tension variation under hf la lf sa cases is more intensive which means this type of bi frequency parametric excitations are relatively unstable the structural dynamic response with such unstable parametric excitations also tends to present some instabilities so the time varying characteristics of viv response under hf la lf sa cases are indeed more obvious which is a detrimental to the accumulation of displacement amplitude 7 conclusions viv of the long flexible risers with time varying axial tension i e parametric excitation is a realistic research issue in the engineering applications based on a published and validated numerical model this paper tries to reveal the viv response with bi frequency excitation twenty four cases are designed and the viv response characteristics under bi frequency single amplitude cases hf sa lf la cases and hf la lf sa cases are investigated respectively several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 a single frequency bi frequency case can be deemed as a single frequency single amplitude case with the equivalent amplitude of δ t 1 2 δ t 2 2 2 δ t 1 δ t 2 cos φ the structural dynamic response under the cases with φ β and φ β should be basically identical just existing a phase lag caused by different θ with φ increasing from 0 to π the excited frequency bandwidth would become narrower the response energy at the main excited frequency would turn stronger and the displacement time histories gradually show simpler regularity 2 the viv response with bi frequency parametric excitation is quite different from that with single frequency one the structural response still has periodicity while the compliant period is not any one of the two tension harmonic components but their least common multiple the effect of φ on the dynamic response is significant which cannot be ignored but its influence laws are still not clear enough the combined action of two harmonic components would excite some secondary sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 n ω v t 2 compared with single frequency cases bi frequency parametric excitation is more propitious to excite high frequency response and enlarge the dominant modal order the rms displacement under bi frequency single amplitude cases is within the corresponding values under the two pure harmonic components 3 the excited frequency bandwidths under the designed bi frequency bi amplitude cases are generally approximate viv response changes with a certain regularity twice and three times under hf sa lf la and hf la lf sa cases the effect of φ on the structural response is also important and it is relatively stringer under hf la lf sa cases the strength relation of the response energy between the sub harmonic frequencies of ω c t m ω v t 1 and ω c t n ω v t 2 is consistent with the magnitude relation between δ t 1 and δ t 2 compared with hf sa lf la cases the time varying characteristics of the viv response under hf la lf sa cases is more obvious and the response displacement is smaller overall the effect of bi frequency parametric excitation on viv response of a tensioned riser is investigated systematically the obtained conclusions are able to make contributions to a deeper understanding of the deepwater riser s dynamic response under the actual marine environment and the predicted results could provide some references in the engineering design field in fact the wave induced heave motion of floating platform always has more than two frequency components and the actual parametric excitation on deepwater riser would be more complicated than the simulated ones in this study future work could focus on the riser s dynamic response with multi frequency at least three components even stochastic parametric excitations with the help of the relevant experimental

22469,developing an offshore wind farms the submarine cables are required as power transmission media to connect offshore wind farms and onshore substations axial forces are one of the main causes of the damage to the submarine cables which consist of spiral armor sheath insulation and conductors in addition to the axial elongation when the cable was subjected to tensile loads the helical armor

denuclearization policy in 2025 the taiwan government is actively pursuing a renewable energy policy according to the energy supply statistics of taiwan power company s power situation in 2016 thermal power generation accounts for 80 and nuclear power accounts for 13 the taiwan government proposed a denuclearization policy in 2025 and the proportion of renewable energy generation must increase gradually in the next seven years taiwan enacted regulations on renewable energy development in 2009 and hopes to launch the offshore and inland wind turbine project in 2012 to attract domestic companies to invest in offshore wind power 1 1 submarine cables submarine cables play an indispensable role in offshore wind power generation the use of offshore wind energy to generate electricity and the connection between onshore power plants and offshore substations requires operation through the transmission of submarine cables there are two types of cables power and communication the difference lies in the laying method and application from marine geological surveys to the design and manufacture of cables and the mechanical performance of laying cables submarine cable engineering projects require significant capital and complex technology statically designed submarine cables can be used in shallow water environments whereas dynamic analysis must be performed when submarine cables are deployed in deep water environments unlike static submarine cables dynamic submarine cables are connected to floating platforms and subsea production equipment and they also are suspended submarine cables need to withstand more severe marine environmental loads therefore it is very important to correctly predict the mechanical properties of the cable submarine cables must be designed to withstand all loads during manufacturing transportation installation and operation stages submarine cables are not only subject to tensile bending and torsional loads during installation or operation but also create contact friction and other effects between their structures therefore due to its complexity it is very difficult to analyze the mechanical properties of the cable structure the cable is usually simplified to a spiral wound cylindrical model as shown in fig 1 theoretical analysis methods usually involve a large number of assumptions and simplifications ignoring the interaction between adjacent layers the values obtained from each layer are superimposed to obtain the final theoretical results although it can be quickly calculated it usually does not reflect the actual condition of the cable therefore experience is needed to judge correctness early studies such as hruska 1951 1952 1953 considered only a single wire wound cylindrical model and assumed that the core was a rigid material then studied the stress axial and tangential forces of the spiral wire knapp 1975 also used this assumption and studied the tensile and torsional loads of the cable armor he used the energy method to create a balance equation and numerically solved equation a linearization equation is then given for the calculation due to the elasticity theory the compressibility of the cable core is also considered knapp 1979 described its new stiffness matrix for tensile and torsional loads and pointed out that the cable will generate torsional forces when the cable is subjected to axial tensile loads similarly when the cable is subjected to a torsional load it also generates a pulling force knapp 1981 further studied the armor layer and proposed a design method for torsional balance and stress balance mcconnell 1982 found a relationship between the torsional load and the axial elongation of a single wound cylinder velinsky 1984 considered the poisson s ratio of materials and studied complex spiral armor structures utting and jones 1987 analyzed the tensile load of the wire rope and considered the interaction between the friction between the wires and the contact according to the experimental results it is shown that the friction has little effect on the armored spiral structure witz and tan 1992 predicted the torsion model of flexible pipes cables and umbilicals and obtained the interstitial gap and compressibility and verified the rationality through experiments subsequently witz 1996 pointed out that although the spiral structure of flexible pipes cables and umbilical cords is relatively complex the analytical results of structural symmetry are in good agreement with the experimental results kumar and botsis 2001 analyzed the maximum contact stress in the armored spiral structure and verified the theoretical analysis results through experiments the previous theoretical research on the tensile and torsional load of helically wound cylindrical structures has been relatively mature in the beginning of year 2000 numerical analyses became popular and the numerical methods were mostly using finite element method sævik and ekeberg 2002 developed a finite element program to analyze the stress of a single armored wire after years of research sævik has developed uflex that can analyze cable cross section material parameters such as elasticity and plasticity can also be set in this software which can not only analyze the surface stiffness and friction effect but also analyze a load of tension torsion bending internal pressure and external pressure it has a wide range of applications in engineering based on its own finite element research knapp and shimabukuro 2007 developed a software cable cad cable cad can be applied to cross section deformation analysis caused by loads as tension bending and torsion many other researchers used commercial software such as ansys and abaqus shaw 2011 used ansys software to simulate 3d finite element analysis of umbilical cables through the comparison with theoretical and experimental results it was concluded that the theoretical analysis can t reflect the radial constraint of the core on the armor and results in a certain error however the finite element method can effectively analyze the tensile and bending mechanical properties of the cable structure and prove the correctness of the finite element method yue et al 2013 predicted the tensile properties of flexible pipelines used in the shallow sea to investigate the influence of radial stiffness of flexible pipelines on tensile stiffness they concluded that the tensile stiffness increases with the radial stiffness as the radial stiffness reaches a typical value the change in tensile stiffness drops sharply in addition the tensile stiffness of the armored layer at different angles was studied yong 2015 used finite element method to predict cable s interaction under tensile load and inner pressure the study was analyzed by abaqus and the results were compared with theoretical data their simulation results can correctly predict cables responses under coupled tensile load and inner pressure and then taking the ratio of diameter to thickness and armored laying angle as a factor the relationship between tension and torsion generated by the cable under the influence of internal pressure was obtained guo et al 2016 used analytical and numerical method to study the mechanical behavior of unbonded flexible risers under axisymmetric loads lu et al 2017 used abaqus to establish three dimensional finite element model of umbilical cables to study the tensile stiffness the numerical results were compared with experimental and theoretical analyses and the error between numerical analysis and experimental data is 6 33 in their study so that the numerical analysis method has a certain degree of credibility wu et al 2018 reported a study on the failure mechanism of flexible pipes under large torsion and considered the layer interaction zhang and zhang 2018 numerically studied the mechanical behavior of a pipe impacted by an object bai et al 2015 also studied the metallic strip pipe under tension load only most recently xu et al 2019 did a structural analysis of a cable reinforced with fiberglass also under tensile load only in the previous analyses such yue et al 2013 and lu et al 2017a 2017b and xu et al 2019 the primary loading is tensile load only however the submarine cable in deep water depth might be experienced with tensile torsional and compressive loading during the installation laying and operation of the submarine cable the mechanical behavior of submarine under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loadings should be rigorously studied in this study the submarine cables under coupled tension torsion compression loads were assumed in this paper section 1 introduces the background research motivation and objectives furthermore the development of theoretical analysis and the numerical method used are described in this section section 2 presents the theoretical analysis method of tensile and torsional stiffness and numerical methodology section 3 discusses the performance of tension and torsion of cables and the stress of armor and conductor the effect of different helix angle of steel wire and the armor layers and conductor core numbers were rigorously investigated and propose a cable design that has better mechanical properties the final section lists the conclusion found in this study 2 theoretical analysis and methodology many commercial software such as ansys nastran and abaqus have the same ability to solve the problems studied in this paper ansys is a complete package containing structural electromagnetic and flow simulations in addition ansys s preprocessor solver and post processor are available in a single package nastran is a solver with structural and vibration analysis capabilities however nastran requires front and rear processors eg patran simexpert hypermesh etc in addition the best software is software that you know how to use and you re your budget since we have purchased ansys for many years and we therefore use ansys to solve the problem this section describes the geometric model of the cable fig 2 shows a cross section of a typical submarine cable which includes 1 one or more conductors 2 insulation systems 3 protective armor layers and 4 outer sheath to reduce abrasion and protect internal cable structures 2 1 geometric model fig 3 depicts a model of a submarine cable cables are mainly divided into two categories one is a cylindrical round tube member mainly composed of a layer and a cable core and the other is a spiral member constituting an armor the spiral assembly is wrapped around the core of the cable and they contact and slide each other in order to improve calculation accuracy and efficiency the spiral member and the cable core are needed to be in close contact with each other therefore accurately predicting the position of the spiral component is a top priority for the cable design the armor layer is the protective layer of the cable and occupies the most important part of the mechanical analysis it consists of steel wire and presents a complex but regular spatial shape the correct construction of the armor layer model is related to the success or failure of the overall modeling the wire is spirally wound around the core of the cable and the surface of the wire is formed by sweeping the section along the spiral assume that the core of the cable is a cylinder of radius r and a radius of the spiral r see fig 4 when the radius r of the cylinder is known the formula shown below can be used to calculate an optimized number of wires wound around the cylinder 1 n π sin 1 r r r where n is the number of wires when the number of spiral wires is equal to right handside of eqn 1 the wire and the cylinder are tangent to each other whereas when the number of spiral steel wires is less than right handside of eqn 1 the distance between the wires is too large to be in close contact 2 2 theoretical analysis submarine cables are subjected to large tensile loads during manufacture installation and operation its ability to withstand loads at different stages of the cable design life depends on the mechanical characteristics of the cable cross section if the tensile stiffness of the submarine cable is too low it will cause excessive deformation of the structure the axial tension and torque acting on the cable are axisymmetric loads that only change the diameter and length of the cable and the deformation between the wires is relatively small due to the nature of the helical structure axial tension and torque are coupled to one another and both axial elongation and torsion angle are produced when a tensile or torque load is applied 2 2 1 hruska theoretical model the first theoretical model of helical wire on axial tension was proposed by hruska 1951 who only considered the axial tension and ignored the relationship between core and armor as shown in formula 2 the overall cable tensile stiffness is obtained by adding the tensile stiffness of the steel wire to the tensile stiffness of the core 2 k a e o n a e w cos 3 α where k is the axial tensile stiffness a e o is the axial stiffness of cable core the subscripts o and w represent core and steel wire respectively n is the number of steel wire α is the lay angle as shown in fig 5 2 3 tension cable consists of helical element and cylindrical element as depicted in fig 6 on a given axial deformation δ rotational deformation θ and radial deformation uρ knapp 1979 derive a formula to express the strain of a helix element as 3 ε δ l cos 2 α u ρ r sin 2 α r θ l sin α cos α where l is the length of cable and r is the mean radius of the helical layer the force of helical element corresponding to the strain becomes 4 f i e a ε e a cos 2 α δ l sin 2 α cos α u ρ r r sin α cos α θ r where e and a are the modulus of elasticity and cross sectional area of the helix element the axial force acted on a single helical element becomes 5 f a x i a l i f i cos α e a cos 3 α δ l sin 2 α cos 2 α u ρ r r sin α cos 2 α θ r the resultant axial force for all n helical elements is 6 f a x i a l i 1 n f a x a i l i n e a i cos 3 α δ i l sin 2 α cos 2 α u ρ i r i r i sin α cos 2 α θ i r i or expressed in a simplified form as 7 f a x i a l k 1 δ l k 2 θ l then the axial stiffness is obtained assuming no torsion coupling 8 k 1 n e a cos 3 α ν sin 2 α cos α where v u ρ r δ l is the poisson s ratio defined by the relation between axial and radial strain k 2 is the coupling parameter given by 9 k 2 i 1 n e i a i r i cos 2 α sin α equation 7 clearly indicates that the resultant axial force is produced by axial deformation and rotation since k 2 is positive a positive θ clockwise rotation will increase the axial force 2 3 1 torsion excessive torsion may occur during cable installation the torque is balanced by the internal moment caused by the axial tension of the helical element it can be calculated by multiplying the force f i by the distance between the spiral element and the cable centerline and can be expressed as 10 t i r i f i sin α the total resultant torque of the n helical elements will be 11 t i 1 n t i n e a i r i sin α cos 2 α δ i l sin 3 α cos α u ρ i r i r 2 i sin 2 α cos α θ i l or expressed in a simplified form as 12 t k 3 δ l k 4 θ l k 4 is the torsional stiffness and can be expressed as 13 k 4 n e a r 2 sin 2 α cos α the parameter k 3 is the coupling parameter and can be expresses as 14 k 3 n e i a i r i cos 2 α ν sin 3 α cos α 2 4 numerical static structural analysis numerical static structural analysis was performed using ansys software in the static structural analysis of the submarine cable the continuous deformation homogenous and isotropic of materials the elastic and small deformation were assumed 2 4 1 contact setting in ansys in order to properly describe the contact of the different components of the cable it is necessary to define the contact surface and the target surface during the simulation the surface of the contact portion is defined as the contact surface and the other surface opposite surface is defined as the target surface the contact surface cannot penetrate the target surface there are two types of contact behavior 1 symmetry the contact surface and the target surface on both sides 2 asymmetry one side is the contact surface and the other side is the target surface ansys workbench offers six contact types and contact behaviors that are bonded without separation frictionless rough friction and forced friction sliding the no separation contact type was chosen in this study in actual physical phenomena no separation occurs between contact surfaces therefore the mutual relationship between the two surfaces must be established to prevent penetration in the analysis this is called forced contact compatibility as shown in fig 7 there are several contact formula to establish forced contact compatibility in ansys workbench such as pure penalty normal lagrange formulations augmented lagrange formulations mpc formulation etc normal contact stiffness is the most important parameter affecting the precision and convergence better precision is given by a large value of normal stiffness but the problem may become more difficult to be solved in this study we chose pure penalty formulation to evaluate the contact stiffness and a brief description of the formulation is given as following 2 4 1 1 pure penalty using a contact spring to establish a relationship between two contact surfaces and the spring parameter is called penalty parameter or contact stiffness equation 15 is the penalty based contact formulation 15 f n o r m a l k n o r m a l x p e n e t r a t i o n where f n o r m a l is the contact force and k n o r m a l is the contact stiffness for an infinite contact stiffness k n o r m a l the penetration will not occur the contact convergence was obtained followed the guide given in ansys in brief during the equilibrium iteration ansys makes a guess displacement change and the residual out of balance force is calculated and it was compared to convergence criterion must small than 0 1 of applied load at the next iteration the displacement change is adjusted and the residual is re calculated and the iterations continues until the convergence is achieved 2 4 2 finite element analysis of submarine cable submarine cables are important equipment for transmitting power and signals to marine equipment due to the complex environment operating in the ocean the functional units of submarine cables must be reinforced to increase their mechanical properties to meet demand in order to reduce the difficulty of modeling the mechanical characteristics of the submarine cable are simplified while ensuring the true structure of the submarine cable fig 8 shows a simplified cross section of a submarine cable it consists mainly of a three core conductor an inner filling material an armor an inner sheath and an outer sheath the dimensions and material properties of the various components are shown in tables 1 and 2 the cable is mainly composed of copper steel aluminum polymer etc the gap of the cable core is filled with polymer and the inner and outer sheaths are extruded through hdpe and the insulator is extruded through xlpe to coat the conductor as mentioned earlier we used ansys software to perform three dimensional finite element analysis on submarine cables and established a single layer armored cable structure model the deformation response of the cable under tensile and torsional loads was studied and various lay angles of the cable were simulated to find the best geometric design 2 4 3 modeling in ansys this subsection describes the contact settings between cable adjacent layers meshing boundary conditions and the applied loads used in modeling cable in ansys 2 4 3 1 modeling and meshing according to the geometric parameters and material properties of the submarine cable the three dimensional finite element analysis model of the submarine cable is shown in fig 9 the cable used in the model has a length of 0 941 m and a lay angle of 10 the inner and outer sheaths are made of quadrilateral mesh which is more suitable for the division of the circular tube structure while the triangular mesh is used for other parts 2 4 3 2 contact setting a submarine cable is a multi layer material structure with many interactions between layers in the ansys workbench the contact between the cable layers is set to no separation for surface contact adjacent layers can slide horizontally but not vertically in the contact formulation the pure penalty method is used which is the most common method of analyzing contact problems for the selection of the normal stiffness of the contact problem the general contact is set to 1 and if the bend is dominant the contact is set between 0 1 and 0 01 2 4 3 3 boundary and loading the both ends of the section are connected with rigid planes so that they have the same constraints the degrees of freedom of all the nodes of the end face are coupled to each other the boundary conditions were imposed on that rigid plane one end of the cable is fully constrained and the other end is free end on which the loading is applied the load was applied to the center point of the rigid plane and transmitted to the entire surface 2 4 4 modeling assumption in earlier reports the submarine cable model required some assumptions to indicate better mechanical performance before numerical analysis and they are 1 the same tensile and torsional forces are required on the section of the cable 2 adjacent layers can slide with each other and ignore the effects of friction 3 all materials are isotropic 4 the occurrence of mechanical behavior within the linear elastic range 5 in initial condition there is no gap between layers the major contribution to tensile stiffness are attributed to elliptic wires and the geometry of the cable will be repeated the same depending on the helix angle of the wire we simulated three cases with three different cable lengths 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m and the calculated tensile and torsional stiffness are about the same as shown in the table 3 and the cable length is therefore set to 1 m in our later simulation 2 4 5 model verification the size of the grid is highly correlated with the computational time and accuracy of the simulation results two different mesh sizes are assumed and they are shown in fig 10 the simulated tensile stiffnesses based on the coarse mesh and the fine mesh size are 2 7 108 and 2 71 108 respectively and the corresponding torsional stiffnesses are 2 72 104 and 2 74 104 respectively therefore the coarse mesh size can be used in the study in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed finite element model the simulation results are compared with the theoretical solutions fig 11 shows the relationship between axial force and axial strain and the relationship between torque and angular rotation the tensile and torsional stiffness of the cable can be obtained by calculating the slope of the line shown in the figure the calculated tensile stiffness is 2 70 10 8 n m and the torsional stiffness is 2 66 10 4 n m the corresponding theoretical results are 2 58 108 and 2 35 104 respectively and the simulation results are 4 4 and 15 7 respectively larger than the theoretical solution the difference in tensile stiffness is small whereas the difference of the torsional stiffness is quite large in the theoretical analysis the helix angle is assumed fixed and does not change when the load is applied while in the numerical analysis the angle of the helix is allowed to vary the helix angle of the wire does change under load and the numerical solution is more accurate 3 results and discussion as recently reported articles discussed the mechanical behavior of the submarine cables all of them only considered the static loading e g tension load only such as yue et al 2013 shaw 2011 bai et al 2015 lu et al 2017a and xu 2019 etc or torsion load wu et al 2018 and bending load lu et al 2015 2017b the wave loading is a truly dynamic load but its effects is decreasing once the water depth is increasing and is nearly negligible even under storm wave conditions when the water depth is larger than 100 m the dynamic loading is definitely needed to be considered when the fatigue of submarine cable is considered in this study the fatigue is not considered and we therefore also consider the hydrodynamic loading as a static loading which is based on the possible weight 100 kn of the 1 km cable in water the maximum loading of 3000 kn was used in this study and it is about one order larger than that 400 kn used in the reported article eg sævik and gjøsteen 2012 the range of the compressive load is based on the possible water depth the submarine cable may reach the cable model described in the previous section is then used to analyze the mechanical response of the cable under tension torque and compressive pressures 3 1 translations in each layer of submarine cable the deformation of the cable under tension and torsion were firstly studied the mechanical response of the cable is presented in two different ways as shown in fig 12 one is along the longitudinal axis of the cable and the other is along the spiral wire the numbers 1 and 2 represent the free end and the fixed end respectively 3 1 1 displacement under tensile load the submarine cable is subjected to a large tensile load during cable installation in practical engineering practice only the outer jacket and steel armor are configured to resist tensile forces therefore in the finite element analysis only the outer sheath and the steel armor are provided to resist the tensile force when a tensile load is applied fig 13 shows the displacement distribution of the cable obtained in the present finite element analysis the maximum displacement occurs at the free end and the axial displacement increases linearly along the cable axis as the displacement profile shown in fig 13 a the tensile force is mainly applied to the outer sheath and the armor and the axial displacement of the outer sheath and the armor is substantially the same fig 13 b due to the influence of armor the inner sheath is also deformed but the corresponding displacement is much smaller than the displacement of the outer sheath and the armored wire in general the displacement between the cable layers is transferred from the outside to the inside the outer sheath and armor have the largest displacement and the displacement of the conductors is minimal because they are the innermost layer 3 1 2 displacement under torsional moment adjacent structures will slide when the cable is under torsional loading same as the tensile load applied the torque is also primarily applied to the outer jacket and the armor and the largest angular displacement was occurred on the outer sheath and armor fig 14 depicts the angular displacement produced when the cable is under torsional loading the outer sheath does not have a spiral structure like the armor layer so the torsion resistance of the outer sheath is inferior to that of the spiral armor wire the mechanical properties of the cable cross section are not isotropic and the cable is not a prismatic rod so the angular displacement does not increase along the cable axis especially for the outer sheath armor and inner sheath note that due to the influence of adjacent layers the torsional load also produces angular displacement of the inner sheath insulator and conductor however their values are much smaller than the values of the outer sheath and armor layers depending on the mechanics of the round bar under torque the angular rotation in the radial direction decreases linearly from the maximum of the outer surface to zero at the core of the cross section fig 15 shows the angular rotation from a particular radial direction of the cross section of the free end 0 2 m and the angular rotation is substantially linearly reduced 3 2 stress analysis of submarine cable the safety of the structure is assured if stress developed in the structure is less than the allowable stress of the materials of the structure accurately predicting stress developed in the cable under tensile and torsion loads is very important this section discusses the equivalent stress in each layer of the cable and determine the dangerous layers of the cable 3 2 1 the equivalent stress the distortion energy is also called shear strain energy the work done by the load will translate into elastic potential energy stored in the elastic body the unit body under the external force generally changes in shape and volume correspondingly strain energy is divided into shape change energy and volume change energy the dominant effect on the strength of materials is the shape change energy therefore the change in shape per unit volume can be called distortion energy density and it can be calculated by 16 u d 1 v 3 e σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 σ 3 σ 3 σ 1 where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are maximum median and minimum principal stress in the tensile load condition σ1 is much larger than the other two principal stress components if the axial stress intensity reaches s y p failure occurs and the distortion energy can be simply expressed as 17 u d y p 1 v 3 e s y p 2 if the failure is not caused by excessive shear strain energy distortion energy the following conditions must be satisfied 18 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 σ 3 σ 3 σ 1 s y p 2 then the equivalent stress also called as von mises stress can be obtained as 19 σ e q u i v a l e n t σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 3 2 2 eqn 18 is used to determine the yielding of material and the most dangerous area can be determined when the corresponding equivalent stress is larger than the yielding stress of material and the material will fatigue or break 3 2 2 the equivalent stress of cable cross section in order to study the stress distribution of the cable under the load the tensile force and the torsional moment are applied at the free end of the cable fig 16 a b show the stress distribution of the cross section of the cable under tension and torsion loads respectively as can be seen from the color bar in the figures the armor of the cable is the primary part withstands the axial force and torsional moment since armor is the main part of the load resistance the stress distribution of the steel wire under tensile and torsional loads is further studied fig 17 shows the stress distribution for a particular steel wire armor and the stress of steel wire is expressed along helix wire at both ends of the cable the stress variation is significant due to the end effect while the stress variation in the central portion is almost constant the stress generated at the fixed end is slightly less than the stress at the free end because the strain near the fixed end is inherited less than the strain near the free end fig 18 shows the stress of the steel wire under torsional loading the trend is different from the trend of the steel wire under tensile load torque does not fundamentally transfer across the entire cable cross section since the angular strain is limited at the fixed end the stress at the fixed end of the cable is significantly less than the stress at the free end the stress distribution of the steel wire gradually decreases from the free end to the fixed end although the stresses along different wires have approximately the same order their magnitudes are completely different since the lay angle changes of different wires are not the same when the cable is under torsion the stress developed at different wires are about the same when the cable is under tensile load but they are quite different when the cable is under torsional moment the tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness evaluated by the theoretical formula is summing the contribution of each wire and the contribution is assumed to be the same for each wire the tensile stiffness of theoretical formula is therefore about the same as that of the present numerical analysis whereas the torsional stiffness predicted by theoretical formula is notably different from that obtained in our numerical analysis 3 2 3 stress distribution of conductor the conductor is the core of the cable and its function is to transfer electrical energy in this study the conductor was simplified to a circular cross section fig 19 a shows the finite element model and stress distribution profile of the conductor under tension the pattern of the stress distribution of the conductor is similar to the pattern of the armor wire except at the free end at the free end the tensile load is applied only to the outer sheath and armor and the conductor is substantially unloaded while the conductor is attached to the fixed end and it shares the contribution of the reaction force at the fixed end in other words the conductor is not affected by the pulling force of the free end so there is no stress fluctuation at the free end the stress in the conductor is much less than the stress of the armored wire one order of magnitude smaller fig 19 b shows the finite element analysis and stress distribution of the conductor under torsion the stress gradually increases to a maximum value and becomes invariant after 0 125 m near the free end since the torsional load applied at the free end is substantially on the armor wires but the conductor is substantially unloaded and the torsional load is gradually transmitted from the outer layer to the conductor the stress of the conductor is therefore gradually developed 3 3 armor design this section discusses the armor design that the simulated results of the armor wires with different helix angles and those of the single and double armor are reported the effects of simultaneous tensile and torsional loads were analyzed the effects of external compressive radial pressure on tensile and torsional stiffness are also described in addition the radial deformation and contact stress of the core are reported 3 3 1 the effect of helix angle in armored cables the helix angle of the wire plays an important role in cable design according to the results of the theoretical analysis the influence of different helix angles on cable stiffness is a considerable factor but the helix angle of submarine cables is usually small in this section we will use numerical simulation to analyze the stiffness and conductor protection of submarine cables with armors at different helix angles in order to study the influence of the wire helix angle on the tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness of the cable three spiral angle models 10 15 and 20 of the same wire size were given in the numerical analyses thereafter the tensile and torsional stiffness were evaluated by the ratio of tensile and torsional forces to tensile displacement and torsional displacement respectively the changes in tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness at different helix angles were calculated fig 20 shows the comparison of the numerical results of tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness with theoretical results when the cable is under tensile load the difference in tensile stiffness obtained by numerical and theoretical analysis increases as the helix angle of the cable increases the theoretical prediction has good precision when the helix angle is small although an axial load is applied to the wire torque is also generated and the resulting torsional displacement will reduce the helix angle and the reduction is larger as the helix angle is larger the helix angle of the wire is assumed unchanged in the theoretical analysis and the theoretical results therefore have larger errors as the wires have larger helix angle on the contrary the difference of the torsional stiffness obtained by numerical and theoretical analyses decreases as helix angle increases when the cable is under torsional loads and the theoretical formula may give accurate results when the helix angle of the wire is large because the torsional resistance increases as does the helix angle of the wires the torsional moment induced helix variation decreases as the helix angle of the wire increases in short the larger the helix angle of the wire the greater the torsional stiffness but the smaller the tension stiffness axial loads not only cause tension but also torque on the armor wire the torsional load also simultaneously produces torque and tension on the wires fig 21 a depicts the coupling relationship of tensile torsional loads on the armored wires with three helix angles it can be seen from the figure that under the same axial force the larger the helix angle the larger the tensional load induced torque the rate of increase in torque caused by the axial force increases as does the helix angle that is to say armor with a large helix angle has a greater tendency to increase torque as the axial force increases when the helix angle is small the cable has a better tensile stiffness at the same time it eliminates torque and shows better torsional tolerances fig 21 b shows the axial force caused by the torsional load torque armor with a large helix angle is physically having more torsional resistance as shown in fig 21 b better torsional resistance effectively reduces the axial force caused by the torsional load however the axial force generated by the torsional load is very small and it has little effect on the stiffness of the cable in summary fig 22 further expresses the tension and torsion stiffness versus various helix angles and the tensile stiffness decreases as the helix angle increases whereas the torsional stiffness increases as does the helix angle 3 4 mechanical behavior of cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads 3 4 1 coupled tensile and torsional loads in this section both tensile and torsional loads are simultaneously applied and the coupling effects of axial and torsional forces on the cable are investigated clockwise and counterclockwise torsion were applied to study the effect of torque direction on the mechanical properties of the cable fig 23 shows the torsional moments developed on the wire under various torsional and tensile loads for a fixed torsional load the torsional moment increases as does the tensile loads fig 24 depicts the axial forces affected by clockwise and counterclockwise torsion as can be seen from the figure axial force increases as does the torsional loads when counterclockwise torque is applied conversely when a clockwise torque is applied the axial force decreases as the torsional load angular displacement increases the reason may be expressed according to eqn 7 that the axial force will increase if the armoring spiral direction is the same as the torsional load and on the contrary when the twisting direction is opposite to the spiral direction the axial force and the cable stiffness will decrease tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly affected by torsional and tensile loads and coupled tensile and torsional loads therefore should be considered in the analysis and design of the submarine cables 3 4 2 coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads because submarine cables are also deployed at the deeper water depths cables may experience high water pressures we then simulated the cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads which were rarely analyzed and studied in the literature fig 25 shows the relationship between tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness and various compressive loads and as the compressive load increases both tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly reduced fig 25 also shows the effect of torsion and tension on the stiffness of the cable as described in the previous section the tensile load significantly reduces the torsional stiffness similar behavior was found and the torsional load also significantly reduced the tensile stiffness in addition when the compression pressure reached 40 mpa the tensile rigidity and the torsional rigidity were reduced by 15 and 25 respectively while the coupled torsional and tensile effects may further reduce the tensile stiffness by 15 that is the tensile stiffness may overall reduced by 30 when the coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads were applied as a result the coupling effects of tensile torsional and compressive loads on submarine cable design cannot be ignored and must be carefully considered in the analysis and design of submarines in deep water environments 4 conclusions the extensive numerical simulations have been made to rigorously investigate the mechanical behavior of the cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads the numerical results were compared with those of the theoretical model following concluding remarks may be given 1 as the axial force increases armor with a large helix angle has a greater tendency to increase torque when the helix angle is small the cable has a better tensile stiffness at the same time it also eliminates torque and shows better torsional tolerances and armor with a large helix angle provides better torsion resistance 2 the axial force generated by the torsion is relatively small and the axial force caused by the torsional load has little effect on the cable 3 since the torsional resistance increases as the helix angle of the wire increases the spiral change caused by the torque decreases as the helix angle of the wire increases the larger the helix angle of the wire the greater the torsional stiffness but the smaller the tension stiffness 4 if the armored spiral direction is the same as that of the torsional loads the axial force will increase whereas the axial force as well as the tensile stiffness of the cable decreases when the torsional rotation direction is opposite to the spiral direction the tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly affected by the torsional and tensile loads therefore the tension and torsion loads should be simultaneously considered in the analysis of submarine cable 5 the tensile load significantly reduces the torsional stiffness similar behavior was found and the torsional load also significantly reduced the tensile stiffness in addition when the compression pressure reached 40 mpa the tensile rigidity and the torsional rigidity were reduced by 15 and 25 while the coupled torsion and tensile effects may further reduce the tensile and torsional stiffness by 15 that is the coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads may generally reduce the tensile stiffness with an amount of 30 in the analysis and design of submarine cables the coupling effects of tension torsion and compression loads on submarine cable design must be carefully considered acknowledgement the study is partially support by a grant from t 4 university union of taiwan 
22469,developing an offshore wind farms the submarine cables are required as power transmission media to connect offshore wind farms and onshore substations axial forces are one of the main causes of the damage to the submarine cables which consist of spiral armor sheath insulation and conductors in addition to the axial elongation when the cable was subjected to tensile loads the helical armor also produces torque and the coupled tensile and torsional mechanical properties of the submarine cable should be analyzed in a deep water environment the effect of water pressure on cable stiffness is important and seldom investigation was made in the past this paper studied in detail the mechanical behavior of submarine cables under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads when the cable is located 4000 m below sea level the coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads may reduce the tensile stiffness as a whole to 30 the coupling effects of tensile torsional and compressive loads therefore must be carefully considered in analysis and design of the submarine cables keywords submarine cable coupled tension and torsion tensile and torsional stiffness compressive load 1 introduction in response to global climate change and reducing carbon dioxide emissions the world has entered a stage of energy transformation and the proportion of using renewable energy has gradually increased advanced countries such as europe and the united states have successively proposed renewable energy policies with the increasing awareness of environmental protection and increasing environmental pollution the development of renewable energy has developed rapidly around the world including taiwan to fill the gap in energy shortage caused by the government s denuclearization policy in 2025 the taiwan government is actively pursuing a renewable energy policy according to the energy supply statistics of taiwan power company s power situation in 2016 thermal power generation accounts for 80 and nuclear power accounts for 13 the taiwan government proposed a denuclearization policy in 2025 and the proportion of renewable energy generation must increase gradually in the next seven years taiwan enacted regulations on renewable energy development in 2009 and hopes to launch the offshore and inland wind turbine project in 2012 to attract domestic companies to invest in offshore wind power 1 1 submarine cables submarine cables play an indispensable role in offshore wind power generation the use of offshore wind energy to generate electricity and the connection between onshore power plants and offshore substations requires operation through the transmission of submarine cables there are two types of cables power and communication the difference lies in the laying method and application from marine geological surveys to the design and manufacture of cables and the mechanical performance of laying cables submarine cable engineering projects require significant capital and complex technology statically designed submarine cables can be used in shallow water environments whereas dynamic analysis must be performed when submarine cables are deployed in deep water environments unlike static submarine cables dynamic submarine cables are connected to floating platforms and subsea production equipment and they also are suspended submarine cables need to withstand more severe marine environmental loads therefore it is very important to correctly predict the mechanical properties of the cable submarine cables must be designed to withstand all loads during manufacturing transportation installation and operation stages submarine cables are not only subject to tensile bending and torsional loads during installation or operation but also create contact friction and other effects between their structures therefore due to its complexity it is very difficult to analyze the mechanical properties of the cable structure the cable is usually simplified to a spiral wound cylindrical model as shown in fig 1 theoretical analysis methods usually involve a large number of assumptions and simplifications ignoring the interaction between adjacent layers the values obtained from each layer are superimposed to obtain the final theoretical results although it can be quickly calculated it usually does not reflect the actual condition of the cable therefore experience is needed to judge correctness early studies such as hruska 1951 1952 1953 considered only a single wire wound cylindrical model and assumed that the core was a rigid material then studied the stress axial and tangential forces of the spiral wire knapp 1975 also used this assumption and studied the tensile and torsional loads of the cable armor he used the energy method to create a balance equation and numerically solved equation a linearization equation is then given for the calculation due to the elasticity theory the compressibility of the cable core is also considered knapp 1979 described its new stiffness matrix for tensile and torsional loads and pointed out that the cable will generate torsional forces when the cable is subjected to axial tensile loads similarly when the cable is subjected to a torsional load it also generates a pulling force knapp 1981 further studied the armor layer and proposed a design method for torsional balance and stress balance mcconnell 1982 found a relationship between the torsional load and the axial elongation of a single wound cylinder velinsky 1984 considered the poisson s ratio of materials and studied complex spiral armor structures utting and jones 1987 analyzed the tensile load of the wire rope and considered the interaction between the friction between the wires and the contact according to the experimental results it is shown that the friction has little effect on the armored spiral structure witz and tan 1992 predicted the torsion model of flexible pipes cables and umbilicals and obtained the interstitial gap and compressibility and verified the rationality through experiments subsequently witz 1996 pointed out that although the spiral structure of flexible pipes cables and umbilical cords is relatively complex the analytical results of structural symmetry are in good agreement with the experimental results kumar and botsis 2001 analyzed the maximum contact stress in the armored spiral structure and verified the theoretical analysis results through experiments the previous theoretical research on the tensile and torsional load of helically wound cylindrical structures has been relatively mature in the beginning of year 2000 numerical analyses became popular and the numerical methods were mostly using finite element method sævik and ekeberg 2002 developed a finite element program to analyze the stress of a single armored wire after years of research sævik has developed uflex that can analyze cable cross section material parameters such as elasticity and plasticity can also be set in this software which can not only analyze the surface stiffness and friction effect but also analyze a load of tension torsion bending internal pressure and external pressure it has a wide range of applications in engineering based on its own finite element research knapp and shimabukuro 2007 developed a software cable cad cable cad can be applied to cross section deformation analysis caused by loads as tension bending and torsion many other researchers used commercial software such as ansys and abaqus shaw 2011 used ansys software to simulate 3d finite element analysis of umbilical cables through the comparison with theoretical and experimental results it was concluded that the theoretical analysis can t reflect the radial constraint of the core on the armor and results in a certain error however the finite element method can effectively analyze the tensile and bending mechanical properties of the cable structure and prove the correctness of the finite element method yue et al 2013 predicted the tensile properties of flexible pipelines used in the shallow sea to investigate the influence of radial stiffness of flexible pipelines on tensile stiffness they concluded that the tensile stiffness increases with the radial stiffness as the radial stiffness reaches a typical value the change in tensile stiffness drops sharply in addition the tensile stiffness of the armored layer at different angles was studied yong 2015 used finite element method to predict cable s interaction under tensile load and inner pressure the study was analyzed by abaqus and the results were compared with theoretical data their simulation results can correctly predict cables responses under coupled tensile load and inner pressure and then taking the ratio of diameter to thickness and armored laying angle as a factor the relationship between tension and torsion generated by the cable under the influence of internal pressure was obtained guo et al 2016 used analytical and numerical method to study the mechanical behavior of unbonded flexible risers under axisymmetric loads lu et al 2017 used abaqus to establish three dimensional finite element model of umbilical cables to study the tensile stiffness the numerical results were compared with experimental and theoretical analyses and the error between numerical analysis and experimental data is 6 33 in their study so that the numerical analysis method has a certain degree of credibility wu et al 2018 reported a study on the failure mechanism of flexible pipes under large torsion and considered the layer interaction zhang and zhang 2018 numerically studied the mechanical behavior of a pipe impacted by an object bai et al 2015 also studied the metallic strip pipe under tension load only most recently xu et al 2019 did a structural analysis of a cable reinforced with fiberglass also under tensile load only in the previous analyses such yue et al 2013 and lu et al 2017a 2017b and xu et al 2019 the primary loading is tensile load only however the submarine cable in deep water depth might be experienced with tensile torsional and compressive loading during the installation laying and operation of the submarine cable the mechanical behavior of submarine under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loadings should be rigorously studied in this study the submarine cables under coupled tension torsion compression loads were assumed in this paper section 1 introduces the background research motivation and objectives furthermore the development of theoretical analysis and the numerical method used are described in this section section 2 presents the theoretical analysis method of tensile and torsional stiffness and numerical methodology section 3 discusses the performance of tension and torsion of cables and the stress of armor and conductor the effect of different helix angle of steel wire and the armor layers and conductor core numbers were rigorously investigated and propose a cable design that has better mechanical properties the final section lists the conclusion found in this study 2 theoretical analysis and methodology many commercial software such as ansys nastran and abaqus have the same ability to solve the problems studied in this paper ansys is a complete package containing structural electromagnetic and flow simulations in addition ansys s preprocessor solver and post processor are available in a single package nastran is a solver with structural and vibration analysis capabilities however nastran requires front and rear processors eg patran simexpert hypermesh etc in addition the best software is software that you know how to use and you re your budget since we have purchased ansys for many years and we therefore use ansys to solve the problem this section describes the geometric model of the cable fig 2 shows a cross section of a typical submarine cable which includes 1 one or more conductors 2 insulation systems 3 protective armor layers and 4 outer sheath to reduce abrasion and protect internal cable structures 2 1 geometric model fig 3 depicts a model of a submarine cable cables are mainly divided into two categories one is a cylindrical round tube member mainly composed of a layer and a cable core and the other is a spiral member constituting an armor the spiral assembly is wrapped around the core of the cable and they contact and slide each other in order to improve calculation accuracy and efficiency the spiral member and the cable core are needed to be in close contact with each other therefore accurately predicting the position of the spiral component is a top priority for the cable design the armor layer is the protective layer of the cable and occupies the most important part of the mechanical analysis it consists of steel wire and presents a complex but regular spatial shape the correct construction of the armor layer model is related to the success or failure of the overall modeling the wire is spirally wound around the core of the cable and the surface of the wire is formed by sweeping the section along the spiral assume that the core of the cable is a cylinder of radius r and a radius of the spiral r see fig 4 when the radius r of the cylinder is known the formula shown below can be used to calculate an optimized number of wires wound around the cylinder 1 n π sin 1 r r r where n is the number of wires when the number of spiral wires is equal to right handside of eqn 1 the wire and the cylinder are tangent to each other whereas when the number of spiral steel wires is less than right handside of eqn 1 the distance between the wires is too large to be in close contact 2 2 theoretical analysis submarine cables are subjected to large tensile loads during manufacture installation and operation its ability to withstand loads at different stages of the cable design life depends on the mechanical characteristics of the cable cross section if the tensile stiffness of the submarine cable is too low it will cause excessive deformation of the structure the axial tension and torque acting on the cable are axisymmetric loads that only change the diameter and length of the cable and the deformation between the wires is relatively small due to the nature of the helical structure axial tension and torque are coupled to one another and both axial elongation and torsion angle are produced when a tensile or torque load is applied 2 2 1 hruska theoretical model the first theoretical model of helical wire on axial tension was proposed by hruska 1951 who only considered the axial tension and ignored the relationship between core and armor as shown in formula 2 the overall cable tensile stiffness is obtained by adding the tensile stiffness of the steel wire to the tensile stiffness of the core 2 k a e o n a e w cos 3 α where k is the axial tensile stiffness a e o is the axial stiffness of cable core the subscripts o and w represent core and steel wire respectively n is the number of steel wire α is the lay angle as shown in fig 5 2 3 tension cable consists of helical element and cylindrical element as depicted in fig 6 on a given axial deformation δ rotational deformation θ and radial deformation uρ knapp 1979 derive a formula to express the strain of a helix element as 3 ε δ l cos 2 α u ρ r sin 2 α r θ l sin α cos α where l is the length of cable and r is the mean radius of the helical layer the force of helical element corresponding to the strain becomes 4 f i e a ε e a cos 2 α δ l sin 2 α cos α u ρ r r sin α cos α θ r where e and a are the modulus of elasticity and cross sectional area of the helix element the axial force acted on a single helical element becomes 5 f a x i a l i f i cos α e a cos 3 α δ l sin 2 α cos 2 α u ρ r r sin α cos 2 α θ r the resultant axial force for all n helical elements is 6 f a x i a l i 1 n f a x a i l i n e a i cos 3 α δ i l sin 2 α cos 2 α u ρ i r i r i sin α cos 2 α θ i r i or expressed in a simplified form as 7 f a x i a l k 1 δ l k 2 θ l then the axial stiffness is obtained assuming no torsion coupling 8 k 1 n e a cos 3 α ν sin 2 α cos α where v u ρ r δ l is the poisson s ratio defined by the relation between axial and radial strain k 2 is the coupling parameter given by 9 k 2 i 1 n e i a i r i cos 2 α sin α equation 7 clearly indicates that the resultant axial force is produced by axial deformation and rotation since k 2 is positive a positive θ clockwise rotation will increase the axial force 2 3 1 torsion excessive torsion may occur during cable installation the torque is balanced by the internal moment caused by the axial tension of the helical element it can be calculated by multiplying the force f i by the distance between the spiral element and the cable centerline and can be expressed as 10 t i r i f i sin α the total resultant torque of the n helical elements will be 11 t i 1 n t i n e a i r i sin α cos 2 α δ i l sin 3 α cos α u ρ i r i r 2 i sin 2 α cos α θ i l or expressed in a simplified form as 12 t k 3 δ l k 4 θ l k 4 is the torsional stiffness and can be expressed as 13 k 4 n e a r 2 sin 2 α cos α the parameter k 3 is the coupling parameter and can be expresses as 14 k 3 n e i a i r i cos 2 α ν sin 3 α cos α 2 4 numerical static structural analysis numerical static structural analysis was performed using ansys software in the static structural analysis of the submarine cable the continuous deformation homogenous and isotropic of materials the elastic and small deformation were assumed 2 4 1 contact setting in ansys in order to properly describe the contact of the different components of the cable it is necessary to define the contact surface and the target surface during the simulation the surface of the contact portion is defined as the contact surface and the other surface opposite surface is defined as the target surface the contact surface cannot penetrate the target surface there are two types of contact behavior 1 symmetry the contact surface and the target surface on both sides 2 asymmetry one side is the contact surface and the other side is the target surface ansys workbench offers six contact types and contact behaviors that are bonded without separation frictionless rough friction and forced friction sliding the no separation contact type was chosen in this study in actual physical phenomena no separation occurs between contact surfaces therefore the mutual relationship between the two surfaces must be established to prevent penetration in the analysis this is called forced contact compatibility as shown in fig 7 there are several contact formula to establish forced contact compatibility in ansys workbench such as pure penalty normal lagrange formulations augmented lagrange formulations mpc formulation etc normal contact stiffness is the most important parameter affecting the precision and convergence better precision is given by a large value of normal stiffness but the problem may become more difficult to be solved in this study we chose pure penalty formulation to evaluate the contact stiffness and a brief description of the formulation is given as following 2 4 1 1 pure penalty using a contact spring to establish a relationship between two contact surfaces and the spring parameter is called penalty parameter or contact stiffness equation 15 is the penalty based contact formulation 15 f n o r m a l k n o r m a l x p e n e t r a t i o n where f n o r m a l is the contact force and k n o r m a l is the contact stiffness for an infinite contact stiffness k n o r m a l the penetration will not occur the contact convergence was obtained followed the guide given in ansys in brief during the equilibrium iteration ansys makes a guess displacement change and the residual out of balance force is calculated and it was compared to convergence criterion must small than 0 1 of applied load at the next iteration the displacement change is adjusted and the residual is re calculated and the iterations continues until the convergence is achieved 2 4 2 finite element analysis of submarine cable submarine cables are important equipment for transmitting power and signals to marine equipment due to the complex environment operating in the ocean the functional units of submarine cables must be reinforced to increase their mechanical properties to meet demand in order to reduce the difficulty of modeling the mechanical characteristics of the submarine cable are simplified while ensuring the true structure of the submarine cable fig 8 shows a simplified cross section of a submarine cable it consists mainly of a three core conductor an inner filling material an armor an inner sheath and an outer sheath the dimensions and material properties of the various components are shown in tables 1 and 2 the cable is mainly composed of copper steel aluminum polymer etc the gap of the cable core is filled with polymer and the inner and outer sheaths are extruded through hdpe and the insulator is extruded through xlpe to coat the conductor as mentioned earlier we used ansys software to perform three dimensional finite element analysis on submarine cables and established a single layer armored cable structure model the deformation response of the cable under tensile and torsional loads was studied and various lay angles of the cable were simulated to find the best geometric design 2 4 3 modeling in ansys this subsection describes the contact settings between cable adjacent layers meshing boundary conditions and the applied loads used in modeling cable in ansys 2 4 3 1 modeling and meshing according to the geometric parameters and material properties of the submarine cable the three dimensional finite element analysis model of the submarine cable is shown in fig 9 the cable used in the model has a length of 0 941 m and a lay angle of 10 the inner and outer sheaths are made of quadrilateral mesh which is more suitable for the division of the circular tube structure while the triangular mesh is used for other parts 2 4 3 2 contact setting a submarine cable is a multi layer material structure with many interactions between layers in the ansys workbench the contact between the cable layers is set to no separation for surface contact adjacent layers can slide horizontally but not vertically in the contact formulation the pure penalty method is used which is the most common method of analyzing contact problems for the selection of the normal stiffness of the contact problem the general contact is set to 1 and if the bend is dominant the contact is set between 0 1 and 0 01 2 4 3 3 boundary and loading the both ends of the section are connected with rigid planes so that they have the same constraints the degrees of freedom of all the nodes of the end face are coupled to each other the boundary conditions were imposed on that rigid plane one end of the cable is fully constrained and the other end is free end on which the loading is applied the load was applied to the center point of the rigid plane and transmitted to the entire surface 2 4 4 modeling assumption in earlier reports the submarine cable model required some assumptions to indicate better mechanical performance before numerical analysis and they are 1 the same tensile and torsional forces are required on the section of the cable 2 adjacent layers can slide with each other and ignore the effects of friction 3 all materials are isotropic 4 the occurrence of mechanical behavior within the linear elastic range 5 in initial condition there is no gap between layers the major contribution to tensile stiffness are attributed to elliptic wires and the geometry of the cable will be repeated the same depending on the helix angle of the wire we simulated three cases with three different cable lengths 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m and the calculated tensile and torsional stiffness are about the same as shown in the table 3 and the cable length is therefore set to 1 m in our later simulation 2 4 5 model verification the size of the grid is highly correlated with the computational time and accuracy of the simulation results two different mesh sizes are assumed and they are shown in fig 10 the simulated tensile stiffnesses based on the coarse mesh and the fine mesh size are 2 7 108 and 2 71 108 respectively and the corresponding torsional stiffnesses are 2 72 104 and 2 74 104 respectively therefore the coarse mesh size can be used in the study in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed finite element model the simulation results are compared with the theoretical solutions fig 11 shows the relationship between axial force and axial strain and the relationship between torque and angular rotation the tensile and torsional stiffness of the cable can be obtained by calculating the slope of the line shown in the figure the calculated tensile stiffness is 2 70 10 8 n m and the torsional stiffness is 2 66 10 4 n m the corresponding theoretical results are 2 58 108 and 2 35 104 respectively and the simulation results are 4 4 and 15 7 respectively larger than the theoretical solution the difference in tensile stiffness is small whereas the difference of the torsional stiffness is quite large in the theoretical analysis the helix angle is assumed fixed and does not change when the load is applied while in the numerical analysis the angle of the helix is allowed to vary the helix angle of the wire does change under load and the numerical solution is more accurate 3 results and discussion as recently reported articles discussed the mechanical behavior of the submarine cables all of them only considered the static loading e g tension load only such as yue et al 2013 shaw 2011 bai et al 2015 lu et al 2017a and xu 2019 etc or torsion load wu et al 2018 and bending load lu et al 2015 2017b the wave loading is a truly dynamic load but its effects is decreasing once the water depth is increasing and is nearly negligible even under storm wave conditions when the water depth is larger than 100 m the dynamic loading is definitely needed to be considered when the fatigue of submarine cable is considered in this study the fatigue is not considered and we therefore also consider the hydrodynamic loading as a static loading which is based on the possible weight 100 kn of the 1 km cable in water the maximum loading of 3000 kn was used in this study and it is about one order larger than that 400 kn used in the reported article eg sævik and gjøsteen 2012 the range of the compressive load is based on the possible water depth the submarine cable may reach the cable model described in the previous section is then used to analyze the mechanical response of the cable under tension torque and compressive pressures 3 1 translations in each layer of submarine cable the deformation of the cable under tension and torsion were firstly studied the mechanical response of the cable is presented in two different ways as shown in fig 12 one is along the longitudinal axis of the cable and the other is along the spiral wire the numbers 1 and 2 represent the free end and the fixed end respectively 3 1 1 displacement under tensile load the submarine cable is subjected to a large tensile load during cable installation in practical engineering practice only the outer jacket and steel armor are configured to resist tensile forces therefore in the finite element analysis only the outer sheath and the steel armor are provided to resist the tensile force when a tensile load is applied fig 13 shows the displacement distribution of the cable obtained in the present finite element analysis the maximum displacement occurs at the free end and the axial displacement increases linearly along the cable axis as the displacement profile shown in fig 13 a the tensile force is mainly applied to the outer sheath and the armor and the axial displacement of the outer sheath and the armor is substantially the same fig 13 b due to the influence of armor the inner sheath is also deformed but the corresponding displacement is much smaller than the displacement of the outer sheath and the armored wire in general the displacement between the cable layers is transferred from the outside to the inside the outer sheath and armor have the largest displacement and the displacement of the conductors is minimal because they are the innermost layer 3 1 2 displacement under torsional moment adjacent structures will slide when the cable is under torsional loading same as the tensile load applied the torque is also primarily applied to the outer jacket and the armor and the largest angular displacement was occurred on the outer sheath and armor fig 14 depicts the angular displacement produced when the cable is under torsional loading the outer sheath does not have a spiral structure like the armor layer so the torsion resistance of the outer sheath is inferior to that of the spiral armor wire the mechanical properties of the cable cross section are not isotropic and the cable is not a prismatic rod so the angular displacement does not increase along the cable axis especially for the outer sheath armor and inner sheath note that due to the influence of adjacent layers the torsional load also produces angular displacement of the inner sheath insulator and conductor however their values are much smaller than the values of the outer sheath and armor layers depending on the mechanics of the round bar under torque the angular rotation in the radial direction decreases linearly from the maximum of the outer surface to zero at the core of the cross section fig 15 shows the angular rotation from a particular radial direction of the cross section of the free end 0 2 m and the angular rotation is substantially linearly reduced 3 2 stress analysis of submarine cable the safety of the structure is assured if stress developed in the structure is less than the allowable stress of the materials of the structure accurately predicting stress developed in the cable under tensile and torsion loads is very important this section discusses the equivalent stress in each layer of the cable and determine the dangerous layers of the cable 3 2 1 the equivalent stress the distortion energy is also called shear strain energy the work done by the load will translate into elastic potential energy stored in the elastic body the unit body under the external force generally changes in shape and volume correspondingly strain energy is divided into shape change energy and volume change energy the dominant effect on the strength of materials is the shape change energy therefore the change in shape per unit volume can be called distortion energy density and it can be calculated by 16 u d 1 v 3 e σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 σ 3 σ 3 σ 1 where σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 are maximum median and minimum principal stress in the tensile load condition σ1 is much larger than the other two principal stress components if the axial stress intensity reaches s y p failure occurs and the distortion energy can be simply expressed as 17 u d y p 1 v 3 e s y p 2 if the failure is not caused by excessive shear strain energy distortion energy the following conditions must be satisfied 18 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 σ 3 σ 3 σ 1 s y p 2 then the equivalent stress also called as von mises stress can be obtained as 19 σ e q u i v a l e n t σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 1 σ 3 2 2 eqn 18 is used to determine the yielding of material and the most dangerous area can be determined when the corresponding equivalent stress is larger than the yielding stress of material and the material will fatigue or break 3 2 2 the equivalent stress of cable cross section in order to study the stress distribution of the cable under the load the tensile force and the torsional moment are applied at the free end of the cable fig 16 a b show the stress distribution of the cross section of the cable under tension and torsion loads respectively as can be seen from the color bar in the figures the armor of the cable is the primary part withstands the axial force and torsional moment since armor is the main part of the load resistance the stress distribution of the steel wire under tensile and torsional loads is further studied fig 17 shows the stress distribution for a particular steel wire armor and the stress of steel wire is expressed along helix wire at both ends of the cable the stress variation is significant due to the end effect while the stress variation in the central portion is almost constant the stress generated at the fixed end is slightly less than the stress at the free end because the strain near the fixed end is inherited less than the strain near the free end fig 18 shows the stress of the steel wire under torsional loading the trend is different from the trend of the steel wire under tensile load torque does not fundamentally transfer across the entire cable cross section since the angular strain is limited at the fixed end the stress at the fixed end of the cable is significantly less than the stress at the free end the stress distribution of the steel wire gradually decreases from the free end to the fixed end although the stresses along different wires have approximately the same order their magnitudes are completely different since the lay angle changes of different wires are not the same when the cable is under torsion the stress developed at different wires are about the same when the cable is under tensile load but they are quite different when the cable is under torsional moment the tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness evaluated by the theoretical formula is summing the contribution of each wire and the contribution is assumed to be the same for each wire the tensile stiffness of theoretical formula is therefore about the same as that of the present numerical analysis whereas the torsional stiffness predicted by theoretical formula is notably different from that obtained in our numerical analysis 3 2 3 stress distribution of conductor the conductor is the core of the cable and its function is to transfer electrical energy in this study the conductor was simplified to a circular cross section fig 19 a shows the finite element model and stress distribution profile of the conductor under tension the pattern of the stress distribution of the conductor is similar to the pattern of the armor wire except at the free end at the free end the tensile load is applied only to the outer sheath and armor and the conductor is substantially unloaded while the conductor is attached to the fixed end and it shares the contribution of the reaction force at the fixed end in other words the conductor is not affected by the pulling force of the free end so there is no stress fluctuation at the free end the stress in the conductor is much less than the stress of the armored wire one order of magnitude smaller fig 19 b shows the finite element analysis and stress distribution of the conductor under torsion the stress gradually increases to a maximum value and becomes invariant after 0 125 m near the free end since the torsional load applied at the free end is substantially on the armor wires but the conductor is substantially unloaded and the torsional load is gradually transmitted from the outer layer to the conductor the stress of the conductor is therefore gradually developed 3 3 armor design this section discusses the armor design that the simulated results of the armor wires with different helix angles and those of the single and double armor are reported the effects of simultaneous tensile and torsional loads were analyzed the effects of external compressive radial pressure on tensile and torsional stiffness are also described in addition the radial deformation and contact stress of the core are reported 3 3 1 the effect of helix angle in armored cables the helix angle of the wire plays an important role in cable design according to the results of the theoretical analysis the influence of different helix angles on cable stiffness is a considerable factor but the helix angle of submarine cables is usually small in this section we will use numerical simulation to analyze the stiffness and conductor protection of submarine cables with armors at different helix angles in order to study the influence of the wire helix angle on the tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness of the cable three spiral angle models 10 15 and 20 of the same wire size were given in the numerical analyses thereafter the tensile and torsional stiffness were evaluated by the ratio of tensile and torsional forces to tensile displacement and torsional displacement respectively the changes in tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness at different helix angles were calculated fig 20 shows the comparison of the numerical results of tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness with theoretical results when the cable is under tensile load the difference in tensile stiffness obtained by numerical and theoretical analysis increases as the helix angle of the cable increases the theoretical prediction has good precision when the helix angle is small although an axial load is applied to the wire torque is also generated and the resulting torsional displacement will reduce the helix angle and the reduction is larger as the helix angle is larger the helix angle of the wire is assumed unchanged in the theoretical analysis and the theoretical results therefore have larger errors as the wires have larger helix angle on the contrary the difference of the torsional stiffness obtained by numerical and theoretical analyses decreases as helix angle increases when the cable is under torsional loads and the theoretical formula may give accurate results when the helix angle of the wire is large because the torsional resistance increases as does the helix angle of the wires the torsional moment induced helix variation decreases as the helix angle of the wire increases in short the larger the helix angle of the wire the greater the torsional stiffness but the smaller the tension stiffness axial loads not only cause tension but also torque on the armor wire the torsional load also simultaneously produces torque and tension on the wires fig 21 a depicts the coupling relationship of tensile torsional loads on the armored wires with three helix angles it can be seen from the figure that under the same axial force the larger the helix angle the larger the tensional load induced torque the rate of increase in torque caused by the axial force increases as does the helix angle that is to say armor with a large helix angle has a greater tendency to increase torque as the axial force increases when the helix angle is small the cable has a better tensile stiffness at the same time it eliminates torque and shows better torsional tolerances fig 21 b shows the axial force caused by the torsional load torque armor with a large helix angle is physically having more torsional resistance as shown in fig 21 b better torsional resistance effectively reduces the axial force caused by the torsional load however the axial force generated by the torsional load is very small and it has little effect on the stiffness of the cable in summary fig 22 further expresses the tension and torsion stiffness versus various helix angles and the tensile stiffness decreases as the helix angle increases whereas the torsional stiffness increases as does the helix angle 3 4 mechanical behavior of cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads 3 4 1 coupled tensile and torsional loads in this section both tensile and torsional loads are simultaneously applied and the coupling effects of axial and torsional forces on the cable are investigated clockwise and counterclockwise torsion were applied to study the effect of torque direction on the mechanical properties of the cable fig 23 shows the torsional moments developed on the wire under various torsional and tensile loads for a fixed torsional load the torsional moment increases as does the tensile loads fig 24 depicts the axial forces affected by clockwise and counterclockwise torsion as can be seen from the figure axial force increases as does the torsional loads when counterclockwise torque is applied conversely when a clockwise torque is applied the axial force decreases as the torsional load angular displacement increases the reason may be expressed according to eqn 7 that the axial force will increase if the armoring spiral direction is the same as the torsional load and on the contrary when the twisting direction is opposite to the spiral direction the axial force and the cable stiffness will decrease tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly affected by torsional and tensile loads and coupled tensile and torsional loads therefore should be considered in the analysis and design of the submarine cables 3 4 2 coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads because submarine cables are also deployed at the deeper water depths cables may experience high water pressures we then simulated the cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads which were rarely analyzed and studied in the literature fig 25 shows the relationship between tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness and various compressive loads and as the compressive load increases both tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly reduced fig 25 also shows the effect of torsion and tension on the stiffness of the cable as described in the previous section the tensile load significantly reduces the torsional stiffness similar behavior was found and the torsional load also significantly reduced the tensile stiffness in addition when the compression pressure reached 40 mpa the tensile rigidity and the torsional rigidity were reduced by 15 and 25 respectively while the coupled torsional and tensile effects may further reduce the tensile stiffness by 15 that is the tensile stiffness may overall reduced by 30 when the coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads were applied as a result the coupling effects of tensile torsional and compressive loads on submarine cable design cannot be ignored and must be carefully considered in the analysis and design of submarines in deep water environments 4 conclusions the extensive numerical simulations have been made to rigorously investigate the mechanical behavior of the cable under coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads the numerical results were compared with those of the theoretical model following concluding remarks may be given 1 as the axial force increases armor with a large helix angle has a greater tendency to increase torque when the helix angle is small the cable has a better tensile stiffness at the same time it also eliminates torque and shows better torsional tolerances and armor with a large helix angle provides better torsion resistance 2 the axial force generated by the torsion is relatively small and the axial force caused by the torsional load has little effect on the cable 3 since the torsional resistance increases as the helix angle of the wire increases the spiral change caused by the torque decreases as the helix angle of the wire increases the larger the helix angle of the wire the greater the torsional stiffness but the smaller the tension stiffness 4 if the armored spiral direction is the same as that of the torsional loads the axial force will increase whereas the axial force as well as the tensile stiffness of the cable decreases when the torsional rotation direction is opposite to the spiral direction the tensile and torsional stiffness are significantly affected by the torsional and tensile loads therefore the tension and torsion loads should be simultaneously considered in the analysis of submarine cable 5 the tensile load significantly reduces the torsional stiffness similar behavior was found and the torsional load also significantly reduced the tensile stiffness in addition when the compression pressure reached 40 mpa the tensile rigidity and the torsional rigidity were reduced by 15 and 25 while the coupled torsion and tensile effects may further reduce the tensile and torsional stiffness by 15 that is the coupled tensile torsional and compressive loads may generally reduce the tensile stiffness with an amount of 30 in the analysis and design of submarine cables the coupling effects of tension torsion and compression loads on submarine cable design must be carefully considered acknowledgement the study is partially support by a grant from t 4 university union of taiwan
