9445,while many studies on zebra chip zc disease in potatoes have focused on the epidemiology of the disease and the characterization of infected potato plants this study quantifies the impact of zc disease on crop response and investigates the relationship between irrigation level and zc disease severity in this two year study chipping potatoes were planted under a variable rate irrigation center pivot sprinkler using a split plot design with a 2 3 factorial combination of zc disease level diseased and non diseased and irrigation levels of 100 80 and 60 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity designated i100 i80 and i60 crop response of tuber yield evapotranspiration etc crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp from zc diseased plots were compared with non diseased control plots tuber yield and cwp in the infested plots were significantly reduced by at least 58 in 2018 and by 21 in 2019 as compared with results in the control plots year significantly affected crop response in the control plots however crop response in the zc diseased plots was devastative to potatoes from year to year there was no interaction between irrigation level and zc disease occurrence in both years stomatal conductance measurements in zc diseased plants were reduced 35 and 44 days after infection as compared with control plants since irrigation did not lessen the severity of zc disease as soon as diseased plants are identified within a field withholding irrigation to the affected areas could improve iwp at the field level future studies should consider the use of thermal imaging or spectral reflectance of the plant canopy for spatiotemporal detection of zc disease as early as possible in the growing season keywords center pivot sprinkler plant disease irrigation water productivity stomatal conductance crop water productivity 1 introduction cultivation of potatoes solanum tuberosum l is a challenging task because potatoes are sensitive to abiotic and biotic stressors which may occur concomitantly and make it difficult to optimize production practices zc disease is a relatively newer disease that has quickly caused extensive economic losses to growers and the potato chip industry djaman et al 2020 garhwal et al 2020 the disease has been found in many production regions for potatoes in central america the u s munyaneza et al 2007a 2011 li et al 2009 and has recently been reported in regions of canada henrickson et al 2019 despite reports of the devastating effects of zc disease infested potatoes only a single study by munyaneza et al 2011 could be found that quantified losses in tuber mass most losses from zc disease are related to a reduction in potato marketability secor and rivera varas 2004 rush et al 2015 raw infected tubers exhibit vascular necrosis navarre et al 2009 when fried the discoloration becomes markedly darker munyaneza 2012 making fried products such as fries and chips commercially unacceptable the causal agent of zc disease in potatoes is the bacterium candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso transmitted by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli munyaneza et al 2007b liefting et al 2008 plants infested with the potato psyllid carrying lso can easily become infected with the pathogen producing observable symptoms within 3 4 weeks crosslin et al 2010 rashed et al 2014 the symptoms include leaf curling leaf chlorosis streaks at the medullary area in the tubers plant stunting leaf scorch collapsed stolons and early necrosis of the vascular system gudmestad and secor 2007 li et al 2009 caicedo et al 2020 workneh et al 2018 because psyllids are easily capable of infecting potato plants in a short period of time 6 h buchman et al 2011 psyllid infestation is typically managed by several insecticide applications throughout the growing season gharalari et al 2009 crosslin et al 2010 prager et al 2013 these applications are expensive do not always assure that a potato crop will be free from zc disease infection and can lead to vector resistance to commonly used insecticides szczepaniec et al 2019 another costly input to consider in potato production is water potatoes being susceptible to soil water deficit and heat stress require the right amount of water at the right time king et al 2006 yost et al 2019 if a grower s field becomes infested with psyllids often multiple plants in a single field will be affected munyaneza et al 2007b henne et al 2010 however potatoes are usually grown in large size fields the disease may go undiscovered until a significant number of plants become symptomatic approximately four weeks after initial infection continuing to irrigate zc diseased potatoes could result in significant reductions in crop water productivity however these reductions have not been quantified irrigation levels can also impact disease in potatoes some studies have shown that irrigation exacerbates disease severity in potatoes rotem and palti 1969 johnson et al 2003 reported that excessive moisture from over irrigation or precipitation negatively impacted russet burbank tuber yields by providing conducive conditions for blight and rust disease brierley et al 2015 determined that irrigation increased the severity of black dot disease on potato cultivar varieties maris piper sante and estima however as pointed out by adams and stevenson 1990 in a review of potato production and disease the interaction between irrigation and severity of many potato diseases is not straightforward for example during tuber initiation irrigation reduced the incidence of scab however wet soils also increased the incidence of brown center and powdery scab in further support of differences in interaction between irrigation and disease severity larkin et al 2011 determined that irrigation compared with rainfed production increased black scurf and common scab but it also resulted in higher yields for most potato rotations lapwood and read 1986 reported that irrigation did not affect disease symptoms of blackleg in rotem and palti 1969 it was noted that yarwood 1957 found that leaf turgidity in irrigated potato crops favored the infection of many hosts by a great variety of bacterial diseases although studies have investigated the effects of irrigation level on many foliar and soil borne diseases in potatoes it is not always clear if soil moisture has an influence on disease severity fiers et al 2012 moreover there are no studies that report the effects of irrigation level on the severity of zc disease in potatoes the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if there is an interaction between irrigation level and zc disease and 2 characterize the impact of zc disease on tuber yield etc crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp at three irrigation levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design a two year experiment was conducted at the conservation production research laboratory at bushland texas 35 11 n 102 06 w 1170 m above sea level on pullman clay loam a fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll the field capacity and wilting point of the soil were assumed to be 0 33 m3m 3 and 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively unger 1996 heng et al 2009 schwartz et al 2003 the climate at the site was characterized as semi arid with an average annual evaporative demand of 2600 mm and average annual precipitation of 460 mm tolk et al 2012 a standalone weather station was located within 10 m of the study site to record precipitation and meteorological measurements the instrumentation for the weather station is described fully in o shaughnessy et al 2019 the study was a split plot design with a 2 3 factorial combination of zc disease level diseased and non diseased and irrigation level 100 80 and 60 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity designated i100 i80 and i60 with four replicates of zc disease and 3 replicates of non diseased plots plot sizes were 12 rows wide 10 m by 30 m long the center eight rows of each designated zc diseased plot each 6 m in length received the psyllid infested treatment the center eight rows in each plot were also used for soil water measurements and harvesting samples destructive sampling of potato plants was conducted in the outer rows of the established plots 2 2 agronomic practices a mid season chipping potato crop variety fl 1867 was planted in early april in 2018 and 2019 on alternating halves each 2 38 ha of a 3 span vri center pivot field using a four row planter seed potatoes were planted 0 17 0 30 cm apart to a depth of 0 20 m in raised semi circular beds spaced 0 76 m apart the 2018 season followed maize while the 2019 season followed fallow ground prior to planting soil samples were taken on march 3 2018 and on march 6 2019 to a depth of 20 cm and analyzed by a third party company to determine fertilizer rates to meet a tuber yield goal of 39 mg ha 1 the blend of herbicides applied in 2019 was to improve weed control table 1 2 3 field management and irrigation treatments a neutron probe np access tube was placed in the center of each plot to a depth of 2 3 m soil water measurements with a np meter 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez ca were made weekly in the i100 treatment plots to determine soil water changes within the root zone in all other treatment plots soil water was measured at least every 30 days with a np soil water was measured from 0 1 m to 2 3 m depths at 0 2 m intervals precipitation occurring before the scheduled irrigation for the week was subtracted from the weekly total the np meter was field calibrated as described in evett 2008 soil water depletion was averaged separately among the i100 diseased and the i100 control plots and irrigations were based on replenishment of a percentage of soil water depletion 100 80 and 60 to field capacity in the top 1 5 m of the soil profile to zc diseased and control plots designated i100 i80 and i60 respectively evapotranspiration etc eq 1 was calculated for each plot as the sum of precipitation p mm and irrigation i mm and the difference between initial soil water readings taken soon after planting and soil water readings taken through july 23 2018 and july 17 2019 s mm these dates in july are when the majority of diseased plants were observed to have experienced necrosis water flux f mm across the lower boundary of the control volume and surface runoff r mm were assumed to be negligible as soil water readings taken with the np below the 1 5 m depth showed no evidence of deep percolation and maximum treatment irrigation depth per irrigation event was limited to 20 mm 1 et c p i f s r destructive sampling of whole potato plants was performed every two weeks after plant emergence to record the growth stage potatoes were harvested by hand in a 10 m2 area around each np access tube a plant count was performed within the 10 m2 area and 10 plants were dug using pitch forks the number of tubers per plant and the fresh weight of each tuber was recorded tuber yield per hectare mg ha 1 was extrapolated using plant count and average tuber yield per plant within the sampling area for each treatment plot this harvesting method was similar to yield method estimates used in usda nass 2006 and al gaadi et al 2016 crop water productivity was calculated as mass kg of tuber yield produced per unit of evapotranspiration mm irrigation water productivity was calculated as mass kg of tuber yield produced per depth mm of irrigation applied a comparison of measurements of stomatal conductance and soil water content in the top 900 mm of the soil profile in both the control and psyllid infested plots were made to help characterize the onset and physiological manifestations of zc disease stomatal conductance measurements were made with a handheld leaf porometer model sc 1 meter group pullman wa on june 13 june 27 july 5 july 11 2018 and on june 17 june 27 july 1 and july 12 2019 to identify the onset of limited transpiration the sensor was calibrated prior to reading each leaf readings were taken from three different leaves on a representative plant in each of the diseased and control plots between 09 00 am and 12 00 pm 2 4 psyllid infestation and zc disease detection in both years of the study diseased plants were established within twelve treatment plots by releasing bacteriliferous psyllids central haplotype co infected with lso haplotype a and b under 7 m x 6 m tents for a 10 day period the plants were infested near the first florescence stage on may 21 2018 and may 28 2019 which coincided with peak incidence of psyllids in grower fields workneh et al 2018 after ten days the released psyllids were eliminated with an insecticide cocktail abamectin agri mek syngenta greensboro nc spirotetramat movento bayer research triangle park nc and pymetrozine fullfill syngenta greensboro nc at label recommended rates for potatoes to ensure termination of all psyllid life stages twenty four hours after psyllid termination tents were removed symptomatic plant samples were collected and the presence of lso in the samples was determined using qpcr real time polymerase chain reaction as described by rashed et al 2018 the onset of zc disease was based on weekly visual observations and verified by qpcr diagnostic testing of symptomatic plant tissue a protocol from dneasy plant mini kit qiagen valencia ca was modified and used for dna extraction again lso was quantified using the qpcr protocol specified in rashed et al 2018 using a base rq relative quantification of zero for uninfected tubers vigue et al 2020 2 5 calculations and statistical analysis crop water productivity y g et c kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of economic yield y g to evapotranspiration etc and irrigation water productivity y g i kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of economic yield to cumulative irrigation i in mm applied howell 2002 year zc disease and irrigation level were considered main effects and analyzed for impacts on tuber yield etc cwp iwp and changes in soil water content δs among treatment plots using the proc mixed procedure in statistical analysis software sas version 9 4 differences between means were compared using the tukey kramer test and considered statistically significant at p 0 05 whole plots were treated as a random effect data were then separated by year to analyze the effects of zc disease and irrigation level on crop response using proc mixed in the case of heterogeneous variances the proc mixed procedure using an unequal variance covariance structure was used a two sample t test with assumed unequal variances was used to compare differences between means of stomatal conductance for zc diseased and control plots at each irrigation level 3 results 3 1 climate growth stage and irrigations in the 2018 growing season precipitation was limited from the start of planting through tuber bulking apr july and mean maximum daily ambient air temperatures were 30 c fig 1a total precipitation received from april through august was 109 mm two post plant irrigations totaling 51 mm were applied in april to facilitate plant emergence which occurred 25 days after planting dap on may 2 primary florescence occurred 57 dap june 1 tuber initiation tuber bulking and vine death were observed 61 dap june 5 77 dap june 21 and 117 dap aug 1 respectively mean cumulative seasonal irrigations for the non diseased i100 i80 and i60 treatment plots were 547 445 and 368 mm respectively for the i100 i80 and i60 diseased treatment plots mean seasonal cumulative irrigations were 476 400 and 324 mm respectively the first application of treatment irrigation was applied on may 26 in 2018 and continued through late july irrigations were not applied on any plants for the days that the tents were in place for the psyllid infestation process thirteen total treatment irrigations were applied in 2018 and irrigations were terminated on july 29 recorded observations indicated that zc disease did not appear to influence florescence in either year of the study florescence was delayed in the i60 irrigation plots for both the zc diseased and control plots by approximately 6 days wagg et al 2021 also noted delayed florescence in potatoes irrigated at deficit levels throughout the vegetative stage in 2019 within season precipitation was nearly four times greater 405 mm and mean maximum ambient air temperatures in apr and may were markedly less compared

treatment levels respectively diseased treatment plots received 280 224 and 193 mm of irrigation at the i100 i80 and i60 treatment levels respectively treatment irrigations were initiated on may 18 in 2019 again irrigations were withheld for all plants while the psyllid tents were in place so as not to interrupt the infection process fifteen treatment irrigations were applied in 2019 irrigations were terminated on july 18 for all treatment plots as most plants throughout the field were wilted black blister beetles coleoptera meloidae were also observed in the potato field in early july of 2019 and were mainly present among the plants in the outer circumference of the field nonetheless the pesticide bifenthrin was applied on july 9 to control the beetle population table 1 3 2 influence of zc disease irrigation level and their interactions on crop response and change in soil water content all subplots infested with bacteriliferous psyllids produced zc diseased potatoes while those not infested with the psyllids produced healthy potatoes analysis of data from both years showed that zc disease significantly impacted tuber yield etc cwp iwp and the change in soil water content to a depth of 900 mm δs table 2 irrigation level affected tuber yield etc and δs no interaction was found between irrigation level and zc disease indicating that irrigation level did not influence disease severity in potatoes to further demonstrate the effect of zc disease and irrigation level on potato production data were separated by year and crop response compared between zc diseased and control plots initially the presentation of results focuses on the effects of zc disease on crop response in 2018 within each irrigation treatment mean tuber yield etc cwp and iwp values were significantly less in the zc diseased plots fig 2 in 2019 mean tuber yield and etc were significantly less in the zc diseased plots however there was no significant difference in cwp between the control and zc diseased treatment plots apart from the i80 treatment iwp was significantly greater for the control plots to evaluate the effects of irrigation level on potato production the results are discussed separately for the control and zc diseased plots irrigation level significantly impacted tuber yield in 2018 and 2019 in the control plots fig 2a in these healthy plots tuber yield was significantly different between the i100 and i60 irrigation treatments in both years seasonal etc was significantly different among all irrigation levels in 2018 however in 2019 the difference was only significant between the i100 and i60 levels fig 2b irrigation level did not significantly impact cwp fig 2c or iwp fig 2d in the control plots in either year in contrast irrigation level did not have a significant impact on tuber yield fig 2a or cwp fig 2c in the zc diseased plots in either year of this study seasonal etc was significantly greater in 2018 for the i100 treatment level as compared with the i80 and i60 treatment levels in 2019 seasonal etc in the i60 treatment level was significantly less compared with the i100 and i80 treatment levels in 2018 the iwp values were similar across all irrigation levels for the zc diseased plots however in 2019 iwp for the i60 treatment was significantly greater compared with the i100 treatment plots 3 3 influence of growing season on crop response in the zc diseased plots tuber yield and cwp were numerically similar between years potatoes harvested from diseased treatment plots consistently produced smaller tuber yields in both years cumulative etc and iwp were significantly different for zc diseased plots between years seasonal etc values were numerically greater in 2019 due to the higher precipitation amounts in 2019 larger tuber yield coupled with lower cumulative irrigation amounts applied in 2019 contributed to numerically greater iwp values between the two years tuber yield in the control plots in 2019 was 22 less compared with yields in 2018 cumulative etc values were 15 greater in 2019 compared with values in 2018 again etc was greater in the latter year due to the greater amount of precipitation which contributed to at least 47 of cumulative etc values in each control plot in contrast in 2018 precipitation contributed at most 22 towards cumulative etc values crop water productivity in the control plots was 29 less in 2019 compared with the control plots in the previous year 3 4 stomatal conductance and changes in soil water levels stomatal conductance is an indirect measure of crop water stress and a benchmark method to assess plant water status ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 leaf porometer readings from plants in the i100 zc diseased and control plots were not significantly different on the first sampling day of each year june 13 2018 and june 17 2019 23 and 20 days after infestation dai in 2018 approximately 35 dai june 27 mean stomatal conductance measurements became significantly less in the zc diseased plants as compared with those readings from plants in the control plots fig 3a visual symptoms of zc disease were not readily evident at this time see supplementary file figure s 1 the differences between the mean stomatal conductance measurements remained significant for the sampling dates of july 5 and july 11 this pattern of numerically greater means in the control plots was similar in the i80 and i60 irrigation treatments levels although the means were not always significantly different see supplementary file figure s 2a b a time series graph of mean soil water content measurements for zc diseased and control plots by irrigation treatment is shown below the graph of stomatal conductance readings for the i100 treatment plots fig 3b comparisons of soil water content were made at this depth since soil water measurements with the np indicated limited soil water uptake beyond 900 mm see supplementary file figure s 3 s 4 in 2018 the average soil water content in all treatment plots was similar at the beginning of the growing season and dropped slightly a week later for the non infested plots but then leveled off near june 7 after june 25 nearly 35 dai mean soil water content began to increase sharply in the diseased treatment plots while for the control plots soil water content started a downward trend by the end of the growing season cumulative irrigation amounts to replenish soil water depletion to the appropriate designated levels in 2018 were 13 10 and 12 less in the i100 i80 and i60 zc diseased treatment plots as compared with the control plots in 2019 symptoms of zc disease leaf curling and chlorosis were observed approximately 35 dai july 2 in the infested treatment plots supplementary file figure s 5a b however mean stomatal conductance measurements in the i100 treatment plots were only significantly different at the p 0 10 level near this date fig 4a stomatal conductance measurements became significantly different at the p 0 05 level on july 12 44 dai the pattern in the difference in stomatal conductance readings between the control and zc diseased plots were more variable than in 2018 this was partially due to a lesser number of samples for each day of sampling stomatal conductance measurements in the i80 irrigation treatment plots showed a consistent trend where mean measurements were numerically greater for the control treatment plots as compared with the zc diseased plots supplementary file figure s 6a stomatal conductance readings were also numerically larger in the i60 treatment plots for the control plots on the sampling dates of july 1 and july 5 supplementary file figure s 6b the pattern of mean soil water content for zc diseased treatment plots in 2019 in the top 900 mm of the soil profile was similar to the pattern of diseased plots in 2018 after june 28 31 dai mean soil water content in the diseased plots began to rise at a greater rate than the control plots by july 11 44 dai mean soil water content for all treatment plots began to increase however the level of soil water content in the zc diseased plots was greater as compared with measurements from the control plots fig 4b mean soil water content decreased after the last irrigation on july 19 for all treatment plots soil water content remained greater for the zc diseased plots and mean stomatal conductance measurements on july 12 were only 25 of the measured values made from the control plots in the i100 treatment level in 2019 the cumulative irrigation amounts were 26 25 and 20 less in the i100 i80 and i60 zc treatment plots notably a numerical reduction in stomatal conductance occurred 14 days earlier than visual observations of zc disease symptoms in 2018 and 8 days earlier than visual observations in 2019 however significant differences in stomatal conductance between zc diseased plants and healthy plants did not occur until at least 35 days after infestation these findings were similar to those by zhou et al 2004 where they reported no significant difference in stomatal conductance readings 10 and 20 dai in virus pvyntn infested potatoes cv chunzao however they described large significant reductions in stomatal conductance 40 60 dai 4 discussion this experiment was established to determine the main effects of zc disease and irrigation level on the response of potatoes and to investigate if irrigation level had a significant impact on the severity level of zc disease secondly because irrigation scheduling was based on weekly neutron probe readings of the highest irrigation plots for the zc diseased and control plots there was interest to investigate the pattern of soil water levels in the soil profile and any relationship to stomatal conductance addressing the influence of zc disease on potato response it was evident that zc disease had a devastating impact on all potato crop response parameters in this study compared with the control healthy potato plants in 2018 overall mean tuber yield was reduced by more than 58 as compared with yield from the control plots mean cumulative etc through july 23rd date when most diseased plants had died was significantly less for the diseased plots yield losses in 2018 were within the range of those reported by munyaneza et al 2011 to be 49 9 87 2 overall mean cwp and iwp in the zc diseased plots were reduced by at least 41 in this year in 2019 the overall mean tuber yield cwp and iwp values in the zc diseased plots were reduced by 28 22 and 16 respectively as compared with the control plots these adverse impacts were expected as kumar et al 2015 reported that a decrease in tuber yields afflicted with zc disease resulted in a reduction in protease inhibitors rashed et al 2014 reported that potato plants infested four weeks before harvest or earlier resulted in 80 95 of tubers exhibiting zc disease symptoms furthermore rush et al 2015 reported that potato plants infested early in the season exhibited the most severe symptoms and produced low tuber yields having suffered from necrosis within a few weeks after being infected the study also demonstrated that the main effect of irrigation level did not significantly impact zc diseased potatoes there are no studies in the literature to compare these results however crop response in zc diseased plots for tuber yield and cwp were similar among irrigation treatments for both years in this study corroborating the devastating impact of zc disease on potato plants infested in the vernal season the results also demonstrated that irrigation level had no impact on severity level of zc disease indicating that apart from etc irrigation does not change crop response in zc diseased plants on the contrary irrigation level significantly impacted crop tuber yield and etc in the control plots the effect of irrigation on tuber yield in the current study were similar to those from many studies where moderate deficit irrigation amounts significantly reduced tuber yield for non diseased potatoes wolfe et al 1982 shock et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2003 onder et al 2005 el abedin et al 2017 ierna and mauromicale 2012 the significant difference in tuber yields within the control plots between the two years of the study warrant further discussion concerning the climatic conditions and agronomic practices the timing of n fertilizer and climatic conditions were different for each year of this study these differences raise the question as to which factors significantly influenced tuber yields in the control plots from year to year specific amounts of n and p were applied each year dependent on the preplant soil fertility reports however the application of n was split in the first year but not the second year the split application may have impacted tuber yield as some studies demonstrated increased tuber yield in coarse soils when the n fertilizer was split between preplant and at emergence gao et al 2018 milagres et al 2019 other studies report no significant difference in tuber yields when the fertilizer application of n was split bohman et al 2019 a second reason for decreased tuber yields in 2019 could be attributed to the large amount of rainfall received in the early part of the growing season that could have leached n away from the potato seeds such reasoning in reduced tuber yields was reported by campbell et al 1985 and rens et al 2018 precipitation was greater in the second year with 70 occurring by early june just prior to first florescence high soil moisture content during the early part of the growing season followed by high ambient air temperatures and drier conditions beginning on june 6 and continuing into july may have contributed to early plant senescence van loon 1981 in the control plots in 2019 the difference in climatic conditions from year to year influenced the cumulative amount and timing of irrigation events the irrigation applied in 2018 to the control plots was approximately 1 43 times greater than applied in 2019 precipitation in 2019 was 3 71 times greater in 2019 than in 2018 again the larger precipitation amount in 2019 contributed to etc values being significantly greater in 2019 compared with those in 2018 camargo et al 2015 also reported differences among tuber yields from year to year potatoes were irrigated at levels of 120 100 80 and 60 yields differences from year to year between the highest and lowest irrigation levels were 20 and 28 in that study evaporative demand was greater in the second year of their study also of interest was the relationship between stomatal conductance and soil water levels in regard to detection of the onset of zc disease it s well established that water deficit in potatoes reduces stomatal conductance ramirez et al 2016 beetge and kruger 2019 ariza et al 2020 however stomatal conductance in zc diseased potato plants is not well studied and it was not known if stomatal conductance measurements could be an early method of detection of zc disease in potatoes the increase in soil water content in the diseased potato plants after july 1 indicated the limited ability of the diseased plants to uptake water differences in stomatal conductance measurements in the control and zc diseased plots within each irrigation level seemed to indicate that a reduction in stomatal conductance occurs earlier than visual symptoms on the plant canopy and certainly sooner than changes in soil water content in the upper layer of the soil profile however stomatal conductance measurements were not significantly different early on and could be highly variable within a single sampling day wallis et al 2015 observed changes in potato physiology that could be directly or indirectly related to aboveground zc symptoms in potato plants gao et al 2009 found reduced levels of glucose in zc diseased plants with visual foliar symptoms as described herein which were likely cause by decreased photosynthesis due to necrosis of leaf tissue visual observations of zc disease evidenced by leaf cupping and chlorosis were recorded on june 27 2018 in most plots coinciding with the onset of the rise in soil water content although the actual physiological reasons for reduced plant water uptake are unclear ariza et al 2020 reasoned that a high reduction of stomatal conductance limits production of photoassimilates plant growth and yield in potatoes bilgin et al 2010 determined that biotic stress in plants triggers a uniform down regulation of proteins responsible for photosynthesis in performing molecular studies on zc diseased potato plants nwugo et al 2017 concluded that the lso bacterium caused a downregulation of photosynthesis related transcripts in potato leaf tissue and blocked the sieve tubes in zc affected potatoes which resulted in abnormal starch accumulation in leaf and root tissue and a consequential increase in potassium concentration in this study minimal changes in stomatal conductance were measured between july 5 and july 11 2018 in the zc diseased i80 and i60 treatment plots supplementary file figure s 2 in 2019 zc diseased plants in all irrigation levels showed only minor differences in stomatal conductance between june 27 july 1 and july 12 supplementary file figure s 6 the occurrence of these negligible changes while soil water content levels were increasing could be attributed to a reduction in functional leaf area gao et al 2016 and in leaf area in the canopy hikosaka 2005 reductions of leaf area in the canopy were observed among the zc diseased plants as the disease progressed see images in supplementary file figure s 1 the final topic of discussion surrounds the detection zc disease in potato plants relative to plant and in situ sensor measurements early detection of the onset of zc disease is important to help producers withhold irrigations on zc diseased plants to prevent water wastage similar foliar observations of leaf chlorosis curling and necroses were documented by crosslin et al 2010 henne et al 2010 munyaneza 2012 and caicedo et al 2020 because differences in stomatal conductance occurred earlier than the visual foliar symptoms it may be possible to detect zc disease earlier than visual observations using thermal imaging studies by chaerle et al 1999 demonstrate that plant virus can be detected with thermography aerial imagery using multi and hyperspectral sensors could be a practical method to detect the presence of zc disease and assess its severity level and location across a field sugiura et al 2016 developed an image processing algorithm to estimate disease severity of potato late blight using rgb imagery taken from a camera mounted on a multi rotor drone van de vijver et al 2020 used a hyperspectral imager on a ground based platform to detect blight in potatoes using support vector machine algorithms the percent of accurate classification for diseased plants was high although disease detection with spectral radiometric sensors would not be pre symptomatic early detection could signal producers to terminate irrigations future studies should consider the use of thermal imaging and spectral reflectance of the plant canopy for spatiotemporal detection of zc disease as early as possible in the growing season 5 conclusions this two year study confirmed that zc disease had a significant negative effect on tuber yield and etc on the chipping potato variety fl 1867 in both years irrigation level influenced tuber yield and etc in the control plots as both responses were significantly reduced in the i60 treatment level as compared with the i100 treatment level however irrigation level did not affect tuber yield cwp or iwp in zc diseased plots in either year of the study there was no interaction between zc disease and irrigation level on potato response indicating that zc disease severity was independent of the level of irrigation treatments in both years losses in tuber yield and wue due to zc disease were determined to be at least 58 in 2018 and 21 in 2019 stomatal conductance measurements showed large differences between measurements in the zc

9445,while many studies on zebra chip zc disease in potatoes have focused on the epidemiology of the disease and the characterization of infected potato plants this study quantifies the impact of zc disease on crop response and investigates the relationship between irrigation level and zc disease severity in this two year study chipping potatoes were planted under a variable rate irrigation center pivot sprinkler using a split plot design with a 2 3 factorial combination of zc disease level diseased and non diseased and irrigation levels of 100 80 and 60 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity designated i100 i80 and i60 crop response of tuber yield evapotranspiration etc crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp from zc diseased plots were compared with non diseased control plots tuber yield and cwp in the infested plots were significantly reduced by at least 58 in 2018 and by 21 in 2019 as compared with results in the control plots year significantly affected crop response in the control plots however crop response in the zc diseased plots was devastative to potatoes from year to year there was no interaction between irrigation level and zc disease occurrence in both years stomatal conductance measurements in zc diseased plants were reduced 35 and 44 days after infection as compared with control plants since irrigation did not lessen the severity of zc disease as soon as diseased plants are identified within a field withholding irrigation to the affected areas could improve iwp at the field level future studies should consider the use of thermal imaging or spectral reflectance of the plant canopy for spatiotemporal detection of zc disease as early as possible in the growing season keywords center pivot sprinkler plant disease irrigation water productivity stomatal conductance crop water productivity 1 introduction cultivation of potatoes solanum tuberosum l is a challenging task because potatoes are sensitive to abiotic and biotic stressors which may occur concomitantly and make it difficult to optimize production practices zc disease is a relatively newer disease that has quickly caused extensive economic losses to growers and the potato chip industry djaman et al 2020 garhwal et al 2020 the disease has been found in many production regions for potatoes in central america the u s munyaneza et al 2007a 2011 li et al 2009 and has recently been reported in regions of canada henrickson et al 2019 despite reports of the devastating effects of zc disease infested potatoes only a single study by munyaneza et al 2011 could be found that quantified losses in tuber mass most losses from zc disease are related to a reduction in potato marketability secor and rivera varas 2004 rush et al 2015 raw infected tubers exhibit vascular necrosis navarre et al 2009 when fried the discoloration becomes markedly darker munyaneza 2012 making fried products such as fries and chips commercially unacceptable the causal agent of zc disease in potatoes is the bacterium candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso transmitted by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli munyaneza et al 2007b liefting et al 2008 plants infested with the potato psyllid carrying lso can easily become infected with the pathogen producing observable symptoms within 3 4 weeks crosslin et al 2010 rashed et al 2014 the symptoms include leaf curling leaf chlorosis streaks at the medullary area in the tubers plant stunting leaf scorch collapsed stolons and early necrosis of the vascular system gudmestad and secor 2007 li et al 2009 caicedo et al 2020 workneh et al 2018 because psyllids are easily capable of infecting potato plants in a short period of time 6 h buchman et al 2011 psyllid infestation is typically managed by several insecticide applications throughout the growing season gharalari et al 2009 crosslin et al 2010 prager et al 2013 these applications are expensive do not always assure that a potato crop will be free from zc disease infection and can lead to vector resistance to commonly used insecticides szczepaniec et al 2019 another costly input to consider in potato production is water potatoes being susceptible to soil water deficit and heat stress require the right amount of water at the right time king et al 2006 yost et al 2019 if a grower s field becomes infested with psyllids often multiple plants in a single field will be affected munyaneza et al 2007b henne et al 2010 however potatoes are usually grown in large size fields the disease may go undiscovered until a significant number of plants become symptomatic approximately four weeks after initial infection continuing to irrigate zc diseased potatoes could result in significant reductions in crop water productivity however these reductions have not been quantified irrigation levels can also impact disease in potatoes some studies have shown that irrigation exacerbates disease severity in potatoes rotem and palti 1969 johnson et al 2003 reported that excessive moisture from over irrigation or precipitation negatively impacted russet burbank tuber yields by providing conducive conditions for blight and rust disease brierley et al 2015 determined that irrigation increased the severity of black dot disease on potato cultivar varieties maris piper sante and estima however as pointed out by adams and stevenson 1990 in a review of potato production and disease the interaction between irrigation and severity of many potato diseases is not straightforward for example during tuber initiation irrigation reduced the incidence of scab however wet soils also increased the incidence of brown center and powdery scab in further support of differences in interaction between irrigation and disease severity larkin et al 2011 determined that irrigation compared with rainfed production increased black scurf and common scab but it also resulted in higher yields for most potato rotations lapwood and read 1986 reported that irrigation did not affect disease symptoms of blackleg in rotem and palti 1969 it was noted that yarwood 1957 found that leaf turgidity in irrigated potato crops favored the infection of many hosts by a great variety of bacterial diseases although studies have investigated the effects of irrigation level on many foliar and soil borne diseases in potatoes it is not always clear if soil moisture has an influence on disease severity fiers et al 2012 moreover there are no studies that report the effects of irrigation level on the severity of zc disease in potatoes the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if there is an interaction between irrigation level and zc disease and 2 characterize the impact of zc disease on tuber yield etc crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp at three irrigation levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design a two year experiment was conducted at the conservation production research laboratory at bushland texas 35 11 n 102 06 w 1170 m above sea level on pullman clay loam a fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll the field capacity and wilting point of the soil were assumed to be 0 33 m3m 3 and 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively unger 1996 heng et al 2009 schwartz et al 2003 the climate at the site was characterized as semi arid with an average annual evaporative demand of 2600 mm and average annual precipitation of 460 mm tolk et al 2012 a standalone weather station was located within 10 m of the study site to record precipitation and meteorological measurements the instrumentation for the weather station is described fully in o shaughnessy et al 2019 the study was a split plot design with a 2 3 factorial combination of zc disease level diseased and non diseased and irrigation level 100 80 and 60 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity designated i100 i80 and i60 with four replicates of zc disease and 3 replicates of non diseased plots plot sizes were 12 rows wide 10 m by 30 m long the center eight rows of each designated zc diseased plot each 6 m in length received the psyllid infested treatment the center eight rows in each plot were also used for soil water measurements and harvesting samples destructive sampling of potato plants was conducted in the outer rows of the established plots 2 2 agronomic practices a mid season chipping potato crop variety fl 1867 was planted in early april in 2018 and 2019 on alternating halves each 2 38 ha of a 3 span vri center pivot field using a four row planter seed potatoes were planted 0 17 0 30 cm apart to a depth of 0 20 m in raised semi circular beds spaced 0 76 m apart the 2018 season followed maize while the 2019 season followed fallow ground prior to planting soil samples were taken on march 3 2018 and on march 6 2019 to a depth of 20 cm and analyzed by a third party company to determine fertilizer rates to meet a tuber yield goal of 39 mg ha 1 the blend of herbicides applied in 2019 was to improve weed control table 1 2 3 field management and irrigation treatments a neutron probe np access tube was placed in the center of each plot to a depth of 2 3 m soil water measurements with a np meter 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez ca were made weekly in the i100 treatment plots to determine soil water changes within the root zone in all other treatment plots soil water was measured at least every 30 days with a np soil water was measured from 0 1 m to 2 3 m depths at 0 2 m intervals precipitation occurring before the scheduled irrigation for the week was subtracted from the weekly total the np meter was field calibrated as described in evett 2008 soil water depletion was averaged separately among the i100 diseased and the i100 control plots and irrigations were based on replenishment of a percentage of soil water depletion 100 80 and 60 to field capacity in the top 1 5 m of the soil profile to zc diseased and control plots designated i100 i80 and i60 respectively evapotranspiration etc eq 1 was calculated for each plot as the sum of precipitation p mm and irrigation i mm and the difference between initial soil water readings taken soon after planting and soil water readings taken through july 23 2018 and july 17 2019 s mm these dates in july are when the majority of diseased plants were observed to have experienced necrosis water flux f mm across the lower boundary of the control volume and surface runoff r mm were assumed to be negligible as soil water readings taken with the np below the 1 5 m depth showed no evidence of deep percolation and maximum treatment irrigation depth per irrigation event was limited to 20 mm 1 et c p i f s r destructive sampling of whole potato plants was performed every two weeks after plant emergence to record the growth stage potatoes were harvested by hand in a 10 m2 area around each np access tube a plant count was performed within the 10 m2 area and 10 plants were dug using pitch forks the number of tubers per plant and the fresh weight of each tuber was recorded tuber yield per hectare mg ha 1 was extrapolated using plant count and average tuber yield per plant within the sampling area for each treatment plot this harvesting method was similar to yield method estimates used in usda nass 2006 and al gaadi et al 2016 crop water productivity was calculated as mass kg of tuber yield produced per unit of evapotranspiration mm irrigation water productivity was calculated as mass kg of tuber yield produced per depth mm of irrigation applied a comparison of measurements of stomatal conductance and soil water content in the top 900 mm of the soil profile in both the control and psyllid infested plots were made to help characterize the onset and physiological manifestations of zc disease stomatal conductance measurements were made with a handheld leaf porometer model sc 1 meter group pullman wa on june 13 june 27 july 5 july 11 2018 and on june 17 june 27 july 1 and july 12 2019 to identify the onset of limited transpiration the sensor was calibrated prior to reading each leaf readings were taken from three different leaves on a representative plant in each of the diseased and control plots between 09 00 am and 12 00 pm 2 4 psyllid infestation and zc disease detection in both years of the study diseased plants were established within twelve treatment plots by releasing bacteriliferous psyllids central haplotype co infected with lso haplotype a and b under 7 m x 6 m tents for a 10 day period the plants were infested near the first florescence stage on may 21 2018 and may 28 2019 which coincided with peak incidence of psyllids in grower fields workneh et al 2018 after ten days the released psyllids were eliminated with an insecticide cocktail abamectin agri mek syngenta greensboro nc spirotetramat movento bayer research triangle park nc and pymetrozine fullfill syngenta greensboro nc at label recommended rates for potatoes to ensure termination of all psyllid life stages twenty four hours after psyllid termination tents were removed symptomatic plant samples were collected and the presence of lso in the samples was determined using qpcr real time polymerase chain reaction as described by rashed et al 2018 the onset of zc disease was based on weekly visual observations and verified by qpcr diagnostic testing of symptomatic plant tissue a protocol from dneasy plant mini kit qiagen valencia ca was modified and used for dna extraction again lso was quantified using the qpcr protocol specified in rashed et al 2018 using a base rq relative quantification of zero for uninfected tubers vigue et al 2020 2 5 calculations and statistical analysis crop water productivity y g et c kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of economic yield y g to evapotranspiration etc and irrigation water productivity y g i kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of economic yield to cumulative irrigation i in mm applied howell 2002 year zc disease and irrigation level were considered main effects and analyzed for impacts on tuber yield etc cwp iwp and changes in soil water content δs among treatment plots using the proc mixed procedure in statistical analysis software sas version 9 4 differences between means were compared using the tukey kramer test and considered statistically significant at p 0 05 whole plots were treated as a random effect data were then separated by year to analyze the effects of zc disease and irrigation level on crop response using proc mixed in the case of heterogeneous variances the proc mixed procedure using an unequal variance covariance structure was used a two sample t test with assumed unequal variances was used to compare differences between means of stomatal conductance for zc diseased and control plots at each irrigation level 3 results 3 1 climate growth stage and irrigations in the 2018 growing season precipitation was limited from the start of planting through tuber bulking apr july and mean maximum daily ambient air temperatures were 30 c fig 1a total precipitation received from april through august was 109 mm two post plant irrigations totaling 51 mm were applied in april to facilitate plant emergence which occurred 25 days after planting dap on may 2 primary florescence occurred 57 dap june 1 tuber initiation tuber bulking and vine death were observed 61 dap june 5 77 dap june 21 and 117 dap aug 1 respectively mean cumulative seasonal irrigations for the non diseased i100 i80 and i60 treatment plots were 547 445 and 368 mm respectively for the i100 i80 and i60 diseased treatment plots mean seasonal cumulative irrigations were 476 400 and 324 mm respectively the first application of treatment irrigation was applied on may 26 in 2018 and continued through late july irrigations were not applied on any plants for the days that the tents were in place for the psyllid infestation process thirteen total treatment irrigations were applied in 2018 and irrigations were terminated on july 29 recorded observations indicated that zc disease did not appear to influence florescence in either year of the study florescence was delayed in the i60 irrigation plots for both the zc diseased and control plots by approximately 6 days wagg et al 2021 also noted delayed florescence in potatoes irrigated at deficit levels throughout the vegetative stage in 2019 within season precipitation was nearly four times greater 405 mm and mean maximum ambient air temperatures in apr and may were markedly less compared

treatment levels respectively diseased treatment plots received 280 224 and 193 mm of irrigation at the i100 i80 and i60 treatment levels respectively treatment irrigations were initiated on may 18 in 2019 again irrigations were withheld for all plants while the psyllid tents were in place so as not to interrupt the infection process fifteen treatment irrigations were applied in 2019 irrigations were terminated on july 18 for all treatment plots as most plants throughout the field were wilted black blister beetles coleoptera meloidae were also observed in the potato field in early july of 2019 and were mainly present among the plants in the outer circumference of the field nonetheless the pesticide bifenthrin was applied on july 9 to control the beetle population table 1 3 2 influence of zc disease irrigation level and their interactions on crop response and change in soil water content all subplots infested with bacteriliferous psyllids produced zc diseased potatoes while those not infested with the psyllids produced healthy potatoes analysis of data from both years showed that zc disease significantly impacted tuber yield etc cwp iwp and the change in soil water content to a depth of 900 mm δs table 2 irrigation level affected tuber yield etc and δs no interaction was found between irrigation level and zc disease indicating that irrigation level did not influence disease severity in potatoes to further demonstrate the effect of zc disease and irrigation level on potato production data were separated by year and crop response compared between zc diseased and control plots initially the presentation of results focuses on the effects of zc disease on crop response in 2018 within each irrigation treatment mean tuber yield etc cwp and iwp values were significantly less in the zc diseased plots fig 2 in 2019 mean tuber yield and etc were significantly less in the zc diseased plots however there was no significant difference in cwp between the control and zc diseased treatment plots apart from the i80 treatment iwp was significantly greater for the control plots to evaluate the effects of irrigation level on potato production the results are discussed separately for the control and zc diseased plots irrigation level significantly impacted tuber yield in 2018 and 2019 in the control plots fig 2a in these healthy plots tuber yield was significantly different between the i100 and i60 irrigation treatments in both years seasonal etc was significantly different among all irrigation levels in 2018 however in 2019 the difference was only significant between the i100 and i60 levels fig 2b irrigation level did not significantly impact cwp fig 2c or iwp fig 2d in the control plots in either year in contrast irrigation level did not have a significant impact on tuber yield fig 2a or cwp fig 2c in the zc diseased plots in either year of this study seasonal etc was significantly greater in 2018 for the i100 treatment level as compared with the i80 and i60 treatment levels in 2019 seasonal etc in the i60 treatment level was significantly less compared with the i100 and i80 treatment levels in 2018 the iwp values were similar across all irrigation levels for the zc diseased plots however in 2019 iwp for the i60 treatment was significantly greater compared with the i100 treatment plots 3 3 influence of growing season on crop response in the zc diseased plots tuber yield and cwp were numerically similar between years potatoes harvested from diseased treatment plots consistently produced smaller tuber yields in both years cumulative etc and iwp were significantly different for zc diseased plots between years seasonal etc values were numerically greater in 2019 due to the higher precipitation amounts in 2019 larger tuber yield coupled with lower cumulative irrigation amounts applied in 2019 contributed to numerically greater iwp values between the two years tuber yield in the control plots in 2019 was 22 less compared with yields in 2018 cumulative etc values were 15 greater in 2019 compared with values in 2018 again etc was greater in the latter year due to the greater amount of precipitation which contributed to at least 47 of cumulative etc values in each control plot in contrast in 2018 precipitation contributed at most 22 towards cumulative etc values crop water productivity in the control plots was 29 less in 2019 compared with the control plots in the previous year 3 4 stomatal conductance and changes in soil water levels stomatal conductance is an indirect measure of crop water stress and a benchmark method to assess plant water status ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 leaf porometer readings from plants in the i100 zc diseased and control plots were not significantly different on the first sampling day of each year june 13 2018 and june 17 2019 23 and 20 days after infestation dai in 2018 approximately 35 dai june 27 mean stomatal conductance measurements became significantly less in the zc diseased plants as compared with those readings from plants in the control plots fig 3a visual symptoms of zc disease were not readily evident at this time see supplementary file figure s 1 the differences between the mean stomatal conductance measurements remained significant for the sampling dates of july 5 and july 11 this pattern of numerically greater means in the control plots was similar in the i80 and i60 irrigation treatments levels although the means were not always significantly different see supplementary file figure s 2a b a time series graph of mean soil water content measurements for zc diseased and control plots by irrigation treatment is shown below the graph of stomatal conductance readings for the i100 treatment plots fig 3b comparisons of soil water content were made at this depth since soil water measurements with the np indicated limited soil water uptake beyond 900 mm see supplementary file figure s 3 s 4 in 2018 the average soil water content in all treatment plots was similar at the beginning of the growing season and dropped slightly a week later for the non infested plots but then leveled off near june 7 after june 25 nearly 35 dai mean soil water content began to increase sharply in the diseased treatment plots while for the control plots soil water content started a downward trend by the end of the growing season cumulative irrigation amounts to replenish soil water depletion to the appropriate designated levels in 2018 were 13 10 and 12 less in the i100 i80 and i60 zc diseased treatment plots as compared with the control plots in 2019 symptoms of zc disease leaf curling and chlorosis were observed approximately 35 dai july 2 in the infested treatment plots supplementary file figure s 5a b however mean stomatal conductance measurements in the i100 treatment plots were only significantly different at the p 0 10 level near this date fig 4a stomatal conductance measurements became significantly different at the p 0 05 level on july 12 44 dai the pattern in the difference in stomatal conductance readings between the control and zc diseased plots were more variable than in 2018 this was partially due to a lesser number of samples for each day of sampling stomatal conductance measurements in the i80 irrigation treatment plots showed a consistent trend where mean measurements were numerically greater for the control treatment plots as compared with the zc diseased plots supplementary file figure s 6a stomatal conductance readings were also numerically larger in the i60 treatment plots for the control plots on the sampling dates of july 1 and july 5 supplementary file figure s 6b the pattern of mean soil water content for zc diseased treatment plots in 2019 in the top 900 mm of the soil profile was similar to the pattern of diseased plots in 2018 after june 28 31 dai mean soil water content in the diseased plots began to rise at a greater rate than the control plots by july 11 44 dai mean soil water content for all treatment plots began to increase however the level of soil water content in the zc diseased plots was greater as compared with measurements from the control plots fig 4b mean soil water content decreased after the last irrigation on july 19 for all treatment plots soil water content remained greater for the zc diseased plots and mean stomatal conductance measurements on july 12 were only 25 of the measured values made from the control plots in the i100 treatment level in 2019 the cumulative irrigation amounts were 26 25 and 20 less in the i100 i80 and i60 zc treatment plots notably a numerical reduction in stomatal conductance occurred 14 days earlier than visual observations of zc disease symptoms in 2018 and 8 days earlier than visual observations in 2019 however significant differences in stomatal conductance between zc diseased plants and healthy plants did not occur until at least 35 days after infestation these findings were similar to those by zhou et al 2004 where they reported no significant difference in stomatal conductance readings 10 and 20 dai in virus pvyntn infested potatoes cv chunzao however they described large significant reductions in stomatal conductance 40 60 dai 4 discussion this experiment was established to determine the main effects of zc disease and irrigation level on the response of potatoes and to investigate if irrigation level had a significant impact on the severity level of zc disease secondly because irrigation scheduling was based on weekly neutron probe readings of the highest irrigation plots for the zc diseased and control plots there was interest to investigate the pattern of soil water levels in the soil profile and any relationship to stomatal conductance addressing the influence of zc disease on potato response it was evident that zc disease had a devastating impact on all potato crop response parameters in this study compared with the control healthy potato plants in 2018 overall mean tuber yield was reduced by more than 58 as compared with yield from the control plots mean cumulative etc through july 23rd date when most diseased plants had died was significantly less for the diseased plots yield losses in 2018 were within the range of those reported by munyaneza et al 2011 to be 49 9 87 2 overall mean cwp and iwp in the zc diseased plots were reduced by at least 41 in this year in 2019 the overall mean tuber yield cwp and iwp values in the zc diseased plots were reduced by 28 22 and 16 respectively as compared with the control plots these adverse impacts were expected as kumar et al 2015 reported that a decrease in tuber yields afflicted with zc disease resulted in a reduction in protease inhibitors rashed et al 2014 reported that potato plants infested four weeks before harvest or earlier resulted in 80 95 of tubers exhibiting zc disease symptoms furthermore rush et al 2015 reported that potato plants infested early in the season exhibited the most severe symptoms and produced low tuber yields having suffered from necrosis within a few weeks after being infected the study also demonstrated that the main effect of irrigation level did not significantly impact zc diseased potatoes there are no studies in the literature to compare these results however crop response in zc diseased plots for tuber yield and cwp were similar among irrigation treatments for both years in this study corroborating the devastating impact of zc disease on potato plants infested in the vernal season the results also demonstrated that irrigation level had no impact on severity level of zc disease indicating that apart from etc irrigation does not change crop response in zc diseased plants on the contrary irrigation level significantly impacted crop tuber yield and etc in the control plots the effect of irrigation on tuber yield in the current study were similar to those from many studies where moderate deficit irrigation amounts significantly reduced tuber yield for non diseased potatoes wolfe et al 1982 shock et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2003 onder et al 2005 el abedin et al 2017 ierna and mauromicale 2012 the significant difference in tuber yields within the control plots between the two years of the study warrant further discussion concerning the climatic conditions and agronomic practices the timing of n fertilizer and climatic conditions were different for each year of this study these differences raise the question as to which factors significantly influenced tuber yields in the control plots from year to year specific amounts of n and p were applied each year dependent on the preplant soil fertility reports however the application of n was split in the first year but not the second year the split application may have impacted tuber yield as some studies demonstrated increased tuber yield in coarse soils when the n fertilizer was split between preplant and at emergence gao et al 2018 milagres et al 2019 other studies report no significant difference in tuber yields when the fertilizer application of n was split bohman et al 2019 a second reason for decreased tuber yields in 2019 could be attributed to the large amount of rainfall received in the early part of the growing season that could have leached n away from the potato seeds such reasoning in reduced tuber yields was reported by campbell et al 1985 and rens et al 2018 precipitation was greater in the second year with 70 occurring by early june just prior to first florescence high soil moisture content during the early part of the growing season followed by high ambient air temperatures and drier conditions beginning on june 6 and continuing into july may have contributed to early plant senescence van loon 1981 in the control plots in 2019 the difference in climatic conditions from year to year influenced the cumulative amount and timing of irrigation events the irrigation applied in 2018 to the control plots was approximately 1 43 times greater than applied in 2019 precipitation in 2019 was 3 71 times greater in 2019 than in 2018 again the larger precipitation amount in 2019 contributed to etc values being significantly greater in 2019 compared with those in 2018 camargo et al 2015 also reported differences among tuber yields from year to year potatoes were irrigated at levels of 120 100 80 and 60 yields differences from year to year between the highest and lowest irrigation levels were 20 and 28 in that study evaporative demand was greater in the second year of their study also of interest was the relationship between stomatal conductance and soil water levels in regard to detection of the onset of zc disease it s well established that water deficit in potatoes reduces stomatal conductance ramirez et al 2016 beetge and kruger 2019 ariza et al 2020 however stomatal conductance in zc diseased potato plants is not well studied and it was not known if stomatal conductance measurements could be an early method of detection of zc disease in potatoes the increase in soil water content in the diseased potato plants after july 1 indicated the limited ability of the diseased plants to uptake water differences in stomatal conductance measurements in the control and zc diseased plots within each irrigation level seemed to indicate that a reduction in stomatal conductance occurs earlier than visual symptoms on the plant canopy and certainly sooner than changes in soil water content in the upper layer of the soil profile however stomatal conductance measurements were not significantly different early on and could be highly variable within a single sampling day wallis et al 2015 observed changes in potato physiology that could be directly or indirectly related to aboveground zc symptoms in potato plants gao et al 2009 found reduced levels of glucose in zc diseased plants with visual foliar symptoms as described herein which were likely cause by decreased photosynthesis due to necrosis of leaf tissue visual observations of zc disease evidenced by leaf cupping and chlorosis were recorded on june 27 2018 in most plots coinciding with the onset of the rise in soil water content although the actual physiological reasons for reduced plant water uptake are unclear ariza et al 2020 reasoned that a high reduction of stomatal conductance limits production of photoassimilates plant growth and yield in potatoes bilgin et al 2010 determined that biotic stress in plants triggers a uniform down regulation of proteins responsible for photosynthesis in performing molecular studies on zc diseased potato plants nwugo et al 2017 concluded that the lso bacterium caused a downregulation of photosynthesis related transcripts in potato leaf tissue and blocked the sieve tubes in zc affected potatoes which resulted in abnormal starch accumulation in leaf and root tissue and a consequential increase in potassium concentration in this study minimal changes in stomatal conductance were measured between july 5 and july 11 2018 in the zc diseased i80 and i60 treatment plots supplementary file figure s 2 in 2019 zc diseased plants in all irrigation levels showed only minor differences in stomatal conductance between june 27 july 1 and july 12 supplementary file figure s 6 the occurrence of these negligible changes while soil water content levels were increasing could be attributed to a reduction in functional leaf area gao et al 2016 and in leaf area in the canopy hikosaka 2005 reductions of leaf area in the canopy were observed among the zc diseased plants as the disease progressed see images in supplementary file figure s 1 the final topic of discussion surrounds the detection zc disease in potato plants relative to plant and in situ sensor measurements early detection of the onset of zc disease is important to help producers withhold irrigations on zc diseased plants to prevent water wastage similar foliar observations of leaf chlorosis curling and necroses were documented by crosslin et al 2010 henne et al 2010 munyaneza 2012 and caicedo et al 2020 because differences in stomatal conductance occurred earlier than the visual foliar symptoms it may be possible to detect zc disease earlier than visual observations using thermal imaging studies by chaerle et al 1999 demonstrate that plant virus can be detected with thermography aerial imagery using multi and hyperspectral sensors could be a practical method to detect the presence of zc disease and assess its severity level and location across a field sugiura et al 2016 developed an image processing algorithm to estimate disease severity of potato late blight using rgb imagery taken from a camera mounted on a multi rotor drone van de vijver et al 2020 used a hyperspectral imager on a ground based platform to detect blight in potatoes using support vector machine algorithms the percent of accurate classification for diseased plants was high although disease detection with spectral radiometric sensors would not be pre symptomatic early detection could signal producers to terminate irrigations future studies should consider the use of thermal imaging and spectral reflectance of the plant canopy for spatiotemporal detection of zc disease as early as possible in the growing season 5 conclusions this two year study confirmed that zc disease had a significant negative effect on tuber yield and etc on the chipping potato variety fl 1867 in both years irrigation level influenced tuber yield and etc in the control plots as both responses were significantly reduced in the i60 treatment level as compared with the i100 treatment level however irrigation level did not affect tuber yield cwp or iwp in zc diseased plots in either year of the study there was no interaction between zc disease and irrigation level on potato response indicating that zc disease severity was independent of the level of irrigation treatments in both years losses in tuber yield and wue due to zc disease were determined to be at least 58 in 2018 and 21 in 2019 stomatal conductance measurements showed large differences between measurements in the zc diseased and control plots that occurred sooner than visual observations of plant disease and the rise in soil water content in the top 900 mm of the soil profile detection of zc disease symptoms

9446,the vulnerability of conventional operational systems in agricultural water distribution systems becomes controversial under successive water shortages accordingly inadequate unfair and unreliable surface water distribution has led to crop yield reduction and economic damage to address these issues a novel configuration of an automated operating system was developed to mitigate crop yield reductions during times of water scarcity using centralized model predictive control cmpc an automatedwater distribution control system was developed in matlab version 2018a and integrated with the aquacrop model to provide an intelligent daily water distribution prioritization within irrigation districts this study also investigated technical and environmental perspectives in enriching the resilience of agricultural water distribution systems influenced by the water shortage periods a controversial irrigation district located in central iran was selected as the test case located in a basin where reported socio economic and environmental concerns are among the highest in iran application of the developed configuration of the cmpc led to 4 1 5 7 5 6 and 7 3 increasing the crop yield under the water shortage scenarios of 15 20 25 and 30 respectively likewise employing the intelligent operation led to the economic benefit of 8 5 11 3 11 9 and 16 8 m us by conserving crop production of 3841 4 5104 8 5367 6 and 7543 0 tons respectively under the scenarios as mentioned above the proposed method enables water authorities to promote the surface water distribution system in practical implementable and step by step planning to increase individual and public profits and environmental achievements by reducing water extraction from tube wells based on the actual water demand potential graphical abstract ga1 keywords automation irrigation district crop yield sustainable agriculture 1 introduction despite substantial investments for developing irrigation districts supplied from surface water sw resources unreliable agricultural water distribution has led to i social conflicts within the farmers society ii economic recession in the rural regions due to significant dependency on the farmer s incomes to the agricultural activities and ii the environmental degradations precisely due to groundwater overexploitation within the irrigation district kamrani et al 2020 regarding these reasons mentioned above modernization renovation and rehabilitation of the many irrigation districts are on the agriculture sector s agenda however these projects have been restricted due to water shortages consecutive droughts climate change impacts and higher priorities for fulfilling industrial and environmental water rights ghazanfari et al 2013 accordingly it is essential to shift from current supply oriented agricultural water management which focuses on developing new water resources to demand driven management aimed at i estimating accurate agricultural water demands in different secondary irrigated units sius and ii reducing water losses within the irrigation district despite advances in water consumption reduction at the farm scale on farm activities resulting from precision agriculture practices lópez urrea et al 2020 wang et al 2016 the water losses in agricultural water operating systems have remained unchanged due to the inefficient unreliable and inflexible operating systems structures and infrastructures of many districts malaterre et al 1998 monem and hashemy 2010 moreover despite improved estimation of water demands by remote sensing techniques and sensor networks han et al 2020 farm scale water conservation has resulted in the expansion of irrigated crops it is worth noting that successful regional scale modernization projects require a proper understanding of the extent and sources of water losses the intrinsic characteristics of the operating systems and approach and the overall potential of the modern agricultural water distribution and delivery systems awdds in terms of the losses reduction and accurate water delivery the current awdds used by many irrigation districts in developing countries require manual daily adjustments of the water level regulator and off take structures i e manual operation according to an appraisal conducted by the united states bureau of reclamation usbr the average amount of water losses within awdds is about 35 of the supplied water based on data analysis over 20 years usbr 2005 investigations into losses at awdds located in an irrigation district in iran indicated that total losses were about 200 of the total evapotranspiration it was also found that while total agricultural water demand is about 1 8 m3 s 1 the inflow to the system is about 5 5 m3 s 1 other studies quantifying water losses in irrigation districts reveal that losses encompass a wide range of total inflow to the main canal for instance portugal s systems have reported losses of almost 50 cunha et al 2019 while those of the wakool irrigation district and southern murray darling basin in australia range from 7 to 10 and 1 8 respectively akbar et al 2013 different water losses in irrigation canals reported in the literature included 35 52 and 64 68 in the lined and unlined irrigation canals in pakistan more than 55 in spain and 41 100 in ethiopia barkhordari et al 2020 accordingly extra delivery happened in the modern scheme due to operational limitations employing the conventional manual operating systems while insufficient delivery occurred because of the infrastructural inabilities analysis of the latest appraisal project conducted by the usbr indicates that approximately 22 of the 35 of awdds losses related to the main channel located in the lugert altus irrigation area were due to operational deviations usbr 2005 barkhordari et al 2020 water losses in awdds can be considerable resulting in significant volumes of water diverted for irrigation purposes never reaching the intended agricultural land end users furthermore the insufficient inequitable and unreliable distribution of sw resources through irrigation canal networks can lead to the over exploitation of aquifers as farmers seek a more reliable water source within irrigation districts such over exploitation has occurred in the middle east north africa the united states china india japan and spain with serious issues related to the sustainability of groundwater resources and with socio environmental problems askari fard et al 2022 accordingly the awdds operational performance improvement has become a top priority for local authorities and water planning managers due to potential negative social economic and environmental effects intelligent systems in awdds operation through automatic control systems are an efficient measure taken to improve the reliability of sw distribution in irrigation districts automated operation schemes are a compelling factor for raising water productivity in agricultural irrigation which have been investigated in previous studies using different management perspectives zafra cabeza et al 2011 tian et al 2017 zhong et al 2020 the management strategies investigated include implementing on demand agricultural water systems in line water storing within the irrigation canals fele et al 2014 hashemy and overloop 2013 guan et al 2011 appropriate operational management for the local water market hashemy et al 2017 and conjunctive operation of sw and groundwater ibrakhimov et al 2018 in this regard centralized automatic control systems cacs are employed to fulfill the advantages of the strategies mentioned above however it should be noted that one of the crucial elements in the reliable and successful operation of awdds is the estimation of actual agricultural water demand at each of the off takes from the distribution canals knowing the exact amount of irrigation water needed at each off take resulted in water conservation due to overestimating the demand and provided a realistic road map for the intelligent systems for accurate water delivery throughout the canal networks crop models should estimate agricultural water demand to fulfill the objective discussed above in most crop models which are the appropriate tools for analyzing crop behaviors in the face of environmental factors the moisture is calculated based on the equilibrium of inflow and outflow in the vicinity of the crop s root aquacrop is one of these models and has been employed in many studies to estimate the irrigation water requirements based on the climate crop and soil characteristics han et al 2020 this crop model has also been used to simulate the actual evapotranspiration under average rainfall and drought conditions nunes et al 2021 crop water use efficiencies jin et al 2020 the economic yield of a crop and agricultural water demands of different crops adeboye et al 2019 the overarching goal of the present study was to develop an innovative operating system for awdds in irrigation districts capable of precise estimation of the agricultural water demands and reliable agricultural water distribution the developed model was tested on an irrigation district in central iran suffering from sw shortage conditions aquacrop s simulation results integrated the crop water productivity model into an automatic operating system to achieve this goal to the best of the authors knowledge intelligent operating systems have never been used simultaneously for demand estimation and automatic operation the method presented here is a prerequisite for the rehabilitation renovation and modernization of surface water irrigation projects the proposed approach works similarly to a water accounting framework for the agricultural water distribution system where precise demand and supply estimations are desperately needed for practical regional water planning the more specific objectives followed in the present study are summarized below 1 to develop and calibrate the aquacrop model for irrigation water demands determination at the individual sius each siu supplied from an off take located in the main canal in the district 2 to design and calibrate the id model to estimate the exact amount of water delivered to the individual siu 3 to design and test the centralized control system for automatic distribution of the water within the siu along with the main canal 4 to integrate the daily siu s irrigation demands objective no 1 and automatic control system objective no 3 and evaluate the potential of the developed innovative operating system in mitigating the cropping pattern yield reduction in a water shortage condition 2 methods and materials 2 1 research methodology the primary components of the present study were included i surface water distribution system simulation model ii automatic control system model and iii crop yield simulation model the integration of these components into a system was explained within the following steps step 1 field study field surveying activities included measurements interviews and brainstorming meetings and two primary data categories were collected the first category were included surveying the sw distribution canal networks and hydraulic structures information on agricultural water rights for each region the second category was related to the required information of the et0 calculator and aquacrop models including the daily weather data from the meteorological station of the varzaneh synoptic station and crops planting specifications step 2 hydraulic operational simulation model this step was included i developing the flow hydraulics simulation model in open canals and ii developing the automatic control system in this component the control model was integrated with the hydraulic model to assess the control command i e the water level regulators adjustments impacts on the hydraulic condition of the canal system step 3 spatial analysis of surface water distribution the appraisal performance indicators were calculated and the arcgis investigated their spatial distribution step 4 crop yield simulation developing and calibrating the aquacrop model for the study area s cropping pattern to calculate the irrigation water demands at the off takes location alongside the main canal of the district this component was integrated with the automatic control system to upgrade the irrigation water demands of each off take located alongside the canal step 5 operational performance appraisal determining the operational technical and agricultural advantages of employing the automated water distribution system to reduce crop production under a severe water shortage scenario 2 2 simulation of awdds operational performance in the status quo the conventional awdds operating systems convey distribute and deliver agricultural water based on daily supplied sw at the canal head source babaei et al 2018 water is accessible through direct extraction from rivers or released water from an upstream reservoir dam under these circumstances the only measure taken is the daily water volume delivered to irrigation districts surface water distribution among sius is planned by determining the adjustments of time and hydraulic structures i e water level regulating and intake structures an expert team conducts planning with several years of experience operating awdds who are adequately familiar with problematic points and social conflicts often between farmers upstream and downstream of the agricultural region the water right of each sius is constant based on agreements in the past decades or centuries or is determined annually based on agreements between the representative of farmers and water distribution system managers most studies have employed a hydraulic simulation model to simulate water distribution through the off take then the awdds operational performance were investigaed by comparing variations of off takes delivered water via agricultural water demand in this regard flow hydraulics simulation models such as sobek epa swmm hec ras canalman and sic or open source academic models such as icss movahedinia et al 2019 azargashb lord et al 2021 malaterre et al 1998 working based on the numerical solution of saint venant equations with different numerical schemes have been used to achieve the desired objective however the high accuracy and reliability of automatic control methods have caused extensive application of simplified analytical models rodriguez et al 2020 horváth et al 2014 liu et al 2012 the numerical models need to be integrated with automatic control systems when more complex objectives than operating an awdds are intended for example reducing the emission of pollutants in a river s water body requires the exact calculation of hydraulic parameters at all points along the flow path horváth et al 2014 zhonghao et al 2019 therefore considering the need to avoid any complexity and the significance of operational fast training the simplified integrator delay id analytical modelwas employed as the hydraulic simulation model in operational water management studies in the id model each open canal reach includes the uniform flow with the characteristic delay time τ and the backwater curve with the characteristic storage level a s these characteristics are obtained from eqs 1 and 2 under normal and frequency analysis modes in addition the water level in each canal reach can be calculated from eq 3 q c a n a l t q i n t τ 1 l q c a n

for the performance evaluation index respectively with values of 0 9 1 0 8 09 and less than 0 8 hassani et al 2019 2 3 daily irrigation water demand estimation the irrigation water requirement calculation was conducted using the aquacrop model version 6 1 the crop growth model this model was initially developed in 2007 by the food and agriculture organization fao division of land and water inherited the combination of simplicity robustness and capabilities the model enables simulation of the irrigation water requirement and yield response of the crops to received water the model is particularly well suited to conditions in which water is a critical limiting factor in crop production owing to the specific ability to employ only a few explicit parameters and mostly intuitive input variables which can be estimated using simple methods the broad applicability of the aquacrop is guaranteed the final crop yield is simulated within four stages each step performs in series and daily time increments as described in the following formulas the four steps are easy to understand thereby ensuring transparency in the modeling approach han et al 2020 8 y x y a y x k y e t x e t a e t x

awdds conventional automatic operating system daily procedure off takes water demands are defined as a predetermined external component for the controller the head gate s sensor measures the canal inflow as the upstream boundary condition each controller in a decentralized configuration regulates its adjacent structure located downstream of canal reaches after water level adjustments the off take structure can be opened for water delivery manually by an operator or automatically by a controller given the single objective nature of decentralized controllers where each controller can only adjust a single structure and adjustments interactions are neglected different centralized control algorithms have been extensively used in automation projects rodriguez et al 2020 the cmpc was used as the automatic operation control system the literature confirms the ability of the cmpc in realizing various operational objectives of agricultural water distribution systems maestre et al 2014 the modified configuration of the cmpc was developed in this study by including the simulated daily agricultural water demands using the aquacrop model in the typical configuration of the cmpc the state space model eq 10 was used to provide an internal model for simulating flow hydraulics in temporal horizons and compacting the multivariable formulation of a linear model hashemy et al 2016 yang et al

is the water level error and e1 k represents the status variable added to the system including the soft constraint caused by violation of the water level from the maximum and minimum levels in the first canal reach according to hashemy et al 2018 this variable was added to the system to eliminate the gradual error of the controller when the controlled water level violates the reference water level the auxiliary variable u k lacks a physical interpretation but is only a hypothetical variable to further penalty on the objective function the error caused by the deviation of the water level is subtracted from the reference water level to achieve e 1 k the soft constraints get involved in the optimization by including an auxiliary status variable e 1 k in each canal reach and at the same time an auxiliary controlled variable u k the auxiliary variables are calculated by eq 12 askari fard et al 2021 12 u k e k h min k h r e f e h max k h r e f h max k h r e f e ³ h max k h r e f h min

aquacrop model s simulation results in the developed mpc s configuration introduced in the present study the calculated daily irrigation water demands by aquacrop at each siu s off take location were replaced by the traditional water rights accordingly the following modifications were conducted in this configuration as follows 1 the vector q o f f t a k e 1 k in eq 10 was updated daily based on the acuacrop model outputs including the daily off takes demand given in table 2 2 the state variables in the penalty matrix q e j in eq 14 were updated so that the siu s off takes with higher demand based on the cropping pattern s total demand prioritize water delivery it is worth noting that these matrix variables make a wide range of flexible penalties daily updated on the optimization model to provide an ordered water delivery within the main canal in this regard the optimization model s constraints have been changed to variable parameters compared to the standard configuration of the cmpc these constraints originated from structural infrastructural physical and operational restrictions in a water distribution system another constraint called soft constraint was violated by the controller to provide a degree of flexibility for cmpc to correct the error gradually these type of constraints were operational inherent such as deviation from a target level or target band illustrated hashemy et al 2013 the soft constraints create extra penalties on eq 14 s auxiliary variable therefore the primary weighting approach in the standard mpc configuration is employed using the maximum allowed value estimate mave factor fele et al 2014 while this procedure in the modified configuration of the present study was shifted to the siu s daily agricultural water demands priorities specified by the aquacrop model simulation results accordingly the sius with higher demand were supposed to get the higher priorities and the lower penalties consequently as follows 15 q e

each ius and c d a w j is the calculated daily water demands by the aquacrop 2 6 the test case field study and on site data measurement roodasht irrigation district is located in southeastern isfahan city in iran the roodasht north branch rnb main canal depicted in fig 1 and given in table 1 was selected as a test case study according to the data obtained from the operational division of the irrigation district the less than optimal performance of this network results in about 30 40 loss of agricultural water delivered to the conveyance distribution delivery systems therefore groundwater based agriculture has expanded to overcome this problem with the annual extraction of 100 million m3 from nearly 45 000 wells dug for the irrigation network the extraction volume by this irrigation district is nearly equal to 26 of total groundwater extraction within the zayandeh rud basin the rnb canal has a 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes in the test canal taking water for the laterals the current irrigation water scheduling follows a rotational approach where the three components of duration irrigation frequency and delivered discharge are not flexible and arranged by the irrigation district manager the canal operational system follows upstream control including manual adjustment of the off take structures the field visiting and field study conducted during the present study revealed that unreliable and imprecise operational activities have led to inadequate performance of the canal system in surface water operation spatial non uniformity and unfair water distribution between the upstream and downstream users consequently extra water was delivered at the upstream off takes leading to drainage problems and imposing labor costs on the farmers on the other hand the farmers at the canal s middle and tail end suffered from insufficient water delivery another obstacle the canal authorities face was a lack of maintenance guidelines and a reliable database containing records of the maintenance activities these deficits were leading to the deterioration of operational conditions and disorder in annual maintenance where the overall trend in operational efficiency has decreased from 2006 to 2016 despite a significant rise in maintenance cost hassani et al 2019 the aquacrop model s input such as daily weather data soil hydraulic characteristics and crop parameters were collected for the 2016 2017 water year the model s calibration and verification were conducted based on the 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 water years daily weather data including minimum and maximum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were collected from the meteorological station of the varzaneh synoptic station lat 52 62 long 32 4 elv 1450 located adjacent to the roodasht irrigation district tables 2 and 3 give the crop parameters for the cultivated crops in the irrigation district and the soil hydraulic characteristics evapotranspiration was calculated via eto calculator software considering the meteorological parameters given in table 4 based on fao penman monteith in addition other required inputs for the aquacrop model including the crops planting periods were gathered during field visits and individual farmers interviewed another variable needed for computing the agricultural water demands at each off take was the applied efficiency of the irrigation systems at the farm scale including i surface irrigation systems and ii pressurized systems of sprinkler and drip systems the applied efficiency was chosen as 53 6 62 1 and 71 1 for the surface sprinkler and drip system based on the measurement carried out recently in the study area by the local authorities accordingly the irrigation water requirement iwr in two forms of depth and volumes was calculated individually for the sui s off takes the crop specific parameters determine the development of the canopy cover during the growing period in the aquacrop s crop file included the canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc days to emergence senescence and flowering the cgc and cdc control the rate at which the canopy expands and how fast the canopy dies off at the end of the growing season during the crop growing period the canopy cover was measured for the crops separately then cgc and cdc values were calculated based on the initial canopy size at the beginning of the growing period the maximum canopy cover the canopy at the time of the harvesting time and the crops days to emergence days to senescence and days to full maturity it is worth noting that the alfalfa s cgc values have higher values than other crops in table 2 since it has the minimum day to maximum canopy parameter s value 3 results 3 1 performance appraisal of awdds s operation in the status quo the statistical indicators including rmse crm mae were calculated and analyzed to calibrate and validate the flow hydraulics simulation model i e id model analyses were conducted by simulating the 11 month operational period during which the canal s inflow and the off takes delivered discharge in the study were measured accordingly 75 of the period was used for calibration and the rest 25 for validation according to the results mae crm and rmse for the calibration period were 0 87 m3 s 1 0 002 and 0 98 m3 s 1 the corresponding values for the validation period were 1 03 m3 s 1 0 009 and 1 05 m3 s 1 confirming the acceptable accuracy of the model the present performance of the sw distribution system was evaluated under three operational scenarios representing variations of the inlet flow the discharge and volume of water delivered to the sui s off takes were measured daily at the head source to the awdds the measured inflow data revealed that irrigation water was released to the awdds in three intervals of the crop season 29 days from 8 november to 6 december in the water year 2016 22 days from 25 february to 18 march and 55 days from 9 april to 2 june in the water year 2017 evaluating the inflow showed that water cannot be continuously supplied from sw resources due to water scarcity for this reason farmers shifted to groundwater resources as a backup system for supplying the demands the 29 22 and 55 day intervals were then selected as a basis for the operational simulation it is noteworthy that the daily water inflow to the system in the above intervals varied from 129 000 to 1036 000 m3 the developed id model simulated water distribution with the awdds every day in the 29 22 and 55 day intervals the inflow range to the main canal was discretized from a minimum of 0 5 to a maximum of 4 5 cubic meters per second cms with an interval of 0 1 cms to display the water distribution simulation results this discretization allowed the performance evaluation of the operating system in the status quo the water delivery adequacy index evaluated the awdds operational performance in the status quo the water delivery adequacy represents the awdds potential in the adequate and appropriate water distribution to suis located from upstream to downstream of the irrigation district table 5 summarizes agricultural water distribution performance in minimum maximum and average agricultural water adequacy for the sius off takes 1 26 in three simulated intervals the average water adequacy was simulated in all three intervals and the results showed the poor performance of the awdds of the test case based on the results in table 5 in the first interval 29 day interval the average water adequacy of distributing agricultural water upstream midstream and downstream of the irrigation district varied from 28 to 51 18 32 and was less than 20 respectively with decreasing water supplied to the irrigation districts from the sw resources in the other two simulated intervals 22 and 55 day intervals the average water adequacy was less than that in the first interval but with the same trend it is noteworthy that according to eq 7 the optimal water adequacy varied from 80 to 100 the results indicated that the less than optimal performance of awdds in this irrigation district was the main reason for farmers willingness to use groundwater resources the catastrophic result of such conditions was nothing but an increase in critical aquifers in developing countries multiple environmental losses caused by excessive water extracted from groundwater resources and reduced water quality 3 2 estimating the agricultural water demand in irrigated units of the studied district 3 2 1 estimating reference evapotranspiration by eto calculator the reference evapotranspiration rate in the crop year 2016 2017 was calculated from the meteorological data with eto calculator s help fig 2 displays variations of the reference evapotranspiration during the crop year the maximum reference evapotranspiration rates of 7 8 and 7 3 mm day 1 were respectively observed in june and july zoning of the irrigation district in terms of irrigation systems in farms the zoning of the irrigation district was performed to plot the distribution of irrigation systems used on farms three irrigation systems were used on the study area s farms based on field visits fig 3 shows the approximate scattering of these irrigation systems of surface irrigation and pressurized drip and sprinkler systems the approximate distribution in fig 3 was obtained considering the threshold of 60 of farms with a specific irrigation system the scattering of irrigation systems confirmed the less than optimal performance of water distribution so that by increasing the distance upstream sius farmers downstream of the district were more interested in using the pressurized irrigation systems this can be related to the system s inability to distribute timely and equitable irrigation water according to the above discussions and fig 3 the water applied efficiency in farms for calculating the gross agricultural water demand was respectively considered 53 6 62 1 and 71 1 upstream midstream and downstream of the irrigation district 3 2 2 estimating the daily agricultural water demand of crops in the cropping pattern this study s crop model was calibrated and validated by the measured data including the grain yield and biomass fig 4 displays this model s calibration and validation results for wheat and barley the densest crops in the cropping pattern according to the results the plant model was appropriately calibrated and thus can estimate the daily water demand of crops in the cropping pattern with reasonable accuracy the calibration and validation results of the aquacrop model in this study seem acceptable compared to the results reported in the literature the maximum kc values for each crop considered in the model calibration were 1 15 for wheat and barley 1 1 for sugar beet 1 2 for alfalfa and 1 05 for safflower allen et al 2005 after evaluating the calibration and validation results and ensuring the plant model s proper performance the crop s net daily water demand in the cropping pattern was calculated by the aquacrop model table 6 shows the results for the 26 crop ranges during the crop season next the gross water demand for each crop was calculated using the water applied efficiency taking into account the ratio of areas covered by different irrigation systems finally each off take s agricultural water demand was determined considering each plant s under cultivation area in the cropping pattern note in net irrigation requirement mm ig gross irrigation requirement mm 4 discussion two water shortage scenarios of 15 and 30 with occurrence probability of 41 and 24 respectively based on daily measurements in field studies were also included to investigate how the developed modified cmpc responded this section discusses i the results of applying the automatic control system to improve the sw distribution process and ii the results of quantifying crop yield variation in water shortage conditions before and after the automation 4 1 automatic operating system s performance the potential of the modified configuration of cmpc was simulated under normal and water shortage operational scenarios the simulation results are presented in table 7 in the form of the adequacy of water distribution comparing these results with those in table 6 on the current status of water distribution indicates the high efficiency of the automatic control system in the practical adequate and steady distribution of surface water among sius the notable point is the high capability of cmpc in severe water shortages so that the adequacy index becomes reasonable in the entire off takes and not only the upstream ones under a severe water shortage scenario the water distribution process 25 37 less than the water demand reliably occurred it is worth noting that the typical procedure in operational performance appraisal of a water distribution system in irrigation canals refers to the adequacy equity dependability or efficiency of delivered water through the off takes located along the canal in the present study three ranges of reliability including reliable r semi reliable sr and unreliable ur were defined for the hydrodynamic simulation model based on the combination of the equity and dependability indicators the combination was defined so that i the operation is reliable when average daily equity and dependability indicators become good ii the operation becomes semi reliable if one of the indicators is not good and iii the operating system is unreliable under the conditions that both of the indicators are not good the indicators classification formulas and details are presented barkhordari et al 2020 the main reason for employing the combination of the equity and dependability indicators in the present study was to propose a meaningful measure from practical viewpoints and a new perspective fulfilling the operational objectives in water shortage conditions however calculating and reporting the mentioned indicators individually was limited to the normal operational scenarios moreover the application of the indicators individually will not be beneficial for proper water allocation in irrigation districts with the conjunctive surface groundwater operation systems fig 5 shows water distribution within the suis within the irrigation district by providing a regionalization map of sw distribution to demonstrate the achievements fulfilled by the automation accordingly fig 5 displays the spatial scattering of the average adequacy indicator of sw distribution before and after automation under normal a d moderate water shortage b e and severe harsh water shortage c f scenarios awdds performance appraisal indicators tables 3 4 constituted the zoning map using the idw tool in arc gis figs 5d 5e and 5 f show the effect of automation on the fair distribution of water between sius from upstream to downstream of the study area similarly according to the above results unlike the conventional water distribution system upstream control in which only upstream regions were more appropriately operated the automatic control system fairly distributed sw among sius ensuring the reliable distribution of water demand even in water shortage scenarios by the sw distribution system guaranteed reduced water extraction from wells by farmers the results of spatial zoning for the adequacy of sw distribution can be used for a couple of practical purposes such as quantifying reduced water extraction from the aquifer and determining energy saving 4 2 quantifying crops yield variation in water shortage conditions before after automation the developed configuration of cmpc in the present study employed the yield crop alterationas a decision support system to prioritize sw distribution between the sius the details and how the cmpc implements this prioritization was discussed earlier in eq 11 two main assumptions in the present study included 1 any awdds s inflow variation directly influences the sw distribution in the canal and consequently diminishes the supplied irrigation water at the farm scale in the real world this assumption is violated since the farmers compensate for any water shortages supplied from sw resources by extracting water from the aquifer however to investigate the impact of automation projects in dealing with purposeful issues considering this assumption is inevitable furthermore 2 the sole variable that s crop yield production is just the supplied water and other agricultural inputs and conditions are considered fixed therefore considering the assumptions the first attempt to develop the developed cmpc configuration of the present study was to create a database that included crop yield variation for individual sius of the test case under the water shortage conditions the aqua crop model was performed more than 1200 iterations to create this database prioritizing water delivery possible for the cmpc fig 6 shows a sample of this database that included the calculated average yield reduction pattern for the cropping pattern of the test case it is worth noting that the crop yield value was calculated based on the weighting average considering the ratio of the cultivated area of each crop in an sui the surface plot in fig 6 shows the magnitude of crop yield production for each sius and under the different ranges of sw inflow alteration it is worth noting that significant variations in the yield reduction among the 26 sius under the same water condition are due to different arrangements of the cultivated crops although the cropping pattern was constant within the sius the cultivated area percentage differed leading to variate yield reduction values under each surface water inflow reduction scenario in other words in an operational scenario an individual crop s yield reduction is a constant value throughout the irrigation district but the cropping pattern s yield reduction would be different for the sius based on the ratio of the cultivated area of each crop in an sui fig 7 reveals the impact of upgrading the cmpc by prioritizing the water distribution within the sius based on the crop yield reduction minimization within the irrigation district the direct impact of the developed intelligent operating model on the single crop wheat barley alfalfa sugarbeet and sunflower and the cropping pattern total were analyzed under the different water shortage scenarios 5 30 according to the results the modified configuration of the cmpc reasonably handled the water shortage scenarios of 5 10 15 and 20 since the yield reduction of the cropping pattern total was kept below the 5 yield reduction however a closer examination revealed that 1 by reducing 5 and 10 of daily canal inflow in the first and second operational scenarios the calculated ratio of total yield reduction of the cropping pattern at the end of the season led to 0 59 and 2 27 the status quo these mentioned figures were reduced to zero after the automation due to reducing a significant amount of water losses in the manual operating system of awdds in the status quo therefore upgrading the current operating system reduces water losses within the awdds and the preserved water fulfilled the agricultural demands in the first and second operational scenarios accordingly the role of the developed configuration in minimizing the crop yield reduction appeared in the moderate and harsh operational scenarios of 15 30 the minimum values achieved by the developed configuration of the cmpc were 1 32 3 34 8 39 and 11 45 for the water shortage scenarios of 15 20 25 and 30 respectively 2 the developed configuration impacted reducing the consequence of water shortages hazard showing up in the harshest scenarios i e 30 the slope of the yield reduction trend in severe water shortage conditions has been significantly reduced by employing intelligent operations in this scenario comparison of the crop yield reduction in the status quo and after automation showed an increase of 8 3 13 3 8 2 12 5 and 8 3 production in wheat alfalfa safflower sugarbeet and the total cropping pattern this shows that upgrading the operating system of awdds significantly reduced the consequence of severe water shortages drought hazards and vulnerability of the distribution system a comprehensive appraisal was conducted considering technical economic agricultural social and environmental aspects of employing the modified configuration of the cmpc and presented in table 8 to provide a clear judgment about the controller s performance in addition different operating systems developed for the test case of the present study were compared regarding the following aspects environmental perspective according to the results given in table 8 the effectiveness of the modified cmpc s perspective on the groundwater overexploitation from the aquifer of the study area was reasonable so that 13 39 and 9 21 reductions achieved after the automation in other words upgrading awdds performance in sw distribution convinced the farmers to shut the tube wells down or decrease pumping working hours due to receiving adequate sw water and the tube wells significant operation and maintenance cost compared to the low surface water price spatial analysis revealed that the automation implementation led to an outstanding 13 28 reduction in groundwater consumption decommissioning 1100 of 2300 authorized tube wells drilled and 16 21 reduction in energy consumption in the area each normal water year economic perspective the developed configuration also adopted economic objectives compared to the other studies presented in table 8 since the primary goal of minimizing the yield reduction has been followed in the present study according to table 8 automation projects generally led to different economic benefits such as i individual profits increasing farmers net revenue table 8 by reducing farmers cost by receiving a reliable cheap sw and reducing the operation and maintenance costs of the tube wells ii public profits conserving the groundwater and energy and reducing carbon emission however the configuration developed in the present study specifically followed increasing agricultural production which led to 1 mitigating the yield reduction in water scarcity so that the yield reduction of 0 05 0 16 0 37 0 61 0 92 1 3 ton ha in the status quo reduced to 0 0 0 0 0 09 0 22 0 55 0 75 ton ha after automation respectively under the 5 10 15 20 25 30 water shortages scenarios 2 economic damages was mitigated by the automation so that 1 41 4 88 11 31 18 79 28 33 39 8 m us economic damage in the status quo reduced to 0 0 0 0 2 75 6 83 16 96 22 99 m us after automation respectively under the 5 10 15 20 25 30 water shortages scenarios social perspective the social achievement of automation ensured equitable sw distribution between the sius regardless of their upstream or downstream location according to table 8 this configuration developed in the present study led to a 15 and 23 improving the sw equitable distribution 5 conclusion for the first time in this study a practical and systematic surface water distributionoperating system was developed to mitigate crop yield reduction under water scarcity this system consists of two integrated components of automatic surface water distribution and crop yield models by identifying critical irrigated regions each day of the irrigation season this controller s configuration prioritizes daily irrigation water distribution under normal and water shortage operational conditions the proposed method enables water authorities to promote the surface water distribution system in practical implementable and step by step planning to mitigate water scarcity impacts on crop production the outstanding achievements resulted for the authorities which enabled them to provide a transparent illustrative and provable image to the farmer s associations local farmers unions investors in the agricultural sector and private companies the lack of a systematic method to evaluate the reaction of farmers to surface water prioritization was among the main limitations of this study the basic assumption in this study was the partial reliable adequate and dependable replacement of conserved water losses due to operational failures within the manual operation in the status quo delivered to farmers to compensate for water shortage hence further studies should be conducted on how farmers help the successful implementation of this improvement strategy it is suggested that by integrating an agro economic model with the conceptual model of this study in addition to this concern the effect of public sector policy making should be further studied by applying supplementary policies such as the reduction of energy subsidies to the

9446,the vulnerability of conventional operational systems in agricultural water distribution systems becomes controversial under successive water shortages accordingly inadequate unfair and unreliable surface water distribution has led to crop yield reduction and economic damage to address these issues a novel configuration of an automated operating system was developed to mitigate crop yield reductions during times of water scarcity using centralized model predictive control cmpc an automatedwater distribution control system was developed in matlab version 2018a and integrated with the aquacrop model to provide an intelligent daily water distribution prioritization within irrigation districts this study also investigated technical and environmental perspectives in enriching the resilience of agricultural water distribution systems influenced by the water shortage periods a controversial irrigation district located in central iran was selected as the test case located in a basin where reported socio economic and environmental concerns are among the highest in iran application of the developed configuration of the cmpc led to 4 1 5 7 5 6 and 7 3 increasing the crop yield under the water shortage scenarios of 15 20 25 and 30 respectively likewise employing the intelligent operation led to the economic benefit of 8 5 11 3 11 9 and 16 8 m us by conserving crop production of 3841 4 5104 8 5367 6 and 7543 0 tons respectively under the scenarios as mentioned above the proposed method enables water authorities to promote the surface water distribution system in practical implementable and step by step planning to increase individual and public profits and environmental achievements by reducing water extraction from tube wells based on the actual water demand potential graphical abstract ga1 keywords automation irrigation district crop yield sustainable agriculture 1 introduction despite substantial investments for developing irrigation districts supplied from surface water sw resources unreliable agricultural water distribution has led to i social conflicts within the farmers society ii economic recession in the rural regions due to significant dependency on the farmer s incomes to the agricultural activities and ii the environmental degradations precisely due to groundwater overexploitation within the irrigation district kamrani et al 2020 regarding these reasons mentioned above modernization renovation and rehabilitation of the many irrigation districts are on the agriculture sector s agenda however these projects have been restricted due to water shortages consecutive droughts climate change impacts and higher priorities for fulfilling industrial and environmental water rights ghazanfari et al 2013 accordingly it is essential to shift from current supply oriented agricultural water management which focuses on developing new water resources to demand driven management aimed at i estimating accurate agricultural water demands in different secondary irrigated units sius and ii reducing water losses within the irrigation district despite advances in water consumption reduction at the farm scale on farm activities resulting from precision agriculture practices lópez urrea et al 2020 wang et al 2016 the water losses in agricultural water operating systems have remained unchanged due to the inefficient unreliable and inflexible operating systems structures and infrastructures of many districts malaterre et al 1998 monem and hashemy 2010 moreover despite improved estimation of water demands by remote sensing techniques and sensor networks han et al 2020 farm scale water conservation has resulted in the expansion of irrigated crops it is worth noting that successful regional scale modernization projects require a proper understanding of the extent and sources of water losses the intrinsic characteristics of the operating systems and approach and the overall potential of the modern agricultural water distribution and delivery systems awdds in terms of the losses reduction and accurate water delivery the current awdds used by many irrigation districts in developing countries require manual daily adjustments of the water level regulator and off take structures i e manual operation according to an appraisal conducted by the united states bureau of reclamation usbr the average amount of water losses within awdds is about 35 of the supplied water based on data analysis over 20 years usbr 2005 investigations into losses at awdds located in an irrigation district in iran indicated that total losses were about 200 of the total evapotranspiration it was also found that while total agricultural water demand is about 1 8 m3 s 1 the inflow to the system is about 5 5 m3 s 1 other studies quantifying water losses in irrigation districts reveal that losses encompass a wide range of total inflow to the main canal for instance portugal s systems have reported losses of almost 50 cunha et al 2019 while those of the wakool irrigation district and southern murray darling basin in australia range from 7 to 10 and 1 8 respectively akbar et al 2013 different water losses in irrigation canals reported in the literature included 35 52 and 64 68 in the lined and unlined irrigation canals in pakistan more than 55 in spain and 41 100 in ethiopia barkhordari et al 2020 accordingly extra delivery happened in the modern scheme due to operational limitations employing the conventional manual operating systems while insufficient delivery occurred because of the infrastructural inabilities analysis of the latest appraisal project conducted by the usbr indicates that approximately 22 of the 35 of awdds losses related to the main channel located in the lugert altus irrigation area were due to operational deviations usbr 2005 barkhordari et al 2020 water losses in awdds can be considerable resulting in significant volumes of water diverted for irrigation purposes never reaching the intended agricultural land end users furthermore the insufficient inequitable and unreliable distribution of sw resources through irrigation canal networks can lead to the over exploitation of aquifers as farmers seek a more reliable water source within irrigation districts such over exploitation has occurred in the middle east north africa the united states china india japan and spain with serious issues related to the sustainability of groundwater resources and with socio environmental problems askari fard et al 2022 accordingly the awdds operational performance improvement has become a top priority for local authorities and water planning managers due to potential negative social economic and environmental effects intelligent systems in awdds operation through automatic control systems are an efficient measure taken to improve the reliability of sw distribution in irrigation districts automated operation schemes are a compelling factor for raising water productivity in agricultural irrigation which have been investigated in previous studies using different management perspectives zafra cabeza et al 2011 tian et al 2017 zhong et al 2020 the management strategies investigated include implementing on demand agricultural water systems in line water storing within the irrigation canals fele et al 2014 hashemy and overloop 2013 guan et al 2011 appropriate operational management for the local water market hashemy et al 2017 and conjunctive operation of sw and groundwater ibrakhimov et al 2018 in this regard centralized automatic control systems cacs are employed to fulfill the advantages of the strategies mentioned above however it should be noted that one of the crucial elements in the reliable and successful operation of awdds is the estimation of actual agricultural water demand at each of the off takes from the distribution canals knowing the exact amount of irrigation water needed at each off take resulted in water conservation due to overestimating the demand and provided a realistic road map for the intelligent systems for accurate water delivery throughout the canal networks crop models should estimate agricultural water demand to fulfill the objective discussed above in most crop models which are the appropriate tools for analyzing crop behaviors in the face of environmental factors the moisture is calculated based on the equilibrium of inflow and outflow in the vicinity of the crop s root aquacrop is one of these models and has been employed in many studies to estimate the irrigation water requirements based on the climate crop and soil characteristics han et al 2020 this crop model has also been used to simulate the actual evapotranspiration under average rainfall and drought conditions nunes et al 2021 crop water use efficiencies jin et al 2020 the economic yield of a crop and agricultural water demands of different crops adeboye et al 2019 the overarching goal of the present study was to develop an innovative operating system for awdds in irrigation districts capable of precise estimation of the agricultural water demands and reliable agricultural water distribution the developed model was tested on an irrigation district in central iran suffering from sw shortage conditions aquacrop s simulation results integrated the crop water productivity model into an automatic operating system to achieve this goal to the best of the authors knowledge intelligent operating systems have never been used simultaneously for demand estimation and automatic operation the method presented here is a prerequisite for the rehabilitation renovation and modernization of surface water irrigation projects the proposed approach works similarly to a water accounting framework for the agricultural water distribution system where precise demand and supply estimations are desperately needed for practical regional water planning the more specific objectives followed in the present study are summarized below 1 to develop and calibrate the aquacrop model for irrigation water demands determination at the individual sius each siu supplied from an off take located in the main canal in the district 2 to design and calibrate the id model to estimate the exact amount of water delivered to the individual siu 3 to design and test the centralized control system for automatic distribution of the water within the siu along with the main canal 4 to integrate the daily siu s irrigation demands objective no 1 and automatic control system objective no 3 and evaluate the potential of the developed innovative operating system in mitigating the cropping pattern yield reduction in a water shortage condition 2 methods and materials 2 1 research methodology the primary components of the present study were included i surface water distribution system simulation model ii automatic control system model and iii crop yield simulation model the integration of these components into a system was explained within the following steps step 1 field study field surveying activities included measurements interviews and brainstorming meetings and two primary data categories were collected the first category were included surveying the sw distribution canal networks and hydraulic structures information on agricultural water rights for each region the second category was related to the required information of the et0 calculator and aquacrop models including the daily weather data from the meteorological station of the varzaneh synoptic station and crops planting specifications step 2 hydraulic operational simulation model this step was included i developing the flow hydraulics simulation model in open canals and ii developing the automatic control system in this component the control model was integrated with the hydraulic model to assess the control command i e the water level regulators adjustments impacts on the hydraulic condition of the canal system step 3 spatial analysis of surface water distribution the appraisal performance indicators were calculated and the arcgis investigated their spatial distribution step 4 crop yield simulation developing and calibrating the aquacrop model for the study area s cropping pattern to calculate the irrigation water demands at the off takes location alongside the main canal of the district this component was integrated with the automatic control system to upgrade the irrigation water demands of each off take located alongside the canal step 5 operational performance appraisal determining the operational technical and agricultural advantages of employing the automated water distribution system to reduce crop production under a severe water shortage scenario 2 2 simulation of awdds operational performance in the status quo the conventional awdds operating systems convey distribute and deliver agricultural water based on daily supplied sw at the canal head source babaei et al 2018 water is accessible through direct extraction from rivers or released water from an upstream reservoir dam under these circumstances the only measure taken is the daily water volume delivered to irrigation districts surface water distribution among sius is planned by determining the adjustments of time and hydraulic structures i e water level regulating and intake structures an expert team conducts planning with several years of experience operating awdds who are adequately familiar with problematic points and social conflicts often between farmers upstream and downstream of the agricultural region the water right of each sius is constant based on agreements in the past decades or centuries or is determined annually based on agreements between the representative of farmers and water distribution system managers most studies have employed a hydraulic simulation model to simulate water distribution through the off take then the awdds operational performance were investigaed by comparing variations of off takes delivered water via agricultural water demand in this regard flow hydraulics simulation models such as sobek epa swmm hec ras canalman and sic or open source academic models such as icss movahedinia et al 2019 azargashb lord et al 2021 malaterre et al 1998 working based on the numerical solution of saint venant equations with different numerical schemes have been used to achieve the desired objective however the high accuracy and reliability of automatic control methods have caused extensive application of simplified analytical models rodriguez et al 2020 horváth et al 2014 liu et al 2012 the numerical models need to be integrated with automatic control systems when more complex objectives than operating an awdds are intended for example reducing the emission of pollutants in a river s water body requires the exact calculation of hydraulic parameters at all points along the flow path horváth et al 2014 zhonghao et al 2019 therefore considering the need to avoid any complexity and the significance of operational fast training the simplified integrator delay id analytical modelwas employed as the hydraulic simulation model in operational water management studies in the id model each open canal reach includes the uniform flow with the characteristic delay time τ and the backwater curve with the characteristic storage level a s these

for the performance evaluation index respectively with values of 0 9 1 0 8 09 and less than 0 8 hassani et al 2019 2 3 daily irrigation water demand estimation the irrigation water requirement calculation was conducted using the aquacrop model version 6 1 the crop growth model this model was initially developed in 2007 by the food and agriculture organization fao division of land and water inherited the combination of simplicity robustness and capabilities the model enables simulation of the irrigation water requirement and yield response of the crops to received water the model is particularly well suited to conditions in which water is a critical limiting factor in crop production owing to the specific ability to employ only a few explicit parameters and mostly intuitive input variables which can be estimated using simple methods the broad applicability of the aquacrop is guaranteed the final crop yield is simulated within four stages each step performs in series and daily time increments as described in the following formulas the four steps are easy to understand thereby ensuring transparency in the modeling approach han et al 2020 8 y x y a y x k y e t x e t a e t x

awdds conventional automatic operating system daily procedure off takes water demands are defined as a predetermined external component for the controller the head gate s sensor measures the canal inflow as the upstream boundary condition each controller in a decentralized configuration regulates its adjacent structure located downstream of canal reaches after water level adjustments the off take structure can be opened for water delivery manually by an operator or automatically by a controller given the single objective nature of decentralized controllers where each controller can only adjust a single structure and adjustments interactions are neglected different centralized control algorithms have been extensively used in automation projects rodriguez et al 2020 the cmpc was used as the automatic operation control system the literature confirms the ability of the cmpc in realizing various operational objectives of agricultural water distribution systems maestre et al 2014 the modified configuration of the cmpc was developed in this study by including the simulated daily agricultural water demands using the aquacrop model in the typical configuration of the cmpc the state

aquacrop model s simulation results in the developed mpc s configuration introduced in the present study the calculated daily irrigation water demands by aquacrop at each siu s off take location were replaced by the traditional water rights accordingly the following modifications were conducted in this configuration as follows 1 the vector q o f f t a k e 1 k in eq 10 was updated daily based on the acuacrop model outputs including the daily off takes demand given in table 2 2 the state variables in the penalty matrix q e j in eq 14 were updated so that the siu s off takes with higher demand based on the cropping pattern s total demand prioritize water delivery it is worth noting that these matrix variables make a wide range of flexible penalties daily updated on the optimization model to provide an ordered water delivery within the main canal in this regard the optimization model s constraints have been changed to variable parameters compared to the standard configuration of the cmpc these constraints originated from structural infrastructural physical and operational restrictions in a water distribution system another constraint called soft constraint was violated by the controller to provide a degree of flexibility for cmpc to correct the error gradually these type of constraints were operational inherent such as deviation from a target level or target band illustrated hashemy et al 2013 the soft constraints create extra penalties on eq 14 s auxiliary variable therefore the primary weighting approach in the standard mpc configuration is employed using the maximum allowed value estimate mave factor fele et al 2014 while this procedure in the modified configuration of the present study was shifted to the siu s daily agricultural water demands priorities specified by the aquacrop model simulation results accordingly the sius with higher demand were supposed to get the higher priorities and the lower penalties consequently as follows 15 q e

city in iran the roodasht north branch rnb main canal depicted in fig 1 and given in table 1 was selected as a test case study according to the data obtained from the operational division of the irrigation district the less than optimal performance of this network results in about 30 40 loss of agricultural water delivered to the conveyance distribution delivery systems therefore groundwater based agriculture has expanded to overcome this problem with the annual extraction of 100 million m3 from nearly 45 000 wells dug for the irrigation network the extraction volume by this irrigation district is nearly equal to 26 of total groundwater extraction within the zayandeh rud basin the rnb canal has a 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes in the test canal taking water for the laterals the current irrigation water scheduling follows a rotational approach where the three components of duration irrigation frequency and delivered discharge are not flexible and arranged by the irrigation district manager the canal operational system follows upstream control including manual adjustment of the off take structures the field visiting and field study conducted during the present study revealed that unreliable and imprecise operational activities have led to inadequate performance of the canal system in surface water operation spatial non uniformity and unfair water distribution between the upstream and downstream users consequently extra water was delivered at the upstream off takes leading to drainage problems and imposing labor costs on the farmers on the other hand the farmers at the canal s middle and tail end suffered from insufficient water delivery another obstacle the canal authorities face was a lack of maintenance guidelines and a reliable database containing records of the maintenance activities these deficits were leading to the deterioration of operational conditions and disorder in annual maintenance where the overall trend in operational efficiency has decreased from 2006 to 2016 despite a significant rise in maintenance cost hassani et al 2019 the aquacrop model s input such as daily weather data soil hydraulic characteristics and crop parameters were collected for the 2016 2017 water year the model s calibration and verification were conducted based on the 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 water years daily weather data including minimum and maximum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were collected from the meteorological station of the varzaneh synoptic station lat 52 62 long 32 4 elv 1450 located adjacent to the roodasht irrigation district tables 2 and 3 give the crop parameters for the cultivated crops in the irrigation district and the soil hydraulic characteristics evapotranspiration was calculated via eto calculator software considering the meteorological parameters given in table 4 based on fao penman monteith in addition other required inputs for the aquacrop model including the crops planting periods were gathered during field visits and individual farmers interviewed another variable needed for computing the agricultural water demands at each off take was the applied efficiency of the irrigation systems at the farm scale including i surface irrigation systems and ii pressurized systems of sprinkler and drip systems the applied efficiency was chosen as 53 6 62 1 and 71 1 for the surface sprinkler and drip system based on the measurement carried out recently in the study area by the local authorities accordingly the irrigation water requirement iwr in two forms of depth and volumes was calculated individually for the sui s off takes the crop specific parameters determine the development of the canopy cover during the growing period in the aquacrop s crop file included the canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc days to emergence senescence and flowering the cgc and cdc control the rate at which the canopy expands and how fast the canopy dies off at the end of the growing season during the crop growing period the canopy cover was measured for the crops separately then cgc and cdc values were calculated based on the initial canopy size at the beginning of the growing period the maximum canopy cover the canopy at the time of the harvesting time and the crops days to emergence days to senescence and days to full maturity it is worth noting that the alfalfa s cgc values have higher values than other crops in table 2 since it has the minimum day to maximum canopy parameter s value 3 results 3 1 performance appraisal of awdds s operation in the status quo the statistical indicators including rmse crm mae were calculated and analyzed to calibrate and validate the flow hydraulics simulation model i e id model analyses were conducted by simulating the 11 month operational period during which the canal s inflow and the off takes delivered discharge in the study were measured accordingly 75 of the period was used for calibration and the rest 25 for validation according to the results mae crm and rmse for the calibration period were 0 87 m3 s 1 0 002 and 0 98 m3 s 1 the corresponding values for the validation period were 1 03 m3 s 1 0 009 and 1 05 m3 s 1 confirming the acceptable accuracy of the model the present performance of the sw distribution system was evaluated under three operational scenarios representing variations of the inlet flow the discharge and volume of water delivered to the sui s off takes were measured daily at the head source to the awdds the measured inflow data revealed that irrigation water was released to the awdds in three intervals of the crop season 29 days from 8 november to 6 december in the water year 2016 22 days from 25 february to 18 march and 55 days from 9 april to 2 june in the water year 2017 evaluating the inflow showed that water cannot be continuously supplied from sw resources due to water scarcity for this reason farmers shifted to groundwater resources as a backup system for supplying the demands the 29 22 and 55 day intervals were then selected as a basis for the operational simulation it is noteworthy that the daily water inflow to the system in the above intervals varied from 129 000 to 1036 000 m3 the developed id model simulated water distribution with the awdds every day in the 29 22 and 55 day intervals the inflow range to the main canal was discretized from a minimum of 0 5 to a maximum of 4 5 cubic meters per second cms with an interval of 0 1 cms to display the water distribution simulation results this discretization allowed the performance evaluation of the operating system in the status quo the water delivery adequacy index evaluated the awdds operational performance in the status quo the water delivery adequacy represents the awdds potential in the adequate and appropriate water distribution to suis located from upstream to downstream of the irrigation district table 5 summarizes agricultural water distribution performance in minimum maximum and average agricultural water adequacy for the sius off takes 1 26 in three simulated intervals the average water adequacy was simulated in all three intervals and the results showed the poor performance of the awdds of the test case based on the results in table 5 in the first interval 29 day interval the average water adequacy of distributing agricultural water upstream midstream and downstream of the irrigation district varied from 28 to 51 18 32 and was less than 20 respectively with decreasing water supplied to the irrigation districts from the sw resources in the other two simulated intervals 22 and 55 day intervals the average water adequacy was less than that in the first interval but with the same trend it is noteworthy that according to eq 7 the optimal water adequacy varied from 80 to 100 the results indicated that the less than optimal performance of awdds in this irrigation district was the main reason for farmers willingness to use groundwater resources the catastrophic result of such conditions was nothing but an increase in critical aquifers in developing countries multiple environmental losses caused by excessive water extracted from groundwater resources and reduced water quality 3 2 estimating the agricultural water demand in irrigated units of the studied district 3 2 1 estimating reference evapotranspiration by eto calculator the reference evapotranspiration rate in the crop year 2016 2017 was calculated from the meteorological data with eto calculator s help fig 2 displays variations of the reference evapotranspiration during the crop year the maximum reference evapotranspiration rates of 7 8 and 7 3 mm day 1 were respectively observed in june and july zoning of the irrigation district in terms of irrigation systems in farms the zoning of the irrigation district was performed to plot the distribution of irrigation systems used on farms three irrigation systems were used on the study area s farms based on field visits fig 3 shows the approximate scattering of these irrigation systems of surface irrigation and pressurized drip and sprinkler systems the approximate distribution in fig 3 was obtained considering the threshold of 60 of farms with a specific irrigation system the scattering of irrigation systems confirmed the less than optimal performance of water distribution so that by increasing the distance upstream sius farmers downstream of the district were more interested in using the pressurized irrigation systems this can be related to the system s inability to distribute timely and equitable irrigation water according to the above discussions and fig 3 the water applied efficiency in farms for calculating the gross agricultural water demand was respectively considered 53 6 62 1 and 71 1 upstream midstream and downstream of the irrigation district 3 2 2 estimating the daily agricultural water demand of crops in the cropping pattern this study s crop model was calibrated and validated by the measured data including the grain yield and biomass fig 4 displays this model s calibration and validation results for wheat and barley the densest crops in the cropping pattern according to the results the plant model was appropriately calibrated and thus can estimate the daily water demand of crops in the cropping pattern with reasonable accuracy the calibration and validation results of the aquacrop model in this study seem acceptable compared to the results reported in the literature the maximum kc values for each crop considered in the model calibration were 1 15 for wheat and barley 1 1 for sugar beet 1 2 for alfalfa and 1 05 for safflower allen et al 2005 after evaluating the calibration and validation results and ensuring the plant model s proper performance the crop s net daily water demand in the cropping pattern was calculated by the aquacrop model table 6 shows the results for the 26 crop ranges during the crop season next the gross water demand for each crop was calculated using the water applied efficiency taking into account the ratio of areas covered by different irrigation systems finally each off take s agricultural water demand was determined considering each plant s under cultivation area in the cropping pattern note in net irrigation requirement mm ig gross irrigation requirement mm 4 discussion two water shortage scenarios of 15 and 30 with occurrence probability of 41 and 24 respectively based on daily measurements in field studies were also included to investigate how the developed modified cmpc responded this section discusses i the results of applying the automatic control system to improve the sw distribution process and ii the results of quantifying crop yield variation in water shortage conditions before and after the automation 4 1 automatic operating system s performance the potential of the modified configuration of cmpc was simulated under normal and water shortage operational scenarios the simulation results are presented in table 7 in the form of the adequacy of water distribution comparing these results with those in table 6 on the current status of water distribution indicates the high efficiency of the automatic control system in the practical adequate and steady distribution of surface water among sius the notable point is the high capability of cmpc in severe water shortages so that the adequacy index becomes reasonable in the entire off takes and not only the upstream ones under a severe water shortage scenario the water distribution process 25 37 less than the water demand reliably occurred it is worth noting that the typical procedure in operational performance appraisal of a water distribution system in irrigation canals refers to the adequacy equity dependability or efficiency of delivered water through the off takes located along the canal in the present study three ranges of reliability including reliable r semi reliable sr and unreliable ur were defined for the hydrodynamic simulation model based on the combination of the equity and dependability indicators the combination was defined so that i the operation is reliable when average daily equity and dependability indicators become good ii the operation becomes semi reliable if one of the indicators is not good and iii the operating system is unreliable under the conditions that both of the indicators are not good the indicators classification formulas and details are presented barkhordari et al 2020 the main reason for employing the combination of the equity and dependability indicators in the present study was to propose a meaningful measure from practical viewpoints and a new perspective fulfilling the operational objectives in water shortage conditions however calculating and reporting the mentioned indicators individually was limited to the normal operational scenarios moreover the application of the indicators individually will not be beneficial for proper water allocation in irrigation districts with the conjunctive surface groundwater operation systems fig 5 shows water distribution within the suis within the irrigation district by providing a regionalization map of sw distribution to demonstrate the achievements fulfilled by the automation accordingly fig 5 displays the spatial scattering of the average adequacy indicator of sw distribution before and after automation under normal a d moderate water shortage b e and severe harsh water shortage c f scenarios awdds performance appraisal indicators tables 3 4 constituted the zoning map using the idw tool in arc gis figs 5d 5e and 5 f show the effect of automation on the fair distribution of water between sius from upstream to downstream of the study area similarly according to the above results unlike the conventional water distribution system upstream control in which only upstream regions were more appropriately operated the automatic control system fairly distributed sw among sius ensuring the reliable distribution of water demand even in water shortage scenarios by the sw distribution system guaranteed reduced water extraction from wells by farmers the results of spatial zoning for the adequacy of sw distribution can be used for a couple of practical purposes such as quantifying reduced water extraction from the aquifer and determining energy saving 4 2 quantifying crops yield variation in water shortage conditions before after automation the developed configuration of cmpc in the present study employed the yield crop alterationas a decision support system to prioritize sw distribution between the sius the details and how the cmpc implements this prioritization was discussed earlier in eq 11 two main assumptions in the present study included 1 any awdds s inflow variation directly influences the sw distribution in the canal and consequently diminishes the supplied irrigation water at the farm scale in the real world this assumption is violated since the farmers compensate for any water shortages supplied from sw resources by extracting water from the aquifer however to investigate the impact of automation projects in dealing with purposeful issues considering this assumption is inevitable furthermore 2 the sole variable that s crop yield production is just the supplied water and other agricultural inputs and conditions are considered fixed therefore considering the assumptions the first attempt to develop the developed cmpc configuration of the present study was to create a database that included crop yield variation for individual sius of the test case under the water shortage conditions the aqua crop model was performed more than 1200 iterations to create this database prioritizing water delivery possible for the cmpc fig 6 shows a sample of this database that included the calculated average yield reduction pattern for the cropping pattern of the test case it is worth noting that the crop yield value was calculated based on the weighting average considering the ratio of the cultivated area of each crop in an sui the surface plot in fig 6 shows the magnitude of crop yield production for each sius and under the different ranges of sw inflow alteration it is worth noting that significant variations in the yield reduction among the 26 sius under the same water condition are due to different arrangements of the cultivated crops although the cropping pattern was constant within the sius the cultivated area percentage differed leading to variate yield reduction values under each surface water inflow reduction scenario in other words in an operational scenario an individual crop s yield reduction is a constant value throughout the irrigation district but the cropping pattern s yield reduction would be different for the sius based on the ratio of the cultivated area of each crop in an sui fig 7 reveals the impact of upgrading the cmpc by prioritizing the water distribution within the sius based on the crop yield reduction minimization within the irrigation district the direct impact of the developed intelligent operating model on the single crop wheat barley alfalfa sugarbeet and sunflower and the cropping pattern total were analyzed under the different water shortage scenarios 5 30 according to the results the modified configuration of the cmpc reasonably handled the water shortage scenarios of 5 10 15 and 20 since the yield reduction of the cropping pattern total was kept below the 5 yield reduction however a closer examination revealed that 1 by reducing 5 and 10 of daily canal inflow in the first and second operational scenarios the calculated ratio of total yield reduction of the cropping pattern at the end of the season led to 0 59 and 2 27 the status quo these mentioned figures were reduced to zero after the automation due to reducing a significant amount of water losses in the manual operating system of awdds in the status quo therefore upgrading the current operating system reduces water losses within the awdds and the preserved water fulfilled the agricultural demands in the first and second operational scenarios accordingly the role of the developed configuration in minimizing the crop yield reduction appeared in the moderate and harsh operational scenarios of 15 30 the minimum values achieved by the developed configuration of the cmpc were 1 32 3 34 8 39 and 11 45 for the water shortage scenarios of 15 20 25 and 30 respectively 2 the developed configuration impacted reducing the consequence of water shortages hazard showing up in the harshest scenarios i e 30 the slope of the yield reduction trend in severe water shortage conditions has been significantly reduced by employing intelligent operations in this scenario comparison of the crop yield reduction in the status quo and after automation showed an increase of 8 3 13 3 8 2 12 5 and 8 3 production in wheat alfalfa safflower sugarbeet and the total cropping pattern this shows that upgrading the operating system of awdds significantly reduced the consequence of severe water shortages drought hazards and vulnerability of the distribution system a comprehensive appraisal was conducted considering technical economic agricultural social and environmental aspects of employing the modified configuration of the cmpc and presented in table 8 to provide a clear judgment about the controller s performance in addition different operating systems developed for the test case of the present study were compared regarding the following aspects environmental perspective according to the results given in table 8 the effectiveness of the modified cmpc s perspective on the groundwater overexploitation from the aquifer of the study area was reasonable so that 13 39 and 9 21 reductions achieved after the automation in other words upgrading awdds performance in sw distribution convinced the farmers to shut the tube wells down or decrease pumping working hours due to receiving adequate sw water and the tube wells significant operation and maintenance cost compared to the low surface water price spatial analysis revealed that the automation implementation led to an outstanding 13 28 reduction in groundwater consumption decommissioning 1100 of 2300 authorized tube wells drilled and 16 21 reduction in energy consumption in the area each normal water year economic perspective the developed configuration also adopted economic objectives compared to the other studies presented in table 8 since the primary goal of minimizing the yield reduction has been followed in the present study according to table 8 automation projects generally led to different economic benefits such as i individual profits increasing farmers net revenue table 8 by reducing farmers cost by receiving a reliable cheap sw and reducing the operation and maintenance costs of the tube wells ii public profits conserving the groundwater and energy and reducing carbon emission however the configuration developed in the present study specifically followed increasing agricultural production which led to 1 mitigating the yield reduction in water scarcity so that the yield reduction of 0 05 0 16 0 37 0 61 0 92 1 3 ton ha in the status quo reduced to 0 0 0 0 0 09 0 22 0 55 0 75 ton ha after automation respectively under the 5 10 15 20 25 30 water shortages scenarios 2 economic damages was mitigated by the automation so that 1 41 4 88 11 31 18 79 28 33 39 8 m us economic damage in the status quo reduced to 0 0 0 0 2 75 6 83 16 96 22 99 m us after automation respectively under the 5 10 15 20 25 30 water shortages scenarios social perspective the social achievement of automation ensured equitable sw distribution between the sius regardless of their upstream or downstream location according to table 8 this configuration developed in the present study led to a 15 and 23 improving the sw equitable distribution 5 conclusion for the first time in this study a practical and systematic surface water distributionoperating system was developed to mitigate crop yield reduction under water scarcity this system consists of two integrated components of automatic surface water distribution and crop yield models by identifying critical irrigated regions each day of the irrigation season this controller s configuration prioritizes daily irrigation water distribution under normal and water shortage operational conditions the proposed method enables water authorities to promote the surface water distribution system in practical implementable and step by step planning to mitigate water scarcity impacts on crop production the outstanding achievements resulted for the authorities which enabled them to provide a transparent illustrative and provable image to the farmer s associations local farmers unions investors in the agricultural sector and private companies the lack of a systematic method to evaluate the reaction of farmers to surface water prioritization was among the main limitations of this study the basic assumption in this study was the partial reliable adequate and dependable replacement of conserved water losses due to operational failures within the manual operation in the status quo delivered to farmers to compensate for water shortage hence further studies should be conducted on how farmers help the successful implementation of this improvement strategy it is suggested that by integrating an agro economic model with the conceptual model of this study in addition to this concern the effect of public sector policy making should be further studied by applying supplementary policies such as the reduction of energy subsidies to the

variability precision irrigation almonds water management 1 introduction spatial heterogeneity of subsurface properties plays a pivotal role in governing plant health de benedetto et al 2013 understanding the role of soil heterogeneity is particularly important for sustaining agricultural production under limited since it may affect the preferential flow through macro pores and cause water and or nutrients flow and transport losses groundwater šimůnek et al 2003 furthermore this aspect is crucial in marginal soils such as the west side of the sacramento valley california usa these marginal soils tend to have higher spatial variability in soil depth profile texture and structure the variability of the soil factors influences the available water holding capacity the fertility and sometimes the salinity and eventually sodicity at the root zone level fulton et al 2011 the heterogeneity of the soil physical and hydraulic properties is translated into greater orchard variability both in terms of canopy growth and crop production kisekka 2021 in order to account for the natural variability of the soils in a parcel of land the implementation of the so called zone irrigation

dynamics of state variables such as soil moisture mainly driven by irrigation water supplies and precipitation can be recognized as a proxy of soil heterogeneity and root activity response detection vereecken et al 2016 despite its critical importance challenges remain in acquiring soil moisture information at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions mainly because their evaluations typically depend on the scale of observation nowadays a number of technologies and tools based on geophysical properties such as electrical conductivity inverse of the electrical resistivity er can provide information on subsurface heterogeneity in terms of soil water flow changes including near surface geophysics remote and proximal sensing approaches using platforms that range from aircraft to unmanned air vehicles among these methods near surface geophysics provides a multidimensional set of investigative methods for monitoring the subsurface dynamics at diverse scales binley et al 2015 in general the spatial range achievable from the available hydrogeophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert helicopter borne frequency domain electromagnetic induction fdem time

method is able to provide ranging from 1 to 10 000 m for the horizontal extent and from 0 1 to 100 m for the depth of investigation thus the choice of the appropriate method is dependent both on the given problem target and on the footprint of the geophysical measurement binley et al 2015 even if most applications only rely on a single geophysical survey at a given time time lapse geophysical surveys have greater capabilities to characterize the soil subsurface flow dynamics blanchy et al 2020 a great compromise in terms of lateral coverage and depth of investigation is delivered by the so called direct current methods based on ert and eri techniques binley 2015 binley and kemna 2005 these techniques applied both in static and in time lapse mode are able to provide accurate information about the soil water spatial heterogeneity due to the flow and storage processes acting at the root zone level making such techniques relevant for soil water plant relationship related applications

current electrodes for each ert dataset were collected using a dipole dipole electrode configuration with a dipole spacing of 0 30 m due to its intrinsic strength in solving er lateral changes samoüelian et al 2005 the high spatial coverage of the adopted ert array permitted us adjusting the numbers of measured levels to reach depths of investigation of about 2 m oldenburg and li 1999 the ert surveys were conducted in time lapse mode within the period july august 2021 table 3 the time lapse approach consists of multiple ert surveys taken at different times during the period of interest e g an irrigation event in particular the electrodes after the initial installation were left in place at each location allowing the time lapse ert measurements to be taken at the same exact position by adopting the following protocol i one ert dataset acquisition was performed before the beginning of the irrigation event early in the morning referred to as t0 in table 3 and ii in addition six ert dataset repetitions were carried out during the irrigation event at different times for the same site location refer to t1 t6 table 3 overall a total of 30 ert datasets were acquired during the study period table 3 in the almond orchard blocks c230 c7 and c6 see table 1 each ert dataset collection lasted about 28 min the electrode galvanic contacts were checked before each ert dataset acquisition showing resistance values lower than 5 k ω ert data processing was performed using the freeware r2 code v 4 02 july 2020 which permits the forwarding inverse solution for two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d current flow in a finite element domain binley 2020 a triangular mesh made of 7016 cells and 13 594 elements was generated using the gmsh software geuzaine and remacle 2009 special attention was paid to the quantification of the measurement and model errors in particular measurements with reciprocity error above 10 were removed and these errors were used as weights in the inversion process in addition several forward models were run for a uniform resistivity value fixed at 100 ω m in order to sort out the preferred discretization domain mesh and evaluating the goodness of the forward model the 2 d data inversions were run both in absolute and in time lapse mode specifically the absolute inverse solution based on a regularised objective function combined with weighted least squares an occam s type solution was applied as defined in binley and kemna 2005 and binley 2015 for identifying the static er distribution at the initial conditions t0 no irrigation table 3 at each site conversely to the absolute inversion that accounted for the static effects on soil er e g from texture the dynamic er changes were calculated by implementing the ratio time lapse inversion following the approach described in vanella et al 2021 as follows 1 d r d t d 0 f σ o h m where dr is the resistance ratio ω dt and d0 ω are the resistance dataset collected at selected time periods t1 t7 and at the initial condition t0 and f σ ohm is the resistance value ω obtained by running the forward model for a fixed er value i e 100 ω m according to eq 1 the ratio time lapse inversion approach permits to recognize the er changes in comparison to the initial condition t0 no irrigation table 3 and thus to provide evidence for wetting or drying soil patterns e g corresponding to a decline increase in er with respect to the reference dataset the reconstruction of the 2 d ert imagery was performed using the paraview software v 5 8 1 2 2 soil plant atmosphere continuum monitoring 2 2 1 micrometeorological data collection and processing an eddy covariance flux tower was installed in the middle of capex ranch almond orchards in order to measure the fast and slow surface energy balance seb fluxes exchanged within the soil plant atmosphere continuum fig 1 specifically the system consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer gill r3 50 li cor usa and an open path fast response infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa which were placed at a height of 10 m above the ground for measuring the carbon co2 and water h2o fluxes and for determining the latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes additional measurements included the use of a four component net radiometer sn 500 ss apogee instruments inc ut usa and three soil heat flux plates hft 3 from radiation energy balance systems in bellevue wa usa for measuring the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g respectively the soil heat flux plates were buried at a depth of 8 cm and coupled with three soil thermocouples tcav l from campbell scientific inc in logan ut usa and soil moisture probes gs 1 meter group inc usa placed at 2 5 cm depth for correcting the heat storage above them eddy pro software v 7 0 6 li cor usa was used for post processing the turbulent flux data which included a full range of standard corrections and adjustments such as the two dimensional rotation the spectral corrections moncrieff et al 1997 and the adjustment for the effects of heat and water vapour density fluctuations webb et al 1980 the footprint and data quality analyses were carried out using the tovi software li cor usa it was found that the energy balance ratio for the study site was 1 67 with an r2 values of 0 88 observed between the mean turbulent fluxes h le and the available energy rn g readers may refer to peddinti and kisekka 2022 for a comprehensive description of the flux tower 2 2 2 soil moisture content measurements neutron probes are generally used for determining the amount of water within a specific volume of soil at different depths these probes work by releasing fast neutrons into the soil where they hit with hydrogen atoms and generating slow neutrons as a result of the collision there is a direct relationship between the soil moisture content swc and the number of slow neutrons in the soil the count of slow neutrons is known as the count rate and the normalized count rate is generated by dividing the count rate measured at each soil depth by the standard count rate measured on the surface before beginning the measurements the ratio of these two readings is known as the count ratio cr the swc was monitored in situ using a neutron probe device cpn 530 neutron probe analytical technologies limited india mounted on a stand which was placed over the neutron probe access tubes located at each study site figs 1and 3 each neutron probe access tube reached a depth of 2 9 m from the soil surface allowing to carry out swc readings at 10 depths of the soil profile 0 20 0 46 0 76 1 07 1 37 1 68 1 98 2 29 2 59 and 2 90 m the swc was analysed in the interval 0 2 to 1 98 m according to the depth of investigation of the ert surveys carried out at the study locations fig 2 the neutron probe readings were acquired according to the ert time scheduling as reported in table 3 the standard count value was recorded before each neutron probe survey all standard count values were taken with the neutron probe sitting on top of its case which rested on bare dry soil as suggested by joint fao iaea 2000 a site specific calibration equation was applied for estimating the soil moisture content as follows 2 swc a cr b where swc is the soil water content expressed in m3 m 3 cr is the count ratio and a and b are fitting parameters varying for different soil types to obtain the volumetric water content independent soil moisture content measurements were conducted in laboratory using the gravimetric method and the bulk density of soil samples collected during the neutron probe access tubes digging at a depth up to 3 6 m with 0 3 m intervals peddinti et al 2020 at the same time neutron count readings were collected the regression equation was then fitted between cr to the volumetric water content to obtain the calibration equation which was then used to determine the real swc eq 2 2 2 3 plant water status measurements stem water potential swp mpa measurements were conducted using a pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara california usa in order to assess plant water stress and to eventually evaluate deviations from the optimal level of irrigation during the ert surveys one leaf for almond tree from 5 and 7 trees at c230 and c6 c7 respectively fig 2 was chosen from the lower shaded canopy and bagged for at least 10 min before it was cut from the tree and placed into the pressure chamber for the swp measurement swp measurements were acquired at several time beginning just prior to irrigation phase and during the irrigation cycle at each study location according to the ert time step reported in table 3 to minimize variability swp readings were made by the same operator immediately after the leaf was cut off the tree as reported by mccutchan and shackel 1992 bagging the leaf eliminates water loss thus the leaf reaches equilibrium with the water conducting system of the adjacent branches and trunk more information about the operation of the pressure chamber for irrigation management in walnut almond and prune can be found in fulton et al 2014 one way analysis of variance anova was carried out on the acquired swp dataset for assessing the differences among the different time steps of dataset collection as reported in table 3 before performing the anova we tested the homogeneity of variances of the swp dataset and we applied the normality test on the basis of shapiro wilk test and quantile quantile plots then a post hoc analysis based on tukey hsd test tukey honest significant differences was performed at significance level p value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 electrical resistivity distribution fig 4 displays the ert imagery for the initial condition no irrigation table 3 at the 5 study site locations as expected the lighter soil type location at c6 9 showed the highest er distribution values in absolute terms with mean and standard error values of 148 19 and 1 01 ω m respectively whereas the lowest er distribution were observed in the heavier soil locations c7 12 and c7 14 showing average and standard error values of 74 51 and 0 51 ω m respectively intermediate er conditions were detected at c230 location sites 1 and 2 with mean and standard error values ranging from 104 76 to 148 19 and from 1 01 to 1 40 ω m respectively the er average and standard error values obtained along the explored soil profiles at the 5 study locations for the initial condition are reported in fig 5 as function of depth specifically some er differences were obtained within the soil profiles at c230 1 and 2 specifically c230 1 presented higher er values until 1 4 m of the soil profile than c230 2 showing average er values of 138 34 and 95 81 ω m respectively and standard error values of 0 54 and 0 77 ω m respectively at the deeper soil layers er values tended to be higher in c230 2 than in c230 1 with average values of 436 85 and 355 66 ω m and standard error values of 6 63 and 3 66 ω m respectively unlike study site c230 analogous er profiles were observed at both study locations 12 and 14 in almond block c7 showing an average standard error of 0 86 ω m overall all 5 study locations showed an er increasing trend with depth though less pronounced at c7 site locations 3 2 time lapse electrical resistivity images the results of the ert time lapse inversions with reference to the no irrigation condition are shown in figs 6 10 the overall er changes that are given in fig 11 were obtained by averaging the er changes values referring to the entire er explored domain at the different time steps after the beginning of the irrigation t1 t6 in table 3 specifically the ert time lapse imagery depicted peculiar spatial distribution in terms of er changes during the different monitoring time steps table 3 at each site location c230 1 2 c7 12 14 and c6 9 at c230 1 negligible er changes 0 26 3 60 were observed at t1 with respect to the initial condition slight er increasing patterns were observed at t2 and t3 corresponding to an overall average increase standard deviation of 0 93 4 84 and 0 42 8 16 in terms of er respectively at the same location localized er decreasing patterns were retrieved at t4 and t5 resulting in an overall er decrease of 0 34 10 73 and 0 74 12 13 respectively as shown in fig 6 the er decreasing patterns were observed until 0 2 0 5 m of the soil depth just under the active drippers see the blue arrows in fig 6 simultaneously er increasing patterns were detected both at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs a different er behavior was observed at c230 2 fig 7 in particular starting from t2 uniform distributed soil wetting patterns decreasing in er were observed along the subsurface of the ert transect these zones corresponded to the propagation of the irrigation wetting fronts showing stable depths of about 0 2 m from the soil surface at t2 and being more starting at t3 until t6 reaching a maximum depth of 0 3 m at the same temporal step er increasing patterns soil drying were retrieved at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs these er increasing patterns tended to be predominant in the investigated subsoil domain resulting in an overall er increase of 2 57 13 71 to 1 73 16 31 from t2 to t4 and from t5 to t6 respectively similarly to c230 1 negligible er changes 0 10 6 02 were detected in c230 2 at t1 corresponding to 47 min after the beginning of the irrigation both study site locations in almond orchard c7 12 and 14 showed a similar dominant behavior mainly characterized by average er increasing from t2 to t6 equal to 2 92 13 60 and 2 16 18 23 of the overall investigated domain respectively figs 8 9 at t1 slight increase in er were observed at both locations resulting in average changes of 0 75 6 38 and 0 16 5 82 respectively it is interesting to note that both c7 12 and c7 14 were characterized by sporadic preferential er decreasing patterns soil wetting that reached the maximum depth of 0 4 m of the soil profile at t4 and t5 respectively in addition 1 2 h after the beginning of the irrigation at t2 and t3 both locations were affected by deeper soil drying patterns until 1 2 m depth of the soil profiles despite the results obtained at the study locations c230 and c7 an evident er decreasing trend was observed in the subsurface of c6 9 during the ert time lapse surveys fig 10 specifically a continuous soil wetting pattern was observed from t1 to t6 resulting in average er reductions ranging from 0 60 4 41 to 10 13 9 31 of the explored domain 3 3 soil plant atmosphere continuum interactions 3 3 1 surface energy balance fluxes the semi hourly seb fluxes monitored at the capex site during the study are shown in fig 12 together with the indication of the ert survey time steps refer to table 3 in general the partitioning of the seb fluxes measured during the ert surveys at the 5 site locations show a typical mediterranean summer trend with higher values observed for the rn component average hourly values observed between 8 a m and 4 p m varied from 529 67 132 17 w m 2 at c230 1 to 477 32 153 98 w m 2 at c7 14 without considering the date referred to c230 2 due to the lack of some measurements during the observation period fig 12 the rn component was followed by the le term with average hourly maximum and minimum values recorded at c6 9 299 99 w m 2 and c7 14 217 72 w m 2 and then by the h and g terms showing the lower values on average 113 62 39 68 w m 2 and 10 82 1 99 w m 2 respectively the mean hourly actual evapotranspiration et measured at the site locations between 8 a m and 4 p m was 0 42 0 11 mm h 1 0 36 0 13 mm h 1 0 43 0 12 mm h 1 0 32 0 07 mm h 1 and 0 45 0 11 mm h 1 for c230 1 c230 2 c7 12 c7 14 and c6 9 respectively 3 3 2 soil moisture content profiles the evolution of the soil moisture content profiles from 0 2 until 1 98 m depth monitored at the study site locations c230 1 c230 1 c7 12 c7 14 e c6 19 during the ert surveys are shown in fig 13 at t0 no irrigation the soil moisture values at c230 1 ranged between 0 20 and 0 35 m3 m 3 as function of depth specifically an abrupt change in soil moisture was observed between the upper part of the soil profile within the interval 0 2 and 0 76 m and the remaining part within the interval 1 07 and 1 98 m in particular the upper part showed greater average and standard deviation values of 0 32 0 03 m3 m 3 than the deeper one with average values of 0 21 m3 m 3 0 01 slight changes were observed in time at c230 1 from t1 to t6 showing soil water reductions of about 7 in the upper part of the soil profile until a depth of 0 5 m ranging from 0 33 to 0 31 m3 m 3 and quite stable lower values 0 23 m3 m 3 in the deeper layers 1 m at c230 2 the soil moisture condition were variable as function of the soil profile depth showing values between 0 17 and 0 45 m3 m 3 before the beginning of the irrigation t0 in particular the upper part of the soil profile until 1 07 m showed higher soil moisture values equal to 0 38 0 07 m3 m 3 and lower values 0 20 0 03 in the deeper layers from 1 37 m until 1 98 m at this study location the soil moisture condition did not considerably differ during the irrigation in comparison to the initial one less than 1 at c7 12 and c7 14 the soil moisture ranged between 0 27 m3 m 3 and 0 39 m3 m 3 and from 0 19 m3 m 3 to 0 35 m3 m 3 at t0 respectively higher values were retrieved at c7 12 at 0 2 m and from 1 07 to 1 37 m depth of the soil profile in average 0 36 0 04 m3 m 3 conversely at the other depths the soil moisture showed similar values in average 0 28 0 01 m3 m 3 in respect to time the soil moisture at c7 12 tended to decrease by 6 and 3 at 0 2 m and at 0 76 m of the soil profile depth after 1 2 h from the irrigation beginning respectively quite stable values with increasing depth of about 1 were observed at 0 46 m and from 1 07 to 1 37 m of the soil profile slight soil moisture increases about 3 were detected at the deeper soil layers from 1 68 to 1 98 m unlike c7 12 the intermediate soil layers of c7 14 showed higher soil moisture values 0 33 0 02 m3 m 3 than the shallower layer at 0 2 m and the deeper layers average equaled to 0 20 0 02 m3 m 3 before the irrigation started at this site during the irrigation event the soil moisture changed with a reduction of about 2 in comparison to the initial condition from the shallower layer until 1 37 m of the soil depth no changes in soil moisture were observed between 1 68 and 1 98 m from the soil surface the lower soil moisture values at t0 were registered at c6 9 with values ranging from 0 12 to 0 20 m3 m 3 that tended to be stable changes 1 during the irrigation phase 3 3 3 plant water status patterns the average swp and standard deviation values ranged from 1 09 0 08 mpa to 1 80 0 17 mpa and from 1 17 0 28 mpa to 1 84 0 17 mpa at c230 1 and c230 2 respectively and from 1 08 0 13 mpa to 1 71 0 18 mpa and from 1 46 0 43 mpa to 2 32 0 41 mpa at c7 12 and c7 14 respectively and from 0 74 0 10 mpa to 1 66 0 17 mpa at c6 9 fig 14 according to the increasing atmospheric demand fig 12 the temporal trend of the swp values observed within the reference period showed a negative pattern at all the study locations c230 1 c230 1 c7 12 c7 14 e c6 19 from t0 to t6 specifically significantly less stressed conditions were identified before the irrigation started t0 see table 3 and more negative swp values were obtained at the end of the ert surveys after about 5 h of irrigation in c230 1 and 6 h at the other site locations site specific swp variations were also observed during the irrigation phase i e from t1 to t3 in c230 1 and from t1 to t5 in c230 2 c7 12 c7 14 and c6 9 in particular even if no differences were retrieved at c230 1 and c230 2 significant differences were obtained at c7 12 and c6 9 between t1 and t5 it is interesting to note that from a qualitative point of view definite clusters were identified between the mean swp and soil moisture neutron probe values observed during the different time steps t1 t5 at the study locations fig 15 specifically the maximum er changes were observed at c6 9 which is characterized by the lighter soil table 1 and the lower water content values fig 13 and less negative swp values fig 14 4 discussion geophysical surveys have been largely applied for imaging the spatial properties of soil that influence crop productivity loke et al 2013 in some cases especially for tree crops the geophysical outputs have been linked to the amount of root biomass al hagrey 2007 rossi et al 2011 and have permitted a way to provide insights about the root water uptake activity mary et al 2018 2019 vanella et al 2018 herein the er sub soil distributions at 5 almond orchard sites characterized by soil heterogeneity were explored in order to unravel differences in soil water dynamics both in absolute and in time lapse terms even if the er measurement and model errors were accounted for the inversion process permitting us to judge the good quality of the forward model against the good quality of the data we cannot exclude the eventual presence of inversion artefacts clément et al 2009 especially below 1 m of the soil profile where the sensitivity was lower e g see supplementary material section different er sub soil distributions in absolute terms have been observed at the different site locations as function of the soil types under study table 1 and table 2 specifically higher and lower er values were observed in the lighter c6 9 and heavier soils c7 12 and c7 14 respectively with intermediate er conditions for sites c230 1 and c230 1 this behavior is typical of the unsaturated soils in which the increase in porosity leads to general increase in the er of a porous medium reynolds 2011 the ert observations were in agreement with the neutron probe measurements that showed lower and greater values for c6 light soil and c7 heavy soil sites respectively fig 13 in addition the ert findings confirmed the goodness of the soil management zones already identified at the capex ranch and the mismatching that existed between the soil unit characterization offered by the soilweb table 1 and table 2 and the detailed information provided by the veris and em38 technologies fulton et al 2011 although the ert technique can be used for stand alone survey time lapse ert surveys have shown great potential for agricultural applications as they enable the observation of the variation of hydrological states that can be related to orchard productivity blanchy et al 2020 changes in er have been linked to the variations of soil moisture distribution alamry et al 2017 or soil pore solution concentration vanella et al 2018 specifically under our 5 study site locations table 1 and table 2 which took place in a non saline environment i e californian central valley the observed er changes can be reasonably linked to the changes in soil moisture specifically at this non saline environment characterized by relatively low ec values of the irrigation water mean ec values of 224 80 μs cm 1 at 20 c observed during the ert surveys it is possible to exclude higher er contrast with the native soil pore solution concentration in this sense we expected that the er changes are mainly due to the differences in soil structure and texture these findings are in accordance with nielson et al 2021 highlighting the role of time lapse ert surveys to infer the soil moisture dynamics as function of the soil structure in addition swc dynamics inferred by time lapse ert surveys were driven by the crop water uptake or et soil drying and the irrigation process soil wetting similar findings were obtained under micro irrigation condition both during the irrigation phase and relative redistribution processes e g ogunmokun and wallach 2021 rahav et al 2017 vanella et al 2021 it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the er changes depended on the initial soil moisture content vanella et al 2021 in fact in our study the greater er decreasing patterns figs 11 and 15 were detected at the lighter soil study site c6 9 that showed the lower initial soil moisture content fig 13 the soil wetting inferred by er changes during the irrigation applications was limited to the 0 40 cm depth interval figs 6 10 which suggests that active root water uptake during the growing season occurred in the shallow soil layer mostly koumanov et al 1997 this evidence suggests also that irrigation infiltration rate was faster than root water uptake at c6 9 fig 15 this hypothesis is supported by the higher hydraulic conductivity values obtained for this soil type table 2 knowledge on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil water status in the root zone during irrigation events is important for efficient water management especially for microirrigated cropping systems koumanov et al 2006 in general quantifying the soil moisture in unsaturated environments is difficult due to the complexity of these systems and problems related to the spatially representativeness of the point based soil moisture measurements schwartz et al 2008 such as the neutron probe method in comparison to plot or field scale methods being the reliability of the obtained swc information valid for specific locations and depths amiri et al 2021 in this study a weak relationship was obtained between the magnitude of the swc changes obtained by the neutron probe measurements and the changes inferred by ert in particular slight soil moisture changes were observed by neutron probe measurements at the 5 study site locations during the monitored irrigation events fig 13 this may be due to the offset positions 0 2 0 4 m of the neutron probe access tubes in respect to the drip irrigation line fig 3 and to the low performance of the method in operating at shallow soil layers which could not be detected by the neutron detector and hence resulting in lower than the usual count rate ratios with consequent low swc visvalingam and tandy 1972 assuming that the sampling volume of a neutron probe has a diameter of approximately 0 3 m this implies that the neutron probe was only sensing a partially wetted volume of soil under micro irrigation condition note that we used existing neutron probe access tubes that are used for irrigation management when the orchard irrigation system is switched to micro sprinklers earlier in the season generally the farmer switches to drip irrigation during fertigation and or when water is limited during the ert survey the farmer had switched to drip irrigation due to limited water supplies caused by the drought experienced that year in california an advantage of using time lapse ert surveys was that they were able to infer the spatially distributed soil moisture changes occurring during the irrigation phases figs 6 10 our results corroborate the importance of using soil moisture based techniques i e ert in order to improve drip irrigation scheduling and design and to avoid water deficits and water and fertilizer losses by drainage andreu et al 1997 simultaneously er increasing patterns were detected both at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs showing non uniform patterns due to the fact that some of the drippers were partially clogged at c230 sites figs 6 7 grey arrows moreover heterogeneity in soil water distribution was assumed by ert in the mostly heavy soils c7 in figs 8 9 these findings agree with the veris maps of bulk soil ec that showed small scale heterogeneities kisekka et al 2021 fulton et al 2011 note also that figs 8 9 indicate that the tree root water uptake at the heavy soil profiles occurred at a faster rate in comparison to the rate at which the irrigation was rewetting the soil this evidence is supported by the high stress conditions depicted by the higher negative swp values observed at c7 sites in comparison to the mild stress condition referred to the light soil profile c6 9 figs 13 and 15 in addition a supporting explanation of the faster root water uptake than the irrigation infiltration rate occurring under c7 sites is suggested by the lower hydraulic conductivities values associated to these soil types table 2 the limitation of the point based soil moisture measurements has been also reflected in the lack of specific relationships observed between these values and the swp measurements even if still some clusters can be identified on the basis of the investigated soil types fig 15 another explanation of this behavior may be related to the different response timing observed between the soil moisture changes and the plant water status responses this response time delay can vary according to depth and water content in the soil profile grossiord et al 2018 at the study sites the hourly temporal evolution of the measured swp values was more influenced by the et demand according to the seb fluxes measured at the capex ranch fig 12 than by the applied irrigation volume specifically at most of the study locations hourly swp differences were maintained constant from 12 p m until 4 p m fig 14 as observed in other almond orchards under drip irrigation in similar semi mediterranean climate espadafor et al 2018 the measurement of swp under midday conditions about 1 3 p m is recommended for almond trees fulton et al 2001 in absolute terms the swp values described different stress levels from mild c6 9 to moderate c230 and high c7 14 at the different study locations mainly as function of the different soil characteristics varying from lighter to heavier soil and almond varieties and rootstocks i e nonpareil peach butte marianna 2624 and monterey peach fig 15 the maximum total soil water depletion i e er increasing patterns were found at the soil surface and under the wetting bulbs figs 6 9 until 1 2 m under the soil surface due to the combination of the evaporation from the soil and root water uptake in the sub soil processes respectively even if the temporal changes of maximum root water uptake patterns are determined by variations in water availability during the seasons koumanov et al 2006 our findings are in accordance with andreu et al 1997 who estimated that about 65 of the total water uptake occurred in the 0 50 cm depth interval and that active roots were absent below 1 m soil depth fig 5 this is shown in fig 5 in which the effect of soil layering and the irrigation fronts mostly reach the 1 m soil depth 5 conclusion spatially and temporally distribution of swc dynamics i e soil drying and wetting patterns have been inferred by time lapse ert surveys conducted during irrigation events under different soil conditions in drip irrigated almond orchards this study represents an attempt to interpreter the swc dynamics inferred from geophysical data taking the advantage of integrating multiple measurements about the soil plant atmosphere continuum system acquired in situ in particular the study highlights the importance of using soil moisture based techniques i e ert to support the irrigation management at the field scale e g for imaging non uniform wetting patterns due to presence of partially clogged drippers moreover it points out the significance of integrating multiple data to overcome the difficulties of controlling the site specific parameters affecting the er behavior under real field conditions e g ec of the irrigation water soil temperature the study puts also in evidence the fact that the interpretation of geophysical data should always be done carefully e g from assuring the data quality to quantifying the adequate weight assignment into the inversion process to providing imagery appraisals the derived er changes were interpreted as proxy for exploring the swc dynamics mainly driven by the soil heterogeneity the major part of the inferred wet bulb infiltration fronts and root water uptake areas were limited to the upper 0 5 m of the soil profile where the root systems are supposed to be these findings help to more accurately estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation leading to more cost effective management of the water resource declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9447,characterizing soil heterogeneity helps to improve the management of the natural resources mainly water nutrients and soil itself at the farm level and enhances crop growth and relative yield sustainability in this context the geophysical monitoring based on direct current methods such as the electrical resistivity tomography ert can help to detect the soil heterogeneity by exploring the soil water variability ert time lapse surveys were carried out in almond orchards characterized by different soil types in terms of structure i e layered light and heavy soil profiles and texture

interpretation of the ert results together with the ancillary data has provided spatially and temporally distributed information about the soil water processes that occurred within the almond root zone during irrigation allowing us to identify where the most root water uptake occurs and the delineation of the irrigation wet bulbs under micro irrigations conditions keywords soil water variability precision irrigation almonds water management 1 introduction spatial heterogeneity of subsurface properties plays a pivotal role in governing plant health de benedetto et al 2013 understanding the role of soil heterogeneity is particularly important for sustaining agricultural production under limited since it may affect the preferential flow through macro pores and cause water and or nutrients flow and transport losses groundwater šimůnek et al 2003 furthermore this aspect is crucial in marginal soils such as the west side of the sacramento valley california usa these marginal soils tend to have higher spatial variability in soil depth profile texture and structure the variability of the soil factors influences the available water holding capacity the fertility and sometimes the salinity and eventually sodicity at the root zone level fulton et al 2011 the heterogeneity of the soil physical and hydraulic properties is translated into greater orchard variability both in terms of canopy growth and crop production kisekka 2021 in order to account for the natural variability of the soils in a parcel of land the implementation of the so called zone irrigation management is needed for helping the growers in the adoption of precision irrigation systems fulton et al 2011 in general several biotic e g roots distribution root water uptake soil organisms and abiotic e g soil structure and soil texture soil aggregation and compaction climatic condition factors contribute to affect the soil heterogeneity vereecken et al 2008 in irrigated agriculture the dynamics of state variables such as soil moisture mainly driven by irrigation water supplies and precipitation can be recognized as a proxy of soil heterogeneity and root activity response detection vereecken et al 2016 despite its critical importance challenges remain in acquiring soil moisture information at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions mainly because their evaluations typically depend on the scale of observation nowadays a number of technologies and tools based on geophysical properties such as electrical conductivity inverse of the electrical resistivity er can provide information on subsurface heterogeneity in terms of soil water flow changes including near surface geophysics remote and proximal sensing approaches using platforms that range from aircraft to unmanned air vehicles among these methods near surface geophysics provides a multidimensional set of investigative methods for monitoring the subsurface dynamics at diverse scales binley et al 2015 in general the spatial range achievable from the available hydrogeophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert helicopter borne frequency domain electromagnetic induction fdem time domain electromagnetic tdem towed ground based transient electromagnetic system ttem ground penetrating radar is variable as function of the horizontal and vertical scales of investigation that each method is able to provide ranging from 1 to 10 000 m for the horizontal extent and from 0 1 to 100 m for the depth of investigation thus the choice of the appropriate method is dependent both on the given problem target and on the footprint of the geophysical measurement binley et al 2015 even if most applications only rely on a single geophysical survey at a given time time lapse geophysical surveys have greater capabilities to characterize the soil subsurface flow dynamics blanchy et al 2020 a great compromise in terms of lateral coverage and depth of investigation is delivered by the so called direct current methods based on ert and eri techniques binley 2015 binley and kemna 2005 these techniques applied both in static and in time lapse mode are able to provide accurate information about the soil water spatial heterogeneity due to the flow and storage processes acting at the root zone level making such techniques relevant for soil water plant relationship related applications cassiani et al 2015 vanella et al 2018 2019 other indirect approaches have linked the crop water stress related phenomena e g identifying the crop vigor and the crop water status for predicting soil heterogeneities information rudolph et al 2015 vereecken et al 2012 however more research is still needed to enhance our ability to link more directly the soil water status with the plant water status response to better address the issue the integration of multiple methodologies for measuring the soil water plant atmosphere system can contribute to offering a more realistic picture of the soil water heterogeneities and their impact on agronomic practices such as precision irrigation management bellvert et al 2021 kisekka et al 2021 the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity characterized by variability in soil structure i e layered light and heavy soil profiles and texture i e prevalently clay loam versus sandy clay loam on root zone soil water dynamics active during irrigation cycles in almond orchards using the ert technique in time lapse mode also in order to link the soil and plant water status conditions multiple ground based measurements i e micro meteorological stem water potential and soil moisture measurements were carried out at the same spatial and temporal scale as the ert surveys 2 methodological approach in order to achieve the above mentioned specific objective the ert technique was applied at 5 sites located in 3 selected almond orchards c230 c6 and c7 in table 1 and fig 1 that belonged to a commercial almond ranch called california almond packers and exporters capex http capexplant com located in the northern part of sacramento valley near corning california usa the descriptions of the applied measurements methods are described in the following paragraphs 2 1 and 2 2 the main site specific soil and plant characteristics of the almond orchards under study are summarized in table 1 the crop information e g rootstock and varieties was provided by the grower specifically nonpareil peach butte marianna 2624 and monterey peach were the varieties and rootstocks under study in almond orchard blocks c230 c6 and c7 respectively table 1 tree spacing among the rows was 4 8 m in block c230 and 3 4 m in blocks c6 and c7 the row spacing was 6 7 m in all almond orchard blocks a first description of the soil information was obtained from the soilweb application developed by the california soil resource lab at uc davis and uc anr in collaboration with the usda natural resources conservation service https casoilresource lawr ucdavis edu gmap detailed information about soil variability was retrieved by consulting the apparent soil electrical conductivity maps generated for the entire ranch using geophysical non intrusive methods such as soil scanning veris technologies salina ks 67401 lund et al 1999 and electromagnetic sensors em38 geonics limited mississauga ontario canada l5t 1c6 mcneill 1992 kisekka et al 2021 fulton et al 2011 fig 1 shown an overview of the study site including the 5 study sites selected for carrying out the ert surveys in the different blocks based on soil management zones heavy layered and light soil identified as above mentioned in table 1 in general these three soil profiles present similar geological origin being characterized by alluvium that has been formed by metamorphic and sedimentary rock formations the term layered soils refers mainly to the tehama silt loam soil with fine silty alluvium the term heavy soil refers to arbuckle fine loamy soils with alluvium then light soils are arbuckle gravelly loam with well drained alluvium the detailed information about the soil profile characteristics in terms of textural and hydraulic conductivity information are given in table 2 irrigation in all the almond orchards was scheduled by the farmer based on stem water potential every week in the period july august with irrigation cycle of about 24 48 h split into 2 applications per week in each almond orchard block irrigation was applied using a drip irrigation line located close to the tree trunks the dripper spacing and the flow rate were 0 9 m and 4 4 l h 1 respectively about 4 and 5 drippers supplied a single almond tree in blocks c230 and c6 c7 locations respectively the applied water was measured weekly with inline flow meters electrical conductivity ec measurements were conducted on 30 water samples 6 samples for site location using a conductivity meter apera instruments llc ai3719 pc60 z columbus ohio usa showed low levels of salinity with average and standard deviation values of 224 80 7 83 μs cm 1 at 20 c 2 1 time lapse electrical resistivity imaging ert technique involves several electrodes to measure the er distribution of the subsurface binley and kemna 2005 in principle a pair of electrodes is adopted for injecting current into the soil and another pair is used for measuring the difference in potential and thus the apparent er a set of 4 electrodes is called quadrupole given multiple combinations of current and potential electrodes along a transect a two dimensional 2 d image of the real er can be reconstructed through solving an inverse modeling problem binley et al 2015 a 2 d arrangement of surface electrodes was set up at the 5 study locations fig 1 specifically each ert array consisted of 80 surface electrodes stainless steel rods of about 0 30 m with diameter of 0 01 m buried for about 1 3 of their length into the soil surface and spaced 0 30 m on the transect each ert transect had a total length of 23 7 m located parallel to the tree rows covering 4 and 7 trees in almond orchard blocks c230 and c6 c7 respectively table 1 and fig 2 a 10 channel syscal pro georesistivimeter iris instruments orleans france was used for the ert dataset acquisition a total of 6006 readings including both direct and reciprocal quadrupoles i e by swapping potential with current electrodes for each ert dataset were collected using a dipole dipole electrode configuration with a dipole spacing of 0 30 m due to its intrinsic strength in solving er lateral changes samoüelian et al 2005 the high spatial coverage of the adopted ert array permitted us adjusting the numbers of measured levels to reach depths of investigation of about 2 m oldenburg and li 1999 the ert surveys were conducted in time lapse mode within the period july august 2021 table 3 the time lapse approach consists of multiple ert surveys taken at different times during the period of interest e g an irrigation event in particular the electrodes after the initial installation were left in place at each location allowing the time lapse ert measurements to be taken at the same exact position by adopting the following protocol i one ert dataset acquisition was performed before the beginning of the irrigation event early in the morning referred to as t0 in table 3 and ii in addition six ert dataset repetitions were carried out during the irrigation event at different times for the same site location refer to t1 t6 table 3 overall a total of 30 ert datasets were acquired during the study period table 3 in the almond orchard blocks c230 c7 and c6 see table 1 each ert dataset collection lasted about 28 min the electrode galvanic contacts were checked before each ert dataset acquisition showing resistance values lower than 5 k ω ert data processing was performed using the freeware r2 code v 4 02 july 2020 which permits the forwarding inverse solution for two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d current flow in a finite element domain binley 2020 a triangular mesh made of 7016 cells and 13 594 elements was generated using the gmsh software geuzaine and remacle 2009 special attention was paid to the quantification of the measurement and model errors in particular measurements with reciprocity error above 10 were removed and these errors were used as weights in the inversion process in addition several forward models were run for a uniform resistivity value fixed at 100 ω m in order to sort out the preferred discretization domain mesh and evaluating the goodness of the forward model the 2 d data inversions were run both in absolute and in time lapse mode specifically the absolute inverse solution based on a regularised objective function combined with weighted least squares an occam s type solution was applied as defined in binley and kemna 2005 and binley 2015 for identifying the static er distribution at the initial conditions t0 no irrigation table 3 at each site conversely to the absolute inversion that accounted for the static effects on soil er e g from texture the dynamic er changes were calculated by implementing the ratio time lapse inversion following the approach described in vanella et al 2021 as follows 1 d r d t d 0 f σ o h m where dr is the resistance ratio ω dt and d0 ω are the resistance dataset collected at selected time periods t1 t7 and at the initial condition t0 and f σ ohm is the resistance value ω obtained by running the forward model for a fixed er value i e 100 ω m according to eq 1 the ratio time lapse inversion approach permits to recognize the er changes in comparison to the initial condition t0 no irrigation table 3 and thus to provide evidence for wetting or drying soil patterns e g corresponding to a decline increase in er with respect to the reference dataset the reconstruction of the 2 d ert imagery was performed using the paraview software v 5 8 1 2 2 soil plant atmosphere continuum monitoring 2 2 1 micrometeorological data collection and processing an eddy covariance flux tower was installed in the middle of capex ranch almond orchards in order to measure the fast and slow surface energy balance seb fluxes exchanged within the soil plant atmosphere continuum fig 1 specifically the system consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer gill r3 50 li cor usa and an open path fast response infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa which were placed at a height of 10 m above the ground for measuring the carbon co2 and water h2o fluxes and for determining the latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes additional measurements included the use of a four component net radiometer sn 500 ss apogee instruments inc ut usa and three soil heat flux plates hft 3 from radiation energy balance systems in bellevue wa usa for measuring the net radiation rn and the soil heat flux g respectively the soil heat flux plates were buried at a depth of 8 cm and coupled with three soil thermocouples tcav l from campbell scientific inc in logan ut usa and soil moisture probes gs 1 meter group inc usa placed at 2 5 cm depth for correcting the heat storage above them eddy pro software v 7 0 6 li cor usa was used for post processing the turbulent flux data which included a full range of standard corrections and adjustments such as the two dimensional rotation the spectral corrections moncrieff et al 1997 and the adjustment for the effects of heat and water vapour density fluctuations webb et al 1980 the footprint and data quality analyses were carried out using the tovi software li cor usa it was found that the energy balance ratio for the study site was 1 67 with an r2 values of 0 88 observed between the mean turbulent fluxes h le and the available energy rn g readers may refer to peddinti and kisekka 2022 for a comprehensive description of the flux tower 2 2 2 soil moisture content measurements neutron probes are generally used for determining the amount of water within a specific volume of soil at different depths these probes work by releasing fast neutrons into the soil where they hit with hydrogen atoms and generating slow neutrons as a result of the collision there is a direct relationship between the soil moisture content swc and the number of slow neutrons in the soil the count of slow neutrons is known as the count rate and the normalized count rate is generated by dividing the count rate measured at each soil depth by the standard count rate measured on the surface before beginning the measurements the ratio of these two readings is known as the count ratio cr the swc was monitored in situ using a neutron probe device cpn 530 neutron probe analytical technologies limited india mounted on a stand which was placed over the neutron probe access tubes located at each study site figs 1and 3 each neutron probe access tube reached a depth of 2 9 m from the soil surface allowing to carry out swc readings at 10 depths of the soil profile 0 20 0 46 0 76 1 07 1 37 1 68 1 98 2 29 2 59 and 2 90 m the swc was analysed in the interval 0 2 to 1 98 m according to the depth of investigation of the ert surveys carried out at the study locations fig 2 the neutron probe readings were acquired according to the ert time scheduling as reported in table 3 the standard count value was recorded before each neutron probe survey all standard count values were taken with the neutron probe sitting on top of its case which rested on bare dry soil as suggested by joint fao iaea 2000 a site specific calibration equation was applied for estimating the soil moisture content as follows 2 swc a cr b where swc is the soil water content expressed in m3 m 3 cr is the count ratio and a and b are fitting parameters varying for different soil types to obtain the volumetric water content independent soil moisture content measurements were conducted in laboratory using the gravimetric method and the bulk density of soil samples collected during the neutron probe access tubes digging at a depth up to 3 6 m with 0 3 m intervals peddinti et al 2020 at the same time neutron count readings were collected the regression equation was then fitted between cr to the volumetric water content to obtain the calibration equation which was then used to determine the real swc eq 2 2 2 3 plant water status measurements stem water potential swp mpa measurements were conducted using a pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara california usa in order to assess plant water stress and to eventually evaluate deviations from the optimal level of irrigation during the ert surveys one leaf for almond tree from 5 and 7 trees at c230 and c6 c7 respectively fig 2 was chosen from the lower shaded canopy and bagged for at least 10 min before it was cut from the tree and placed into the pressure chamber for the swp measurement swp measurements were acquired at several time beginning just prior to irrigation phase and during the irrigation cycle at each study location according to the ert time step reported in table 3 to minimize variability swp readings were made by the same operator immediately after the leaf was cut off the tree as reported by mccutchan and shackel 1992 bagging the leaf eliminates water loss thus the leaf reaches equilibrium with the water conducting system of the adjacent branches and trunk more information about the operation of the pressure chamber for irrigation management in walnut almond and prune can be found in fulton et al 2014 one way analysis of variance anova was carried out on the acquired swp dataset for assessing the differences among the different time steps of dataset collection as reported in table 3 before performing the anova we tested the homogeneity of variances of the swp dataset and we applied the normality test on the basis of shapiro wilk test and quantile quantile plots then a post hoc analysis based on tukey hsd test tukey honest significant differences was performed at significance level p value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 electrical resistivity distribution fig 4 displays the ert imagery for the initial condition no irrigation table 3 at the 5 study site locations as expected the lighter soil type location at c6 9 showed the highest er distribution values in absolute terms with mean and standard error values of 148 19 and 1 01 ω m respectively whereas the lowest er distribution were observed in the heavier soil locations c7 12 and c7 14 showing average and standard error values of 74 51 and 0 51 ω m respectively intermediate er conditions were detected at c230 location sites 1 and 2 with mean and standard error values ranging from 104 76 to 148 19 and from 1 01 to 1 40 ω m respectively the er average and standard error values obtained along the explored soil profiles at the 5 study locations for the initial condition are reported in fig 5 as function of depth specifically some er differences were obtained within the soil profiles at c230 1 and 2 specifically c230 1 presented higher er values until 1 4 m of the soil profile than c230 2 showing average er values of 138 34 and 95 81 ω m respectively and standard error values of 0 54 and 0 77 ω m respectively at the deeper soil layers er values tended to be higher in c230 2 than in c230 1 with average values of 436 85 and 355 66 ω m and standard error values of 6 63 and 3 66 ω m respectively unlike study site c230 analogous er profiles were observed at both study locations 12 and 14 in almond block c7 showing an average standard error of 0 86 ω m overall all 5 study locations showed an er increasing trend with depth though less pronounced at c7 site locations 3 2 time lapse electrical resistivity images the results of the ert time lapse inversions with reference to the no irrigation condition are shown in figs 6 10 the overall er changes that are given in fig 11 were obtained by averaging the er changes values referring to the entire er explored domain at the different time steps after the beginning of the irrigation t1 t6 in table 3 specifically the ert time lapse imagery depicted peculiar spatial distribution in terms of er changes during the different monitoring time steps table 3 at each site location c230 1 2 c7 12 14 and c6 9 at c230 1 negligible er changes 0 26 3 60 were observed at t1 with respect to the initial condition slight er increasing patterns were observed at t2 and t3 corresponding to an overall average increase standard deviation of 0 93 4 84 and 0 42 8 16 in terms of er respectively at the same location localized er decreasing patterns were retrieved at t4 and t5 resulting in an overall er decrease of 0 34 10 73 and 0 74 12 13 respectively as shown in fig 6 the er decreasing patterns were observed until 0 2 0 5 m of the soil depth just under the active drippers see the blue arrows in fig 6 simultaneously er increasing patterns were detected both at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs a different er behavior was observed at c230 2 fig 7 in particular starting from t2 uniform distributed soil wetting patterns decreasing in er were observed along the subsurface of the ert transect these zones corresponded to the propagation of the irrigation wetting fronts showing stable depths of about 0 2 m from the soil surface at t2 and being more starting at t3 until t6 reaching a maximum depth of 0 3 m at the same temporal step er increasing patterns soil drying were retrieved at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs these er increasing patterns tended to be predominant in the investigated subsoil domain resulting in an overall er increase of 2 57 13 71 to 1 73 16 31 from t2 to t4 and from t5 to t6 respectively similarly to c230 1 negligible er changes 0 10 6 02 were detected in c230 2 at t1 corresponding to 47 min after the beginning of the irrigation both study site locations in almond orchard c7 12 and 14 showed a similar dominant behavior mainly characterized by average er increasing from t2 to t6 equal to 2 92 13 60 and 2 16 18 23 of the overall investigated domain respectively figs 8 9 at t1 slight increase in er were observed at both locations resulting in average changes of 0 75 6 38 and 0 16 5 82 respectively it is interesting to note that both c7 12 and c7 14 were characterized by sporadic preferential er decreasing patterns soil wetting that reached the maximum depth of 0 4 m of the soil profile at t4 and t5 respectively in addition 1 2 h after the beginning of the irrigation at t2 and t3 both locations were affected by deeper soil drying patterns until 1 2 m depth of the soil profiles despite the results obtained at the study locations c230 and c7 an evident er decreasing trend was observed in the subsurface of c6 9 during the ert time lapse surveys fig 10 specifically a continuous soil wetting pattern was observed from t1 to t6 resulting in average er reductions ranging from 0 60 4 41 to 10 13 9 31 of the explored domain 3 3 soil plant atmosphere continuum interactions 3 3 1 surface energy balance fluxes the semi hourly seb fluxes monitored at the capex site during the study are shown in fig 12 together with the indication of the ert survey time steps refer to table 3 in general the partitioning of the seb fluxes measured during the ert surveys at the 5 site locations show a typical mediterranean summer trend with higher values observed for the rn component average hourly values observed between 8 a m and 4 p m varied from 529 67 132 17 w m 2 at c230 1 to 477 32 153 98 w m 2 at c7 14 without considering the date referred to c230 2 due to the lack of some measurements during the observation period fig 12 the rn component was followed by the le term with average hourly maximum and minimum values recorded at c6 9 299 99 w m 2 and c7 14 217 72 w m 2 and then by the h and g terms showing the lower values on average 113 62 39 68 w m 2 and 10 82 1 99 w m 2 respectively the mean hourly actual evapotranspiration et measured at the site locations between 8 a m and 4 p m was 0 42 0 11 mm h 1 0 36 0 13 mm h 1 0 43 0 12 mm h 1 0 32 0 07 mm h 1 and 0 45 0 11 mm h 1 for c230 1 c230 2 c7 12 c7 14 and c6 9 respectively 3 3 2 soil moisture content profiles the evolution of the soil moisture content profiles from 0 2 until 1 98 m depth monitored at the study site locations c230 1 c230 1 c7 12 c7 14 e c6 19 during the ert surveys are shown in fig 13 at t0 no irrigation the soil moisture values at c230 1 ranged between 0 20 and 0 35 m3 m 3 as function of depth specifically an abrupt change in soil moisture was observed between the upper part of the soil profile within the interval 0 2 and 0 76 m and the remaining part within the interval 1 07 and 1 98 m in particular the upper part showed greater average and standard deviation values of 0 32 0 03 m3 m 3 than the deeper one with average values of 0 21 m3 m 3 0 01 slight changes were observed in time at c230 1 from t1 to t6 showing soil water reductions of about 7 in the upper part of the soil profile until a depth of 0 5 m ranging from 0 33 to 0 31 m3 m 3 and quite stable lower values 0 23 m3 m 3 in the deeper layers 1 m at c230 2 the soil moisture condition were variable as function of the soil profile depth showing values between 0 17 and 0 45 m3 m 3 before the beginning of the irrigation t0 in particular the upper part of the soil profile until 1 07 m showed higher soil moisture values equal to 0 38 0 07 m3 m 3 and lower values 0 20 0 03 in the deeper layers from 1 37 m until 1 98 m at this study location the soil moisture condition did not considerably differ during the irrigation in comparison to the initial one less than 1 at c7 12 and c7 14 the soil moisture ranged between 0 27 m3 m 3 and 0 39 m3 m 3 and from 0 19 m3 m 3 to 0 35 m3 m 3 at t0 respectively higher values were retrieved at c7 12 at 0 2 m and from 1 07 to 1 37 m depth of the soil profile in average 0 36 0 04 m3 m 3 conversely at the other depths the soil moisture showed similar values in average 0 28 0 01 m3 m 3 in respect to time the soil moisture at c7 12 tended to decrease by 6 and 3 at 0 2 m and at 0 76 m of the soil profile depth after 1 2 h from the irrigation beginning respectively quite stable values with increasing depth of about 1 were observed at 0 46 m and from 1 07 to 1 37 m of the soil profile slight soil moisture increases about 3 were detected at the deeper soil layers from 1 68 to 1 98 m unlike c7 12 the intermediate soil layers of c7 14 showed higher soil moisture values 0 33 0 02 m3 m 3 than the shallower layer at 0 2 m and the deeper layers average equaled to 0 20 0 02 m3 m 3 before the irrigation started at this site during the irrigation event the soil moisture changed with a reduction of about 2 in comparison to the initial condition from the shallower layer until 1 37 m of the soil depth no changes in soil moisture were observed between 1 68 and 1 98 m from the soil surface the lower soil moisture values at t0 were registered at c6 9 with values ranging from 0 12 to 0 20 m3 m 3 that tended to be stable changes 1 during the irrigation phase 3 3 3 plant water status patterns the average swp and standard deviation values ranged from 1 09 0 08 mpa to 1 80 0 17 mpa and from 1 17 0 28 mpa to 1 84 0 17 mpa at c230 1 and c230 2 respectively and from 1 08 0 13 mpa to 1 71 0 18 mpa and from 1 46 0 43 mpa to 2 32 0 41 mpa at c7 12 and c7 14 respectively and from 0 74 0 10 mpa to 1 66 0 17 mpa at c6 9 fig 14 according to the increasing atmospheric demand fig 12 the temporal trend of the swp values observed within the reference period showed a negative pattern at all the study locations c230 1 c230 1 c7 12 c7 14 e c6 19 from t0 to t6 specifically significantly less stressed conditions were identified before the irrigation started t0 see table 3 and more negative swp values were obtained at the end of the ert surveys after about 5 h of irrigation in c230 1 and 6 h at the other site locations site specific swp variations were also observed during the irrigation phase i e from t1 to t3 in c230 1 and from t1 to t5 in c230 2 c7 12 c7 14 and c6 9 in particular even if no differences were retrieved at c230 1 and c230 2 significant differences were obtained at c7 12 and c6 9 between t1 and t5 it is interesting to note that from a qualitative point of view definite clusters were identified between the mean swp and soil moisture neutron probe values observed during the different time steps t1 t5 at the study locations fig 15 specifically the maximum er changes were observed at c6 9 which is characterized by the lighter soil table 1 and the lower water content values fig 13 and less negative swp values fig 14 4 discussion geophysical surveys have been largely applied for imaging the spatial properties of soil that influence crop productivity loke et al 2013 in some cases especially for tree crops the geophysical outputs have been linked to the amount of root biomass al hagrey 2007 rossi et al 2011 and have permitted a way to provide insights about the root water uptake activity mary et al 2018 2019 vanella et al 2018 herein the er sub soil distributions at 5 almond orchard sites characterized by soil heterogeneity were explored in order to unravel differences in soil water dynamics both in absolute and in time lapse terms even if the er measurement and model errors were accounted for the inversion process permitting us to judge the good quality of the forward model against the good quality of the data we cannot exclude the eventual presence of inversion artefacts clément et al 2009 especially below 1 m of the soil profile where the sensitivity was lower e g see supplementary material section different er sub soil distributions in absolute terms have been observed at the different site locations as function of the soil types under study table 1 and table 2 specifically higher and lower er values were observed in the lighter c6 9 and heavier soils c7 12 and c7 14 respectively with intermediate er conditions for sites c230 1 and c230 1 this behavior is typical of the unsaturated soils in which the increase in porosity leads to general increase in the er of a porous medium reynolds 2011 the ert observations were in agreement with the neutron probe measurements that showed lower and greater values for c6 light soil and c7 heavy soil sites respectively fig 13 in addition the ert findings confirmed the goodness of the soil management zones already identified at the capex ranch and the mismatching that existed between the soil unit characterization offered by the soilweb table 1 and table 2 and the detailed information provided by the veris and em38 technologies fulton et al 2011 although the ert technique can be used for stand alone survey time lapse ert surveys have shown great potential for agricultural applications as they enable the observation of the variation of hydrological states that can be related to orchard productivity blanchy et al 2020 changes in er have been linked to the variations of soil moisture distribution alamry et al 2017 or soil pore solution concentration vanella et al 2018 specifically under our 5 study site locations table 1 and table 2 which took place in a non saline environment i e californian central valley the observed er changes can be reasonably linked to the changes in soil moisture specifically at this non saline environment characterized by relatively low ec values of the irrigation water mean ec values of 224 80 μs cm 1 at 20 c observed during the ert surveys it is possible to exclude higher er contrast with the native soil pore solution concentration in this sense we expected that the er changes are mainly due to the differences in soil structure and texture these findings are in accordance with nielson et al 2021 highlighting the role of time lapse ert surveys to infer the soil moisture dynamics as function of the soil structure in addition swc dynamics inferred by time lapse ert surveys were driven by the crop water uptake or et soil drying and the irrigation process soil wetting similar findings were obtained under micro irrigation condition both during the irrigation phase and relative redistribution processes e g ogunmokun and wallach 2021 rahav et al 2017 vanella et al 2021 it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the er changes depended on the initial soil moisture content vanella et al 2021 in fact in our study the greater er decreasing patterns figs 11 and 15 were detected at the lighter soil study site c6 9 that showed the lower initial soil moisture content fig 13 the soil wetting inferred by er changes during the irrigation applications was limited to the 0 40 cm depth interval figs 6 10 which suggests that active root water uptake during the growing season occurred in the shallow soil layer mostly koumanov et al 1997 this evidence suggests also that irrigation infiltration rate was faster than root water uptake at c6 9 fig 15 this hypothesis is supported by the higher hydraulic conductivity values obtained for this soil type table 2 knowledge on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil water status in the root zone during irrigation events is important for efficient water management especially for microirrigated cropping systems koumanov et al 2006 in general quantifying the soil moisture in unsaturated environments is difficult due to the complexity of these systems and problems related to the spatially representativeness of the point based soil moisture measurements schwartz et al 2008 such as the neutron probe method in comparison to plot or field scale methods being the reliability of the obtained swc information valid for specific locations and depths amiri et al 2021 in this study a weak relationship was obtained between the magnitude of the swc changes obtained by the neutron probe measurements and the changes inferred by ert in particular slight soil moisture changes were observed by neutron probe measurements at the 5 study site locations during the monitored irrigation events fig 13 this may be due to the offset positions 0 2 0 4 m of the neutron probe access tubes in respect to the drip irrigation line fig 3 and to the low performance of the method in operating at shallow soil layers which could not be detected by the neutron detector and hence resulting in lower than the usual count rate ratios with consequent low swc visvalingam and tandy 1972 assuming that the sampling volume of a neutron probe has a diameter of approximately 0 3 m this implies that the neutron probe was only sensing a partially wetted volume of soil under micro irrigation condition note that we used existing neutron probe access tubes that are used for irrigation management when the orchard irrigation system is switched to micro sprinklers earlier in the season generally the farmer switches to drip irrigation during fertigation and or when water is limited during the ert survey the farmer had switched to drip irrigation due to limited water supplies caused by the drought experienced that year in california an advantage of using time lapse ert surveys was that they were able to infer the spatially distributed soil moisture changes occurring during the irrigation phases figs 6 10 our results corroborate the importance of using soil moisture based techniques i e ert in order to improve drip irrigation scheduling and design and to avoid water deficits and water and fertilizer losses by drainage andreu et al 1997 simultaneously er increasing patterns were detected both at the soil surface and under the wet bulbs showing non uniform patterns due to the fact that some of the drippers were partially clogged at c230 sites figs 6 7 grey arrows moreover heterogeneity in soil water distribution was assumed by ert in the mostly heavy soils c7 in figs 8 9 these findings agree with the veris maps of bulk soil ec that showed small scale heterogeneities kisekka et al 2021 fulton et al 2011 note also that figs 8 9 indicate that the tree root water uptake at the heavy soil profiles occurred at a faster rate in comparison to the rate at which the irrigation was rewetting the soil this evidence is supported by the high stress conditions depicted by the higher negative swp values observed at c7 sites in comparison to the mild stress condition referred to the light soil profile c6 9 figs 13 and 15 in addition a supporting explanation of the faster root water uptake than the irrigation infiltration rate occurring under c7 sites is suggested by the lower hydraulic conductivities values associated to these soil types table 2 the limitation of the point based soil moisture measurements has been also reflected in the lack of specific relationships observed between these values and the swp measurements even if still some clusters can be identified on the basis of the investigated soil types fig 15 another explanation of this behavior may be related to the different response timing observed between the soil moisture changes and the plant water status responses this response time delay can vary according to depth and water content in the soil profile grossiord et al 2018 at the study sites the hourly temporal evolution of the measured swp values was more influenced by the et demand according to the seb fluxes measured at the capex ranch fig 12 than by the applied irrigation volume specifically at most of the study locations hourly swp differences were maintained constant from 12 p m until 4 p m fig 14 as observed in other almond orchards under drip irrigation in similar semi mediterranean climate espadafor et al 2018 the measurement of swp under midday conditions about 1 3 p m is recommended for almond trees fulton et al 2001 in absolute terms the swp values described different stress levels from mild c6 9 to moderate c230 and high c7 14 at the different study locations mainly as function of the different soil characteristics varying from lighter to heavier soil and almond varieties and rootstocks i e nonpareil peach butte marianna 2624 and monterey peach fig 15 the maximum total soil water depletion i e er increasing patterns were found at the soil surface and under the wetting bulbs figs 6 9 until 1 2 m under the soil surface due to the combination of the evaporation from the soil and root water uptake in the sub soil processes respectively even if the temporal changes of maximum root water uptake patterns are determined by variations in water availability during the seasons koumanov et al 2006 our findings are in accordance with andreu et al 1997 who estimated that about 65 of the total water uptake occurred in the 0 50 cm depth interval and that active roots were absent below 1 m soil depth fig 5 this is shown in fig 5 in which the effect of soil layering and the irrigation fronts mostly reach the 1 m soil depth 5 conclusion spatially and temporally distribution of swc dynamics i e soil drying and wetting patterns have been inferred by time lapse ert surveys conducted during irrigation events under different soil conditions in drip irrigated almond orchards this study represents an attempt to interpreter the swc dynamics inferred from geophysical data taking the advantage of integrating multiple measurements about the soil plant atmosphere continuum system acquired in situ in particular the study highlights the importance of using soil moisture based techniques i e ert to support the irrigation management at the field scale e g for imaging non uniform wetting patterns due to presence of partially clogged drippers moreover it points out the significance of integrating multiple data to overcome the difficulties of controlling the site specific parameters affecting the er behavior under real field conditions e g ec of the irrigation water soil temperature the study puts also in evidence the fact that the interpretation of geophysical data should always be done carefully e g from assuring the data quality to quantifying the adequate weight assignment into the inversion process to providing imagery appraisals the derived er changes were interpreted as proxy for exploring the swc dynamics mainly driven by the soil heterogeneity the major part of the inferred wet bulb infiltration fronts and root water uptake areas were limited to the upper 0 5 m of the soil profile where the root systems are supposed to be these findings help to more accurately estimate the amount of water needed for

the nutritional quality of forages cp is the most important indicator to evaluate forages quality and higher the cp the higher will be the nutritional quality yang et al 2021 ndf is used to estimate the potential feed intake and higher the ndf the worse the nutritional quality of the forages and the lower the feed intake of livestock whereas the adf is used for the estimation of digestibility and higher the adf the lower will be the nutritional quality of the forages and the lower will be the digestibility in livestock rotger et al 2006 ee includes fats fatty acid esters and fat soluble

compared with the w1 in w1 and w2 during both growth seasons increasing n rate gradually increased cp maximum cp during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w2 followed by n2w2 whereas minimum cp was recorded in n1w1 ndf adf and ee are also important indicators of forages quality if the ndf and adf are lower the nutritional quality of forages will be higher our results suggested that ndf adf and ee at physiological maturity stage were significantly affected by n rates and supplemental irrigation levels during both growth seasons table 5 the interaction between n rates and supplemental irrigation levels on ndf adf and ee during 2015 and the interaction between n rates and supplemental irrigation levels on adf during 2016 growth season was significant ndf and adf were lower during 2015 growth season whereas higher in 2016 growth season ee was higher in 2015 growth season and was lower in 2016 growth season ndf and adf were higher in w1 and lower in w2 whereas ee was lower in w1 and higher in w2 in w1 in 2015 growth season increasing n rate decreased ndf and adf and again increased ndf and adf in n3 in w1 in 2016 growth season increasing n rate decreased ndf and adf in w1 in 2015 growth season increasing n rate increased ee and then decreased it in n3 however in 2016 growth season increasing n rate increased ee in w2 during both growth seasons increasing n rate decreased ndf and adf and increased ee maximum ndf and adf during both growth seasons were recorded in n1w1 and minimum in n3w2 maximum ee during both growth seasons was recorded in n3w2 and minimum in n1w1 our results suggested that n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected the nutritional quality of fodder maize treatment n3w2 has higher nutritional quality compared with the other treatments during both growth seasons 3 7 ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield of fodder maize table 6 the interaction between n rates and supplemental irrigation levels on ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield during both growth seasons were significant the interaction between n rates and supplemental irrigation levels on ear length was significant during 2015 growth season whereas non significant during 2016 growth season ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield were higher during 2015 growth season while lower in 2016 growth season ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield were higher in w2 while lower in w1 in w1 during 2015 growth season increasing n rate increased ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield and then decreased it under n3 however during 2016 growth season increasing n rate gradually increased ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield in w2 during both growth seasons increasing n rate increased ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield maximum ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w2 compared with the other treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation on smc st nh4 n and no3 n in arid and semi arid areas deficit and erratic precipitation can results in lower crops productivity and sometimes complete failure of the crops ali et al 2019a jia et al 2020 in addition imbalance n fertilization can also leads to lower crops productivity and cause environmental pollution su et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021b meng et al 2021 water and n fertilization are an effective way to improve soil fertility water and n use efficiency galloway et al 2008 furthermore optimum irrigation and n fertilization could increase the soil organic matter soil total n and total phosphorus contents thereby improving the soil environment and soil fertility however under excessive irrigation and n fertilization conditions most of n fertilizer applied to the crops is leached in the form of no3 n and making the ground water unfit for human consumptions durani 2016 ali et al 2019a meng et al 2021 xia et al 2021 therefore optimum irrigation and n fertilization are important to improve the productivity of fodder maize smc and st are important for the crops growth and development zhou et al 2012 ali et al 2018 soil water content significantly affects the soil physio chemical properties and plays a key role in nitrification denitrification and soil respiration xu et al 2019 our results suggested that smc was higher and st was lower during 2015 growth season compared with the 2016 the higher smc and lower st during 2015 were attributed to higher precipitation in 2015 compared with the 2016 fig 1 smc was higher and st was lower in w2 compared with the w1 the higher smc in w2 resulted in lower st compared with the w1 our previous research on winter wheat suggested that increasing simulated precipitation and limited irrigation levels improved smc and reduced st ali et al 2018 furthermore increasing irrigation level increases the crop leaf area index and thus reduces the solar radiation at the soil levels which results in lower st ali et al 2019b moreover a more wet soil increases the soil evapotranspiration thus decreasing st ali et al 2019a our results suggested that n rates also significantly affected smc and st during 2015 under w1 increasing n rate increased smc and then decreased it in n3 whereas under w2 increasing n rate gradually increased smc during 2016 increasing n rate gradually increased smc under both supplemental irrigation levels during 2015 under w1 increasing n rate decreased st and then increased it in n3 whereas under w2 increasing n rate decreased st during 2016 increasing n rate decreased st under both supplemental irrigation levels jia et al 2020 reported that under traditional planting pattern and ridge furrow planting pattern increasing n rate decreased the soil water storage however our results suggested that maximum smc and minimum st during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w2 these results needs further study n rates and supplemental irrigation levels also significantly affected nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n and no3 n were higher in w1 compared with the w2 minimum nh4 n was recorded in n3w2 increasing n rate gradually increased no3 n and its minimum values were obtained in n1w2 maximum no3 n during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w1 previous study suggested that increasing n rate could increase no3 n wang et al 2010 jia et al 2021b excessive irrigation could also increase no3 n leaching xing and zhu 2000 no3 n was lower in supplemental irrigation compared with the rain fed irrigation and application of n at a higher rate resulted in maximum no3 n content in peanut crop xia et al 2021 lu et al 2021a suggested that conventional irrigation and n fertilization has higher no3 n leaching compared with the drip fertigation in wheat maize rotation system drip irrigation is an effective strategy to reduce n leaching and mitigate n2o emission whereas furrow irrigation could results in higher n leaching yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 suggested that optimum n fertilization and irrigation could reduce n leaching and improve the grain yield in spring wheat higher precipitation and irrigation could increase n leaching wu et al 2020 zotarelli et al 2008 and the possibility of no3 n leaching is higher when heavy precipitation occurs after irrigation in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions lu et al 2021b however our results suggested that no3 n was lower in w2 compared with the w1 the reason might be that the study area is an arid area and the annual precipitation is just 110 7 mm and in w2 the plants absorbed more no3 n compared with the w1 furthermore our results are consistent with xia et al 2021 and rath et al 2021 that higher n application increased no3 n leaching compared with the lower n application hu et al 2013b suggested that application of urea dropped nh4 n whereas no3 n was higher for a longer period of time therefore optimum irrigation and n fertilization are important to improve the productivity of fodder maize 4 2 effects of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation on ghg emissions cumulative ghg emissions gwp and ghgi ch4 n2o and co2 in atmosphere are the important ghg that result in global warming worldwide and reduction in ghg emissions is a major challenging task to mitigate global warming mosier et al 2006 smith et al 2008 agricultural lands are a main source of n2o and ch4 emissions and accounts for 50 and 43 respectively of global anthropogenic emission ding et al 2017 applications of chemical fertilizers significantly affect the soil quality and production of maize and thus affect the ghg emissions ma et al 2014 excessive application of fertilizers could lead to microbial denitrification n leaching and n2o emission wang et al 2016 kim et al 2008 optimum n fertilization could reduce ghg emissions compared with the no n fertilization trost et al 2016 applying n in split doses half as a basal dose and half top dressing have a significant effect on ghg emissions n use efficiency and grain yield in winter wheat zhang et al 2021 our results suggested that n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected ch4 n2o and co2 emissions cumulative emission of ch4 n2o and co2 gwp and ghgi the soil of the maize field behaved as ch4 sink ch4 uptake at different growth stages and cumulative ch4 uptake was higher during 2015 compared with the 2016 ch4 uptake at different growth stages and cumulative ch4 uptake was higher in w1 compared with the w2 the lower smc and higher st in w1 resulted in higher ch4 uptake and cumulative ch4 uptake previous study suggested that ch4 emission has a positive correlation with soil water content zhang et al 2021 suggesting that higher the soil water content the lower will be ch4 uptake hu et al 2013b also reported that ch4 uptake was negatively correlated with water filled pore spaces and positively with st our results showed that in w1 at sowing sixth leaf stage and tasseling stage increasing n rate increased ch4 uptake and then decreased it under n3 however at dough stage and physiological maturity stage increasing n rate gradually increased ch4 uptake under w2 increasing n rate increased ch4 uptake during both growth seasons maximum ch4 uptake at sowing sixth leaf stage and tasseling stage were recorded in n2w1 and at dough stage and physiological maturity stage in n3w1 followed by n3w2 during both growth seasons linquist et al 2012 suggested that n fertilization affects ch4 emissions in rice field n fertilization in split doses resulted in ch4 uptake in winter wheat zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 also depicted that optimum n application enhanced ch4 uptake however some studies suggested that n fertilization inhibit ch4 uptake and thus indirectly contributes to ghg emissions mosier et al 1991 castro et al 1995 this may be due to climatic conditions in the study areas n2o is formed through nitrification and denitrification of the soil microorganism jiang et al 2016 n fertilization can provide available n to soil microorganisms and thus accelerates nitrification denitrification and mineralization of microorganisms to affect the soil n2o emission wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 irrigation also influences n2o emission trost et al 2014 our results suggested that n2o emission at different growth stages and cumulative emission of n2o was lower in 2015 compared with the 2016 the higher smc and lower st in w2 resulted in lower n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o compared with the w1 previous research suggested that soil water content affects n2o emission silvia and bohannan 2016 zhang et al 2021 depicted that with the increase in soil water content the n2o emission decreased in wheat field our results also showed that in w1 and w2 increasing n rate increased the n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o maximum n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o were recorded in n3w1 nitrogen fertilization can increase no3 n and provides substrate for field soil n2o production linquist et al 2012 the higher n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o in n3w1 may be attributed to higher no3 n zhang et al 2021 also depicted that applying optimized n half as a basal dose and half top dressing reduced nh4 n and no3 n and thus decreased n2o emission in wheat field our results suggested that co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 was higher in w1 compared with the w2 under w1 increasing n rate increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 in 2015 in w2 increasing n rate gradually increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 however in 2016 increasing n rate increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 and then decreased it under n3 maximum co2 emissions and cumulative emission of co2 were recorded in n3w1 n fertilization can increase co2 emission gagnon et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the carbon in n fertilizers is supposed to be emit as co2 zhang et al 2021 co2 emission after n fertilization is associated with soil respiration and stimulation of microbial activity li et al 2020 furthermore excessive n fertilization in wheat field decomposes into water and co2 zhang et al 2017 our result are in line with jia et al 2020 who also depicted that n fertilization under conventional flat planting without plastic mulch and ridge covered with plastic mulch condition enhanced co2 and n2o emissions from maize field strategies for reducing gwp should be focus on nitrogen management to reduce ghg emissions and improve grain yield to reduce ghgi zhang et al 2021 ghgi is the ratio of ghg emissions to grain yield and an indicator of the sustainability of production system shang et al 2011 lyu et al 2019 ghgi could be reduced through n management practices by improving grain yield while reducing ghg emissions mosier et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 reported that applying n into two split doses significantly reduced gwp and ghgi in winter wheat wang et al 2020 suggested that water saving irrigation reduced gwp and ghgi our results suggested that n rates and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected gwp and ghgi table 2 gwp and ghgi were lower during 2015 and were higher in 2016 the lower n2o emission and higher ch4 uptake in 2015 resulted in lower gwp compared with the 2016 furthermore the lower gwp and higher grain yield in 2015 resulted in lower ghgi compared with the 2016 during both years the gwp and ghgi were higher in w1 compared with w2 the higher gwp in w1 was attributed mainly with higher n2o emission compared with the w2 whereas the higher ghgi in w1 was attributed to higher gwp and lower grain yield compared with the w2 maximum gwp and ghgi during both years were recorded in n3w1 compared with the other treatments although the ch4 emission was lower in n3w1 but the n2o emission was significantly higher which resulted in higher gwp as well as ghgi 4 3 effects of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation on nutritional quality and yield of fodder maize n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels affected the forage yield cp ndf adf ee ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield of fodder maize the quality of forage is the most critical factor affecting animal health and production performance studies have shown that if the cp of forages ingested by livestock is less than 7 the microorganisms in the rumen will not be able to effectively decompose the ingested food resulting in livestock weight loss charmley 2001 our results suggested that n rates and supplemental irrigation levels affected the nutritional quality of fodder maize previous research suggested that n fertilization and irrigation significantly affects the growth and development of crops and improves the grain yield jia et al 2020 2021a 2021b su et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021a 2021b in conclusion treatment n3w2 improved the smc forage yield grain yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize as well as reduced ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in an arid region 5 conclusion in conclusion under supplemental irrigation conditions three n application rates had a significant impact on the ghg emissions yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize n fertilization coupled with supplemental irrigation regime greatly mitigated ghg emissions gwp and ghgi n application coupled with supplemental irrigation regimes greatly improved the nutritional quality and yield of fodder maize over two maize growing seasons more soil water content forage yield and grain yield of fodder maize were provided by 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime also greatly improved the nutritional quality of fodder maize by improving cp and ee and reducing ndf and adf in summary our findings suggested that compared with other treatments 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime has a potentiality to ensure nutritional quality and yield while decreasing ghg emissions and warming potential the findings of the experiment are beneficial for improving the yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize and reducing ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in arid regions for a large scale assessment of n fertilization and irrigation impact on ghg emissions and productivity of fodder maize more

9448,deficit and erratic precipitation in arid regions and imbalance nitrogen n fertilization can result in lower yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize the objectives of the experiment were to

nutritional quality of fodder maize the treatments combination comprised of n1w1 n2w1 n3w1 n1w2 n2w2 and n3w2 n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected soil moisture

forage yield grain yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize as well as reduced ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in an arid region keywords arid region greenhouse gas emissions supplemental irrigation levels fodder maize nutritional quality nitrogen fertilization 1 introduction deficit and unpredictable precipitation and improper nutrients management in arid and semi arid regions can inhibit crops growth and development and results in lower yield and quality ren et al 2008 2017 ali et al 2018 su et al 2020 in china dry land accounts for 60 of the cultivated area and the deficit and erratic precipitation and frequent droughts in these regions limit crops yield and quality jia et al 2020 2021a optimum nitrogen n fertilization and irrigation are the main factors affecting crops growth but the excessive application of water and n will not only waste water resources but also cause great harm to the ecological environment ali et al 2019a xu et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021a 2021b meng et al 2021 water deficiency is significantly increasing due to climatic change and higher water use and thus negatively affects the yield of crops spedding et al 2004 irrigation is an important agricultural technique to increase the productivity of crops ali et al 2019a under excessive irrigation condition most of the n fertilizer applied to the crops is leached in the form of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and an optimum irrigation could reduce the risk of no3 n leaching into deeper soil profile meng et al 2021 xia et al 2021 irrigation can maintain sufficient water and meet the roots demand for water ali et al 2019a xu et al 2020 n is important for crops production however excessive use of n fertilizers could reduce n use efficiency and degrading water and soil quality by increasing the concentration of no3 n in groundwater and in topsoil godfray et al 2010 zhu et al 2012 hu et al 2013a godinot et al 2016 depicted that higher yield can be obtained through the application of inorganic fertilizers however 50 of n is lost in the forms of leaching volatilization soil erosion and denitrification and thus negatively affects the biodiversity human health and environment he and zhou 2016 ma et al 2014 application of chemical fertilizers affects soil quality and greenhouse gas ghg emissions ma et al 2014 increasing efficiency of n fertilizers and water harvesting strategies could minimize the ecological damages zhang et al 2009 optimized n application and irrigation could enhance the soil water content and n uptake bialczyk and lechowski 1995 zhang et al 2021 suggested that application of n 240 kg n ha 1 half as a basal dose and half top dressing in winter wheat reduced methane ch4 carbon dioxide co2 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions greenhouse gas intensity ghgi and global warming potential gwp and improved the n use efficiency and grain yield therefore optimum n fertilization and irrigation are the most important factors for increasing the yield of fodder maize and reduce ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in china the total ghg emissions from 1990 to 2013 have been increased from 3487 7 to 12550 2 mt co2 eq ding et al 2017 human activities have a major role in ghg emissions and global warming han et al 2019 agriculture is a main source of ghg emissions which is estimated as 10 12 of total anthropogenic 2007 2016 having 70 ch4 90 n2o and 20 co2 emissions luo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 ch4 is produce by methanogenic bacteria and the soil emits ch4 when its production is higher compared with its consumption by methanotrophic bacteria lourenco et al 2019 lan et al 2020 ch4 is an important ghg having 33 times higher relative gwp than co2 over a hundred year time scale ma et al 2020 n2o is also an important trace gas in atmosphere because of its importance for greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2001 n2o emission is increasing approximately at a level of 0 26 year 1 ipcc 2007 agricultural soil contributes to 67 of global anthropogenic n2o emission mosier et al 1998 kroeze et al 1999 nutrients management could reduce n2o and ch4 emissions and ghgi mosier et al 2006 sintim and flury 2017 excessive usage of chemical fertilizers could lead to higher co2 and n2o emissions sun et al 2020 n fertilization directly or indirectly influences nitrification and denitrification and thus affects n2o emission raza et al 2021 n fertilization also inhibits atmospheric ch4 uptake and is dependent on n rates mosier et al 1991 castro et al 1995 irrigation could enhance or reduced ghg emissions liu and greaver 2009 trost et al 2016 n fertilization and irrigation affects n2o emission trost et al 2014 therefore optimum n fertilization and irrigation are important to reduce ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in arid regions the nutritional quality of forage determines the utilization efficiency regulates the digestion and absorption of forage energy intake and nutrient acquisition by livestock and affects the yield and quality of livestock products richman et al 2015 neutral detergent fiber ndf acid detergent fiber adf crude protein content cp and ether extract ee are the commonly used indexes to measure the nutritional quality of forages cp is the most important indicator to evaluate forages quality and higher the cp the higher will be the nutritional quality yang et al 2021 ndf is used to estimate the potential feed intake and higher the ndf the worse the nutritional quality of the forages and the lower the feed intake of livestock whereas the adf is used for the estimation of digestibility and higher the adf the lower will be the nutritional quality of the forages and the lower will be the digestibility in livestock rotger et al 2006 ee includes fats fatty acid esters and fat soluble vitamins and therefore also referred as crude fat ee is also an important indicator of forages quality and animal prefers forages with higher crude fat cp and total phenolics and lower lignin and tannin agetsuma et al 2019 crude fats have more energy per unit dry weight compared with the carbohydrates national research council 1989 thus improving the nutritional quality of fodder maize is important for livestock husbandry previous research suggested that n fertilization and irrigation could improve the yield of various crops ali et al 2019a su et al 2020 xu et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021a 2021b however the effect of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels on the soil physio chemical properties ghg emissions gwp ghgi yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize is limited especially in arid regions due to deficit precipitation 110 7 mm in the study area a large amount of flood irrigation is applied to fodder maize furthermore n is applied at a higher rate 450 kg n ha 1 for fodder maize production in the region the objectives of the experiment were to 1 examine the effect of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels on soil water content soil temperature soil ammonium nitrogen content nh4 n and no3 n 2 to investigate the effect of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels on ghg emissions cumulative ghg emissions gwp and ghgi 3 to study the effect of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels on forage yield yield components grain yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize in an arid region the results of the current

table 3 the interaction between n rates and supplemental irrigation levels on the forage yield was highly significant during both growth seasons the forage yield reached to its maximum at dough stage

irrigation on smc st nh4 n and no3 n in arid and semi arid areas deficit and erratic precipitation can results in lower crops productivity and sometimes complete failure of the crops ali et al 2019a jia et al 2020 in addition imbalance n fertilization can also leads to lower crops productivity and cause environmental pollution su et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021b meng et al 2021 water and n fertilization are an effective way to improve soil fertility water and n use efficiency galloway et al 2008 furthermore optimum irrigation and n fertilization could increase the soil organic matter soil total n and total phosphorus contents thereby improving the soil environment and soil fertility however under excessive irrigation and n fertilization conditions most of n fertilizer applied to the crops is leached in the form of no3 n and making the ground water unfit for human consumptions durani 2016 ali et al 2019a meng et al 2021 xia et al 2021 therefore optimum irrigation and n fertilization are important to improve the productivity of fodder maize smc and st are important for the crops growth and development zhou et al 2012 ali et al 2018 soil water content significantly affects the soil physio chemical properties and plays a key role in nitrification denitrification and soil respiration xu et al 2019 our results suggested that smc was higher and st was lower during 2015 growth season compared with the 2016 the higher smc and lower st during 2015 were attributed to higher precipitation in 2015 compared with the 2016 fig 1 smc was higher and st was lower in w2 compared with the w1 the higher smc in w2 resulted in lower st compared with the w1 our previous research on winter wheat suggested that increasing simulated precipitation and limited irrigation levels improved smc and reduced st ali et al 2018 furthermore increasing irrigation level increases the crop leaf area index and thus reduces the solar radiation at the soil levels which results in lower st ali et al 2019b moreover a more wet soil increases the soil evapotranspiration thus decreasing st ali et al 2019a our results suggested that n rates also significantly affected smc and st during 2015 under w1 increasing n rate increased smc and then decreased it in n3 whereas under w2 increasing n rate gradually increased smc during 2016 increasing n rate gradually increased smc under both supplemental irrigation levels during 2015 under w1 increasing n rate decreased st and then increased it in n3 whereas under w2 increasing n rate decreased st during 2016 increasing n rate decreased st under both supplemental irrigation levels jia et al 2020 reported that under traditional planting pattern and ridge furrow planting pattern increasing n rate decreased the soil water storage however our results suggested that maximum smc and minimum st during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w2 these results needs further study n rates and supplemental irrigation levels also significantly affected nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n and no3 n were higher in w1 compared with the w2 minimum nh4 n was recorded in n3w2 increasing n rate gradually increased no3 n and its minimum values were obtained in n1w2 maximum no3 n during both growth seasons were recorded in n3w1 previous study suggested that increasing n rate could increase no3 n wang et al 2010 jia et al 2021b excessive irrigation could also increase no3 n leaching xing and zhu 2000 no3 n was lower in supplemental irrigation compared with the rain fed irrigation and application of n at a higher rate resulted in maximum no3 n content in peanut crop xia et al 2021 lu et al 2021a suggested that conventional irrigation and n fertilization has higher no3 n leaching compared with the drip fertigation in wheat maize rotation system drip irrigation is an effective strategy to reduce n leaching and mitigate n2o emission whereas furrow irrigation could results in higher n leaching yu et al 2022 li et al 2022 suggested that optimum n fertilization and irrigation could reduce n leaching and improve the grain yield in spring wheat higher precipitation and irrigation could increase n leaching wu et al 2020 zotarelli et al 2008 and the possibility of no3 n leaching is higher when heavy precipitation occurs after irrigation in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions lu et al 2021b however our results suggested that no3 n was lower in w2 compared with the w1 the reason might be that the study area is an arid area and the annual precipitation is just 110 7 mm and in w2 the plants absorbed more no3 n compared with the w1 furthermore our results are consistent with xia et al 2021 and rath et al 2021 that higher n application increased no3 n leaching compared with the lower n application hu et al 2013b suggested that application of urea dropped nh4 n whereas no3 n was higher for a longer period of time therefore optimum irrigation and n fertilization are important to improve the productivity of fodder maize 4 2 effects of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation on ghg emissions cumulative ghg emissions gwp and ghgi ch4 n2o and co2 in atmosphere are the important ghg that result in global warming worldwide and reduction in ghg emissions is a major challenging task to mitigate global warming mosier et al 2006 smith et al 2008 agricultural lands are a main source of n2o and ch4 emissions and accounts for 50 and 43 respectively of global anthropogenic emission ding et al 2017 applications of chemical fertilizers significantly affect the soil quality and production of maize and thus affect the ghg emissions ma et al 2014 excessive application of fertilizers could lead to microbial denitrification n leaching and n2o emission wang et al 2016 kim et al 2008 optimum n fertilization could reduce ghg emissions compared with the no n fertilization trost et al 2016 applying n in split doses half as a basal dose and half top dressing have a significant effect on ghg emissions n use efficiency and grain yield in winter wheat zhang et al 2021 our results suggested that n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected ch4 n2o and co2 emissions cumulative emission of ch4 n2o and co2 gwp and ghgi the soil of the maize field behaved as ch4 sink ch4 uptake at different growth stages and cumulative ch4 uptake was higher during 2015 compared with the 2016 ch4 uptake at different growth stages and cumulative ch4 uptake was higher in w1 compared with the w2 the lower smc and higher st in w1 resulted in higher ch4 uptake and cumulative ch4 uptake previous study suggested that ch4 emission has a positive correlation with soil water content zhang et al 2021 suggesting that higher the soil water content the lower will be ch4 uptake hu et al 2013b also reported that ch4 uptake was negatively correlated with water filled pore spaces and positively with st our results showed that in w1 at sowing sixth leaf stage and tasseling stage increasing n rate increased ch4 uptake and then decreased it under n3 however at dough stage and physiological maturity stage increasing n rate gradually increased ch4 uptake under w2 increasing n rate increased ch4 uptake during both growth seasons maximum ch4 uptake at sowing sixth leaf stage and tasseling stage were recorded in n2w1 and at dough stage and physiological maturity stage in n3w1 followed by n3w2 during both growth seasons linquist et al 2012 suggested that n fertilization affects ch4 emissions in rice field n fertilization in split doses resulted in ch4 uptake in winter wheat zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 also depicted that optimum n application enhanced ch4 uptake however some studies suggested that n fertilization inhibit ch4 uptake and thus indirectly contributes to ghg emissions mosier et al 1991 castro et al 1995 this may be due to climatic conditions in the study areas n2o is formed through nitrification and denitrification of the soil microorganism jiang et al 2016 n fertilization can provide available n to soil microorganisms and thus accelerates nitrification denitrification and mineralization of microorganisms to affect the soil n2o emission wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 irrigation also influences n2o emission trost et al 2014 our results suggested that n2o emission at different growth stages and cumulative emission of n2o was lower in 2015 compared with the 2016 the higher smc and lower st in w2 resulted in lower n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o compared with the w1 previous research suggested that soil water content affects n2o emission silvia and bohannan 2016 zhang et al 2021 depicted that with the increase in soil water content the n2o emission decreased in wheat field our results also showed that in w1 and w2 increasing n rate increased the n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o maximum n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o were recorded in n3w1 nitrogen fertilization can increase no3 n and provides substrate for field soil n2o production linquist et al 2012 the higher n2o emission and cumulative emission of n2o in n3w1 may be attributed to higher no3 n zhang et al 2021 also depicted that applying optimized n half as a basal dose and half top dressing reduced nh4 n and no3 n and thus decreased n2o emission in wheat field our results suggested that co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 was higher in w1 compared with the w2 under w1 increasing n rate increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 in 2015 in w2 increasing n rate gradually increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 however in 2016 increasing n rate increased co2 emission and cumulative emission of co2 and then decreased it under n3 maximum co2 emissions and cumulative emission of co2 were recorded in n3w1 n fertilization can increase co2 emission gagnon et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the carbon in n fertilizers is supposed to be emit as co2 zhang et al 2021 co2 emission after n fertilization is associated with soil respiration and stimulation of microbial activity li et al 2020 furthermore excessive n fertilization in wheat field decomposes into water and co2 zhang et al 2017 our result are in line with jia et al 2020 who also depicted that n fertilization under conventional flat planting without plastic mulch and ridge covered with plastic mulch condition enhanced co2 and n2o emissions from maize field strategies for reducing gwp should be focus on nitrogen management to reduce ghg emissions and improve grain yield to reduce ghgi zhang et al 2021 ghgi is the ratio of ghg emissions to grain yield and an indicator of the sustainability of production system shang et al 2011 lyu et al 2019 ghgi could be reduced through n management practices by improving grain yield while reducing ghg emissions mosier et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 reported that applying n into two split doses significantly reduced gwp and ghgi in winter wheat wang et al 2020 suggested that water saving irrigation reduced gwp and ghgi our results suggested that n rates and supplemental irrigation levels significantly affected gwp and ghgi table 2 gwp and ghgi were lower during 2015 and were higher in 2016 the lower n2o emission and higher ch4 uptake in 2015 resulted in lower gwp compared with the 2016 furthermore the lower gwp and higher grain yield in 2015 resulted in lower ghgi compared with the 2016 during both years the gwp and ghgi were higher in w1 compared with w2 the higher gwp in w1 was attributed mainly with higher n2o emission compared with the w2 whereas the higher ghgi in w1 was attributed to higher gwp and lower grain yield compared with the w2 maximum gwp and ghgi during both years were recorded in n3w1 compared with the other treatments although the ch4 emission was lower in n3w1 but the n2o emission was significantly higher which resulted in higher gwp as well as ghgi 4 3 effects of n fertilization and supplemental irrigation on nutritional quality and yield of fodder maize n fertilization and supplemental irrigation levels affected the forage yield cp ndf adf ee ear length ear diameter grains per ear and grain yield of fodder maize the quality of forage is the most critical factor affecting animal health and production performance studies have shown that if the cp of forages ingested by livestock is less than 7 the microorganisms in the rumen will not be able to effectively decompose the ingested food resulting in livestock weight loss charmley 2001 our results suggested that n rates and supplemental irrigation levels affected the nutritional quality of fodder maize previous research suggested that n fertilization and irrigation significantly affects the growth and development of crops and improves the grain yield jia et al 2020 2021a 2021b su et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021a 2021b in conclusion treatment n3w2 improved the smc forage yield grain yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize as well as reduced ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in an arid region 5 conclusion in conclusion under supplemental irrigation conditions three n application rates had a significant impact on the ghg emissions yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize n fertilization coupled with supplemental irrigation regime greatly mitigated ghg emissions gwp and ghgi n application coupled with supplemental irrigation regimes greatly improved the nutritional quality and yield of fodder maize over two maize growing seasons more soil water content forage yield and grain yield of fodder maize were provided by 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime also greatly improved the nutritional quality of fodder maize by improving cp and ee and reducing ndf and adf in summary our findings suggested that compared with other treatments 375 kg n ha 1 coupled with 900 mm ha 1 supplemental irrigation regime has a potentiality to ensure nutritional quality and yield while decreasing ghg emissions and warming potential the findings of the experiment are beneficial for improving the yield and nutritional quality of fodder maize and reducing ghg emissions gwp and ghgi in arid regions for a large scale assessment of n fertilization and irrigation impact on ghg emissions and productivity of fodder maize more

9449,canopy interception ic of rainwater is an important component of hydrological cycles and its measurement and modeling are essential for understanding water balances and formulating scientific strategies of management in different ecosystems large areas of traditional agricultural crops have been replaced with apple orchards in the yellow river basin while few studies were conducted to quantify and model canopy interception for apple orchards with different ages in this work we measured rainfall stemflow and throughfall and calculated ic for young and mature apple orchards from may to september 2013 2016 in changwu county on the loess plateau in the yellow river basin the revised gash model was applied to the two orchards the results revealed that annual ic for the young range 22 2 29 2 mm and mature range 26 8 39 7 mm orchards varied between years during the past four years cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively evaluation parameters the mean root mean square error and bias values 0 1719 mm and 0 0372 mm respectively between the measured and modeled ic implied that the revised model performed better for the young orchard for both orchards the revised model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity each year the good agreement between the measured and modeled ic indicated that the revised model was suitable for predicting ic for apple orchards with different ages under our climatic conditions or similar conditions keywords canopy interception revised gash model subhumid region apple orchard tree age 1 introduction canopy interception ic is the amount of rain that falls on vegetation and evaporates before reaching the ground klaassen et al 1998 ic diverts large quantities of rainwater that would otherwise contribute to soil water transpiration surface water and groundwater and thus plays a critical role in determining net hydrological parameters linhoss and siegert 2016 rain is considered a major driver of the distribution and abundance of vegetation in water limited regions kwarteng et al 2009 magliano et al 2019 found that ic for species of woody dryland plants accounted for an average of 24 0 of the total annual rainfall with a gradient of 145 805 mm y 1 yue et al 2021 reported that median global levels of relative ic for trees and shrubs accounted for 21 8 of the total incident rainfall ic does not directly contribute to plant production and remains one of the most important processes in hydrological modeling so it should not be neglected savenije 2004 many studies have found that ic depended on the characteristics of the vegetation and on meteorological factors brauman et al 2010 gerrits et al 2010 sun et al 2015 quantifying ic in different ecosystems can thus be important for improving the management of water cycles and upgrading crop yields and water productivity especially for changes in land use and the effects of climate change in rainfed areas magliano et al 2022 kang et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 ic models allow the extrapolation of measurements in space and time and provide insight into the mechanisms of interception rutter et al 1975 many ic models such as simple regression models helvey and patric 1965 stochastic models calder 1996 and physically based models gash 1979 rutter et al 1971 have been developed to accurately predict ic in different ecosystems muzylo et al 2009 found that the original and revised gash models were most often used for predicting ic due to their ease of use few parameters and low programming complexity gash 1979 gash et al 1995 gash and morton 1978 the original model usually overestimates ic when applied to sparse forests as it predicts whole plot area evaporation lankreijer et al 1993 valente et al 1997 therefore the original model was corrected for a consistent formulation of the canopy cover fraction c eliades et al 2022 compared with the original model the revised model improves boundary conditions and uses evaporation per unit canopy area rather than per unit ground area gash 1979 gash et al 1995 jackson 2000 reported that estimates of ic for an agroforestry system in semi arid kenya were about 4 lower for the revised model than measured totals between november 1994 and june 1997 herbst et al 2008 reported that the revised model well accounted for the seasonal variability in ic the revised model provides more accurate estimates of ic for different plant species sadeghi et al 2015 ma et al 2020 and is particularly needed by managers of forests and water resources for predicting hydrological parameters the loess plateau in shaanxi province in the yellow river basin in china is an optimal area for growing apples suo et al 2016 traditional agricultural crops have been replaced with apple orchards due to the high income available from apple production zhang et al 2021 planting apple trees is also a more efficient way to decrease surface runoff compared to growing traditional agricultural crops thus retaining more water for infiltration into the soil li 2001 the acreage of apple orchards after years of development increased from 3 9 105 ha in 2000 7 3 105 ha in 2017 wang and wang 2020 the modification of vegetation cover together with the redistribution of precipitation can lead to the increases in soil water consumption by increasing leaf area index lai and the time of plant cover and substantially influence the ecology and hydrology of a region chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 jian et al 2019 the cultivation of apple trees continues to expand so the loess plateau has large areas of apple orchards with different ages tree age clearly influenced the morphologies of trees and the hydrological effect of apple orchards with different ages on water balances in catchments cannot be ignored quantifying and modeling ic for apple orchards with different ages is thus important for improving our understanding of the effect of planting apple orchards on regional water balances and for formulating reasonable strategies to manage water resources in the yellow river basin ic in different forest ecosystems such as tropical forests junqueira junior et al 2019 lopes et al 2020 subtropical forests fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 temperate forests návar 2013 2017 and subarid forests ma et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2015 shi et al 2010 has been successfully modeled across various climatic conditions using the revised model but the revised model has not yet been applied to economic apple orchards also little is known about how well the revised model performs in modeling ic for apple orchards of different ages in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin the revised model has usually been calibrated and validated using field data from only one year ma et al 2020 pereira et al 2009 prasad ghimire et al 2017 but rainfall characteristics and other climatic factors can differ greatly between years and even within a year so the difference in performance of the revised model in modeling ic for apple orchards of different ages between years still needs to be explored in the yellow river basin in this study we measured rainfall stemflow throughfall meteorological factors and lai during four consecutive growing seasons 2013 2016 in two adjacent apple orchards in changwu county on the loess plateau in the yellow river basin the two orchards at the beginning of our study were 8 and 18 years old hereafter young and mature orchards respectively we modeled ic for the young and mature orchards using the revised gash model and summarized the application of the original and revised models in different ecosystems on the plateau the aim of this study was to 1 quantify ic for the young and mature orchards from may to september 2013 2016 and 2 assess the performance of the revised model in modeling ic for apple orchards with different ages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were established in 2013 and all measurements were conducted continuously in the young and mature orchards from may to september 2013 2016 at the changwu agro ecological experimental station on the loess plateau 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e 1200 m a s l changwu county shaanxi province china fig 1a the study site has a warm temperate subhumid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 1 c fu et al 2021 but often suffers from drought the mean annual precipitation for 1957 2016 was 573 3 mm about 55 0 of which fell in the fallow period in summer late june to late september the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 1017 0 mm which is about 1 8 fold higher than the mean annual precipitation the soil texture is very uniform and is classified as a cumulic haplustoll usda soil taxonomy the mean dry bulk density of the top 1 0 m of soil is 1 46 g cm 3 with a gravimetric field capacity and wilting point of 21 1 and 8 8 respectively precipitation is the most important source of available water for various ecosystems on the plateau because the groundwater level is 50 0 80 0 m below the surface most apple orchards malus domestica cv fuji apple in this region were planted in 1996 and 2006 due to local governmental policies the trees were thus 8 young and 18 mature years old in 2013 the experiments were conducted in two nearby orchards one young and the other mature fig 1a each orchard was oriented east west summary information for the two orchards at the beginning of the study in 2013 are presented in table 1 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements incident rainfall mm and rainfall duration h were recorded regularly during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 using a horizontally positioned rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge onset computer corp bourne usa with a resolution of 0 2 mm in a grassy area 300 m from the two orchards rainfall intensity mm h 1 could then be calculated accordingly individual rainfalls were greater than 0 2 mm and separated by a period of at least 4 h without rain yuan et al 2017 ic could not be measured directly so daily ic was calculated by subtracting all daily throughfalls and stemflows from the daily incident rainfalls we randomly distributed 20 homemade rain gauges inner diameter of 20 cm and 30 cm in height under the canopy of each orchard to collect throughfall we measured stemflow at a height of 0 8 m for 20 trees in each orchard tree diameter was the main criterion for selecting these trees information for the selected trees is presented in table 1 halved corrugated plastic tubing 3 0 cm wide was stapled around each tree trunk and then sealed using a silicon sealant the tubing was connected by a pipe to a container that was emptied after each rainfall event facilities for measuring throughfall and stemflow are shown in fig 1b more detailed information for the measurements is provided by wang and wang 2020 2 3 revised gash model we used the revised gash model gash et al 1995 to model ic in the two orchards from may to september 2013 2016 the model assumes that rain falls in a series of rains separated by sufficiently long intervals to completely dry the canopy and tree trunks gash 1979 each rainfall event can be distinguished by discrete phases i the wetting phase during which rainfall p g mm is below the threshold required to saturate the canopy ii the saturation phase during which the average rainfall intensity exceeds the average rate of evaporation from a fully wetted canopy and iii the drying phase after the rainfall has stopped gash et al 1995 wei et al 2020 the equations used in the revised model are briefly summarized in table 2 and more detailed descriptions are provided by gash et al 1995 the revised model requires two types of data for calculating ic canopy parameters and atmospheric variables the canopy storage capacity s was determined by extrapolating the linear relationship between precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow for individual continuous rainfall events sufficient to saturate the canopy klaassen et al 1998 wallace and mcjannet 2006 the s value corresponds to the negative intercept of this regression line with the axis for the sum of throughfall and stemflow the coefficient for free throughfall ρ representing the amount of rain that falls directly to the ground without touching the canopy is commonly assumed to be 1 c where c is derived from lai using the following equation junqueira junior et al 2019 1 c 1 1 lai the storage capacity of a trunk s t and the fraction of precipitation diverted to stemflow p t were estimated as the negative intercept and slope respectively of the linear regression between precipitation and stemflow gash and morton 1978 the amount of rain needed to entirely saturate a canopy p g and trunk p t were calculated as gash et al 1995 2 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 3 p t s t p t where r is the mean rainfall intensity mm h 1 e c is the mean rate of evaporation from the saturated canopy during a rain mm h 1 defined as e c e c and s c is the storage capacity of the canopy per unit area of cover mm defined as s c s c the rate of evaporation from the forest canopy during a rain e was calculated using the penman monteith equation for saturated canopies with canopy resistance set to zero gash et al 1995

meteorological factors and determination of leaf area index meteorological data were obtained from a national meteorological station at the changwu agro ecological experimental station 300 m from the two orchards meteorological factors such as solar net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were automatically measured at intervals of 10 s and recorded at intervals of 10 min using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan usa the data were maintained by the chinese meteorological administration the two orchards were close to each other so the recorded meteorological factors were considered to be the same lais for each orchard were determined each year using a lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences inc lincoln usa monthly average lais were obtained from 96 observations in six randomly established plots in each orchard more detailed information is provided by wang and wang 2019 2 5 data analysis daily throughfall and stemflow for each orchard were calculated as average daily measurements cumulative ic for each orchard was the sum of daily ic during the study periods in each year summary statistics such as means and standard deviations for s s t c p t e and r were calculated using excel 2019 we evaluated the performance of the revised model using the root mean square error rmse and bias bias between measured and modeled ic for the two orchards each year the sensitivity of five parameters s c e r s t and p t was analyzed to determine the relative importance of the parameters in the revised model ma et al 2020 wei et al 2020 we increased or decreased the values of these five parameters by up to 50 of their original values to assess the sensitivity of the modeled results to the parameters in both orchards for each year the unpaired t test was employed to compare s c ρ s t p t e and r between the two orchards measured and modeled ic for each orchard were also compared the level of significance was set at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 graphs were constructed using sigmaplot 10 0 and origin 8 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics as shown in fig 2 57 49 54 and 50 rainfall events were recorded with total rainfall of 388 7 383 3 264 6 and 274 0 mm during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount rainfall duration and rainfall intensity varied seasonally rainfall amount during the study periods ranged from 0 2 to 28 0 0 2 43 6 0 2 34 4 and 0 2 38 1 mm in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively rainfall duration and rainfall intensity were 1 17 h and 0 1 5 4 mm h 1 in 2013 1 17 h and 0 2 12 7 mm h 1 in 2014 1 17 h and 0 2 10 4 mm h 1 in 2015 and 1 15 h and 0 2 9 3 mm h 1 in 2016 respectively rains were mostly characterized by low rainfalls of 0 2 mm fig 3a the frequency of rainfalls of 0 2 mm were about 45 6 36 7 50 0 and 56 0 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively larger rainfalls such as 10 20 and 20 mm jointly contributed most of the gross precipitation each year the total percentages of gross precipitation for rainfalls of 10 20 and 20 mm ranged from 54 3 to 79 3 during the past four years fig 3b rainfall duration was mainly 0 2 h with frequencies of about 43 8 36 7 38 9 and 50 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 3c rainfall intensity varied little fig 3d rainfall intensities of 0 0 2 0 5 1 0 0 2 0 5 and 0 2 0 5 mm h 1 had frequencies of 26 3 30 6 31 5 and 28 0 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively 3 2 model parameterization the relationships between incident rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow are shown in fig 4 the differences between the regression equations suggested that the sensitivity of the sum of throughfall and stemflow to incident rainfall varied with tree age as shown in table 3 canopy storage capacity differed between the two orchards during the past four years s was consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard p 0 05 average s for the young and mature orchards was 0 2396 0 0106 and 0 2901 0 0179 mm respectively the relationship between incident rainfall and stemflow also differed between the two orchards fig 5 the increase in stemflow was consistently larger for the mature than the young orchard for the same increase in incident rainfall trunk storage capacity was significantly higher for the mature than the young orchard p 0 05 table 4 mean s t for the young and mature orchards was 0 0221 0 0030 and 0 0376 0 0125 mm respectively the values for c ρ p t e and r used in the revised model for the two orchards in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 are presented in table 3 canopy cover fraction p t and e were generally lower for the young than the mature orchard each year mean c p t and e were about 0 45 0 02 0 0250 0 001 and 0 043 0 006 mm h 1 for the young orchard and 0 49 0 02 0 0271 0 002 and 0 062 0 012 mm h 1 for the mature orchard respectively coefficient for free throughfall was consistently higher for the young than the mature orchard each year 0 57 0 55 0 55 and 0 54 for the young orchard and 0 49 0 50 0 53 and 0 51 for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean rainfall intensity was assumed to be the same for the young and mature orchards and r for the two orchards was about 1 24 0 17 mm h 1 during the past four years 3 3 model application and sensitivity analysis relationships between measured and modeled ic and the evaluation parameters rmse and bias for the young and mature orchards are shown in fig 6 differences in the equations between the two orchards indicated that the sensitivity of modeled ic to measured ic varied with tree age the slope of the regression line was higher for the young than the mature orchard each year during the past four years rmse and bias were consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard p 0 05 mean rmse and bias were 0 1719 mm and 0 0372 mm for the young orchard and 0 2409 mm and 0 0679 mm for the mature orchard respectively rmse and bias each year suggested that the revised model performed better for the young than the mature orchard cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model for the two orchards during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 7 cumulative modeled ic was always higher than cumulative measured ic for both orchards during the past four years p 0 05 cumulative measured ic was 29 2 27 6 23 5 and 22 2 mm for the young orchard and 39 7 38 4 26 8 and 29 2 mm for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively differences between cumulative measured and modeled ic were about 1 8 2 4 1 7 and 1 8 mm for the young orchard and about 3 8 4 5 2 7 and 3 1 mm for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively tree age clearly affected the accuracy of the revised model for the two orchards during the past four years cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 range 6 3 8 6 and 10 5 0 9 range 9 6 11 7 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively the differences between cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model were smaller for the young than the mature orchard the sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the revised model for the young and mature orchards is shown in fig 8 modeled ic was sensitive to all parameters but the relative importance of s c e r s t and p t differed between the two orchards during the past four years e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards followed by c s t and p t the average ic decreased by 24 7 2 6 17 9 1 8 6 8 0 4 1 5 0 2 and 1 4 0 2 for the young orchard and by 28 1 3 4 20 1 2 1 8 6 0 5 1 7 0 2 and 1 3 0 2 for the mature orchard when the values of e r s c s t and p t were reduced by 50 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall characteristics and canopy interception rainfall in this region was mainly 0 2 mm range 36 7 56 and rainfall duration class was mainly 0 2 h range 36 7 50 during the past four years consistent with the general perception that most dryland rainfall events are light and short cavanaugh et al 2011 mean annual rainfall during the study periods for 2013 2016 was about 327 6 67 4 mm with a coefficient of variation of 67 4 yang et al 2019 found that rainfall and canopy area were the two main factors driving the relationships of rainfall partitioning yue et al 2021 reported that meteorological factors and plant traits drove the patterns of rainfall partitioning in biome specific ecohydrological cycles the effects of meteorological factors especially rains and their characteristics rainfall amount rainfall duration and rainfall intensity on rainfall partitioning should therefore be considered when evaluating the dynamics of canopy interception during the same study periods among different experimental years in a specific ecosystem cumulative measured ic for the young annual range 22 2 29 2 mm and mature annual range 26 8 39 7 mm orchards varied between years li and bai 2013 reported that ic for a 22 year old apple orchard ranged from 26 8 to 38 6 mm from april to november 2008 2010 differences in annual ic between our study and the study by li and bai 2013 may have been mostly due to differences in tree morphology study periods rainfall characteristics and local management practices magliano et al 2019 found that ic decreased from 27 1 to 18 9 along a rainfall gradient of 145 805 mm y 1 crockford and richardson 2000 found that ic for some forest types can depend mostly on the type of rain and other meteorological factors in our study rainfall characteristics varied greatly within and between years figs 2 and 3 during the past four years ic for the two orchards in our earlier study was also significantly correlated with rainfall amount and rainfall intensity wang and wang 2019 differences in rainfall characteristics and other meteorological factors may thus have led to the differences in ic for each orchard between years continuous experiments over multiple years are thus important and necessary to minimize the interannual variations of rainfall characteristics and other meteorological factors for better understanding the characteristics of ic and the effects of ic on regional water balances in apple orchards ic negatively affected the consumption of water by plants by preventing water from reaching the soil surface dunkerley 2000 molina and campo 2012 found that throughfall in an aleppo pine plantation was very low but increased significantly after thinning and sun et al 2015 found that the annual ic rate for a japanese cypress plantation decreased from 28 7 to 20 8 after strip thinning hakimi et al 2018 reported that thinning and pruning in three pomegranate stands altered the structures of the stands and canopies and then affected the quantity and pathway of rainwater reaching the ground most crops in this region including apples are cultivated under rainfed conditions effective management practices such as thinning and pruning should thus be applied in apple orchards to promote the sustainable development of apple production 4 2 performance of the revised gash model to the best of our knowledge no studies have evaluated the performance of the revised gash model for apple orchards with different ages in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin during the past four years cumulative modeled ic in our study was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively muzylo et al 2009 proposed that errors in the cumulative model could be divided into five qualitative groups bad 30 applicable 10 30 good 5 10 very good 1 5 and extremely good 1 we thus inferred that the revised model would be applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this region tree age in the two apple orchards in our study clearly affected the performance of the revised model during the past four years rmse and bias were consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard the mean cumulative error of the revised model for the young and mature orchards could be divided into the good and applicable groups proposed by muzylo et al 2009 respectively prasad ghimire et al 2017 also found that the revised model was able to accurately reproduce cumulative measured ic for a young and a semi mature secondary forest the two orchards were close to each other and the environmental factors especially the rainfall characteristics were assumed to be the same so the different performances of the revised model between the two orchards were likely not due to differences in meteorological factors tree density is a key factor influencing ic limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2016 both orchards in our study had the same tree density but the trees in the mature orchard had more branches and thicker trunks and were taller than the trees in the young orchard table 1 these morphological differences likely led to the differences in canopy parameters for the young and mature orchards such as s mean 0 2396 vs 0 2901 mm c mean 0 45 vs 0 49 and s t mean 0 0221 vs 0 0376 mm table 3 and were then likely responsible for the differences in the performance of the revised model in the two orchards link et al 2004 and pypker et al 2005 reported that the original model was more applicable in a young error 7 1 than an old douglas fir forest error 32 although the relative importance of the parameters differed between the young and mature orchards e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards each year in agreement with results reported by fathizadeh et al 2018 and ma et al 2020 4 3 implications for hydrologic studies the grain for green project in china has greatly increased vegetation cover since 1999 on the loess plateau chen et al 2015 the management of water resources in water limited regions is indeed complicated by afforestation because the supply of water must be balanced with hydrological processes in afforested areas sadeghi et al 2016 vegetation affects the amount of water lost from a catchment by transpiration and ic thereby altering the timing and quantity of water available for storage and surface runoff sadeghi et al 2015 due to the importance of ic in regional water balances the original and revised models have been widely used for various tree species on the loess plateau table 4 relative errors and the most sensitive parameters indicate that the performance of the two models differ among studies ma et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2013 2012 differences in tree age study period and meteorological condition table 4 can also lead to differences in the performance of the two models even for the same tree species the planting area and yield of apple trees in the yellow river basin in shaanxi province are both highest for china and the apple industry has become an important contributor to the national economy wang and wang 2017 quantifying ic for apple orchards with different ages and then selecting appropriate management practices to reduce unproductive water fluxes are thus important and necessary to fully exploit the productive potential of apple orchards in the yellow river basin tree density morphological characteristics climatic regions and local management practices vary greatly among apple orchards in the yellow river basin many studies have found that canopy structure and phenological and foliar forms strongly affect rainfall partitioning dong et al 2020 magliano et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 more field experiments should thus be conducted in the yellow river basin to quantify and model the dynamics of ic in apple orchards with different tree densities climatic zones and management practices using the revised gash model 5 conclusion this study measured and modeled ic for a young and a mature apple orchard during 2013 2016 in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin during the past four years cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards ranged from 22 2 to 29 2 and 26 8 39 7 mm respectively the relationship between cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model differed between the two orchards cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively the revised model should thus be applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this subhumid region tree age clearly affected the performance of the revised model in the orchards and the revised model performed better for the young than the mature orchard due to its lower rmse and bias modeled ic was sensitive to canopy and climatic parameters and e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards each year in conclusion this study demonstrated that the revised gash model was robust and applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this subhumid region of the yellow

9449,canopy interception ic of rainwater is an important component of hydrological cycles and its measurement and modeling are essential for understanding water balances and formulating scientific strategies of management in different ecosystems large areas of traditional agricultural crops have been replaced with apple orchards in the yellow river basin while few studies were conducted to quantify and model canopy interception for apple orchards with different ages in this work we measured rainfall stemflow and throughfall and calculated ic for young and mature apple orchards from may to september 2013 2016 in changwu county on the loess plateau in the yellow river basin the revised gash model was applied to the two orchards the results revealed that annual ic for the young range 22 2 29 2 mm and mature range 26 8 39 7 mm orchards varied between years during the past four years cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively evaluation parameters the mean root mean square error and bias values 0 1719 mm and 0 0372 mm respectively between the measured and modeled ic implied that the revised model performed better for the young orchard for both orchards the revised model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity each year the good agreement between the measured and modeled ic indicated that the revised model was suitable for predicting ic for apple orchards with different ages under our climatic conditions or similar conditions keywords canopy interception revised gash model subhumid region apple orchard tree age 1 introduction canopy interception ic is the amount of rain that falls on vegetation and evaporates before reaching the ground klaassen et al 1998 ic diverts large quantities of rainwater that would otherwise contribute to soil water transpiration surface water and groundwater and thus plays a critical role in determining net hydrological parameters linhoss and siegert 2016 rain is considered a major driver of the distribution and abundance of vegetation in water limited regions kwarteng et al 2009 magliano et al 2019 found that ic for species of woody dryland plants accounted for an average of 24 0 of the total annual rainfall with a gradient of 145 805 mm y 1 yue et al 2021 reported that median global levels of relative ic for trees and shrubs accounted for 21 8 of the total incident rainfall ic does not directly contribute to plant production and remains one of the most important processes in hydrological modeling so it should not be neglected savenije 2004 many studies have found that ic depended on the characteristics of the vegetation and on meteorological factors brauman et al 2010 gerrits et al 2010 sun et al 2015 quantifying ic in different ecosystems can thus be important for improving the management of water cycles and upgrading crop yields and water productivity especially for changes in land use and the effects of climate change in rainfed areas magliano et al 2022 kang et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 ic models allow the extrapolation of measurements in space and time and provide insight into the mechanisms of interception rutter et al 1975 many ic models such as simple regression models helvey and patric 1965 stochastic models calder 1996 and physically based models gash 1979 rutter et al 1971 have been developed to accurately predict ic in different ecosystems muzylo et al 2009 found that the original and revised gash models were most often used for predicting ic due to their ease of use few parameters and low programming complexity gash 1979 gash et al 1995 gash and morton 1978 the original model usually overestimates ic when applied to sparse forests as it predicts whole plot area evaporation lankreijer et al 1993 valente et al 1997 therefore the original model was corrected for a consistent formulation of the canopy cover fraction c eliades et al 2022 compared with the original model the revised model improves boundary conditions and uses evaporation per unit canopy area rather than per unit ground area gash 1979 gash et al 1995 jackson 2000 reported that estimates of ic for an agroforestry system in semi arid kenya were about 4 lower for the revised model than measured totals between november 1994 and june 1997 herbst et al 2008 reported that the revised model well accounted for the seasonal variability in ic the revised model provides more accurate estimates of ic for different plant species sadeghi et al 2015 ma et al 2020 and is particularly needed by managers of forests and water resources for predicting hydrological parameters the loess plateau in shaanxi province in the yellow river basin in china is an optimal area for growing apples suo et al 2016 traditional agricultural crops have been replaced with apple orchards due to the high income available from apple production zhang et al 2021 planting apple trees is also a more efficient way to decrease surface runoff compared to growing traditional agricultural crops thus retaining more water for infiltration into the soil li 2001 the acreage of apple orchards after years of development increased from 3 9 105 ha in 2000 7 3 105 ha in 2017 wang and wang 2020 the modification of vegetation cover together with the redistribution of precipitation can lead to the increases in soil water consumption by increasing leaf area index lai and the time of plant cover and substantially influence the ecology and hydrology of a region chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 jian et al 2019 the cultivation of apple trees continues to expand so the loess plateau has large areas of apple orchards with different ages tree age clearly influenced the morphologies of trees and the hydrological effect of apple orchards with different ages on water balances in catchments cannot be ignored quantifying and modeling ic for apple orchards with different ages is thus important for improving our understanding of the effect of planting apple orchards on regional water balances and for formulating reasonable strategies to manage water resources in the yellow river basin ic in different forest ecosystems such as tropical forests junqueira junior et al 2019 lopes et al 2020 subtropical forests fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 temperate forests návar 2013 2017 and subarid forests ma et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2015 shi et al 2010 has been successfully modeled across various climatic conditions using the revised model but the revised model has not yet been applied to economic apple orchards also little is known about how well the revised model performs in modeling ic for apple orchards of different ages in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin the revised model has usually been calibrated and validated using field data from only one year ma et al 2020 pereira et al 2009 prasad ghimire et al 2017 but rainfall characteristics and other climatic factors can differ greatly between years and even within a year so the difference in performance of the revised model in modeling ic for apple orchards of different ages between years still needs to be explored in the yellow river basin in this study we measured rainfall stemflow throughfall meteorological factors and lai during four consecutive growing seasons 2013 2016 in two adjacent apple orchards in changwu county on the loess plateau in the yellow river basin the two orchards at the beginning of our study were 8 and 18 years old hereafter young and mature orchards respectively we modeled ic for the young and mature orchards using the revised gash model and summarized the application of the original and revised models in different ecosystems on the plateau the aim of this study was to 1 quantify ic for the young and mature orchards from may to september 2013 2016 and 2 assess the performance of the revised model in modeling ic for apple orchards with different ages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were established in 2013 and all measurements were conducted continuously in the young and mature orchards from may to september 2013 2016 at the changwu agro ecological experimental station on the loess plateau 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e 1200 m a s l changwu county shaanxi province china fig 1a the study site has a warm temperate subhumid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 1 c fu et al 2021 but often suffers from drought the mean annual precipitation for 1957 2016 was 573 3 mm about 55 0 of which fell in the fallow period in summer late june to late september the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 1017 0 mm which is about 1 8 fold higher than the mean annual precipitation the soil texture is very uniform and is classified as a cumulic haplustoll usda soil taxonomy the mean dry bulk density of the top 1 0 m of soil is 1 46 g cm 3 with a gravimetric field capacity and wilting point of 21 1 and 8 8 respectively precipitation is the most important source of available water for various ecosystems on the plateau because the groundwater level is 50 0 80 0 m below the surface most apple orchards malus domestica cv fuji apple in this region were planted in 1996 and 2006 due to local governmental policies the trees were thus 8 young and 18 mature years old in 2013 the experiments were conducted in two nearby orchards one young and the other mature fig 1a each orchard was oriented east west summary information for the two orchards at the beginning of the study in 2013 are presented in table 1 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements incident rainfall mm and rainfall duration h were recorded regularly during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 using a horizontally positioned rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge onset computer corp bourne usa with a resolution of 0 2 mm in a grassy area 300 m from the two orchards rainfall intensity mm h 1 could then be calculated accordingly individual rainfalls were greater than 0 2 mm and separated by a period of at least 4 h without rain yuan et al 2017 ic could not be measured directly so daily ic was calculated by subtracting all daily throughfalls and stemflows from the daily incident rainfalls we randomly distributed 20 homemade rain gauges inner diameter of 20 cm and 30 cm in height under the canopy of each orchard to collect throughfall we measured stemflow at a height of 0 8 m for 20 trees in each orchard tree diameter was the main criterion for selecting these trees information for the selected trees is presented in table 1 halved corrugated plastic tubing 3 0 cm wide was stapled around each tree trunk and then sealed using a silicon sealant the tubing was connected by a pipe to a container that was emptied after each rainfall event facilities for measuring throughfall and stemflow are shown in fig 1b more detailed information for the measurements is provided by wang and wang 2020 2 3 revised gash model we used the revised gash model gash et al 1995 to model ic in the two orchards from may to september 2013 2016 the model assumes that rain falls in a series of rains separated by sufficiently long intervals to completely dry the canopy and tree trunks gash 1979 each rainfall event can be distinguished by discrete phases i the wetting phase during which rainfall p g mm is below the threshold required to saturate the canopy ii the saturation phase during which the average rainfall intensity exceeds the average rate of evaporation from a fully wetted canopy and iii the drying phase after the rainfall has stopped gash et al 1995 wei et al 2020 the equations used in the revised model are briefly summarized in table 2 and more detailed descriptions are provided by gash et al 1995 the revised model requires two types of data for calculating ic canopy parameters and atmospheric variables the canopy storage capacity s was determined by extrapolating the linear relationship between precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow for individual continuous rainfall events sufficient to saturate the canopy klaassen et al 1998 wallace and mcjannet 2006 the s value corresponds to the negative intercept of this regression line with the axis for the sum of throughfall and stemflow the coefficient for free throughfall ρ representing the amount of rain that falls directly to the ground without touching the canopy is commonly assumed to be 1 c where c is derived from lai using the following equation junqueira junior et al 2019 1 c 1 1 lai the storage capacity of a trunk s t and the fraction of precipitation diverted to stemflow p t were estimated as the negative intercept and slope respectively of the linear regression between precipitation and stemflow gash and morton 1978 the amount of rain needed to entirely saturate a canopy p g and trunk p t were calculated as gash et al 1995 2 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 3 p t s t p t where r is the mean rainfall intensity mm h 1 e c is the mean rate of evaporation from the saturated canopy during a rain mm h 1 defined as e c e c and s c is the storage capacity of the canopy per unit area of cover mm defined as s c s c the rate of evaporation from the forest canopy during a rain e was calculated using the penman monteith equation for saturated canopies with canopy resistance set to zero gash et al 1995

meteorological factors and determination of leaf area index meteorological data were obtained from a national meteorological station at the changwu agro ecological experimental station 300 m from the two orchards meteorological factors such as solar net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were automatically measured at intervals of 10 s and recorded at intervals of 10 min using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan usa the data were maintained by the chinese meteorological administration the two orchards were close to each other so the recorded meteorological factors were considered to be the same lais for each orchard were determined each year using a lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences inc lincoln usa monthly average lais were obtained from 96 observations in six randomly established plots in each orchard more detailed information is provided by wang and wang 2019 2 5 data analysis daily throughfall and stemflow for each orchard were calculated as average daily measurements cumulative ic for each orchard was the sum of daily ic during the study periods in each year summary statistics such as means and standard deviations for s s t c p t e and r were calculated using excel 2019 we evaluated the performance of the revised model using the root mean square error rmse and bias bias between measured and modeled ic for the two orchards each year the sensitivity of five parameters s c e r s t and p t was analyzed to determine the relative importance of the parameters in the revised model ma et al 2020 wei et al 2020 we increased or decreased the values of these five parameters by up to 50 of their original values to assess the sensitivity of the modeled results to the parameters in both orchards for each year the unpaired t test was employed to compare s c ρ s t p t e and r between the two orchards measured and modeled ic for each orchard were also compared the level of significance was set at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 graphs were constructed using sigmaplot 10 0 and origin 8 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics as shown in fig 2 57 49 54 and 50 rainfall events were recorded with total rainfall of 388 7 383 3 264 6 and 274 0 mm during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount rainfall duration and rainfall intensity varied seasonally rainfall amount during the study periods ranged from 0 2 to 28 0 0 2 43 6 0 2 34 4 and 0 2 38 1 mm in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively rainfall duration and rainfall intensity were 1 17 h and 0 1 5 4 mm h 1 in 2013 1 17 h and 0 2 12 7 mm h 1 in 2014 1 17 h and 0 2 10 4 mm h 1 in 2015 and 1 15 h and 0 2 9 3 mm h 1 in 2016 respectively rains were mostly characterized by low rainfalls of 0 2 mm fig 3a the frequency of rainfalls of 0 2 mm were about 45 6 36 7 50 0 and 56 0 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively larger rainfalls such as 10 20 and 20 mm jointly contributed most of the gross precipitation each year the total percentages of gross precipitation for rainfalls of 10 20 and 20 mm ranged from 54 3 to 79 3 during the past four years fig 3b rainfall duration was mainly 0 2 h with frequencies of about 43 8 36 7 38 9 and 50 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 3c rainfall intensity varied little fig 3d rainfall intensities of 0 0 2 0 5 1 0 0 2 0 5 and 0 2 0 5 mm h 1 had frequencies of 26 3 30 6 31 5 and 28 0 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively 3 2 model parameterization the relationships between incident rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow are shown in fig 4 the differences between the regression equations suggested that the sensitivity of the sum of throughfall and stemflow to incident rainfall varied with tree age as shown in table 3 canopy storage capacity differed between the two orchards during the past four years s was consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard p 0 05 average s for the young and mature orchards was 0 2396 0 0106 and 0 2901 0 0179 mm respectively the relationship between incident rainfall and stemflow also differed between the two orchards fig 5 the increase in stemflow was consistently larger for the mature than the young orchard for the same increase in incident rainfall trunk storage capacity was significantly higher for the mature than the young orchard p 0 05 table 4 mean s t for the young and mature orchards was 0 0221 0 0030 and 0 0376 0 0125 mm respectively the values for c ρ p t e and r used in the revised model for the two orchards in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 are presented in table 3 canopy cover fraction p t and e were generally lower for the young than the mature orchard each year mean c p t and e were about 0 45 0 02 0 0250 0 001 and 0 043 0 006 mm h 1 for the young orchard and 0 49 0 02 0 0271 0 002 and 0 062 0 012 mm h 1 for the mature orchard respectively coefficient for free throughfall was consistently higher for the young than the mature orchard each year 0 57 0 55 0 55 and 0 54 for the young orchard and 0 49 0 50 0 53 and 0 51 for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean rainfall intensity was assumed to be the same for the young and mature orchards and r for the two orchards was about 1 24 0 17 mm h 1 during the past four years 3 3 model application and sensitivity analysis relationships between measured and modeled ic and the evaluation parameters rmse and bias for the young and mature orchards are shown in fig 6 differences in the equations between the two orchards indicated that the sensitivity of modeled ic to measured ic varied with tree age the slope of the regression line was higher for the young than the mature orchard each year during the past four years rmse and bias were consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard p 0 05 mean rmse and bias were 0 1719 mm and 0 0372 mm for the young orchard and 0 2409 mm and 0 0679 mm for the mature orchard respectively rmse and bias each year suggested that the revised model performed better for the young than the mature orchard cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model for the two orchards during the study periods in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 7 cumulative modeled ic was always higher than cumulative measured ic for both orchards during the past four years p 0 05 cumulative measured ic was 29 2 27 6 23 5 and 22 2 mm for the young orchard and 39 7 38 4 26 8 and 29 2 mm for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively differences between cumulative measured and modeled ic were about 1 8 2 4 1 7 and 1 8 mm for the young orchard and about 3 8 4 5 2 7 and 3 1 mm for the mature orchard in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively tree age clearly affected the accuracy of the revised model for the two orchards during the past four years cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 range 6 3 8 6 and 10 5 0 9 range 9 6 11 7 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively the differences between cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model were smaller for the young than the mature orchard the sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the revised model for the young and mature orchards is shown in fig 8 modeled ic was sensitive to all parameters but the relative importance of s c e r s t and p t differed between the two orchards during the past four years e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards followed by c s t and p t the average ic decreased by 24 7 2 6 17 9 1 8 6 8 0 4 1 5 0 2 and 1 4 0 2 for the young orchard and by 28 1 3 4 20 1 2 1 8 6 0 5 1 7 0 2 and 1 3 0 2 for the mature orchard when the values of e r s c s t and p t were reduced by 50 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall characteristics and canopy interception rainfall in this region was mainly 0 2 mm range 36 7 56 and rainfall duration class was mainly 0 2 h range 36 7 50 during the past four years consistent with the general perception that most dryland rainfall events are light and short cavanaugh et al 2011 mean annual rainfall during the study periods for 2013 2016 was about 327 6 67 4 mm with a coefficient of variation of 67 4 yang et al 2019 found that rainfall and canopy area were the two main factors driving the relationships of rainfall partitioning yue et al 2021 reported that meteorological factors and plant traits drove the patterns of rainfall partitioning in biome specific ecohydrological cycles the effects of meteorological factors especially rains and their characteristics rainfall amount rainfall duration and rainfall intensity on rainfall partitioning should therefore be considered when evaluating the dynamics of canopy interception during the same study periods among different experimental years in a specific ecosystem cumulative measured ic for the young annual range 22 2 29 2 mm and mature annual range 26 8 39 7 mm orchards varied between years li and bai 2013 reported that ic for a 22 year old apple orchard ranged from 26 8 to 38 6 mm from april to november 2008 2010 differences in annual ic between our study and the study by li and bai 2013 may have been mostly due to differences in tree morphology study periods rainfall characteristics and local management practices magliano et al 2019 found that ic decreased from 27 1 to 18 9 along a rainfall gradient of 145 805 mm y 1 crockford and richardson 2000 found that ic for some forest types can depend mostly on the type of rain and other meteorological factors in our study rainfall characteristics varied greatly within and between years figs 2 and 3 during the past four years ic for the two orchards in our earlier study was also significantly correlated with rainfall amount and rainfall intensity wang and wang 2019 differences in rainfall characteristics and other meteorological factors may thus have led to the differences in ic for each orchard between years continuous experiments over multiple years are thus important and necessary to minimize the interannual variations of rainfall characteristics and other meteorological factors for better understanding the characteristics of ic and the effects of ic on regional water balances in apple orchards ic negatively affected the consumption of water by plants by preventing water from reaching the soil surface dunkerley 2000 molina and campo 2012 found that throughfall in an aleppo pine plantation was very low but increased significantly after thinning and sun et al 2015 found that the annual ic rate for a japanese cypress plantation decreased from 28 7 to 20 8 after strip thinning hakimi et al 2018 reported that thinning and pruning in three pomegranate stands altered the structures of the stands and canopies and then affected the quantity and pathway of rainwater reaching the ground most crops in this region including apples are cultivated under rainfed conditions effective management practices such as thinning and pruning should thus be applied in apple orchards to promote the sustainable development of apple production 4 2 performance of the revised gash model to the best of our knowledge no studies have evaluated the performance of the revised gash model for apple orchards with different ages in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin during the past four years cumulative modeled ic in our study was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively muzylo et al 2009 proposed that errors in the cumulative model could be divided into five qualitative groups bad 30 applicable 10 30 good 5 10 very good 1 5 and extremely good 1 we thus inferred that the revised model would be applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this region tree age in the two apple orchards in our study clearly affected the performance of the revised model during the past four years rmse and bias were consistently lower for the young than the mature orchard the mean cumulative error of the revised model for the young and mature orchards could be divided into the good and applicable groups proposed by muzylo et al 2009 respectively prasad ghimire et al 2017 also found that the revised model was able to accurately reproduce cumulative measured ic for a young and a semi mature secondary forest the two orchards were close to each other and the environmental factors especially the rainfall characteristics were assumed to be the same so the different performances of the revised model between the two orchards were likely not due to differences in meteorological factors tree density is a key factor influencing ic limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2016 both orchards in our study had the same tree density but the trees in the mature orchard had more branches and thicker trunks and were taller than the trees in the young orchard table 1 these morphological differences likely led to the differences in canopy parameters for the young and mature orchards such as s mean 0 2396 vs 0 2901 mm c mean 0 45 vs 0 49 and s t mean 0 0221 vs 0 0376 mm table 3 and were then likely responsible for the differences in the performance of the revised model in the two orchards link et al 2004 and pypker et al 2005 reported that the original model was more applicable in a young error 7 1 than an old douglas fir forest error 32 although the relative importance of the parameters differed between the young and mature orchards e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards each year in agreement with results reported by fathizadeh et al 2018 and ma et al 2020 4 3 implications for hydrologic studies the grain for green project in china has greatly increased vegetation cover since 1999 on the loess plateau chen et al 2015 the management of water resources in water limited regions is indeed complicated by afforestation because the supply of water must be balanced with hydrological processes in afforested areas sadeghi et al 2016 vegetation affects the amount of water lost from a catchment by transpiration and ic thereby altering the timing and quantity of water available for storage and surface runoff sadeghi et al 2015 due to the importance of ic in regional water balances the original and revised models have been widely used for various tree species on the loess plateau table 4 relative errors and the most sensitive parameters indicate that the performance of the two models differ among studies ma et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2013 2012 differences in tree age study period and meteorological condition table 4 can also lead to differences in the performance of the two models even for the same tree species the planting area and yield of apple trees in the yellow river basin in shaanxi province are both highest for china and the apple industry has become an important contributor to the national economy wang and wang 2017 quantifying ic for apple orchards with different ages and then selecting appropriate management practices to reduce unproductive water fluxes are thus important and necessary to fully exploit the productive potential of apple orchards in the yellow river basin tree density morphological characteristics climatic regions and local management practices vary greatly among apple orchards in the yellow river basin many studies have found that canopy structure and phenological and foliar forms strongly affect rainfall partitioning dong et al 2020 magliano et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 more field experiments should thus be conducted in the yellow river basin to quantify and model the dynamics of ic in apple orchards with different tree densities climatic zones and management practices using the revised gash model 5 conclusion this study measured and modeled ic for a young and a mature apple orchard during 2013 2016 in a subhumid region of the yellow river basin during the past four years cumulative measured ic for the young and mature orchards ranged from 22 2 to 29 2 and 26 8 39 7 mm respectively the relationship between cumulative measured and modeled ic using the revised model differed between the two orchards cumulative modeled ic was 7 6 1 0 and 10 5 0 9 higher than measured ic for the young and mature orchards respectively the revised model should thus be applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this subhumid region tree age clearly affected the performance of the revised model in the orchards and the revised model performed better for the young than the mature orchard due to its lower rmse and bias modeled ic was sensitive to canopy and climatic parameters and e r and s were the most sensitive parameters for both orchards each year in conclusion this study demonstrated that the revised gash model was robust and applicable to apple orchards with different ages in this subhumid region of the yellow
