15040,chloramination and chlorination are both strong barriers that prevent the transmission of potential pathogens to humans through drinking water however the comparative effects of chloramination and chlorination on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args in drinking water treatment plants dwtps remain unknown herein the antibiotic resistome in water before and after chloramination or chlorination was analyzed through metagenomic sequencing and then verified through quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr after the treatment of 90 min chloramination led to higher enrichment of the total relative abundance of intracellular args iargs in water than chlorination whereas chlorination facilitated the release of more extracellular args eargs than chloramination according to redundancy and pearson s analyses the total concentration of the observed iargs in the finished water exhibited a strong positive correlation with ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration presenting a linear upward trend with an increase in the nh4 n concentration this indicated that nh4 n is a crucial driving factor for iarg accumulation during chloramination iarg enrichment ceases if the duration of chloramination is shortened to 40 min suggesting that shortening the duration would be a better strategy for controlling iarg enrichment in drinking water these findings emphasized the potential risk of antibiotic resistance after extended chloramination shedding light on the control of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria through water by optimizing disinfection procedures

data will be made available on request 1 introduction increase in antibiotic resistance is gradually impairing the ability to treat infectious diseases posing a great threat to global public health antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause as many as 10 million casualties annually by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill 2015 therefore the increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args especially in drinking water systems is gradually becoming a hot research topic globally han et al 2020 hu et al 2021 ma et al 2017 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 this is because of the associated great human health risks including an increase in virulence pathogenicity disease outbreaks as well as the resulting morbidity hospitalization and mortality rates sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 safety of drinking water exiting from drinking water treatment plants dwtps is of paramount importance because of its vast influence on the health of millions of people generally primary disinfection in the dwtps is a necessary step for killing of pathogens and ensuring the microbiological safety of drinking water even so in the last few years arb and args have been detected frequently in chlorinated plant effluent han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 ma et al 2017 resulting in an increased risk of exposure to microbial hazards this is attributed to the possibilities that the traditional water treatment process of primary disinfection fails to remove arb and args from the source water sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 xu et al 2016 furthermore chlorine disinfection elevates arg accumulation in drinking water jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 moreover chlorination promotes the horizontal transfer of plasmids through natural transformation resulting in arg exchange across bacterial genera and the emergence of new arb jin et al 2020 given the serious threat of arb to public health the effect of primary disinfection method in the dwtps pichel et al 2019 on arg occurrence in the drinking water must be urgently evaluated nowadays primary disinfection in the dwtps is performed by chloramination and chlorination chloramination which are performed by introducing ammonia into the water to combine with free chlorine residues is gaining some popularity over chlorination mostly due to maintaining chlorine residues and the reduced formation of disinfection byproducts but possibly also because of its selective reactivity with biofilm components thereby achieving better biofilm penetration stalter et al 2016 stewart et al 1994 xue et al 2014 previous findings have showed that chlorine injured bacteria surviving sodium hypochlorite exposure presented a good physiological competence with an increased transformation frequency of rp4 plasmid up to 550 times compared with the untreated bacteria jin et al 2020 furthermore the water quality factor nh4 n could significantly facilitate the transformation frequencies of rp4 into the injured bacteria with the frequencies increasing with the increasing nh4 n concentration we thus speculated that chloramination which had higher nh4 n concentration in chloramine disinfected water may lead to higher iarg enrichment in dwtps than chlorination unfortunately the comparative effects of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water from dwtps have not been investigated herein one dwtp with chloramination and another with chlorination were chosen to analyze the antibiotic resistome in the filtered water and finished water through metagenomic sequencing furthermore to validate the change in arg occurrence after disinfection processes samples from the two dwtps were collected continuously for 1 year and then arg concentrations were quantified using qpcr assays the study investigated the comparative effect of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water and explored key water quality contributors which would guide the optimization of disinfection procedures in dwtps to help control global arb spread 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples from two dwtps located in tianjin city china were studied as shown in fig 1

adding 300 ml eluent 15 g l nacl 30 g l tryptone 15 g l beef extract 3 75 g l glycine and 0 28 g l naoh ph 9 3 0 2 and filtered through a polyethersulfone microporous membrane filter pore size 0 22 µm millipore bedford ma usa to remove bacteria the filtered elutes were incubated with twice the volume of isopropanol at room temperature for 16 h and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the precipitate was resuspended with 2 ml tris edta buffer ph 8 0 and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 5 arg quantification a total of 15 typical arg subtypes namely sulfonamide resistance gene

enhance cycling efficiencies all primers were synthesized by shenggong co ltd shanghai china table s2 the standard curves for arg quantification were obtained by analyzing 10 fold serial dilutions of target standards liang et al 2022 table s3 2 6 calculation of arg concentration the recovery and concentration of args were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 eargs recovery efficiency b c a

according to above described in section 2 4 the extracted dna was sequenced using illumina novaseq pe150 novogene china raw data was processed to acquire the clean data using readfq v8 and then the clean data was assembled by megahit v1 0 4 li et al 2015b metagenemark v2 10 was used to predict open reading frames orfs for each scaftig with a minimum length of 500 bp the redundant orfs were removed and then unique initial gene unigene clusters were obtained by using cd hit v4 5 8 fu et al 2012 bowtie2 v2 2 4 was used to map the clean data to unigenes to get the number of mapped reads followed by calculation of gene abundances in each sample based on length of the gene and the number of mapped reads we used the diamond v0 9 9 software to blast the unigenes against the nonredundant nr database of ncbi for taxonomic annotations nr results with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 were adopted to take the lca algorithm system classification of megan huson et al 2011 according to the abundance of unigenes and taxonomic classification abundance information at each taxonomic level kingdom phylum class order family genus species was acquired the unigenes were aligned to the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database jia et al 2017a martinez et al 2015 mcarthur et al 2013 by the resistance gene identifier software by using blastp with an e value cutoff of 1e 30 the arg relative abundance was calculated by normalizing the matched sequencing reads to the total metagenomic sequences in each sample yin et al 2018 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism graphpad software inc la jolla ca usa and spss ibm spss inc chicago il usa student s t test was used for two group comparisons assuming equal variances and anova was used for multi group comparisons to analyze the correlation between args and bacterial communities spearman s correlation analysis was performed then network analysis was performed using gephi 0 9 2 software pearson s correlation analysis was performed to identify variable correlations between the nh4 n concentration and total iarg concentration data are presented as mean standard deviation sd differences were deemed statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 antibiotic resistome analysis through metagenomic sequencing during chloramination and chlorination to investigate the change in the antibiotic resistome in water after the implementation of disinfection strategies involving chloramination and chlorination metagenomic analysis was performed to provide insight into arg occurrence the total relative abundance of args in water sampled from the final outlets was significantly high fig 2 a p 0 001 the abundance was 1 9 times higher after 90 min chloramination in line 1 fig 2b chlorination for 90 min in line 2 also enriched arg abundance fig 2a which is consistent with the results of previous studies indicating that chlorination could elevate the total relative arg abundance in drinking water jia et al 2015 xu et al 2016 however enrichment after chlorination was only 1 1 times higher fig 2b p 0 05 no significant difference was observed between water samples from the filter station and final outlet after 40 min chloramination in line 3 fig 2a therefore chloramination led to higher arg enrichment in water than chlorination and extended chloramination led to further arg enrichment args were deemed as significantly enriched if they exhibited a fold change of 2 with a p value of less than 0 05 or were undetectable before disinfection but were detectable after disinfection with p value 0 05 after analyzing the change in arg abundance a total of 92 arg subtypes were identified to be significantly elevated in line 1 after disinfection table s4 the enrichment of 67 args most of which functioned as antibiotic inactivation and antibiotic efflux fig 3 a was higher or specifically enhanced in line 1 than in line 2 fig s1a the enrichment of 86 args most of which also functioned as antibiotic inactivation and antibiotic efflux fig 3b was higher in line 1 than in line 3 fig s1b generally genes conferring resistance to vancomycin polymyxins and carbapenems which have been considered as the last target to fight severe infections knox et al 2022 mandler et al 2018 wu and boger 2020 were referred to as last resort args largs liang et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the enrichment of largs such as kpc 14 gim 1 vanhf cau 1 ebr 1 beta lactamase imp 29 imp 13 imp 48 and ndm 14 was higher in line 1 than in the other lines fig s1a indicating that chloramination poses a potential threat to public health a total of 53 arg subtypes mostly acting as antibiotic efflux 31 args and antibiotic inactivation 15 args were positively detected in all water samples fig s2 figs 4 a and 4b table s5 which were defined as persistent args jia et al 2020 among these persistent args the enrichment of 12 args namely tcr3 msre smer smef mphd sed 1 adc 8 oxa 211 oxa 57 bacillus subtilis mprf tet44 and sul2 was higher after chloramination than after chlorination fig s1a table s4 however emrd qnrd1 and the drug efflux pump genes acrd and acrb that facilitate multiple antibiotic resistance alav et al 2021 tam et al 2021 were evidently enriched in the three lines 3 2 the potential host of increased args during chloramination accumulating evidence has revealed that the bacterial community structure shapes the antibiotic resistome jia et al 2017b su et al 2018 to explore the potential host of args network analysis was performed to illustrate the significant positive correlations spearman s coefficient r 0 8 p 0 01 between args and bacterial communities fig 5 presents the co existing network consisting of 137 nodes 89 bacterial species and 48 arg subtypes and 219 edges among the args in the network vantc vanhf tet39 tet33 r39 otra msre mphd mexv mefa crp brucella suis mprf and bacillus subtilis mprf were evidently enriched by 90 min chloramination table s4 among them r39 and mphd appeared most frequently in the network showing positive correlations with the same 10 bacterial species providencia alcalifaciens comamonas aquatica vittaforma corneae empedobacter falsenii proteobacteria bacterium sg bin5 acinetobacter rudis comamonas testosteroni alcaligenes faecalis stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter junii followed by tet39 and crp which co occurred with eight species e g acinetobacter rudis comamonas testosterone alcaligenes faecalis acinetobacter junii and providencia alcalifaciens surprisingly most of these bacteria were opportunist human pathogens alcaligenes faecalis huang 2020 acinetobacter junii hung et al 2009 comamonas testosteroni farooq et al 2017 and providencia alcalifaciens shah et al 2019 were opportunistic pathogens causing nosocomial infections and potentially coharbored tet39 r39 mphd and crp additionally the human pathogen vittaforma corneae mittleider et al 2002 was speculated to be the potential host of at least three enriched arg subtypes namely r39 mphd and crp while empedobacter falsenii zaman et al 2017 potentially harbored tet39 r39 msre and mphd stenotrophomonas maltophilia which is the third most common nosocomial infection causing pathogen with multidrug resistance that targets immunocompromised patients sader and jones 2005 was deemed as a potential host of two enriched arg subtypes including r39 and mphd providencia rettgeri an emerging nosocomial uropathogen sagar et al 2017 was found to correlate with crp generally the abundances of args carried by diverse potential hosts could vary drastically along with the potential host abundances li et al 2015a in the network the potential bacterial hosts of the aforementioned args enriched in line 1 elevated their abundance after 90 min chloramination fig s3 revealing the key role of bacterial community shift in the alteration of arg abundance undeniably such co occurrence patterns were determined solely by the prediction correlation methods and need to be further validated using the molecular detection assays 3 3 arg detection during chloramination and chlorination through qpcr to validate the changes in arg occurrence after chloramination and chlorination representative arg subtypes against tetracyclines sulfonamides macrolides quinolones aminoglycosides rifampicin chloramphenicol trimethoprim vancomycin carbapenems and polymyxin present in the water samples before and after disinfection were assayed throughout a year by using qpcr among the observed iargs blatem aada and teta were consistently found in all detected finished water with the detection frequency reaching 100 fig 6 a table s6 for iargs with a detection frequency of 90 in the finished water blatem aada teta sul1 tetm and vana occurred in line 1 whereas only blatem aada teta and tetm occurred in line 2 all the observed iargs in the finished water from line 1 except tetm and cata1 had identical or higher detection frequencies than the corresponding ones from line 2 especially nine iargs aada vana teta rpob1 mcr 1 ermb cata1 qnra and katg in line 1 and six iargs tetm teta rpob1 ermb cata1 and qnra in line 2 exhibited higher detection frequencies in the finished water than those in the filtered water eargs with detection frequencies of 90 in the finished water from line 1 were blatem sul1 vana and teta but all the observed eargs presented a detection frequency below 90 in the finished water from line 2 fig 6b table s6 except for aada all the observed eargs in the finished water from line 1 had higher detection frequencies than those from line 2 additionally detection frequencies of seven eargs sul1 teta blandm 1 mcr 1 ermb qnra and katg in line 1 and six eargs sul1 aada teta rpob1 dfra1 1 and katg in line 2 were higher in the finished water than in the filtered water meanwhile detection frequencies of iargs were generally higher than those of the corresponding eargs in the finished water from lines 1 and 2 fig s4 p 0 001 collectively these results indicated that compared with chlorination chloramination may help increase the levels of specific iargs in the finished water resulting in a higher detection frequency of iargs we investigated changes in relative concentration of iargs before and after chloramination and chlorination each iarg concentration fluctuated greatly during the sampling period fig s5 after summing up all observed iarg concentrations in the monthly collected samples the highest total iarg concentration after chloramination and chlorination was observed in january 2020 whereas the total iarg concentration remained low 1 copy 16s rrna gene during june 2020 to november 2022 after chloramination and chlorination figs s7a and s7b upper panels subsequently a comparison of the concentration of each iarg throughout the whole year revealed that the concentration of both intracellular blatem and aada was the highest after chloramination and chlorination figs s8a and s8b the total relative concentration of iargs was remarkably enhanced at the final outlet in comparison to that at the filter station p 0 05 whereas no significant difference was observed for line 2 fig 7 a obviously chloramination led to higher enrichment of iargs concentration than chlorination fig 7b in accordance with above metagenomic analysis simultaneously the monthly concentration of each earg in the finished water after chloramination or chlorination also fluctuated greatly during the sample period fig s6 the average total concentration of observed eargs generally fluctuated from 102 november 2020 to 106 gc l january 2020 figs s7a and s7b lower panels interestingly both iargs and eargs reached maximum concentrations in january when the water temperature remained the lowest consistent with the previous study that the median concentration of total iargs increased during the chlorination when water temperature was declined liu et al 2018 the median concentration of extracellular blatem was the highest after chloramination and chlorination followed by those of vana sul1 and aada figs s8d and s8e the total concentration of measured eargs reached 3 5 105 gc l and 1 58 105 gc l in the water sampled at the final outlets from lines 1 and 2 additionally the total concentration of the observed eargs at the filter station was significantly higher than that at the final outlet from line 1 p 0 05 whereas an opposite trend was observed for line 2 fig 7c thus chloramination led to lower enrichment of earg concentration than chlorination fig 7d 3 4 effect of chloramine exposure time on arg occurrence in dwtps the effect of chloramine exposure time on iarg occurrence in the finished water was also explored table s6 figs 6a s7a and s7c the detection frequency of only tetm in the finished water disinfected with chloramine for 90 min line 1 was lower whereas that of other iargs e g vana rpob1 dfra1 1 mcr 1 ermb cata1 and katg in the same finished water was identical or higher than the detection frequency in the finished water disinfected with chloramines for 40 min line 3 intracellular blakpc remained undetectable in all samples from lines 1 and 3 total iarg concentrations fluctuated considerably on a monthly basis during the whole year and reached maximum concentrations in january 2020 after 90 and 40 min chloramination figs s7a and s7c upper panels the concentrations of blatem aada and sul1 were the highest and the median concentrations of blatem and aada after 90 min chloramination were 8 05 10 2 and 5 12 10 2 copies 16s rrna gene which were higher than those after 40 min chloramination figs s8a and s8c a summation of the concentrations of all observed iargs exhibited no significant difference between samples before and after 40 min chloramine exposure p 0 05 fig 7a extracellular forms of blakpc were not detected in all samples from lines 1 and 3 table s6 fig 6b the earg concentration fluctuated sharply in lines 1 and 3 figs s7a and s7c lower panels presenting an increase in earg concentration from 102 to 106 gc l the gene blatem was the most abundant earg in the finished water from both line 1 and line 3 followed by sul1 aada tetm and vana figs s8d and s8f the total concentration of the observed eargs was significantly higher at the filter station than at the final outlet from line 1 whereas an opposite trend was observed for line 3 p 0 05 fig 7c thus extended chloramination led to lower enrichment of earg concentration than shortened chloramine exposure did fig 7d 3 5 key factors to promote args occurrence during chloramination redundancy analysis between args and water quality indices was performed to explore the key factors influencing arg enrichment during chloramination physicochemical parameters explained 72 9 of antibiotic resistance variables heterotrophic plate counts hpc nh4 n concentration and total chlorine concentration were physicochemical parameters significantly correlated with args p 0 05 fig 8 a table s7 specifically the total concentration of the observed iargs exhibited a strong positive correlation with nh4 n concentration fig 8a presenting a linear upward trend with an increase in the nh4 n concentration figs 8b and s9 collectively nh4 n is a key promoting factor for increasing iarg occurrence during chloramination 4 discussion chloramination has become a crucial process for maintaining chlorine residues in the dwtps to control microbiological growth and ensure water safety ministry of health of the pr china 2006 ngwenya et al 2013 usepa 1998 however this study showed for the first time that chloramination resulted in a relatively higher iarg enrichment than chlorination through metagenomics sequencing and then qpcr assays conducted throughout a whole year survey notably the findings showed that when the duration of chloramination was extended from 40 min to 90 min the relative iarg concentration increased evidently considering the wide application of chloramination for municipal water treatment attention should be paid to the promoting effects of extended chloramination on arg and arb occurrence at a global scale accumulating evidence has shown that some water disinfectants facilitate arg enrichment in water liu et al 2018 reported higher enrichment of arg levels in water from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp after disinfection with clo2 than in pre disinfection water using metagenomic sequencing shi et al 2013 documented that chlorine disinfection enriched the abundances of various args this phenomenon may be attributable to disinfectant induced horizontal gene transfer hgt previous studies revealed the high functionality of bacterial plasmid dna after peracetic acid disinfection which could be acquired by other microorganisms via hgt zhang et al 2019a 2019b jin et al 2020 further found that chlorination enhanced the horizontal transfer of functional plasmids which were released from killed bacteria to survival chlorine injured opportunistic pathogens through natural transformation resulting in arg exchange across bacterial genera and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by survivors alternately low chlorine doses or sub inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants free chlorine chloramine and hydrogen peroxide can also enhance the intragenera and intergenera conjugative transfer whose underlying mechanisms involved intracellular reactive oxygen species formation sos response increased cell membrane permeability and altered expressions of conjugation relevant genes guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ye et al 2022 found oxidative disinfection induced dormancy is the key to evaluating whether it can promote the plasmid mediated conjugative transfer of args as aforementioned the dominant enriched args in line 1 such as carbapenem resistance genes kpcs imps oxas and aminoglycoside modifying enzymes encoding genes aadas belonged to the resistance mechanism of antibiotic inactivation fig 3 and table s4 most of them were frequently found on the mobile genetic elements bennett 2008 de pascale and wright 2010 which make them more prone to horizontal transfer additionally one possible reason for arg enrichment was the co selection of disinfectant tolerance and antibiotic resistance khan et al 2016 demonstrated that the presence of chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water systems may carry an additional risk of antibiotic resistance hou et al 2019 found temporal physiological persistence to antibiotics in cultivable chlorine injured pathogens that survived the chlorination process besides bacterial community shift may be an indispensable fact contributing to the alteration in arg abundance during disinfection jia et al 2020 2015 bacterial sensitivity to disinfectants varies greatly leading to significant changes in microbial community structure under different disinfection strategies differentiated resistance to chloramination among bacteria potentially facilitated the certain arg enrichment in surviving bacterial community figs 5 and s3 and also possibly drove the co selection of chloramination tolerance and resistance to certain classes of antibiotics in bacteria this study found that the ability of 90 min chloramination to enhance iarg enrichment in water was stronger than that of 90 min chlorination for the first time after redundancy analysis between args and water quality indices the total concentration of the observed iargs exhibit a strong positive correlation with hpc nh4 n concentration and total chlorine concentration but only nh4 n concentration presented a linear upward trend with an increase in the iargs concentration nh4 n can enhance the transformation frequency of released plasmid rp4 from killed arb into culturable chlorine injured bacteria jin et al 2020 thus chloramination which led to a higher nh4 n concentration may promote the occurrence of natural transformation in water it facilitated the uptake of mobile genetic elements e g args released from killed bacteria into the surviving bacteria thereby resulting in iarg enrichment moreover liu et al 2018 also found that the total concentration of observed iargs was strongly positively correlated with the nh4 n concentration during clo2 treatment in the wwtp zhang et al 2015 reported that higher nh4 n concentrations led to lower arg removal efficiencies of chlorination disinfection thereby nh4 n may be one of crucial driving factors for iarg accumulation during chloramination for the eargs 90 min chlorination and 40 min chloramination increased their total concentration significantly in water but not the 90 min chloramination considering iargs or eargs detected by qpcr might be dysfunctional gene fragments not functional plasmid of hgt the potential health risk of iargs or eargs climb need to be evaluated in the future study importantly this study also revealed iarg enrichment declined if the duration of chloramination is shortened from 90 min to 40 min for the first time it may be explained by the findings that the frequency of conjugative transfer and dna transformation increased with the prolongation of mating time and incubation time of cells with dna guo et al 2015 kufryk et al 2002 because of the increase in arg enrichment with the extension of chloramine exposure time the problem of arb may become exacerbated if chloramine treated drinking water is stagnated in the dwds for a long time correspondingly the phenomena about lower enrichment of earg concentration in extended chloramination than shortened chloramine exposure was attributed to the possibility that eargs were transformed into surviving bacteria which led to the iarg enrichment similarity liang et al 2022 found the iarg concentration increased and earg concentration decreased in the sampling points along the dwds zhang et al 2020 reported that bacterial resistance to most antibiotics except for tetracycline increased with an increase in the stagnation time of pipe network water to 24 and 48 h in addition the use of chloramines resulting into elevation of ammonium nitrogen however can stimulate the growth of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms thereby promoting nitrification to remove ammonium nitrogen and generate nitrite or nitrate which pose great threat to public health potgieter et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 thus extended chloramination may pose public health risks and excellent candidate disinfectants are urgently needed moreover maintaining chlorine residues during chloramination by shortening the chloramine exposure time can help control arb spread in the dwds 5 conclusions in summary this study unveiled that chloramination led to higher iarg enrichment in dwtps than chlorination through metagenomic sequencing and qpcr assays and nh4 n is a crucial driving factor for iarg accumulation during chloramination differently chlorination facilitated eargs release than chloramination prolonged chloramination led to more severe arg contamination indicating that shortening the chloramine exposure time would be beneficial for arg control to the best of our current knowledge this is the first work that we comprehensively delineated the comparative effects of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water from dwtps

or chlorination was analyzed through metagenomic sequencing and then verified through quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr after the treatment of 90 min chloramination led to higher enrichment of the total relative abundance of intracellular args iargs in water than chlorination whereas chlorination facilitated the release of more extracellular args eargs than chloramination according to redundancy and pearson s analyses the total concentration of the observed iargs in the finished water exhibited a strong positive correlation with ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration presenting a linear upward trend with an increase in the nh4 n concentration this indicated that nh4 n is a crucial driving factor for iarg accumulation during chloramination iarg enrichment ceases if the duration of chloramination is shortened to 40 min suggesting that shortening the duration would be a better strategy for controlling iarg enrichment in drinking water these findings emphasized the

data will be made available on request 1 introduction increase in antibiotic resistance is gradually impairing the ability to treat infectious diseases posing a great threat to global public health antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause as many as 10 million casualties annually by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill 2015 therefore the increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args especially in drinking water systems is gradually becoming a hot research topic globally han et al 2020 hu et al 2021 ma et al 2017 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 this is because of the associated great human health risks including an increase in virulence pathogenicity disease outbreaks as well as the resulting morbidity hospitalization and mortality rates sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 safety of drinking water exiting from drinking water treatment plants dwtps is of paramount importance because of its vast influence on the health of millions of people generally primary disinfection in the dwtps is a necessary step for killing of pathogens and ensuring the microbiological safety of drinking water even so in the last few years arb and args have been detected frequently in chlorinated plant effluent han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 ma et al 2017 resulting in an increased risk of exposure to microbial hazards this is attributed to the possibilities that the traditional water treatment process of primary disinfection fails to remove arb and args from the source water sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 xu et al 2016 furthermore chlorine disinfection elevates arg accumulation in drinking water jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 moreover chlorination promotes the horizontal transfer of plasmids through natural transformation resulting in arg exchange across bacterial genera and the emergence of new arb jin et al 2020 given the serious threat of arb to public health the effect of primary disinfection method in the dwtps pichel et al 2019 on arg occurrence in the drinking water must be urgently evaluated nowadays primary disinfection in the dwtps is performed by chloramination and chlorination chloramination which are performed by introducing ammonia into the water to combine with free chlorine residues is gaining some popularity over chlorination mostly due to maintaining chlorine residues and the reduced formation of disinfection byproducts but possibly also because of its selective reactivity with biofilm components thereby achieving better biofilm penetration stalter et al 2016 stewart et al 1994 xue et al 2014 previous findings have showed that chlorine injured bacteria surviving sodium hypochlorite exposure presented a good physiological competence with an increased transformation frequency of rp4 plasmid up to 550 times compared with the untreated bacteria jin et al 2020 furthermore the water quality factor nh4 n could significantly facilitate the transformation frequencies of rp4 into the injured bacteria with the frequencies increasing with the increasing nh4 n concentration we thus speculated that chloramination which had higher nh4 n concentration in chloramine disinfected water may lead to higher iarg enrichment in dwtps than chlorination unfortunately the comparative effects of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water from dwtps have not been investigated herein one dwtp with chloramination and another with chlorination were chosen to analyze the antibiotic resistome in the filtered water and finished water through metagenomic sequencing furthermore to validate the change in arg occurrence after disinfection processes samples from the two dwtps were collected continuously for 1 year and then arg concentrations were quantified using qpcr assays the study investigated the comparative effect of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water and explored key water quality contributors which would guide the optimization of disinfection procedures in dwtps to help control global arb spread 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples from two dwtps located in tianjin city china were studied as shown in fig 1 dwtp1 uses two processes of chloramination for the same concentration of total chlorine 1 4 mg l one with a contact time of 90 min line 1 and another with a contact time of 40 min line 3 dwtp2 uses a process of chlorination where the contact time is again 90 min for 1 4 mg l total chlorine line 2 a total of 222 water samples including raw water rw filtered water before chlorination or chloramination at inlets of the clear water reservoirs and finished water after chlorination or chloramination at outlets of the clear water reservoirs were collected from the sampling sites between

adding 300 ml eluent 15 g l nacl 30 g l tryptone 15 g l beef extract 3 75 g l glycine and 0 28 g l naoh ph 9 3 0 2 and filtered through a polyethersulfone microporous membrane filter pore size 0 22 µm millipore bedford ma usa to remove bacteria the filtered elutes were incubated with twice the volume of isopropanol at room temperature for 16 h and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the precipitate was resuspended with 2 ml tris edta buffer ph 8 0 and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 5 arg quantification a total of 15 typical arg subtypes namely sulfonamide resistance gene

enhance cycling efficiencies all primers were synthesized by shenggong co ltd shanghai china table s2 the standard curves for arg quantification were obtained by analyzing 10 fold serial dilutions of target standards liang et al 2022 table s3 2 6 calculation of arg concentration the recovery and concentration of args were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 eargs recovery efficiency b c a

finished water samples were collected once a month from july to september and then used for metagenomic sequencing bacteria in 120 l water samples were enriched and intracellular dna were extracted according to above described in section 2 4 the extracted dna was sequenced using illumina novaseq pe150 novogene china raw data was processed to acquire the clean data using readfq v8 and then the clean data was assembled by megahit v1 0 4 li et al 2015b metagenemark v2 10 was used to predict open reading frames orfs for each scaftig with a minimum length of 500 bp the redundant orfs were removed and then unique initial gene unigene clusters were obtained by using cd hit v4 5 8 fu et al 2012 bowtie2 v2 2 4 was used to map the clean data to unigenes to get the number of mapped reads followed by calculation of gene abundances in each sample based on length of the gene and the number of mapped reads we used the diamond v0 9 9 software to blast the unigenes against the nonredundant nr database of ncbi for taxonomic annotations nr results with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 were adopted to take the lca algorithm system classification of megan huson et al 2011 according to the abundance of unigenes and taxonomic classification abundance information at each taxonomic level kingdom phylum class order family genus species was acquired the unigenes were aligned to the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database jia et al 2017a martinez et al 2015 mcarthur et al 2013 by the resistance gene identifier software by using blastp with an e value cutoff of 1e 30 the arg relative abundance was calculated by normalizing the matched sequencing reads to the total metagenomic sequences in each sample yin et al 2018 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism graphpad software inc la jolla ca usa and spss ibm spss inc chicago il usa student s t test was used for two group comparisons assuming equal variances and anova was used for multi group comparisons to analyze the correlation between args and bacterial communities spearman s correlation analysis was performed then network analysis was performed using gephi 0 9 2 software pearson s correlation analysis was performed to identify variable correlations between the nh4 n concentration and total iarg concentration data are presented as mean standard deviation sd differences were deemed statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 antibiotic resistome analysis through metagenomic sequencing during chloramination and chlorination to investigate the change in the antibiotic resistome in water after the implementation of disinfection strategies involving chloramination and chlorination metagenomic analysis was performed to provide insight into arg occurrence the total relative abundance of args in water sampled from the final outlets was significantly high fig 2 a p 0 001 the abundance was 1 9 times higher after 90 min chloramination in line 1 fig 2b chlorination for 90 min in line 2 also enriched arg abundance fig 2a which is consistent with the results of previous studies indicating that chlorination could elevate the total relative arg abundance in drinking water jia et al 2015 xu et al 2016 however enrichment after chlorination was only 1 1 times higher fig 2b p 0 05 no significant difference was observed between water samples from the filter station and final outlet after 40 min chloramination in line 3 fig 2a therefore chloramination led to higher arg enrichment in water than chlorination and extended chloramination led to further arg enrichment args were deemed as significantly enriched if they exhibited a fold change of 2 with a p value of less than 0 05 or were undetectable before disinfection but were detectable after disinfection with p value 0 05 after analyzing the change in arg abundance a total of 92 arg subtypes were identified to be significantly elevated in line 1 after disinfection table s4 the enrichment of 67 args most of which functioned as antibiotic inactivation and antibiotic efflux fig 3 a was higher or specifically enhanced in line 1 than in line 2 fig s1a the enrichment of 86 args most of which also functioned as antibiotic inactivation and antibiotic efflux fig 3b was higher in line 1 than in line 3 fig s1b generally genes conferring resistance to vancomycin polymyxins and carbapenems which have been considered as the last target to fight severe infections knox et al 2022 mandler et al 2018 wu and boger 2020 were referred to as last resort args largs liang et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the enrichment of largs such as kpc 14 gim 1 vanhf cau 1 ebr 1 beta lactamase imp 29 imp 13 imp 48 and ndm 14 was higher in line 1 than in the other lines fig s1a indicating that chloramination poses a potential threat to public health a total of 53 arg subtypes mostly acting as antibiotic efflux 31 args and antibiotic inactivation 15 args were positively detected in all water samples fig s2 figs 4 a and 4b table s5 which were defined as persistent args jia et al 2020 among these persistent args the enrichment of 12 args namely tcr3 msre smer smef mphd sed 1 adc 8 oxa 211 oxa 57 bacillus subtilis mprf tet44 and sul2 was higher after chloramination than after chlorination fig s1a table s4 however emrd qnrd1 and the drug efflux pump genes acrd and acrb that facilitate multiple antibiotic resistance alav et al 2021 tam et al 2021 were evidently enriched in the three lines 3 2 the potential host of increased args during chloramination accumulating evidence has revealed that the bacterial community structure shapes the antibiotic resistome jia et al 2017b su et al 2018 to explore the potential host of args network analysis was performed to illustrate the significant positive correlations spearman s coefficient r 0 8 p 0 01 between args and bacterial communities fig 5 presents the co existing network consisting of 137 nodes 89 bacterial species and 48 arg subtypes and 219 edges among the args in the network vantc vanhf tet39 tet33 r39 otra msre mphd mexv mefa crp brucella suis mprf and bacillus subtilis mprf were evidently enriched by 90 min chloramination table s4 among them r39 and mphd appeared most frequently in the network showing positive correlations with the same 10 bacterial species providencia alcalifaciens comamonas aquatica vittaforma corneae empedobacter falsenii proteobacteria bacterium sg bin5 acinetobacter rudis comamonas testosteroni alcaligenes faecalis stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter junii followed by tet39 and crp which co occurred with eight species e g acinetobacter rudis comamonas testosterone alcaligenes faecalis acinetobacter junii and providencia alcalifaciens surprisingly most of these bacteria were opportunist human pathogens alcaligenes faecalis huang 2020 acinetobacter junii hung et al 2009 comamonas testosteroni farooq et al 2017 and providencia alcalifaciens shah et al 2019 were opportunistic pathogens causing nosocomial infections and potentially coharbored tet39 r39 mphd and crp additionally the human pathogen vittaforma corneae mittleider et al 2002 was speculated to be the potential host of at least three enriched arg subtypes namely r39 mphd and crp while empedobacter falsenii zaman et al 2017 potentially harbored tet39 r39 msre and mphd stenotrophomonas maltophilia which is the third most common nosocomial infection causing pathogen with multidrug resistance that targets immunocompromised patients sader and jones 2005 was deemed as a potential host of two enriched arg subtypes including r39 and mphd providencia rettgeri an emerging nosocomial uropathogen sagar et al 2017 was found to correlate with crp generally the abundances of args carried by diverse potential hosts could vary drastically along with the potential host abundances li et al 2015a in the network the potential bacterial hosts of the aforementioned args enriched in line 1 elevated their abundance after 90 min chloramination fig s3 revealing the key role of bacterial community shift in the alteration of arg abundance undeniably such co occurrence patterns were determined solely by the prediction correlation methods and need to be further validated using the molecular detection assays 3 3 arg detection during chloramination and chlorination through qpcr to validate the changes in arg occurrence after chloramination and chlorination representative arg subtypes against tetracyclines sulfonamides macrolides quinolones aminoglycosides rifampicin chloramphenicol trimethoprim vancomycin carbapenems and polymyxin present in the water samples before and after disinfection were assayed throughout a year by using qpcr among the observed iargs blatem aada and teta were consistently found in all detected finished water with the detection frequency reaching 100 fig 6 a table s6 for iargs with a detection frequency of 90 in the finished water blatem aada teta sul1 tetm and vana occurred in line 1 whereas only blatem aada teta and tetm occurred in line 2 all the observed iargs in the finished water from line 1 except tetm and cata1 had identical or higher detection frequencies than the corresponding ones from line 2 especially nine iargs aada vana teta rpob1 mcr 1 ermb cata1 qnra and katg in line 1 and six iargs tetm teta rpob1 ermb cata1 and qnra in line 2 exhibited higher detection frequencies in the finished water than those in the filtered water eargs with detection frequencies of 90 in the finished water from line 1 were blatem sul1 vana and teta but all the observed eargs presented a detection frequency below 90 in the finished water from line 2 fig 6b table s6 except for aada all the observed eargs in the finished water from line 1 had higher detection frequencies than those from line 2 additionally detection frequencies of seven eargs sul1 teta blandm 1 mcr 1 ermb qnra and katg in line 1 and six eargs sul1 aada teta rpob1 dfra1 1 and katg in line 2 were higher in the finished water than in the filtered water meanwhile detection frequencies of iargs were generally higher than those of the corresponding eargs in the finished water from lines 1 and 2 fig s4 p 0 001 collectively these results indicated that compared with chlorination chloramination may help increase the levels of specific iargs in the finished water resulting in a higher detection frequency of iargs we investigated changes in relative concentration of iargs before and after chloramination and chlorination each iarg concentration fluctuated greatly during the sampling period fig s5 after summing up all observed iarg concentrations in the monthly collected samples the highest total iarg concentration after chloramination and chlorination was observed in january 2020 whereas the total iarg concentration remained low 1 copy 16s rrna gene during june 2020 to november 2022 after chloramination and chlorination figs s7a and s7b upper panels subsequently a comparison of the concentration of each iarg throughout the whole year revealed that the concentration of both intracellular blatem and aada was the highest after chloramination and chlorination figs s8a and s8b the total relative concentration of iargs was remarkably enhanced at the final outlet in comparison to that at the filter station p 0 05 whereas no significant difference was observed for line 2 fig 7 a obviously chloramination led to higher enrichment of iargs concentration than chlorination fig 7b in accordance with above metagenomic analysis simultaneously the monthly concentration of each earg in the finished water after chloramination or chlorination also fluctuated greatly during the sample period fig s6 the average total concentration of observed eargs generally fluctuated from 102 november 2020 to 106 gc l january 2020 figs s7a and s7b lower panels interestingly both iargs and eargs reached maximum concentrations in january when the water temperature remained the lowest consistent with the previous study that the median concentration of total iargs increased during the chlorination when water temperature was declined liu et al 2018 the median concentration of extracellular blatem was the highest after chloramination and chlorination followed by those of vana sul1 and aada figs s8d and s8e the total concentration of measured eargs reached 3 5 105 gc l and 1 58 105 gc l in the water sampled at the final outlets from lines 1 and 2 additionally the total concentration of the observed eargs at the filter station was significantly higher than that at the final outlet from line 1 p 0 05 whereas an opposite trend was observed for line 2 fig 7c thus chloramination led to lower enrichment of earg concentration than chlorination fig 7d 3 4 effect of chloramine exposure time on arg occurrence in dwtps the effect of chloramine exposure time on iarg occurrence in the finished water was also explored table s6 figs 6a s7a and s7c the detection frequency of only tetm in the finished water disinfected with chloramine for 90 min line 1 was lower whereas that of other iargs e g vana rpob1 dfra1 1 mcr 1 ermb cata1 and katg in the same finished water was identical or higher than the detection frequency in the finished water disinfected with chloramines for 40 min line 3 intracellular blakpc remained undetectable in all samples from lines 1 and 3 total iarg concentrations fluctuated considerably on a monthly basis during the whole year and reached maximum concentrations in january 2020 after 90 and 40 min chloramination figs s7a and s7c upper panels the concentrations of blatem aada and sul1 were the highest and the median concentrations of blatem and aada after 90 min chloramination were 8 05 10 2 and 5 12 10 2 copies 16s rrna gene which were higher than those after 40 min chloramination figs s8a and s8c a summation of the concentrations of all observed iargs exhibited no significant difference between samples before and after 40 min chloramine exposure p 0 05 fig 7a extracellular forms of blakpc were not detected in all samples from lines 1 and 3 table s6 fig 6b the earg concentration fluctuated sharply in lines 1 and 3 figs s7a and s7c lower panels presenting an increase in earg concentration from 102 to 106 gc l the gene blatem was the most abundant earg in the finished water from both line 1 and line 3 followed by sul1 aada tetm and vana figs s8d and s8f the total concentration of the observed eargs was significantly higher at the filter station than at the final outlet from line 1 whereas an opposite trend was observed for line 3 p 0 05 fig 7c thus extended chloramination led to lower enrichment of earg concentration than shortened chloramine exposure did fig 7d 3 5 key factors to promote args occurrence during chloramination redundancy analysis between args and water quality indices was performed to explore the key factors influencing arg enrichment during chloramination physicochemical parameters explained 72 9 of antibiotic resistance variables heterotrophic plate counts hpc nh4 n concentration and total chlorine concentration were physicochemical parameters significantly correlated with args p 0 05 fig 8 a table s7 specifically the total concentration of the observed iargs exhibited a strong positive correlation with nh4 n concentration fig 8a presenting a linear upward trend with an increase in the nh4 n concentration figs 8b and s9 collectively nh4 n is a key promoting factor for increasing iarg occurrence during chloramination 4 discussion chloramination has become a crucial process for maintaining chlorine residues in the dwtps to control microbiological growth and ensure water safety ministry of health of the pr china 2006 ngwenya et al 2013 usepa 1998 however this study showed for the first time that chloramination resulted in a relatively higher iarg enrichment than chlorination through metagenomics sequencing and then qpcr assays conducted throughout a whole year survey notably the findings showed that when the duration of chloramination was extended from 40 min to 90 min the relative iarg concentration increased evidently considering the wide application of chloramination for municipal water treatment attention should be paid to the promoting effects of extended chloramination on arg and arb occurrence at a global scale accumulating evidence has shown that some water disinfectants facilitate arg enrichment in water liu et al 2018 reported higher enrichment of arg levels in water from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp after disinfection with clo2 than in pre disinfection water using metagenomic sequencing shi et al 2013 documented that chlorine disinfection enriched the abundances of various args this phenomenon may be attributable to disinfectant induced horizontal gene transfer hgt previous studies revealed the high functionality of bacterial plasmid dna after peracetic acid disinfection which could be acquired by other microorganisms via hgt zhang et al 2019a 2019b jin et al 2020 further found that chlorination enhanced the horizontal transfer of functional plasmids which were released from killed bacteria to survival chlorine injured opportunistic pathogens through natural transformation resulting in arg exchange across bacterial genera and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by survivors alternately low chlorine doses or sub inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants free chlorine chloramine and hydrogen peroxide can also enhance the intragenera and intergenera conjugative transfer whose underlying mechanisms involved intracellular reactive oxygen species formation sos response increased cell membrane permeability and altered expressions of conjugation relevant genes guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ye et al 2022 found oxidative disinfection induced dormancy is the key to evaluating whether it can promote the plasmid mediated conjugative transfer of args as aforementioned the dominant enriched args in line 1 such as carbapenem resistance genes kpcs imps oxas and aminoglycoside modifying enzymes encoding genes aadas belonged to the resistance mechanism of antibiotic inactivation fig 3 and table s4 most of them were frequently found on the mobile genetic elements bennett 2008 de pascale and wright 2010 which make them more prone to horizontal transfer additionally one possible reason for arg enrichment was the co selection of disinfectant tolerance and antibiotic resistance khan et al 2016 demonstrated that the presence of chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water systems may carry an additional risk of antibiotic resistance hou et al 2019 found temporal physiological persistence to antibiotics in cultivable chlorine injured pathogens that survived the chlorination process besides bacterial community shift may be an indispensable fact contributing to the alteration in arg abundance during disinfection jia et al 2020 2015 bacterial sensitivity to disinfectants varies greatly leading to significant changes in microbial community structure under different disinfection strategies differentiated resistance to chloramination among bacteria potentially facilitated the certain arg enrichment in surviving bacterial community figs 5 and s3 and also possibly drove the co selection of chloramination tolerance and resistance to certain classes of antibiotics in bacteria this study found that the ability of 90 min chloramination to enhance iarg enrichment in water was stronger than that of 90 min chlorination for the first time after redundancy analysis between args and water quality indices the total concentration of the observed iargs exhibit a strong positive correlation with hpc nh4 n concentration and total chlorine concentration but only nh4 n concentration presented a linear upward trend with an increase in the iargs concentration nh4 n can enhance the transformation frequency of released plasmid rp4 from killed arb into culturable chlorine injured bacteria jin et al 2020 thus chloramination which led to a higher nh4 n concentration may promote the occurrence of natural transformation in water it facilitated the uptake of mobile genetic elements e g args released from killed bacteria into the surviving bacteria thereby resulting in iarg enrichment moreover liu et al 2018 also found that the total concentration of observed iargs was strongly positively correlated with the nh4 n concentration during clo2 treatment in the wwtp zhang et al 2015 reported that higher nh4 n concentrations led to lower arg removal efficiencies of chlorination disinfection thereby nh4 n may be one of crucial driving factors for iarg accumulation during chloramination for the eargs 90 min chlorination and 40 min chloramination increased their total concentration significantly in water but not the 90 min chloramination considering iargs or eargs detected by qpcr might be dysfunctional gene fragments not functional plasmid of hgt the potential health risk of iargs or eargs climb need to be evaluated in the future study importantly this study also revealed iarg enrichment declined if the duration of chloramination is shortened from 90 min to 40 min for the first time it may be explained by the findings that the frequency of conjugative transfer and dna transformation increased with the prolongation of mating time and incubation time of cells with dna guo et al 2015 kufryk et al 2002 because of the increase in arg enrichment with the extension of chloramine exposure time the problem of arb may become exacerbated if chloramine treated drinking water is stagnated in the dwds for a long time correspondingly the phenomena about lower enrichment of earg concentration in extended chloramination than shortened chloramine exposure was attributed to the possibility that eargs were transformed into surviving bacteria which led to the iarg enrichment similarity liang et al 2022 found the iarg concentration increased and earg concentration decreased in the sampling points along the dwds zhang et al 2020 reported that bacterial resistance to most antibiotics except for tetracycline increased with an increase in the stagnation time of pipe network water to 24 and 48 h in addition the use of chloramines resulting into elevation of ammonium nitrogen however can stimulate the growth of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms thereby promoting nitrification to remove ammonium nitrogen and generate nitrite or nitrate which pose great threat to public health potgieter et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 thus extended chloramination may pose public health risks and excellent candidate disinfectants are urgently needed moreover maintaining chlorine residues during chloramination by shortening the chloramine exposure time can help control arb spread in the dwds 5 conclusions in summary this study unveiled that chloramination led to higher iarg enrichment in dwtps than chlorination through metagenomic sequencing and qpcr assays and nh4 n is a crucial driving factor for iarg accumulation during chloramination differently chlorination facilitated eargs release than chloramination prolonged chloramination led to more severe arg contamination indicating that shortening the chloramine exposure time would be beneficial for arg control to the best of our current knowledge this is the first work that we comprehensively delineated the comparative effects of chloramination and chlorination on arg occurrence in drinking water from dwtps

provided in the supporting informations 1 introduction the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter dom play a critical role in a number of biogeochemical processes such as metal redox cycling dadi et al 2017 riedel et al 2013 microbial transformations lechtenfeld et al 2015 ohno et al 2014 riedel et al 2016 and photochemical processes bittar et al 2015 gonsior et al 2013 holt et al 2021 maizel et al 2017 riedel et al 2016 wilske et al 2020 in natural systems these processes are difficult to disentangle kellerman et al 2015 from the analytical point of view processes can be exclusively observed by concentration variations of components for example inorganic ions organic molecules the variation as function of time is one possibility for investigation of processes a negative or positive temporal trend of a specific component abundance is defined as degradation and product formation respectively also spatial abundance variations can be interpreted as processes depending on the reference system a component can be regarded as degraded produced if its concentration is decreased increased in one location of a system compared to another location of the same system such a system can be a reservoir and one location could be the epilimnion and the other one the hypolimnion if the reservoir is thermally stratified however without any additional information it is difficult to interpret concentration differences between epi and hypolimnion if a component is depleted accumulated in the epilimnion the question is was it consumed produced or did it keep unchanged and was as alternative interpretation produced consumed in the hypolimnion or even released resorbed from the sediment pore water by diffusion into the hypolimnion diffusion to the sediment another aspect is the detection of dom concentration differences themselves while the quantification of single components like nutrients nitrate ammonium metal ions anions or trace organic compounds like pharmaceuticals or pesticides in analytical standard methods are well established the analysis of dom comprises considerable difficulties due to the complexity of its composition dom probably consists of thousands or even millions of different organic compounds and the identification of the isomeric structure of each molecule is still far from any instrumental analytical realization hawkes et al 2018 herzsprung et al 2012 the up to date highest analytical resolution of dom can be achieved by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms hertkorn et al 2006 reemtsma 2009 this method is principally appropriate to differentiate abundances of mass features to which molecular formulas mfs can be assigned various limitations exist to determine the enormous complexity of organic molecules with fticr ms in combination with sampling and sample preparation it seems challenging to quantify each single compound in the totality of the dom in order to investigate transformation processes by far not all of the dom components can be detected by fticr ms because desalting is required a solid phase extraction spe or dialysis or reverse osmosis must be installed before analysis in the mass spectrometer molecules with high water solubility polarity are not retained on the cartridge whereas highly hydrophobic molecules might be retained but no longer eluted with an organic solvent raeke et al 2016 regarding this procedure the fticr ms analyzed dom is designated as spedom only the extractable dom dittmar et al 2008 raeke et al 2016 even the spedom composition cannot be analyzed completely the mass peak intensity is a function of ionization efficiency this efficiency will not be a function of the assigned elemental composition but of each possible isomer any data evaluation which bases on comparison of component abundances derived from fticr ms spectra from different samples has to suggest the same isomeric composition of mf in each considered sample the lower the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and dom quality differences between compared samples the better the mf abundances will be evaluable being aware of these limitations we present a new attempt on a semi quantitative level to show how dom transformation processes can be followed so far dom processes were often described by the use of bulk e g optical parameters bracchini et al 2010 howard et al 2021 painter et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 providing not sufficient resolution on a molecular basis more chemical resolution can be achieved by nmr which was used for investigation of dom transformation kida et al 2021 nmr can be regarded as bulk parameter as well because many molecules having the same structural subunits will contribute to a signal also studies using fticr ms results often used bulk parameters like the intensity weighted average number of components h c or o c ratios nosc nominal oxidation state of carbon and others or statistical methods like pca berg et al 2022 casas ruiz et al 2020 fudyma et al 2021 kellerman et al 2014 martinez perez et al 2017 osterholz et al 2018 wagner et al 2015 from those studies no details about the fate of single mf are available but trends which parts of the dom as specified by its oxygenation aromaticity molecular weight are reactive some studies including our recent approaches used formula by formula rank correlations with external parameters like the fluorescence intensity bacterial activity or chlorophyll or even the radiation dose herzsprung et al 2012 2020 kamjunke et al 2019 lavonen et al 2015 stubbins et al 2014 the resulting correlation coefficients and p values can indicate biogeochemical processes the dimensions orders of magnitude of mf abundance differences are not explored yet a more successful strategy addressing the fate of single mf are experiments where the start solution is compared with the reacted solution the mfs are categorized into a removed present in the start solution but not in the end solution b produced present in the end solution but not in the start solution and c resistant present in both solutions yuan et al 2017 tang et al 2022 this experiment design cannot distinguish between large abundance mfs which were no more found in the second sample and low abundance mfs just above the signal to noise ratio in the one sample and just below the signal to noise ratio in the other sample it may happen that a large start mf abundance corresponds to a just above the s n ratio in the second sample but regarded finally as resistant in addition many of the process oriented fticr ms studies do not report about the fate of single mf although the data are principally available but not for the readership in many studies there is a lack of providing raw data mfs and their intensities this is a research gap in combination with the incomplete evaluated resistant group we hypothesize therefore that the resistant mf group present both in a start and end sample or more generally in all samples of an experiment as function of time or space can be resolved for products and degraded mfs with pregnant abundance differences by introduction of new and appropriate evaluation techniques within this common presence pool we expect that a fraction remains with reliable resistance it is clear that fticr ms studies were performed where this common presence pool was included and dom transformations were evaluated by statistical means as mentioned above the abundance differences which will be specified in an equation in the methods section as δri will be regarded as proxy for the reactivity of a mf we hypothesize that mfs with extreme δri exist which we name key molecular formulas key mfs the key mfs may be of interest for the dom biogeochemistry community while the microbiology community already uses key players for investigation which are the bacteria mainly responsible for certain metabolism tanuwidjaja et al 2021 our hypothesis will be addressed by design of search strategies in fticr ms example data sets the used examples originate from photochemical experiment time variation and drinking water reservoir monitoring space and time variation herzsprung et al 2020 wilske et al 2021 2020 drinking water processing is an important environmental and health issue and dom components are suggested to influence flocculation costs and to act as disinfection byproduct precursors phungsai et al 2018 lavonen et al 2013 such issues justify the analytical expense fticr ms and advanced evaluation effort search for key mfs while it is not intended to provide a complete list with all elemental compositions and their quantified influence on drinking water processing in the present study we want to demonstrate the possibility to make dom transformations more comprehensible our intension is to provide new methodological evaluation tools for understanding dom turnover processes from available fticr ms elemental formula data sets with the new generated knowledge already existing elemental formula data sets might be reanalyzed our new judge and assessment methodology is structured as follows i calculation of relative intensity differences δris 2 1 from experiments where abundance differences are expected between start and end sample function of time or surface and bottom function of space ii simple search of key mfs use of data pairs start end or surface bottom 2 2 iii advanced search of key mfs use of data with more time seasonal space resolution 2 3 iv use of δri ranking for prove of multivariate similarities between the samples by hierarchical cluster analysis hca 2 4 v deeper statistical prove a statistically control was performed with description in si 3 and execution in mmc3 xlsx using the cox stuart cox and stuart 1955 and the wilcoxon wilcoxon 1945 test all steps are explained using following data sets photo experiment phot published in herzsprung et al 2020 reservoir muldenberg monitoring muld wilske et al 2021 reservoir rappbode monitoring rapp herzsprung et al 2020 2 methods 2 1 calculation of relative percentage intensity differences δris i samples have to be selected where a process relevant abundance difference is expected this can be a kinetical experiment where the end dom quality is expected to be different from the start time series another possibility are monitoring experiments where different mf abundances can be expected at different locations variation with space a lake or reservoir can be considered where during stratification different dom quality between surface and bottom can be suggested also different depths in sediment pore water might be compared where different dom quality might be induced by desorption adsorption or microbial processes thus for calculation of δris each two samples a sample pair is required which can be named sample x and sample y the general equation would be δ ri intensity sample x intensity sample y intensity sample y 100 the used ris base on the normalization on the total intensity flerus et al 2012 in our example the δris as key values are calculated by sample pairs of end versus start intensity in a photo experiment phot and surface versus bottom intensity in the reservoir monitoring the calculation principle is visualized in fig 1 using examples of sample pairs from phot end start and monitoring in reservoirs sampling month july surface bottom from muld and rapp background information about the three selected example data sets is available in si 1 1 these three data sets were merged to a joined data set finally named as total data set where only the shared components total common presence in all samples were considered as limitation one has to suggest that each component has the same isomeric composition in all samples this need of assumption is not only valid for our study but for all studies which used direct infusion fticr ms without chromatographic separation and without mass fragmentation a further limitation of the equation calculating relative differences is the fact that the information is lost whether these were major abundance mfs high importance for bulk dom or low abundance mfs little importance for bulk dom 2 2 simple search of key mfs ii the simple search bases on the idea to calculate the ranking of the δri values for each experiment and combining them to a rank sum for each mf by suggestion that the different experiments have to be combined for the key mf search the key mfs are simply the components with extreme positive or extreme negative rank sum values in our case the data subset was used as described in si 1 2 sample x means end sample of phot or surface sample from muld or rapp y means start sample from phot or bottom from muld or rapp see fig 1 for each data set phot muld rapp the ranks of the δri are calculated for all 1111 mfs finally the rank sum for each mf is calculated as shown in mmc2 xlsx sheet simple search column m as shown in the simple search sheet we selected the first ten with the lowest rank sum screenshot 6 si 2 3 1 and the last ten with the highest rank sum using autofilter in excel represents one simple possibility the lowest rank sum key mfs are defined to have positive reactivity products the highest rank sum key mfs are defined to have negative reactivity degraded it is clear that the number ten of key mfs was selected randomly just to show example results and one has to reflect about the weighting of the experiments which contribute to the rank sum this simple search method can be extended by including more specific steps depending on the special data sets and the scientific question 2 3 advanced search of key mfs iii if more data as function of time and or space are available the search of key mfs can be elaborated while the simple search strategy addresses experiments which generated data pairs start end surface bottom for example our advanced search is targeted to more valid interpretation of temporal and spatial biogeochemical processing 2 3 1 experiments with higher time resolution if more than two data points in a kinetical experiment are available the question is which data can be used as data pair x and y here we introduce one solution of potential more possibilities using median values as an example we use data from phot si 1 2 the reaction course is divided into three phases starting four measurements middle five measurements end four measurements sample x is defined as the median value of the end phase and sample y as the median value of the start phase si 2 1 equation 1b fig s1 it is clear that median values are more robust from a statistical and experimental point of view 2 3 2 monitoring with space and seasonal resolution in the reservoir samples which we use here as example several sample pairs x y surface bottom are available particularly at different seasons the δri values are calculated for all selected seasons in separate using equation 2 si 2 1 both for muld and rapp for the advanced key mf search only months with lake stratification were used because only at such times differences between x and y can be expected the temperature data which are the basis for suggestion of stratification are reported in the recent studies together with the data sets muld and rapp for muld three months june july august and for rapp four months june july august october were combined by calculation of the median δri values using equation 3 si 2 1 2 3 3 combination of 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 for ranking calculation the ranking of the median δri values as a normalization offers the possibility to combine both data sets in our case it is calculated in mmc2 xlsx sheet advanced search column o p q with the rank sum in column m before the smallest and highest rank sum values are searched for key mfs additional criteria are recommended to improve the robustness with regard to biogeochemical process interpretation 2 3 4 advanced criteria search of mfs with identical sign for δri for different sampling dates during the total stratification period in the reservoir monitoring one can assign biogeochemical reactivity only for components with identical sign for δri on each of the considered sampling dates for example in muld for all three months june july august with lake stratification regarding phot we expect for photo products that all experiment end time points t9 t12 show higher intensity compared to all start time points t0 t3 and for photo degraded components the opposite the principle of the following search equations is the question programmed in excel if a group of values is for reservoirs pairwise larger or smaller compared to the opposite group the details are shown in si 2 2 eqs 4a b 5a b 6a b the result of such equation question as excel equation reservoir as an example if and r i surface jun r i bottom jun r i surface jul r i bottom jul r i surface aug r i bottom aug 1 0 is in principle true or false 1 or 0 using autofilter the three data sets muld rapp phot can be combined by the same sign of reactivity if for all three the same result true resp false was found the implementation of all six equations is documented in the advanced criteria sheet of mmc2 xlsx with column addresses shown in si 2 2 if eqs 4a 5a 6a have the result 1 the component has positive reactivity product for eqs 4b 5b 6b the result 1 means negative reactivity degradation the result 0 for any of these eqs means no reactivity the possible combination of results of such equation questions can be translated in dom reactivity of the mfs using reactivity codes as follows 101010 photo product 6 characters equation sequence 4a 4b 5a 5b 6a 6b as explained in si 2 2 screenshot 1 5 010101 photo degraded 000000 non reactive 001010 microbial product no photo reactivity but positive reactivity in both reservoirs 000101 microbial degraded no photo reactivity but negative reactivity in both reservoirs all remaining codes like 000100 mean that no clear reactivity can be assigned to the corresponding mfs the assigned biogeochemical reactivities to all considered 1111 mfs are balanced number of mfs in table 1 and shown individually for all mfs in the advanced criteria column m reactivity codes shown in column n 2 3 5 combination of median δri values 2 3 3 with advanced criteria 2 3 4 by this process it can be verified that the via rank sum searched key mfs which address certain biogeochemical processing have the correct reactivity code the reactivity code is appropriate to select all mfs with the same defined biogeochemical reactivity practically it means that the reactivity codes and corresponding biogeochemical reactivities were copied from the advanced criteria sheet to the advanced search sheet in mmc2 xlsx the advanced key mf search continued with following steps search of photo product key mf reactivity code is set to 101010 column j using autofilter then the ten lowest values in column m rank sum are searched and the cells in column l labelled with photo product screenshot 7 si 2 3 2 the found key mfs are shown in screenshot 8 search of photo degraded key mf reactivity code is set to 010101 then the ten highest rank sum values are searched and the cells labelled with photo degraded search of microbial products reactivity code is set to 001010 an additional rank sum value column is available column n only the ranks of both reservoirs were added mf wise but the phot ranks were not considered then the ten lowest rank sum values are searched and the cells labelled with microbial product these mf data can be extracted and their phot median δri values can be plotted versus the reservoir median δri values in such plot the key mfs can be highlighted and the order of magnitude of δri differences between key mfs and residual mfs can be visualized as shown in fig 3 2 4 prove of multivariate similarities using hca iv as shown for the simple key mf search 2 2 and the advanced search 2 3 the δri values can be used for calculation of their ranking for each of the 1111 mfs a hca based on the ranked dataset distance is an option to find out similarities and dissimilarities between the sample pairs here the phot median end start sample pair is compared with reservoir sample pairs surface bottom for months with and without stratification for all 1111 mfs the ranking is calculated in the mmc2 xlsx sheet ranking for hca column m phot columns n t muld columns u aa rapp the ranks were used for calculation of a hca using ward s minimum variance method with squared euclidean distance for classification of all single sampling dates each seven for the reservoirs and one for phot ward 1963 the statistical assessments were executed in statistica version 13 3 the received dendrogram fig 2 clearly separates sampling dates during stratification in the reservoirs this implies that the subdivision of the waterbody by temperature gradient as the main driver for stratification is reflected in the dom quality analysis phot data clustered together with the reservoir sampling campaigns during stratification this is one more indicator for the influence of the thermocline 3 results and discussion the focus is on the methodological outcome of the presented data evaluation the selected data sets experiments studies are used as examples the δris are used for discussion how mfs illustrate biogeochemical processes 3 1 maximum δris represent key mfs the corresponding ri versus time or space plots 3 2 are appropriate examples to confirm suggested processes in 3 3 ri versus time or space plots are presented as examples to challenge the limitations of process interpretation drinking water reservoirs are one example 3 4 where the key mf search can be of environmental benefit 3 1 evaluation of the calculated δris phot clustered dendrogram in fig 2 together with the reservoir sampling campaigns during stratification within this cluster the muld jun aug samples clustered separately from the rapp jun oct samples this is not surprising since biogeochemical cycling might be different in reservoirs and depends on climatic conditions the october sample from rapp clustered together with the other sampling dates during stratification at this time point rapp was stratified in contrast to muld in october the muld october sample clustered together with time points from both reservoirs during a period without stratification without stratification the samples are clustered relatively mixed muld feb rapp dec muld dec muld oct and muld mar rapp jan rapp mar this suggests that the evaluated δris behave randomly indicating that there is no potential to effectively evaluate biogeochemical processes they are not visible the next step is to find out which of the 1111 components were mainly responsible for the observed differences in ranking between late spring summer months stratification and late autumn winter months no stratification one possibility to search for significant behavior of components was the search for components with positive or negative δris in all months with stratification 2 3 4 si 2 2 eqs 5a b 6a b a balance of this analysis is shown in table 1 the reactivities are defined and explained in 2 3 4 as largest group 155 mfs were found with negative reactivity in all summer months of both reservoirs and in phot the second largest group contains 116 mfs identified as photo products positive reactivity in all three data sets the non reactive group contains 102 mfs 71 components were identified as microbial products and 78 as microbially degraded the reactivity of all other components remains unclear and will not be further considered in this article the found reactivities can be compared with the results from our recent study columns h l in the advanced criteria sheet of mmc2 xlsx which used rank correlation with radiation dose phot and chla rapp reservoir monitoring a balance is shown in table s4 91 106 of 116 of the photo products were confirmed new results in column m by the former study 61 of the photo degraded components 52 of the microbial products 47 of the microbially degraded components and 41 of the non reactive components this demonstrates that principally reasonable reactivities can be found and assigned but many compounds remain where no clear reactivity can be derived for some components different reactivities were found as an example 6 components were found to be photo products in the present study but in the cited study herzsprung et al 2020 they were calculated as microbial products chla rad0 this is not surprising because we expect that the reactivity assignment is not completely independent from the applied search or calculation algorithms 3 2 search of key mfs it is not intended to allocate reactivities to all components considered in the present study instead we want to show how to find the components showing the largest reactivity highest δri values in all selected three experiments a simple way simple search is the use of the calculated ranking as shown in mmc2 xlsx sheet simple search here the evidently most reactive mfs are highlighted after combination of three experiments but without any further suggestions in the advanced search 2 3 additional selection criteria were introduced the expectation that key mfs show the same reactivity in all three compared data sets except for the suggested microbial transformations where no photo reactivity was found the sum of ranks for key mfs for both the simple 2 2 and the advanced 2 3 search are shown in table s2 the simple search did not show exactly the same key mfs like the advanced search in the following we rely on the key mfs found in the advanced search ten components with the lowest sum value of ranks products c9h12o6 c9h12o5 c10h16o6 c10h16o7 c11h14o7 c11h18o7 c10h14o6 c10h14o5 c11h16o5 c9h12o4 and ten with the highest sum value degraded c20h16o14 c19h14o13 c17h14o13 c18h14o13 c17h12o12 c18h12o12 c20h16o13 c18h16o14 c19h16o14 c21h16o13 were listed as searched in advanced search sheet using autofilter for column j reactivity code and m rank sum the ten components with the lowest rank sum all photo products are relative aliphatic h c 1 3 and their number of carbon atoms is low 9 11 in contrast the found photo degraded components with the highest rank sum are relative aromatic h c 1 and oxygen rich o c 0 6 with higher number of carbon atoms 17 23 while the ranking of δris shown in table s2 is a robust search which component is more or less reactive it does not provide information about the quantitative relations e g if a component has 20 or 100 more reactivity in order to give a first impression of the dimensions of the relations of reactivities between components phot δris equation 1b si 2 1 are plotted versus the reservoir median δris equation 3 si 2 1 and shown in fig 3 the photo product key mfs found in table s2 with potential high reactivity are shown by their formulas key photo products are highlighted in fig 3 key photo degraded mfs in fig s2 evidently photo products exist with more than five fold δri compared to others from this group fig 3 for example c9h12o6 all results depend on the definition of the equations 1 3 in si 2 1 and selection of samples the intention is not to present an optimized calculation but moreover a reasonable idea of many possible ones to compare components reactivities in a simple semi quantitative manner the search strategy using δri is in the focus the absolute δri values of degraded components are lower compared to those values of the photo products fig s2 versus fig 3 partly caused by the calculation algorithm the 20 listed key mfs table s2 show in all data sets comparably high absolute δri values within the respective reactivity groups accordingly microbial products can be searched by the lowest rank sum if the value for phot is excluded from the rank sum calculation fig s3 and table s3 and the reactivity code is set as 001010 in the advanced search sheet key mfs can be further checked if the ris can be combined to meaningful profiles using all available data from the joint data set ris are plotted versus radiation dose phot and versus season and depth muld rapp for this purpose a procedure programmed in excel mmc2 xlsx for displaying dom component profiles is introduced in si 12 in fig s9 the plots of the photo product having lowest rank sum table s2 are shown the ri of the photo product c9h12o6 increased nearly monotonously in phot fig s9 a and the final intensity nearly doubled compared to the initial intensity the data from rapp fig s9 e g showed a significantly elevated c9h12o6 intensity at the surface water epilimnion during stratification months for this component the same effect was observed in muld samples fig s9 c here the stratification ended already in october according to the available data muld showed elevated epilminetic c9h12o6 intensity at the beginning of the following stratification period in 2016 as photo degraded component c20h16o14 showed nearly monotonous decreasing intensity in phot fig s19 a both in rapp and muld samples depleted intensity was measured during stratification fig s19 c e g the profiles of all 30 found key mfs are shown systematically arranged in si 9 11 figs s14 s18 photo products figs s19 s23 photo degraded components figs s24 s28 microbial products as an example for a microbial product the profiles from c10h10o7 fig s7 a c e g show elevated epilimnion intensities in both reservoirs but rather decreasing intensity in phot regarding the c9h12o6 profile in fig s9 a it can be shown which properties we expect from a photo product first the intensity must be significantly higher at the end of the irradiation experiment fig s9 a second we expect that in natural waters or managed waters lakes or reservoirs the intensity is increased in a water body e g epilimnion receiving more solar radiation dose compared to a water body with attenuated radiation hypolimnion this is the case for c9h12o6 in fig s9 c muld and e g rapp as shown in the methods section fig 1 this expectation can be written as equations and used as search algorithm table 1 shows that reasonable reactivity groups can be found as discussed in our recent study herzsprung et al 2020 it is hardly possible to discriminate between exclusively photochemically produced or degraded compounds and those where microbial activity contributed in addition one has to consider that photo products might be microbially available possible priming effect bianchi 2012 fudyma et al 2021 kuzyakov 2010 olefeldt et al 2013 this discussion is addressed in si 5 2 fig s4 3 3 limitations of assignment of reactivity types threshold criteria have to be set for search routines according to the defined equations 4 6 si 2 2 which can be regarded as thresholds mfs could be assigned to reactivity groups table 1 the mf c10h10o7 shows clearly no trend of intensity increase over the total period of phot and the final intensity was smaller compared to the start intensity fig s7 a photo production of this mf can be excluded from that plot since epilimnetic intensity increase was observed in both reservoirs for this mf microbial production can be suggested a similar mf c10h12o7 showed significant intensity increase during phot and epilimnetic intensity increase in both reservoirs fig s7 b as conclusion both c10h10o7 and c10h12o7 must have different biogeochemical reactivity as it was calculated by the defined thresholds c8h10o6 and c8h10o5 also have similar compositions c8h10o6 has been calculated as microbial product and c8h10o5 as photo product however the photo degradation profiles of these two mfs fig s8 a b are not such different as those profiles of the compared pair c10h10o7 and c10h12o7 fig s7 a b only the first five time points show different reactivity increasing intensity for c8h10o5 and more or less constant intensity for c8h10o6 fig s8 a the final 8 time points show nearly no ri variation for both mfs these observations show as an example that c8h10o6 is not rather appropriate to be selected as key mf microbial product see fig s3 and table s3 concerning clarity of reactivity assignment as a counterexample for c10h10o7 it is much clearer that it must have been microbially produced rather than photochemically fig s7 a c e the selected threshold criteria are just an idea amongst many other possibilities it is clear that assignment of reactivity types to mfs will depend on threshold criteria as shown above and in the si many profiles were found which confirmed that selected threshold criteria were to some extend reasonable but not in all cases for further elucidation six mfs were selected as an example to compare them for assigning clear biogeochemical reactivity by discussion of the ri versus radiation dose or versus depth plots and consulting rank correlation data from our previous study herzsprung et al 2020 for this purpose figs s9 s11 are discussed subsequently to fig s11 in si 6 it can be finally stated that pure statistical analysis is useful herlemann et al 2014 osterholz et al 2018 to describe biogeochemical turnover of dom but evidently not sufficient to confirm clear reactivity for all assigned mfs plotting of the ris versus time and or space can achieve more clarity of dom reactivity our intension was just to implement a methodology to find out mfs with maximum δri the three selected data sets are appropriate to derive clear statements about processes from ri versus time or space plots it is clear that processes can be easier derived from batch experiments here photo degradation or a stratified lake or reservoir with the assumption of low water mass exchange the process oriented interpretation of δri in rivers or marine ecosystems might be more complicated however search of maximum δri will contribute to understanding of dom transformations 3 4 practicality of the key mf search with respect to drinking water production mfs from reservoir monitoring were already identified to be potential precursors of disinfection byproducts as discussed recently herzsprung et al 2020 phungsai et al 2016 2018 with our key mf search it can be verified which precursors are most important and which show high reactivity as indicated by δri for example c10h14o6 has been identified as a key photo product fig 4 a and precursor phungsai et al 2016 for muld its intensity remained at relative low level red profile fig 4c at the water subtraction depth and the bottom layers between spring and late summer august 2015 in september after mixing homogenized its vertical distribution it subsequently dropped continuously over the wintertime in contrast to this the polyphenol like mf c19h14o13 decreased from august to september fig 4d and afterwards increased this knowledge might be used by the water works authority e g by adapting the water subtraction depth in order to avoid undesired dom mfs e g disinfection byproduct precursors or polyphenol likes the latter ones would cause more flocculation costs because of precipitation with iron or aluminum salts andersson et al 2020 lavonen et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 if higher spatial resolution is available like in rapp 8 9 different depths fig 4e f g h a better adaptation of the subtraction depth is possible it seems also practical to simply use lake temperature data which reflect the stratification situation as a proxy if the seasonal patterns remain relatively stable within the year our results suggest that photo products which can act as disinfection byproduct precursors phungsai et al 2018 generally accumulate in eplimnetic waters and vice versa polyphenol likes are depleted there because of photo degradation δris of key mfs evidently can be used as proxies for the properties of dom precursor flocculation relevance the relevance of the key mfs addressing their abundance in the mass spectrum compared to all other assigned mfs has been tested the found key mfs have mainly abundances much larger than the signal to noise ratio details in si7 fig s12 4 conclusions this study presents an evaluation method for fticr ms data sets in order to find out key mfs which reveal high biogeochemical reactivity within the very complex dom pool the main outcomes are the hypothesis that the pool with apparently resistant mfs present in all samples of an experiment can be resolved to products degraded mfs and reliable resistant mfs could be convincingly confirmed the search strategies confirmed in part biogeochemical reactivities of mfs which were statistically evaluated by rank correlation in recent studies ri versus time or space plots for single mf are appropriate to proof the suggested biogeochemical reactivities the δri values from different data sets can be plotted versus each other photo experiment versus reservoir stratification and let space for biogeochemical interpretations photo products with extreme δri values can be found as key mfs some key mfs could be identified as potential disinfection byproduct precursors or important for flocculation processes the reactivity of mfs can be discriminated in a at least semi quantitative way just stating component a is more reactive compared to component b under preconditions c the resulting question is whether it is reasonable in any case to evaluate all mass peak data which are available in its completeness or would it be more effective to select key mfs as proxies for dom transformation processes it is promising to further differentiate only key mfs by chromatographic fractionation or ms ms fragmentation to get more insights into the isomeric

15041,the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom is of relevance for global carbon cycling and important for drinking water processing also the detection of variation of dom composition as function of time and space from a methodological viewpoint is essential to observe dom processing and was addressed so far high resolution concerning dom quality was achieved with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms however almost none of the existing fticr ms data sets were evaluated addressing the fate of single mass features molecular formulas mfs abundance during experiments in contrast to former studies we analyze the function of mf abundance of time and space for such mfs which are present in all samples and which were formerly claimed as recalcitrant in not all but a great number of studies for the first time the reactivity of mfs was directly compared by their abundance differences using a simple equation the relative intensity difference δri search strategies to find out the maximum δri values are introduced the corresponding mfs will be regarded as key mfs key mfs in order to test this new approach data from a recent photo degradation experiment were combined with monitoring surveys conducted in two drinking water reservoirs the δri values varied over one order of magnitude more than five fold mfs like c9h12o6 and c10h14o6 revealed high biogeochemical reactivity as photo products some of the key mfs were identical with mfs identified as disinfection byproducts precursors in recent studies other key mfs were oxygen rich and relatively unsaturated poly phenol like and hence relevant to flocculation procedures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom key molecular formulas high

provided in the supporting informations 1 introduction the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter dom play a critical role in a number of biogeochemical processes such as metal redox cycling dadi et al 2017 riedel et al 2013 microbial transformations lechtenfeld et al 2015 ohno et al 2014 riedel et al 2016 and photochemical processes bittar et al 2015 gonsior et al 2013 holt et al 2021 maizel et al 2017 riedel et al 2016 wilske et al 2020 in natural systems these processes are difficult to disentangle kellerman et al 2015 from the analytical point of view processes can be exclusively observed by concentration variations of components for example inorganic ions organic molecules the variation as function of time is one possibility for investigation of processes a negative or positive temporal trend of a specific component abundance is defined as degradation and product formation respectively also spatial abundance variations can be interpreted as processes depending on the reference system a component can be regarded as degraded produced if its concentration is decreased increased in one location of a system compared to another location of the same system such a system can be a reservoir and one location could be the epilimnion and the other one the hypolimnion if the reservoir is thermally stratified however without any additional information it is difficult to interpret concentration differences between epi and hypolimnion if a component is depleted accumulated in the epilimnion the question is was it consumed produced or did it keep unchanged and was as alternative interpretation produced consumed in the hypolimnion or even released resorbed from the sediment pore water by diffusion into the hypolimnion diffusion to the sediment another aspect is the detection of dom concentration differences themselves while the quantification of single components like nutrients nitrate ammonium metal ions anions or trace organic compounds like pharmaceuticals or pesticides in analytical standard methods are well established the analysis of dom comprises considerable difficulties due to the complexity of its composition dom probably consists of thousands or even millions of different organic compounds and the identification of the isomeric structure of each molecule is still far from any instrumental analytical realization hawkes et al 2018 herzsprung et al 2012 the up to date highest analytical resolution of dom can be achieved by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms hertkorn et al 2006 reemtsma 2009 this method is principally appropriate to differentiate abundances of mass features to which molecular formulas mfs can be assigned various limitations exist to determine the enormous complexity of organic molecules with fticr ms in combination with sampling and sample preparation it seems challenging to quantify each single compound in the totality of the dom in order to investigate transformation processes by far not all of the dom components can be detected by fticr ms because desalting is required a solid phase extraction spe or dialysis or reverse osmosis must be installed before analysis in the mass spectrometer molecules with high water solubility polarity are not retained on the cartridge whereas highly hydrophobic molecules might be retained but no longer eluted with an organic solvent raeke et al 2016 regarding this procedure the fticr ms analyzed dom is designated as spedom only the extractable dom dittmar et al 2008 raeke et al 2016 even the spedom composition cannot be analyzed completely the mass peak intensity is a function of ionization efficiency this efficiency will not be a function of the assigned elemental composition but of each possible isomer any data evaluation which bases on comparison of component abundances derived from fticr ms spectra from different samples has to suggest the same isomeric composition of mf in each considered sample the lower the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and dom quality differences between compared samples the better the mf abundances will be evaluable being aware of these limitations we present a new attempt on a semi quantitative level to show how dom transformation processes can be followed so far dom processes were often described by the use of bulk e g optical parameters bracchini et al 2010 howard et al 2021 painter et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 providing not sufficient resolution on a molecular basis more chemical resolution can be achieved by nmr which was used for investigation of dom transformation kida et al 2021 nmr can be regarded as bulk parameter as well because many molecules having the same structural subunits will contribute to a signal also studies using fticr ms results often used bulk parameters like the intensity weighted average number of components h c or o c ratios nosc nominal oxidation state of carbon and others or statistical methods like pca berg et al 2022 casas ruiz et al 2020 fudyma et al 2021 kellerman et al 2014 martinez perez et al 2017 osterholz et al 2018 wagner et al 2015 from those studies no details about the fate of single mf are available but trends which parts of the dom as specified by its oxygenation aromaticity molecular weight are reactive some studies including our recent approaches used formula by formula rank correlations with external parameters like the fluorescence intensity bacterial activity or chlorophyll or even the radiation dose herzsprung et al 2012 2020 kamjunke et al 2019 lavonen et al 2015 stubbins et al 2014 the resulting correlation coefficients and p values can indicate biogeochemical processes the dimensions orders of magnitude of mf abundance differences are not explored yet a more successful strategy addressing the fate of single mf are experiments where the start solution is compared with the reacted solution the mfs are categorized into a removed present in the start solution but not in the end solution b produced present in the end solution but not in the start solution and c resistant present in both solutions yuan et al 2017 tang et al 2022 this experiment design cannot distinguish between large abundance mfs which were no more found in the second sample and low abundance mfs just above the signal to noise ratio in the one sample and just below the signal to noise ratio in the other sample it may happen that a large start mf abundance corresponds to a just above the s n ratio in the second sample but regarded finally as resistant in addition many of the process oriented fticr ms studies do not report about the fate of single mf although the data are principally available but not for the readership in many studies there is a lack of providing raw data mfs and their intensities this is a research gap in combination with the incomplete evaluated resistant group we hypothesize therefore that the resistant mf group present both in a start and end sample or more generally in all samples of an experiment as function of time or space can be resolved for products and degraded mfs with pregnant abundance differences by introduction of new and appropriate evaluation techniques within this common presence pool we expect that a fraction remains with reliable resistance it is clear that fticr ms studies were performed where this common presence pool was included and dom transformations were evaluated by statistical means as mentioned above the abundance differences which will be specified in an equation in the methods section as δri will be regarded as proxy for the reactivity of a mf we hypothesize that mfs with extreme δri exist which we name key molecular formulas key mfs the key mfs may be of interest for the dom biogeochemistry community while the microbiology community already uses key players for investigation which are the bacteria mainly responsible for certain metabolism tanuwidjaja et al 2021 our hypothesis will be addressed by design of search strategies in fticr ms example data sets the used examples originate from photochemical experiment time variation and drinking water reservoir monitoring space and time variation herzsprung et al 2020 wilske et al 2021 2020 drinking water processing is an important environmental and health issue and dom components are suggested to influence flocculation costs and to act as disinfection byproduct precursors phungsai et al 2018 lavonen et al 2013 such issues justify the analytical expense fticr ms and advanced evaluation effort search for key mfs while it is not intended to provide a complete list with all elemental compositions and their quantified influence on drinking water processing in the present study we want to demonstrate the possibility to make dom transformations more comprehensible our intension is to provide new methodological evaluation tools for understanding dom turnover processes from available fticr ms elemental formula data sets with the new generated knowledge already existing elemental formula data sets might be reanalyzed our new judge and assessment methodology is structured as follows i calculation of relative intensity differences δris 2 1 from experiments where abundance differences are expected between start and end sample function of time or surface and bottom function of space ii simple search of key mfs use of data pairs start end or surface bottom 2 2 iii advanced search of key mfs use of data with more time seasonal space resolution 2 3 iv use of δri ranking for prove of multivariate similarities between the samples by hierarchical cluster analysis hca 2 4 v deeper statistical prove a statistically control was performed with description in si 3 and execution in mmc3 xlsx using the cox stuart cox and stuart 1955 and the wilcoxon wilcoxon 1945 test all steps are explained using following data sets photo experiment phot published in herzsprung et al 2020 reservoir muldenberg monitoring muld wilske et al 2021 reservoir rappbode monitoring rapp herzsprung et al 2020 2 methods 2 1 calculation of relative percentage intensity differences δris i samples have to be selected where a process relevant abundance difference is expected this can be a kinetical experiment where the end dom quality is expected to be different from the start time series another possibility are monitoring experiments where different mf abundances can be expected at different locations variation with space a lake or reservoir can be considered where during stratification different dom quality between surface and bottom can be suggested also different depths in sediment pore water might be compared where different dom quality might be induced by desorption adsorption or microbial processes thus for calculation of δris each two samples a sample pair is required which can be named sample x and sample y the general equation would be δ ri intensity sample x intensity sample y intensity sample y 100 the used ris base on the normalization on the total intensity flerus et al 2012 in our example the δris as key values are calculated by sample pairs of end versus start intensity in a photo experiment phot and surface versus bottom intensity in the reservoir monitoring the calculation principle is visualized in fig 1 using examples of sample pairs from phot end start and monitoring in reservoirs sampling month july surface bottom from muld and rapp background information about the three selected example data sets is available in si 1 1 these three data sets were merged to a joined data set finally named as total data set where only the shared components total common presence in all samples were considered as limitation one has to suggest that each component has the same isomeric composition in all samples this need of assumption is not only valid for our study but for all studies which used direct infusion fticr ms without chromatographic separation and without mass fragmentation a further limitation of the equation calculating relative differences is the fact that the information is lost whether these were major abundance mfs high importance for bulk dom or low abundance mfs little importance for bulk dom 2 2 simple search of key mfs ii the simple search bases on the idea to calculate the ranking of the δri values for each experiment and combining them to a rank sum for each mf by suggestion that the different experiments have to be combined for the key mf search the key mfs are simply the components with extreme positive or extreme negative rank sum values in our case the data subset was used as described in si 1 2 sample x means end sample of phot or surface sample from muld or rapp y means start sample from phot or bottom from muld or rapp see fig 1 for each data set phot muld rapp the ranks of the δri are calculated for all 1111 mfs finally the rank sum for each mf is calculated as shown in mmc2 xlsx sheet simple search column m as shown in the simple search sheet we selected the first ten with the lowest rank sum screenshot 6 si 2 3 1 and the last ten with the highest rank sum using autofilter in excel represents one simple possibility the lowest rank sum key mfs are defined to have positive reactivity products the highest rank sum key mfs are defined to have negative reactivity degraded it is clear that the number ten of key mfs was selected randomly just to show example results and one has to reflect about the weighting of the experiments which contribute to the rank sum this simple search method can be extended by including more specific steps depending on the special data sets and the scientific question 2 3 advanced search of key mfs iii if more data as function of time and or space are available the search of key mfs can be elaborated while the simple search strategy addresses experiments which generated data pairs start end surface bottom for example our advanced search is targeted to more valid interpretation of temporal and spatial biogeochemical processing 2 3 1 experiments with higher time resolution if more than two data points in a kinetical experiment are available the question is which data can be used as data pair x and y here we introduce one solution of potential more possibilities using median values as an example we use data from phot si 1 2 the reaction course is divided into three phases starting four measurements middle five measurements end four measurements sample x is defined as the median value of the end phase and sample y as the median value of the start phase si 2 1 equation 1b fig s1 it is clear that median values are more robust from a statistical and experimental point of view 2 3 2 monitoring with space and seasonal resolution in the reservoir samples which we use here as example several sample pairs x y surface bottom are available particularly at different seasons the δri values are calculated for all selected seasons in separate using equation 2 si 2 1 both for muld and rapp for the advanced key mf search only months with lake stratification were used because only at such times differences between x and y can be expected the temperature data which are the basis for suggestion of stratification are reported in the recent studies together with the data sets muld and rapp for muld three months june july august and for rapp four months june july august october were combined by calculation of the median δri values using equation 3 si 2 1 2 3 3 combination of 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 for ranking calculation the ranking of the median δri values as a normalization offers the possibility to combine both data sets in our case it is calculated in mmc2 xlsx sheet advanced search column o p q with the rank sum in column m before the smallest and highest rank sum values are searched for key mfs additional criteria are recommended to improve the robustness with regard to biogeochemical process interpretation 2 3 4 advanced criteria search of mfs with identical sign for δri for different sampling dates during the total stratification period in the reservoir monitoring one can assign biogeochemical reactivity only for components with identical sign for δri on each of the considered sampling dates for example in muld for all three months june july august with lake stratification regarding phot we expect for photo products that all experiment end time points t9 t12 show higher intensity compared to all start time points t0 t3 and for photo degraded components the opposite the principle of the following search equations is the question programmed in excel if a group of values is for reservoirs pairwise larger or smaller compared to the opposite group the details are shown in si 2 2 eqs 4a b 5a b 6a b the result of such equation question as excel equation reservoir as an example if and r i surface jun r i bottom jun r i surface jul r i bottom jul r i surface aug r i bottom aug 1 0 is in principle true or false 1 or 0 using autofilter the three data sets muld rapp phot can be combined by the same sign of reactivity if for all three the same result true resp false was found the implementation of all six equations is documented in the advanced criteria sheet of mmc2 xlsx with column addresses shown in si 2 2 if eqs 4a 5a 6a have the result 1 the component has positive reactivity product for eqs 4b 5b 6b the result 1 means negative reactivity degradation the result 0 for any of these eqs means no reactivity the possible combination of results of such equation questions can be translated in dom reactivity of the mfs using reactivity codes as follows 101010 photo product 6 characters equation sequence 4a 4b 5a 5b 6a 6b as explained in si 2 2 screenshot 1 5 010101 photo degraded 000000 non reactive 001010 microbial product no photo reactivity but positive reactivity in both reservoirs 000101 microbial degraded no photo reactivity but negative reactivity in both reservoirs all remaining codes like 000100 mean that no clear reactivity can be assigned to the corresponding mfs the assigned biogeochemical reactivities to all considered 1111 mfs are balanced number of mfs in table 1 and shown individually for all mfs in the advanced criteria column m reactivity codes shown in column n 2 3 5 combination of median δri values 2 3 3 with advanced criteria 2 3 4 by this process it can be verified that the via rank sum searched key mfs which address certain biogeochemical processing have the correct reactivity code the reactivity code is appropriate to select all mfs with the same defined biogeochemical reactivity practically it means that the reactivity codes and corresponding biogeochemical reactivities were copied from the advanced criteria sheet to the advanced search sheet in mmc2 xlsx the advanced key mf search continued with following steps search of photo product key mf reactivity code is set to 101010 column j using autofilter then the ten lowest values in column m rank sum are searched and the cells in column l labelled with photo product screenshot 7 si 2 3 2 the found key mfs are shown in screenshot 8 search of photo degraded key mf reactivity code is set to 010101 then the ten highest rank sum values are searched and the cells labelled with photo degraded search of microbial products reactivity code is set to 001010 an additional rank sum value column is available column n only the ranks of both reservoirs were added mf wise but the phot ranks were not considered then the ten lowest rank sum values are searched and the cells labelled with microbial product these mf data can be extracted and their phot median δri values can be plotted versus the reservoir median δri values in such plot the key mfs can be highlighted and the order of magnitude of δri differences between key mfs and residual mfs can be visualized as shown in fig 3 2 4 prove of multivariate similarities using hca iv as shown for the simple key mf search 2 2 and the advanced search 2 3 the δri values can be used for calculation of their ranking for each of the 1111 mfs a hca based on the ranked dataset distance is an option to find out similarities and dissimilarities between the sample pairs here the phot median end start sample pair is compared with reservoir sample pairs surface bottom for months with and without stratification for all 1111 mfs the ranking is calculated in the mmc2 xlsx sheet ranking for hca column m phot columns n t muld columns u aa rapp the ranks were used for calculation of a hca using ward s minimum variance method with squared euclidean distance for classification of all single sampling dates each seven for the reservoirs and one for phot ward 1963 the statistical assessments were executed in statistica version 13 3 the received dendrogram fig 2 clearly separates sampling dates during stratification in the reservoirs this implies that the subdivision of the waterbody by temperature gradient as the main driver for stratification is reflected in the dom quality analysis phot data clustered together with the reservoir sampling campaigns during stratification this is one more indicator for the influence of the thermocline 3 results and discussion the focus is on the methodological outcome of the presented data evaluation the selected data sets experiments studies are used as examples the δris are used for discussion how mfs illustrate biogeochemical processes 3 1 maximum δris represent key mfs the corresponding ri versus time or space plots 3 2 are appropriate examples to confirm suggested processes in 3 3 ri versus time or space plots are presented as examples to challenge the limitations of process interpretation drinking water reservoirs are one example 3 4 where the key mf search can be of environmental benefit 3 1 evaluation of the calculated δris phot clustered dendrogram in fig 2 together with the reservoir sampling campaigns during stratification within this cluster the muld jun aug samples clustered separately from the rapp jun oct samples this is not surprising since biogeochemical cycling might be different in reservoirs and depends on climatic conditions the october sample from rapp clustered together with the other sampling dates during stratification at this time point rapp was stratified in contrast to muld in october the muld october sample clustered together with time points from both reservoirs during a period without stratification without stratification the samples are clustered relatively mixed muld feb rapp dec muld dec muld oct and muld mar rapp jan rapp mar this suggests that the evaluated δris behave randomly indicating that there is no potential to effectively evaluate biogeochemical processes they are not visible the next step is to find out which of the 1111 components were mainly responsible for the observed differences in ranking between late spring summer months stratification and late autumn winter months no stratification one possibility to search for significant behavior of components was the search for components with positive or negative δris in all months with stratification 2 3 4 si 2 2 eqs 5a b 6a b a balance of this analysis is shown in table 1 the reactivities are defined and explained in 2 3 4 as largest group 155 mfs were found with negative reactivity in all summer months of both reservoirs and in phot the second largest group contains 116 mfs identified as photo products positive reactivity in all three data sets the non reactive group contains 102 mfs 71 components were identified as microbial products and 78 as microbially degraded the reactivity of all other components remains unclear and will not be further considered in this article the found reactivities can be compared with the results from our recent study columns h l in the advanced criteria sheet of mmc2 xlsx which used rank correlation with radiation dose phot and chla rapp reservoir monitoring a balance is shown in table s4 91 106 of 116 of the photo products were confirmed new results in column m by the former study 61 of the photo degraded components 52 of the microbial products 47 of the microbially degraded components and 41 of the non reactive components this demonstrates that principally reasonable reactivities can be found and assigned but many compounds remain where no clear reactivity can be derived for some components different reactivities were found as an example 6 components were found to be photo products in the present study but in the cited study herzsprung et al 2020 they were calculated as microbial products chla rad0 this is not surprising because we expect that the reactivity assignment is not completely independent from the applied search or calculation algorithms 3 2 search of key mfs it is not intended to allocate reactivities to all components considered in the present study instead we want to show how to find the components showing the largest reactivity highest δri values in all selected three experiments a simple way simple search is the use of the calculated ranking as shown in mmc2 xlsx sheet simple search here the evidently most reactive mfs are highlighted after combination of three experiments but without any further suggestions in the advanced search 2 3 additional selection criteria were introduced the expectation that key mfs show the same reactivity in all three compared data sets except for the suggested microbial transformations where no photo reactivity was found the sum of ranks for key mfs for both the simple 2 2 and the advanced 2 3 search are shown in table s2 the simple search did not show exactly the same key mfs like the advanced search in the following we rely on the key mfs found in the advanced search ten components with the lowest sum value of ranks products c9h12o6 c9h12o5 c10h16o6 c10h16o7 c11h14o7 c11h18o7 c10h14o6 c10h14o5 c11h16o5 c9h12o4 and ten with the highest sum value degraded c20h16o14 c19h14o13 c17h14o13 c18h14o13 c17h12o12 c18h12o12 c20h16o13 c18h16o14 c19h16o14 c21h16o13 were listed as searched in advanced search sheet using autofilter for column j reactivity code and m rank sum the ten components with the lowest rank sum all photo products are relative aliphatic h c 1 3 and their number of carbon atoms is low 9 11 in contrast the found photo degraded components with the highest rank sum are relative aromatic h c 1 and oxygen rich o c 0 6 with higher number of carbon atoms 17 23 while the ranking of δris shown in table s2 is a robust search which component is more or less reactive it does not provide information about the quantitative relations e g if a component has 20 or 100 more reactivity in order to give a first impression of the dimensions of the relations of reactivities between components phot δris equation 1b si 2 1 are plotted versus the reservoir median δris equation 3 si 2 1 and shown in fig 3 the photo product key mfs found in table s2 with potential high reactivity are shown by their formulas key photo products are highlighted in fig 3 key photo degraded mfs in fig s2 evidently photo products exist with more than five fold δri compared to others from this group fig 3 for example c9h12o6 all results depend on the definition of the equations 1 3 in si 2 1 and selection of samples the intention is not to present an optimized calculation but moreover a reasonable idea of many possible ones to compare components reactivities in a simple semi quantitative manner the search strategy using δri is in the focus the absolute δri values of degraded components are lower compared to those values of the photo products fig s2 versus fig 3 partly caused by the calculation algorithm the 20 listed key mfs table s2 show in all data sets comparably high absolute δri values within the respective reactivity groups accordingly microbial products can be searched by the lowest rank sum if the value for phot is excluded from the rank sum calculation fig s3 and table s3 and the reactivity code is set as 001010 in the advanced search sheet key mfs can be further checked if the ris can be combined to meaningful profiles using all available data from the joint data set ris are plotted versus radiation dose phot and versus season and depth muld rapp for this purpose a procedure programmed in excel mmc2 xlsx for displaying dom component profiles is introduced in si 12 in fig s9 the plots of the photo product having lowest rank sum table s2 are shown the ri of the photo product c9h12o6 increased nearly monotonously in phot fig s9 a and the final intensity nearly doubled compared to the initial intensity the data from rapp fig s9 e g showed a significantly elevated c9h12o6 intensity at the surface water epilimnion during stratification months for this component the same effect was observed in muld samples fig s9 c here the stratification ended already in october according to the available data muld showed elevated epilminetic c9h12o6 intensity at the beginning of the following stratification period in 2016 as photo degraded component c20h16o14 showed nearly monotonous decreasing intensity in phot fig s19 a both in rapp and muld samples depleted intensity was measured during stratification fig s19 c e g the profiles of all 30 found key mfs are shown systematically arranged in si 9 11 figs s14 s18 photo products figs s19 s23 photo degraded components figs s24 s28 microbial products as an example for a microbial product the profiles from c10h10o7 fig s7 a c e g show elevated epilimnion intensities in both reservoirs but rather decreasing intensity in phot regarding the c9h12o6 profile in fig s9 a it can be shown which properties we expect from a photo product first the intensity must be significantly higher at the end of the irradiation experiment fig s9 a second we expect that in natural waters or managed waters lakes or reservoirs the intensity is increased in a water body e g epilimnion receiving more solar radiation dose compared to a water body with attenuated radiation hypolimnion this is the case for c9h12o6 in fig s9 c muld and e g rapp as shown in the methods section fig 1 this expectation can be written as equations and used as search algorithm table 1 shows that reasonable reactivity groups can be found as discussed in our recent study herzsprung et al 2020 it is hardly possible to discriminate between exclusively photochemically produced or degraded compounds and those where microbial activity contributed in addition one has to consider that photo products might be microbially available possible priming effect bianchi 2012 fudyma et al 2021 kuzyakov 2010 olefeldt et al 2013 this discussion is addressed in si 5 2 fig s4 3 3 limitations of assignment of reactivity types threshold criteria have to be set for search routines according to the defined equations 4 6 si 2 2 which can be regarded as thresholds mfs could be assigned to reactivity groups table 1 the mf c10h10o7 shows clearly no trend of intensity increase over the total period of phot and the final intensity was smaller compared to the start intensity fig s7 a photo production of this mf can be excluded from that plot since epilimnetic intensity increase was observed in both reservoirs for this mf microbial production can be suggested a similar mf c10h12o7 showed significant intensity increase during phot and epilimnetic intensity increase in both reservoirs fig s7 b as conclusion both c10h10o7 and c10h12o7 must have different biogeochemical reactivity as it was calculated by the defined thresholds c8h10o6 and c8h10o5 also have similar compositions c8h10o6 has been calculated as microbial product and c8h10o5 as photo product however the photo degradation profiles of these two mfs fig s8 a b are not such different as those profiles of the compared pair c10h10o7 and c10h12o7 fig s7 a b only the first five time points show different reactivity increasing intensity for c8h10o5 and more or less constant intensity for c8h10o6 fig s8 a the final 8 time points show nearly no ri variation for both mfs these observations show as an example that c8h10o6 is not rather appropriate to be selected as key mf microbial product see fig s3 and table s3 concerning clarity of reactivity assignment as a counterexample for c10h10o7 it is much clearer that it must have been microbially produced rather than photochemically fig s7 a c e the selected threshold criteria are just an idea amongst many other possibilities it is clear that assignment of reactivity types to mfs will depend on threshold criteria as shown above and in the si many profiles were found which confirmed that selected threshold criteria were to some extend reasonable but not in all cases for further elucidation six mfs were selected as an example to compare them for assigning clear biogeochemical reactivity by discussion of the ri versus radiation dose or versus depth plots and consulting rank correlation data from our previous study herzsprung et al 2020 for this purpose figs s9 s11 are discussed subsequently to fig s11 in si 6 it can be finally stated that pure statistical analysis is useful herlemann et al 2014 osterholz et al 2018 to describe biogeochemical turnover of dom but evidently not sufficient to confirm clear reactivity for all assigned mfs plotting of the ris versus time and or space can achieve more clarity of dom reactivity our intension was just to implement a methodology to find out mfs with maximum δri the three selected data sets are appropriate to derive clear statements about processes from ri versus time or space plots it is clear that processes can be easier derived from batch experiments here photo degradation or a stratified lake or reservoir with the assumption of low water mass exchange the process oriented interpretation of δri in rivers or marine ecosystems might be more complicated however search of maximum δri will contribute to understanding of dom transformations 3 4 practicality of the key mf search with respect to drinking water production mfs from reservoir monitoring were already identified to be potential precursors of disinfection byproducts as discussed recently herzsprung et al 2020 phungsai et al 2016 2018 with our key mf search it can be verified which precursors are most important and which show high reactivity as indicated by δri for example c10h14o6 has been identified as a key photo product fig 4 a and precursor phungsai et al 2016 for muld its intensity remained at relative low level red profile fig 4c at the water subtraction depth and the bottom layers between spring and late summer august 2015 in september after mixing homogenized its vertical distribution it subsequently dropped continuously over the wintertime in contrast to this the polyphenol like mf c19h14o13 decreased from august to september fig 4d and afterwards increased this knowledge might be used by the water works authority e g by adapting the water subtraction depth in order to avoid undesired dom mfs e g disinfection byproduct precursors or polyphenol likes the latter ones would cause more flocculation costs because of precipitation with iron or aluminum salts andersson et al 2020 lavonen et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 if higher spatial resolution is available like in rapp 8 9 different depths fig 4e f g h a better adaptation of the subtraction depth is possible it seems also practical to simply use lake temperature data which reflect the stratification situation as a proxy if the seasonal patterns remain relatively stable within the year our results suggest that photo products which can act as disinfection byproduct precursors phungsai et al 2018 generally accumulate in eplimnetic waters and vice versa polyphenol likes are depleted there because of photo degradation δris of key mfs evidently can be used as proxies for the properties of dom precursor flocculation relevance the relevance of the key mfs addressing their abundance in the mass spectrum compared to all other assigned mfs has been tested the found key mfs have mainly abundances much larger than the signal to noise ratio details in si7 fig s12 4 conclusions this study presents an evaluation method for fticr ms data sets in order to find out key mfs which reveal high biogeochemical reactivity within the very complex dom pool the main outcomes are the hypothesis that the pool with apparently resistant mfs present in all samples of an experiment can be resolved to products degraded mfs and reliable resistant mfs could be convincingly confirmed the search strategies confirmed in part biogeochemical reactivities of mfs which were statistically evaluated by rank correlation in recent studies ri versus time or space plots for single mf are appropriate to proof the suggested biogeochemical reactivities the δri values from different data sets can be plotted versus each other photo experiment versus reservoir stratification and let space for biogeochemical interpretations photo products with extreme δri values can be found as key mfs some key mfs could be identified as potential disinfection byproduct precursors or important for flocculation processes the reactivity of mfs can be discriminated in a at least semi quantitative way just stating component a is more reactive compared to component b under preconditions c the resulting question is whether it is reasonable in any case to evaluate all mass peak data which are available in its completeness or would it be more effective to select key mfs as proxies for dom transformation processes it is promising to further differentiate only key mfs by chromatographic fractionation or ms ms fragmentation to get more insights into the isomeric

15042,surface complexation of arsenite as iii on colloidal ferric hydroxide cfh plays an important role not only in the adsorptive immobilization of as iii but also in the subsequent oxidation of as iii to arsenate as v through light induced ligand to metal charge transfer lmct in water at near neutral ph however the effects of natural organic matter nom especially humic substances hss and low molecular weight carboxylic acids cas on the photochemistry of the cfh as iii system have not been sufficiently understood in this work the inhibition of photooxidation of as iii in terms of the observed apparent rate constant k obs by six hss below 16 mg l 1 and seven cas below 2 5 mm has been observed in water containing 66 μm fe iii and 5 μm as iii at ph 7 under simulated solar irradiation consisting of uva λmax 365 nm and uvb λmax 313 nm lights total inhibition factors t have been determined from the combined effect of light screening factor s and competitive complexation factor c wherein both s and c varied with nom concentration s was obtained by determining the absorbance of nom and c was obtained by fitting modified langmuir or freundlich models to the amount of as iii desorbed from cfh upon the addition of nom statistical analysis between the experimental t exp and the calculated one according to t cal s c showed that the freundlich model rmse for hs 0 1609 and for ca 0 1771 was better than the langmuir model and was statistically robust q loo 2 0 691 0 5 this work provided an estimation method for the effects of nom on as iii photooxidation in the presence of cfh as well as a deeper understanding of the transformation of arsenic species in sunlit water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords colloidal ferric hydroxide arsenic species natural organic matter photooxidation light screening competitive complexation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photochemical transformation is an important environmental fate of pollutants vione and scozzaro 2019 photochemical processes of natural organic matter nom not only alter its intrinsic properties sharpless et al 2014 but also affect the fates of inorganic substances and organic pollutants luo et al 2012 wang et al 2012 and can inactivate bacteria romero et al 2011 in sunlit surface waters such processes involve the generation of reactive species and the light screening effect caused by intrinsic absorbance due to the wide distribution high abundance and high photoactivity of nom its environmental photochemistry especially of humic substances hss and low molecular weight carboxylic acids cas has been investigated much more extensively barbeau et al 2001 cottrell et al 2013 fujii and otani 2017 than that of other photoactive substances in natural waters such as no3 and h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 mack and bolton 1999 attention has been paid to photochemical processes in the fe iii nom system for many years mainly in relation to the following three aspects i photodegradation and property changes of nom as a ligand of iron gu et al 2017 sato et al 2021 ii photoreduction of fe iii to bioavailable fe ii and implications for the biogeochemical iron cycle melton et al 2014 wang et al 2017 iii photochemical transformation of pollutants in the presence of both iron and nom wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 as regards the last aspect many investigations have been focused on organic pollutants while far fewer have dealt with inorganic pollutants in these few studies focused on inorganic pollutants nom was normally treated as a coexisting compound to investigate its macroscopic effects revealing its light screening effect and or scavenging effect but mechanistic details were not fully delineated chin et al 2004 liu et al 2018 the oxidation of inorganic arsenic from as iii to as v has attracted attention for decades due to its wide contamination higher toxicity and mobility of as iii in our previous work we investigated the photochemical oxidation of as iii on nascent colloidal ferric hydroxides cfh revealing the photochemical conversion mechanism of arsenic species at circumneutral conditions which proceeded through electron transfer from as iii to fe iii induced by the absorption of radiation at a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct band xu et al 2014 however the environmental photochemical processes of cfh as iii complex have not been fully revealed especially the influence of nom prevalent in natural water on the interaction between cfh and as iii and the photochemical oxidation processes of as iii some previous studies have indicated that light and dissolved organic matter dom were important for the transformation of arsenic species by generating excited triplet and or phenolic oxygen radicals kim et al 2019 and iron further promoted photosensitization oxidation of as iii in the presence of dissolved organic carbon buschmann et al 2005 but the transformation mechanism of as iii from the interaction of arsenic iron and nom has not been fully clarified yet the concentrations of nom in natural water are at mg l 1 level mojela et al 2022 parveen and goel 2022 though photochemical oxidation of as iii induced by fe iii nom complex has been reported previously hug et al 2001 that a high dosage of nom e g citrate favors as iii oxidation in our previous work we observed inhibitory effects of 11 kinds of low molecular weight nom including cas and phenols at low dosage 10 μm on cfh induced photooxidation of as iii huang et al 2021 correlation analysis between the properties of nom molecular weight element composition functional groups etc and the observed apparent rate constant k obs showed the inhibitory efficiency to be structure dependent relating to its complexation ability with iron in fact interactions and competitions between arsenic iron species and nom have been widely studied inorganic arsenic can be adsorbed on the surface of iron hydr oxide and co existing arsenic and iron can be complexed by organic matter liu et al 2011 some work even suggests the formation of ternary complexes of arsenic iron nom hoffmann et al 2013 although this remains debatable due to incomplete evidence and a lack of information on the molecular structures of the ternary species in contrast competitive adsorption between arsenic species and nom on iron hydr oxides has been more extensively reported reflecting the inhibitory effect of nom on arsenic adsorption on iron oxides interactions with nom are known to modify the stability and surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides adusei gyamfi et al 2019 all of these processes would undoubtedly influence the formation of cfh as iii complex arco lazaro et al 2016 giasuddin et al 2007 and hence influence the photooxidation efficiency of as iii moreover the light screening effect was not considered in our previous work because most low molecular weight nom does not absorb light in the uv range in contrast hss as important components of nom consist predominantly of polyphenols and benzoic carboxylic acids buffle 1990 which absorb significantly in both the uv and visible wavelength ranges and so may have multiple effects on the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cfh the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of nom on the photochemical oxidation process in the cfh as iii system for this 13 kinds of nom including 6 kinds of hss 0 16 mg l 1 and 7 kinds of cas 0 2500 μm were used as typical nom uv vis spectroscopy was used to observe the absorption spectra of nom itself and the formation of the cfh nom complex the light screening effect was calculated from the absorbance of nom at the corresponding wavelength the complexation abilities of nom and as iii with cfh were investigated by competitive desorption experiments an estimation model describing the effect of nom has been constructed by calculating the total inhibition combining the light screening effect and the competitive complexation effect in the natural environment where both nom and iron exist this study of the effect on photooxidation of as iii would enhance our understanding of the geochemical cycle and fate of arsenic in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification detailed

solution to control the ph during the reactions text s5 and fig s6 all experiments were conducted in an open atmosphere and performed in triplicate average values and error bars are presented in each figure 2 3 uv vis spectrum experiments uv vis spectra of nom with or without fe iii and as iii were recorded on a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1601 in a quartz cuvette pipes was also added to control the ph and each solution was pre equilibrated by stirring in the dark for 1 h before scanning 2 4 competitive desorption of as iii the contents of as iii in the supernatants of mixed solutions containing 66 μm fe iii 5 μm as iii 5 mm pipes and nom after centrifugation were measured as the amount of nom added varied the mixtures were prepared in 50 ml colorimetric tubes gently mixed by inverting the tubes shaken in a water bath 25 c for 2 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min prior to analysis of as iii concentrations 2 5 analysis methods the concentrations of as iii and as v were determined by liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc hg afs bohui instrument co ltd beijing china the concentrations of h2o2 were measured by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase pod spectrophotometry bader et al 1988 the chemical species of fe iii and their distributions in the presence of oxalic acid were simulated with medusa software http www inorg kth se medusa statistical parameters including root mean square error rmse and leave one out method q loo 2 were calculated based on matlab software version 26 to evaluate the fitting effect and robustness of the model full details are given in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nom on the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of fe iii control experiments were conducted at ph 7 as iii alone fe iii as iii and nom as iii reaction systems as iii was rapidly oxidized in the presence of fe iii and no photooxidation occurred in the absence of fe iii fig s7 which is consistent with our previous work and reflects the lmct process between cfh and adsorbed as iii xu et al 2014 the observed initial rate of photooxidation of as iii was around 0 225 μm min 1 with 66 μm fe iii 5 μm as iii and 5 5 mw cm 2 uva irradiation in contrast to the photooxidation of as iii by suwannee river humic acid under irradiation from a medium pressure mercury lamp buschmann et al 2005 the rate was negligible in our work with either 16 mg l 1 hs equal to 2 37 12 3 μm depending on their molar mass table s3 or 2500 μm ca as shown in figs s8 and s9 which might be due to the discrepancies in light sources and nom structures between the two works therefore photooxidation of as iii induced by nom can be excluded in this work nevertheless such positive effect by mere nom should still be considered at higher nom concentrations and under stronger solar irradiation 1 r k o b s a s i i i f e i i i k obs a s i i i 2 ln c c 0 k obs t next the effects of various concentrations of nom on photooxidation of as iii with cfh were investigated the kinetic results of concentration change with time under uva or uvb irradiation are shown in figs s10 and s11 hss and figs s12 and s13 cas the rates of photooxidation of as iii should be affected by the concentrations of both fe iii and as iii while the changes of concentrations of fe iii can be neglected eq 1 and the kinetic results could be linearly fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model using the data from the initial 20 min eq 2 the obtained apparent rate constants of photooxidation of as iii k obs with various concentrations of hss or cas are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively on the whole k obs decreased with the concentrations of nom increasing in the presence of cfh under either uva or uvb irradiation values of k obs under uvb irradiation were significantly higher than that under uva irradiation which could be rationalized in terms of quantum yields matafonova and batoev 2018 specifically over a comparatively wide range of hs concentrations 0 16 mg l 1 inhibition of photooxidation of as iii was the predominant result the precise inhibition extent on k obs is dependent on the structure of the respective hs for instance when the concentrations of fa or ha reached a certain value these acids completely inhibited the oxidation of as iii whereas the same concentrations of rnom did not have such a comprehensive inhibitory effect our previous work huang et al 2021 which investigated how the low concentrations of ca inhibited the photooxidation of as iii induced by cfh found a positive correlation between k obs and the number of cooh group and a negative correlation between k obs and the number of oh group or nh2 group reports concerning alkali metal salts of humic acids have indicated that mono di and trihydroxy derivatives of benzoic acid were likely to be the basic structural units from which humic acids are constructed giannakopoulos et al 2005 nakayasu et al 1999 thus these functional groups may be important factors in the inhibition of photooxidation of as iii the inhibitory effects of cas were similar to those of hss except for high concentrations of oxalic citric and malic acids photooxidation of as iii was significantly inhibited when the concentrations of maleic lactic succinic acid as well as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta increased over a low range 0 50 μm but the rates leveled off when their concentrations increased further low concentrations of oxalic citric and malic acids also inhibited oxidation of as iii as reported previously huang et al 2021 but promoted it when their concentrations increased to a certain level this is commonly accepted to be due to the formation of photoactive fe iii carboxylate complexes feng and nansheng 2000 whose promotion effect on photooxidation of as iii is discussed in detail in the next section 3 2 possible mechanisms for the effects of nom the possible mechanisms involved in the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cfh and nom are shown in scheme 1 in brief three aspects may play the role 1 light screening effect photochemical reaction of cfh as iii complex may be inhibited by any nom that has specific light absorption in the uv vis region the nature of this effect is attenuation of the light intensity available for the photochemical reaction of the target photoactive species 2 competitive complexation effect photochemical oxidation of as iii on cfh as iii complex may be inhibited by nom that has a stronger complexing ability than as iii oxyanion in this case nom may destroy the surface complexation of as iii oxyanion on cfh at neutral ph thereby cutting off the lmct process 3 photolysis effect photochemical oxidation of as iii may be enhanced by nom through photosensitizing oxidation photo fenton like oxidation and or photooxidation with h2o2 the uv vis absorption spectra of fe iii as iii nom alone and or in binary or ternary systems were determined and shown in figs s14 and s15 the spectral changes especially the appearance of characteristic peaks are commonly attributed to the formation of complexes benesi and hildebrand 1949 though cfh as iii complex is considered to be formed in an fe iii as iii binary solution at ph 7 the absorbance of such a solution did not show observable changes compared to an fe iii solution this can be attributed to the low dosage of as iii fe iii as iii 66 5 in this work much lower than fe iii as iii 10 66 7 333 3 in our previous work xu et al 2014 and the low molar absorptivity of cfh as iii complex the aqueous solutions of each hs alone had distinct colors indicating strong light absorption capacity whereas the ca alone showed insignificant absorbance interestingly the absorbances of cfh nom mixtures were slightly or obviously higher than that of cfh alone revealing the complexation of cfh with each nom whether hs or ca specifically the absorbance of cfh hs complexes is slightly higher than that of hs alone since hs already has instinct absorbance whereas the absorbance of cfh ca complexes seemed to be much higher than that of ca alone as ca does not absorb light it should be noted that such significant increases in ca systems only occurred at high concentration conditions and the promotion effect was not obvious when the concentrations of ca were low the absorbances of cfh as iii nom ternary mixture solutions were very similar to those of cfh nom binary mixture solutions due to the strong interaction between cfh and nom albeit with relatively large differences in the molar absorptivity of each complex complexation between iron species and nom has been widely studied some researchers believe that coordinative adsorption ligand exchange between carboxyl hydroxyl functional groups of nom and the surface of metal hydr oxide is the predominant mechanism for hs adsorption gu et al 1994 guan et al 2006 similar to that of ca it is considered that the presence of nom enhances the mobility of arsenic species in the soil sediment environment by competitive adsorption or dissolving soil minerals williams et al 2011 it has been reported that dom competes with as iii for binding on mineral surfaces such as those of alumina goethite and hematite bauer and blodau 2006 redman et al 2002 moreover many previous studies have indicated the competitive effect resulting in the mobilization of sb or as from mineral surfaces by cas ha or other nom deng et al 2019 shi et al 2009 wu et al 2019 cfh as a special form of iron particles will undoubtedly show similar roles when as iii and nom co existed photosensitizing oxidation is normally considered when evaluating the photochemistry of nom nom absorbs light and is thereby excited to the triplet state 3nom which transfers the energy to ground state oxygen to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 such a process need only be considered for hs since the absorbances of cas are insignificant the photochemical reactions of as iii and nom 16 mg l 1 for hs and 2500 μm for ca in the absence of fe iii showed no obvious as iii oxidation figs s8 and s9 suggesting that 1o2 is not a powerful oxidant for as iii oxidation at neutral ph since it is easily quenched by water jiang et al 2017 meanwhile photo fenton like reaction that may produce various ros o2 h2o2 and ho through photolysis of cfh nom complex plays an important role in the photooxidation of as iii only when the conditions ph fe iii nom ratio etc are favorable zhang et al 2006 zhao et al 2022 these ros are relevant to each other in the presence of reductive species such as fe ii ding et al 2018 and cu i wu et al 2022 which can activate o2 then the identification and contribution of h2o2 were analyzed in detail in text s7 though h2o2 can be detected in cfh hs systems with 16 mg l 1 hs table s2 its concentrations were too low to make contributions to photooxidation of as iii and it only reached a sufficient level in the presence of specific ca at high concentrations figs s16 and s17 therefore the inhibition effect of nom on photooxidation of as iii would still be the main result when the concentrations of nom were at the level of natural water 100 101 mg l 1 mojela et al 2022 parveen and goel 2022 and the third aspect could be neglected in our following discussion only the first two aspects having a negative effect were considered without the contribution of ros as iii is only oxidized through the lmct process of the cfh as iii complex and based on the theory of quantum yield the observable photooxidation rate of as iii r would be proportional to the concentration of the cfh as iii complex and the light that can be absorbed by the complex and the detailed description was shown in text s8 the two key factors were affected by the competitive effect of nom and the absorbance of the reaction system respectively then in order to describe the inhibition quantitively the total inhibition factor t of nom on photooxidation of as iii is defined as the ratio of the reaction rates in the presence and absence of nom r and r 0 respectively eqs 3 and 4 according to the pseudo first order model r and r 0 are the products of the reaction rate constant k obs and k obs0 respectively and the initial concentration of as iii eq 1 therefore the inhibition factor t can be simplified to the ratio of reaction rate constants in the presence and absence of nom which can be obtained from the kinetic experiment results recorded as t exp eq 3 meanwhile based on the theory of quantum yield φ r can also be simply expressed as the product of e the utilizable light intensity and the concentration of cfh as iii complex recorded as t cal eq 4 where e is an integrated constant of φ absorption area and other constants 3 t e x p r r 0 k o b s a s i i i k o b s 0 a s i i i 0 k o b s k o b s 0 4 t c a l r r 0 e i a b s c f h a s i i i e i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i 0 i a b s i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 the ratio of the utilizable light intensities in the presence and absence of nom can be defined as s reflecting the inhibition factor caused by light screening eq 5 and the ratio of the concentrations of cfh as iii complex in the presence and absence of nom can be defined as c reflecting the inhibition factor caused by competitive complexation eq 6 according to eqs 3 6 the relationship between factors t s and c was derived as eq 7 s and c are determined and discussed in detail in the following sections 5 s i a b s i a b s 0 6 c c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 7 t c a l i a b s i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 s c 3 3 light screening effect as discussed above hs has relatively strong absorbances at the uva and uvb wavelengths whereas those of cas are insignificant figs s14 and s15 though cfh nom complex showed higher absorbance than nom itself the enhancement for hs is not strong and that for ca at low concentration is also not very significant hence to simplify the quantitative analysis and model calculation the light screening effect is only considered for hs itself when evaluating the effect of nom on photooxidation of as iii because of the complex composition of hs mainly with aromatic structures and overlapping absorption peaks of each functional group it is easy to form a wide and blunt absorption platform chen et al 2017 leal et al 2013 investigated hss isolated from the vouga river carvoeiro portugal which included ha fa and xad 4 fractions and found complex molecules to be responsible for sensitizing or delaying photochemical degradation of contaminants such that the retardation effect could be largely attributed to light screening though the light screening effect was ignored in previous work when using low molecular weight nom it could not be neglected in this work to quantify the light screening effect caused by nom and its effect on photooxidation of as iii s was calculated according to eq 8 calisto et al 2011 grandbois et al 2008 8 s 1 10 α l 2 303 α l 9 a b s α l ε l n o m 10 s 1 α l 11 s 1 ε l n o m where α cm 1 is the wavelength specific attenuation coefficient of the reaction system considered as the absorbance of each nom at the selected wavelengths for a pathlength of 1 cm l cm is the pathlength of the irradiated reactor 6 5 cm and n o m mol l 1 represents the added amount of nom s 1 means that no light screening effect occurs and the lower the s value the higher the inhibitory effect thus the s values of ca are 1 and that of hs needed to be calculated based on their absorbances the uv vis absorption spectra of various concentrations of hs 0 40 mg l 1 were scanned as shown in fig s18 the absorbance of hs increased with concentration and the main absorption was in the short wavelength range but the characteristic features were different for example the absorbance of ha was slightly higher than those of rnom and fa at the same concentration and the molar absorbance coefficients of hs ɛ 313 and ɛ 365 were calculated by linear fitting of the concentrations and absorbances fig s18 listed in table s3 according to eqs 8 and 9 s values of hs solutions at different concentrations could be calculated based on the α values which were obtained by multiplying ɛ and n o m and the results are listed in table s4 mathematically eq 8 can be simplified to eqs 10 and 11 when the absorbance of hs is not very high there was a good linear correlation between light screening factor s 0 7 under uva or uvb radiation and the concentration of hs fig 3 and the slopes of such plots of s versus n o m ks c are consistent with the values of ɛ l table s5 which verified the feasibility of the simplified calculation method the simplified calculation method was however not suitable for high concentrations of nom because a relatively large deviation could be expected nevertheless the s values for each hs could be obtained by determining its absorbance or calculating based on its molar absorption coefficient and concentration it also should be noted that since the emission spectra are not strictly sharp line emissions the calculation at the two single wavelengths is a valid approximation 3 4 competitive complexation effect to verify the competitive complexation effect of nom on the formation of cfh as iii complex desorption experiments were conducted by centrifugation under dark conditions without photoreaction the amounts of as iii in centrifuged supernatant solutions with or without nom were measured after equilibration for 2 h as shown in fig 4 in the absence of nom of the total amount of 5 μm as iii 2 7 μm as iii was bound to cfh and the remaining 2 3 μm was free in the supernatant after centrifugation with the addition of 50 μm ca or 16 mg l 1 hs the amount of free as iii increased indicating the competitive complexation effect of nom interestingly the amount of unoxidized as iii after 30 mins of photoreaction is corresponding to the amount of free as iii in the presence of nom under dark conditions as shown in fig 4 inset there is a significant positive correlation between them with the addition of the same amount of six cas r 2 0 95 indicating that the oxidation efficiency of as iii is highly related to the amount of cfh as iii complex edta which has more coordinating groups and a longer chain results in more free as iii and less oxidized as v by inhibiting the coordination of cfh and as iii however the degree of correlation was insignificant in the presence of hs the molecular weights of hs species were high and their structures were complex bearing many functional groups that can coordinate with cfh in the presence of 16 mg l 1 hs the amount of free as iii increased to 2 8 3 0 μm with little difference between each hs system our results are consistent with the findings of redman s work 2002 on the significant retard of adsorption of both as iii and as v on hematite in water based on the obvious competitive interactions of as iii and nom with cfh the competitive complexation effect needed to be considered when calculating the total inhibition factor t though the adsorption ability of as iii and as v is different as reported as v is generated during the photoreaction and still occupies the sites which are originally occupied by as iii rather than new available sites stachowicz et al 2006 and the competitive adsorption which affects the reaction rate mainly occurs between as iii and nom the competitive effect can be described by the experimentally determined amount of as iii desorbed from the cfh as iii complex in the presence of various concentrations of nom eq 6 is the ratio of the amount of cfh as iii complex in the presence and absence of nom which in fact is the amount of as iii adsorbed on cfh in the presence and absence of nom as iii ads nom and as iii ads 0 respectively since as iii that forms the cfh as iii complex could be precipitated with iron during centrifugation therefore eq 6 can then be transformed to eq 12 12 c as iii ads nom as iii ads 0 as iii 0 as iii sup nom as iii 0 as iii sup 0 where as iii sup 0 and as iii sup nom represent the concentrations of as iii in the centrifuged supernatant in the absence and presence of nom respectively 13 a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p n o m a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p 0 1 a l n o m 1 a l n o m 14 a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p n o m a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p 0 1 a f n o m 1 b f the desorption isotherms of as iii by various concentrations of nom could be obtained by fitting the modified langmuir eq 13 or freundlich eq 14 models where al af and bf are model constants as shown in figs 5 and 6 both the modified langmuir and freundlich models gave good fitting results for the majority of hss but the langmuir model was not as good as the freundlich model for cas it is probably due to that the freundlich fitting was more suitable for the adsorption model at lower absorbate concentrations whereas the langmuir fitting favored higher concentrations in this way the adsorption ratio of as iii and the competitive complexation inhibition factor c at nom concentration of 0 16 mg l 1 for hss and 0 2500 μm for cas could be calculated and listed in tables s6 and s7 3 5 modeling the effect of nom and experimental data comparison combining the theoretical light screening effect and competitive complexation effect as discussed above the total inhibition effect could be calculated according to eq 15 by integrating eqs 7 8 9 and 12 eq 15 can also be deformed to functions directly taking the concentration of nom as the argument eqs 15 1 and 15 2 the experimental values t exp were calculated according to eq 3 based on the apparent rate constants of photooxidation of as iii in the absence and presence of nom the correlation between experimental and calculated values of t is shown in fig 7 and rmse was calculated to measure the deviation between t cal and t exp and to evaluate the reliability of the model due to the differences in the properties of hs and ca and their different effects on photooxidation of as iii the values of t cal and t exp for hs and ca were compared separately 15 t c a l s c 1 10 α l 2

total of 72 sample points relating to various concentrations 0 04 16 mg l 1 of six kinds of hs are shown in fig 7a and b whether using the modified langmuir model rmse 0 1609 or the freundlich model rmse 0 1969 the evaluated values of t exp were basically equal to that of t cal confirming our hypothesis that the inhibition effect of hs on photooxidation of as iii was a combined effect of light screening and competitive complexation and the calculation method was reasonable the product of s factors obtained from the absorbance of hs and the c factors obtained by fitting the amount of as iii desorbed could accurately evaluate the total inhibition factors for cas a total of 46 sample points relating to various concentrations of seven kinds of cas 0 50 μm for oxalic acid 0 500 μm for edta and 0 2500 μm for the other five kinds of cas were used in the fitting because the absorbances of cas are insignificant the s values were set to 1 for all the samples hence the comparison of t exp with t cal was actually the comparison of t exp with competitive complexation factors c as shown in fig 7c and d though the overall fitting results were good when the c factors were obtained from modified freundlich fitting rmse 0 1771 the values of t exp and t cal were only close at high t values 0 7 1 at which concentrations of ca were low compared to the hs systems a relatively large discrepancy between t exp and t cal was observed at higher ca concentrations and the deviations could be probably ascribed to the three factors 1 light screening effect occurred caused by the cfh ca complex which would be formed at sufficiently high ca concentrations and lead to a lower value of t exp than t cal 2 the much wider range of ca concentrations in desorption experiment would lead to the obtained desorption constants not perfect enough for c calculation at the concentration level of 0 2500 μm 3 the minor contribution of ros produced by photochemical reactions of cfh ca complex was neglected which would lead to a higher value of t exp than t cal the deviation in t values for hs caused by the light screening effect was much less because the absorbance of hs alone was already significant and neglecting the absorbance of the cfh hs complex had only minor effects on s evaluation in the ca systems compared with modified freundlich fitting t cal values obtained by modified langmuir fitting deviated more from t exp which was to be expected in view of the inferior fitting of c differences in adsorption mechanisms may also lead to the discrepancies in c calculation for hs and ca hs was adsorbed on cfh through both physical and chemical adsorption whereas ca was mostly dependent on chemical adsorption based on the freundlich model which gave a smaller rmse than the langmuir model a linear equation of t exp versus the product of s and c was obtained as t exp 0 84 0 04 s c 0 02 0 03 pearson s r 0 8358 rmse 0 1700 fig s19 moreover the internal validation was performed and the q loo 2 value 0 691 is higher than 0 5 indicating the model is statistically robust while no obvious overfitting exists and it is more accurate for preliminarily predicting t values of the nom investigated in this work to sum up the total inhibition factor t of nom on photooxidation of as iii in the cfh as iii system could be evaluated by the light screening factor s and the competitive complexation factor c such a theoretical calculation model was more effective for investigating the inhibition effect of nom at the concentration level of natural water and should be appropriate for adequately explaining photochemical processes in the real environment 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of nom including hs and ca on the photochemical oxidation of as iii in the presence of fe iii under neutral ph conditions in contrast to previous work which mainly focused on the photosensitization and photooxidation of nom at high concentrations we have addressed the inhibitory effect on the photooxidation of as iii to quantitatively evaluate the inhibitory effect of various kinds and concentrations of nom a model for calculating the total inhibition factor t was established based on the theory of quantum yield which was defined as the product of light screening factor s and competitive complexation factor c values of s could be calculated by the absorbance of nom or based on the product of the molar absorption coefficient and concentration values of c could be obtained by langmuir or freundlich fitting the amount of as iii desorption and nom addition by comparing the experimental values of t ratio of k obs with and without nom with the calculated values it can be concluded that the model was accurate for evaluating the effects of low concentrations of nom 0 16 mg l 1 for hs and 0 50 μm for ca on the photooxidation of as iii a more complicated and detailed calculation model would be helpful to evaluate the effects of nom at higher concentrations because the photoactivity of nom and the light screening effect of the cfh nom complex could no longer be neglected in summary the effects of nom at the concentration level of natural water on photooxidation of as iii in the cfh as iii system have been evaluated and the calculation method for quantifying the inhibitory factors has been elaborated which may serve as a reference for studying the impact of nom on environmental pollutants credit authorship contribution statement yi wu investigation data curation writing original draft

15042,surface complexation of arsenite as iii on colloidal ferric hydroxide cfh plays an important role not only in the adsorptive immobilization of as iii but also in the subsequent oxidation of as iii to arsenate as v through light induced ligand to metal charge transfer lmct in water at near neutral ph however the effects of natural organic matter nom especially humic substances hss and low molecular weight carboxylic acids cas on the photochemistry of the cfh as iii system have not been sufficiently understood in this work the inhibition of photooxidation of as iii in terms of the observed apparent rate constant k obs by six hss below 16 mg l 1 and seven cas below 2 5 mm has been observed in water containing 66 μm fe iii and 5 μm as iii at ph 7 under simulated solar irradiation consisting of uva λmax 365 nm and uvb λmax 313 nm lights total inhibition factors t have been determined from the combined effect of light screening factor s and competitive complexation factor c wherein both s and c varied with nom concentration s was obtained by determining the absorbance of nom and c was obtained by fitting modified langmuir or freundlich models to the amount of as iii desorbed from cfh upon the addition of nom statistical analysis between the experimental t exp and the calculated one according to t cal s c showed that the freundlich model rmse for hs 0 1609 and for ca 0 1771 was better than the langmuir model and was statistically robust q loo 2 0 691 0 5 this work provided an estimation method for the effects of nom on as iii photooxidation in the presence of cfh as well as a deeper understanding of the transformation of arsenic species in sunlit water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords colloidal ferric hydroxide arsenic species natural organic matter photooxidation light screening competitive complexation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photochemical transformation is an important environmental fate of pollutants vione and scozzaro 2019 photochemical processes of natural organic matter nom not only alter its intrinsic properties sharpless et al 2014 but also affect the fates of inorganic substances and organic pollutants luo et al 2012 wang et al 2012 and can inactivate bacteria romero et al 2011 in sunlit surface waters such processes involve the generation of reactive species and the light screening effect caused by intrinsic absorbance due to the wide distribution high abundance and high photoactivity of nom its environmental photochemistry especially of humic substances hss and low molecular weight carboxylic acids cas has been investigated much more extensively barbeau et al 2001 cottrell et al 2013 fujii and otani 2017 than that of other photoactive substances in natural waters such as no3 and h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 mack and bolton 1999 attention has been paid to photochemical processes in the fe iii nom system for many years mainly in relation to the following three aspects i photodegradation and property changes of nom as a ligand of iron gu et al 2017 sato et al 2021 ii photoreduction of fe iii to bioavailable fe ii and implications for the biogeochemical iron cycle melton et al 2014 wang et al 2017 iii photochemical transformation of pollutants in the presence of both iron and nom wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 as regards the last aspect many investigations have been focused on organic pollutants while far fewer have dealt with inorganic pollutants in these few studies focused on inorganic pollutants nom was normally treated as a coexisting compound to investigate its macroscopic effects revealing its light screening effect and or scavenging effect but mechanistic details were not fully delineated chin et al 2004 liu et al 2018 the oxidation of inorganic arsenic from as iii to as v has attracted attention for decades due to its wide contamination higher toxicity and mobility of as iii in our previous work we investigated the photochemical oxidation of as iii on nascent colloidal ferric hydroxides cfh revealing the photochemical conversion mechanism of arsenic species at circumneutral conditions which proceeded through electron transfer from as iii to fe iii induced by the absorption of radiation at a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct band xu et al 2014 however the environmental photochemical processes of cfh as iii complex have not been fully revealed especially the influence of nom prevalent in natural water on the interaction between cfh and as iii and the photochemical oxidation processes of as iii some previous studies have indicated that light and dissolved organic matter dom were important for the transformation of arsenic species by generating excited triplet and or phenolic oxygen radicals kim et al 2019 and iron further promoted photosensitization oxidation of as iii in the presence of dissolved organic carbon buschmann et al 2005 but the transformation mechanism of as iii from the interaction of arsenic iron and nom has not been fully clarified yet the concentrations of nom in natural water are at mg l 1 level mojela et al 2022 parveen and goel 2022 though photochemical oxidation of as iii induced by fe iii nom complex has been reported previously hug et al 2001 that a high dosage of nom e g citrate favors as iii oxidation in our previous work we observed inhibitory effects of 11 kinds of low molecular weight nom including cas and phenols at low dosage 10 μm on cfh induced photooxidation of as iii huang et al 2021 correlation analysis between the properties of nom molecular weight element composition functional groups etc and the observed apparent rate constant k obs showed the inhibitory efficiency to be structure dependent relating to its complexation ability with iron in fact interactions and competitions between arsenic iron species and nom have been widely studied inorganic arsenic can be adsorbed on the surface of iron hydr oxide and co existing arsenic and iron can be complexed by organic matter liu et al 2011 some work even suggests the formation of ternary complexes of arsenic iron nom hoffmann et al 2013 although this remains debatable due to incomplete evidence and a lack of information on the molecular structures of the ternary species in contrast competitive adsorption between arsenic species and nom on iron hydr oxides has been more extensively reported reflecting the inhibitory effect of nom on arsenic adsorption on iron oxides interactions with nom are known to modify the stability and surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides adusei gyamfi et al 2019 all of these processes would undoubtedly influence the formation of cfh as iii complex arco lazaro et al 2016 giasuddin et al 2007 and hence influence the photooxidation efficiency of as iii moreover the light screening effect was not considered in our previous work because most low molecular weight nom does not absorb light in the uv range in contrast hss as important components of nom consist predominantly of polyphenols and benzoic carboxylic acids buffle 1990 which absorb significantly in both the uv and visible wavelength ranges and so may have multiple effects on the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cfh the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of nom on the photochemical oxidation process in the cfh as iii system for this 13 kinds of nom including 6 kinds of hss 0 16 mg l 1 and 7 kinds of cas 0 2500 μm were used as typical nom uv vis spectroscopy was used to observe the absorption spectra of nom itself and the formation of the cfh nom complex the light screening effect was calculated from the absorbance of nom at the corresponding wavelength the complexation abilities of nom and as iii with cfh were investigated by competitive desorption experiments an estimation model describing the effect of nom has been constructed by calculating the total inhibition combining the light screening effect and the competitive complexation effect in the natural environment where both nom and iron exist this study of the effect on photooxidation of as iii would enhance our understanding of the geochemical cycle and fate of arsenic in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification detailed

solution to control the ph during the reactions text s5 and fig s6 all experiments were conducted in an open atmosphere and performed in triplicate average values and error bars are presented in each figure 2 3 uv vis spectrum experiments uv vis spectra of nom with or without fe iii and as iii were recorded on a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1601 in a quartz cuvette pipes was also added to control the ph and each solution was pre equilibrated by stirring in the dark for 1 h before scanning 2 4 competitive desorption of as iii the contents of as iii in the supernatants of mixed solutions containing 66 μm fe iii 5 μm as iii 5 mm pipes and nom after centrifugation were measured as the amount of nom added varied the mixtures were prepared in 50 ml colorimetric tubes gently mixed by inverting the tubes shaken in a water bath 25 c for 2 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min prior to analysis of as iii concentrations 2 5 analysis methods the concentrations of as iii and as v were determined by liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc hg afs bohui instrument co ltd beijing china the concentrations of h2o2 were measured by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase pod spectrophotometry bader et al 1988 the chemical species of fe iii and their distributions in the presence of oxalic acid were simulated with medusa software http www inorg kth se medusa statistical parameters including root mean square error rmse and leave one out method q loo 2 were calculated based on matlab software version 26 to evaluate the fitting effect and robustness of the model full details are given in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nom on the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of fe iii control experiments were conducted at ph 7 as iii alone fe iii as iii and nom as iii reaction systems as iii was rapidly oxidized in the presence of fe iii and no photooxidation occurred in the absence of fe iii fig s7 which is consistent with our previous work and reflects the lmct process between cfh and adsorbed as iii xu et al 2014 the observed initial rate of photooxidation of as iii was around 0 225 μm min 1 with 66 μm fe iii 5 μm as iii and 5 5 mw cm 2 uva irradiation in contrast to the photooxidation of as iii by suwannee river humic acid under irradiation from a medium pressure mercury lamp buschmann et al 2005 the rate was negligible in our work with either 16 mg l 1 hs equal to 2 37 12 3 μm depending on their molar mass table s3 or 2500 μm ca as shown in figs s8 and s9 which might be due to the discrepancies in light sources and nom structures between the two works therefore photooxidation of as iii induced by nom can be excluded in this work nevertheless such positive effect by mere nom should still be considered at higher nom concentrations and under stronger solar irradiation 1 r k o b s a s i i i f e i i i k obs a s i i i 2 ln c c 0 k obs t next the effects of various concentrations of nom on photooxidation of as iii with cfh were investigated the kinetic results of concentration change with time under uva or uvb irradiation are shown in figs s10 and s11 hss and figs s12 and s13 cas the rates of photooxidation of as iii should be affected by the concentrations of both fe iii and as iii while the changes of concentrations of fe iii can be neglected eq 1 and the kinetic results could be linearly fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model using the data from the initial 20 min eq 2 the obtained apparent rate constants of photooxidation of as iii k obs with various concentrations of hss or cas are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively on the whole k obs decreased with the concentrations of nom increasing in the presence of cfh under either uva or uvb irradiation values of k obs under uvb irradiation were significantly higher than that under uva irradiation which could be rationalized in terms of quantum yields matafonova and batoev 2018 specifically over a comparatively wide range of hs concentrations 0 16 mg l 1 inhibition of photooxidation of as iii was the predominant result the precise inhibition extent on k obs is dependent on the structure of the respective hs for instance when the concentrations of fa or ha reached a certain value these acids completely inhibited the oxidation of as iii whereas the same concentrations of rnom did not have such a comprehensive inhibitory effect our previous work huang et al 2021 which investigated how the low concentrations of ca inhibited the photooxidation of as iii induced by cfh found a positive correlation between k obs and the number of cooh group and a negative correlation between k obs and the number of oh group or nh2 group reports concerning alkali metal salts of humic acids have indicated that mono di and trihydroxy derivatives of benzoic acid were likely to be the basic structural units from which humic acids are constructed giannakopoulos et al 2005 nakayasu et al 1999 thus these functional groups may be important factors in the inhibition of photooxidation of as iii the inhibitory effects of cas were similar to those of hss except for high concentrations of oxalic citric and malic acids photooxidation of as iii was significantly inhibited when the concentrations of maleic lactic succinic acid as well as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta increased over a low range 0 50 μm but the rates leveled off when their concentrations increased further low concentrations of oxalic citric and malic acids also inhibited oxidation of as iii as reported previously huang et al 2021 but promoted it when their concentrations increased to a certain level this is commonly accepted to be due to the formation of photoactive fe iii carboxylate complexes feng and nansheng 2000 whose promotion effect on photooxidation of as iii is discussed in detail in the next section 3 2 possible mechanisms for the effects of nom the possible mechanisms involved in the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cfh and nom are shown in scheme 1 in brief three aspects may play the role 1 light screening effect photochemical reaction of cfh as iii complex may be inhibited by any nom that has specific light absorption in the uv vis region the nature of this effect is attenuation of the light intensity available for the photochemical reaction of the target photoactive species 2 competitive complexation effect photochemical oxidation of as iii on cfh as iii complex may be inhibited by nom that has a stronger complexing ability than as iii oxyanion in this case nom may destroy the surface complexation of as iii oxyanion on cfh at neutral ph thereby cutting off the lmct process 3 photolysis effect photochemical oxidation of as iii may be enhanced by nom through photosensitizing oxidation photo fenton like oxidation and or photooxidation with h2o2 the uv vis absorption spectra of fe iii as iii nom alone and or in binary or ternary systems were determined and shown in figs s14 and s15 the spectral changes especially the appearance of characteristic peaks are commonly attributed to the formation of complexes benesi and hildebrand 1949 though cfh as iii complex is considered to be formed in an fe iii as iii binary solution at ph 7 the absorbance of such a solution did not show observable changes compared to an fe iii solution this can be attributed to the low dosage of as iii fe iii as iii 66 5 in this work much lower than fe iii as iii 10 66 7 333 3 in our previous work xu et al 2014 and the low molar absorptivity of cfh as iii complex the aqueous solutions of each hs alone had distinct colors indicating strong light absorption capacity whereas the ca alone showed insignificant absorbance interestingly the absorbances of cfh nom mixtures were slightly or obviously higher than that of cfh alone revealing the complexation of cfh with each nom whether hs or ca specifically the absorbance of cfh hs complexes is slightly higher than that of hs alone since hs already has instinct absorbance whereas the absorbance of cfh ca complexes seemed to be much higher than that of ca alone as ca does not absorb light it should be noted that such significant increases in ca systems only occurred at high concentration conditions and the promotion effect was not obvious when the concentrations of ca were low the absorbances of cfh as iii nom ternary mixture solutions were very similar to those of cfh nom binary mixture solutions due to the strong interaction between cfh and nom albeit with relatively large differences in the molar absorptivity of each complex complexation between iron species and nom has been widely studied some researchers believe that coordinative adsorption ligand exchange between carboxyl hydroxyl functional groups of nom and the surface of metal hydr oxide is the predominant mechanism for hs adsorption gu et al 1994 guan et al 2006 similar to that of ca it is considered that the presence of nom enhances the mobility of arsenic species in the soil sediment environment by competitive adsorption or dissolving soil minerals williams et al 2011 it has been reported that dom competes with as iii for binding on mineral surfaces such as those of alumina goethite and hematite bauer and blodau 2006 redman et al 2002 moreover many previous studies have indicated the competitive effect resulting in the mobilization of sb or as from mineral surfaces by cas ha or other nom deng et al 2019 shi et al 2009 wu et al 2019 cfh as a special form of iron particles will undoubtedly show similar roles when as iii and nom co existed photosensitizing oxidation is normally considered when evaluating the photochemistry of nom nom absorbs light and is thereby excited to the triplet state 3nom which transfers the energy to ground state oxygen to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 such a process need only be considered for hs since the absorbances of cas are insignificant the photochemical reactions of as iii and nom 16 mg l 1 for hs and 2500 μm for ca in the absence of fe iii showed no obvious as iii oxidation figs s8 and s9 suggesting that 1o2 is not a powerful oxidant for as iii oxidation at neutral ph since it is easily quenched by water jiang et al 2017 meanwhile photo fenton like reaction that may produce various ros o2 h2o2 and ho through photolysis of cfh nom complex plays an important role in the photooxidation of as iii only when the conditions ph fe iii nom ratio etc are favorable zhang et al 2006 zhao et al 2022 these ros are relevant to each other in the presence of reductive species such as fe ii ding et al 2018 and cu i wu et al 2022 which can activate o2 then the identification and contribution of h2o2 were analyzed in detail in text s7 though h2o2 can be detected in cfh hs systems with 16 mg l 1 hs table s2 its concentrations were too low to make contributions to photooxidation of as iii and it only reached a sufficient level in the presence of specific ca at high concentrations figs s16 and s17 therefore the inhibition effect of nom on photooxidation of as iii would still be the main result when the concentrations of nom were at the level of natural water 100 101 mg l 1 mojela et al 2022 parveen and goel 2022 and the third aspect could be neglected in our following discussion only the first two aspects having a negative effect were considered without the contribution of ros as iii is only oxidized through the lmct process of the cfh as iii complex and based on the theory of quantum yield the observable photooxidation rate of as iii r would be proportional to the concentration of the cfh as iii complex and the light that can be absorbed by the complex and the detailed description was shown in text s8 the two key factors were affected by the competitive effect of nom and the absorbance of the reaction system respectively then in order to describe the inhibition quantitively the total inhibition factor t of nom on photooxidation of as iii is defined as the ratio of the reaction rates in the presence and absence of nom r and r 0 respectively eqs 3 and 4 according to the pseudo first order model r and r 0 are the products of the reaction rate constant k obs and k obs0 respectively and the initial concentration of as iii eq 1 therefore the inhibition factor t can be simplified to the ratio of reaction rate constants in the presence and absence of nom which can be obtained from the kinetic experiment results recorded as t exp eq 3 meanwhile based on the theory of quantum yield φ r can also be simply expressed as the product of e the utilizable light intensity and the concentration of cfh as iii complex recorded as t cal eq 4 where e is an integrated constant of φ absorption area and other constants 3 t e x p r r 0 k o b s a s i i i k o b s 0 a s i i i 0 k o b s k o b s 0 4 t c a l r r 0 e i a b s c f h a s i i i e i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i 0 i a b s i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 the ratio of the utilizable light intensities in the presence and absence of nom can be defined as s reflecting the inhibition factor caused by light screening eq 5 and the ratio of the concentrations of cfh as iii complex in the presence and absence of nom can be defined as c reflecting the inhibition factor caused by competitive complexation eq 6 according to eqs 3 6 the relationship between factors t s and c was derived as eq 7 s and c are determined and discussed in detail in the following sections 5 s i a b s i a b s 0 6 c c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 7 t c a l i a b s i a b s 0 c f h a s i i i c f h a s i i i 0 s c 3 3 light screening effect as discussed above hs has relatively strong absorbances at the uva and uvb wavelengths whereas those of cas are insignificant figs s14 and s15 though cfh nom complex showed higher absorbance than nom itself the enhancement for hs is not strong and that for ca at low concentration is also not very significant hence to simplify the quantitative analysis and model calculation the light screening effect is only considered for hs itself when evaluating the effect of nom on photooxidation of as iii because of the complex composition of hs mainly with aromatic structures and overlapping absorption peaks of each functional group it is easy to form a wide and blunt absorption platform chen et al 2017 leal et al 2013 investigated hss isolated from the vouga river carvoeiro portugal which included ha fa and xad 4 fractions and found complex molecules to be responsible for sensitizing or delaying photochemical degradation of contaminants such that the retardation effect could be largely attributed to light screening though the light screening effect was ignored in previous work when using low molecular weight nom it could not be neglected in this work to quantify the light screening effect caused by nom and its effect on photooxidation of as iii s was calculated according to eq 8 calisto et al 2011 grandbois et al 2008 8 s 1 10 α l 2 303 α l 9 a b s α l ε l n o m 10 s 1 α l 11 s 1 ε l n o m where α cm 1 is the wavelength specific attenuation coefficient of the reaction system considered as the absorbance of each nom at the selected wavelengths for a pathlength of 1 cm l cm is the pathlength of the irradiated reactor 6 5 cm and n o m mol l 1 represents the added amount of nom s 1 means that no light screening effect occurs and the lower the s value the higher the inhibitory effect thus the s values of ca are 1 and that of hs needed to be calculated based on their absorbances the uv vis absorption spectra of various concentrations of hs 0 40 mg l 1 were scanned as shown in fig s18 the absorbance of hs increased with concentration and the main absorption was in the short wavelength range but the characteristic features were different for example the absorbance of ha was slightly higher than those of rnom and fa at the same concentration and the molar absorbance coefficients of hs ɛ 313 and ɛ 365 were calculated by linear fitting of the concentrations and absorbances fig s18 listed in table s3 according to eqs 8 and 9 s values of hs solutions at different concentrations could be calculated based on the α values which were obtained by multiplying ɛ and n o m and the results are listed in table s4 mathematically eq 8 can be simplified to eqs 10 and 11 when the absorbance of hs is not very high there was a good linear correlation between light screening factor s 0 7 under uva or uvb radiation and the concentration of hs fig 3 and the slopes of such plots of s versus n o m ks c are consistent with the values of ɛ l table s5 which verified the feasibility of the simplified calculation method the simplified calculation method was however not suitable for high concentrations of nom because a relatively large deviation could be expected nevertheless the s values for each hs could be obtained by determining its absorbance or calculating based on its molar absorption coefficient and concentration it also should be noted that since the emission spectra are not strictly sharp line emissions the calculation at the two single wavelengths is a valid approximation 3 4 competitive complexation effect to verify the competitive complexation effect of nom on the formation of cfh as iii complex desorption experiments were conducted by centrifugation under dark conditions without photoreaction the amounts of as iii in centrifuged supernatant solutions with or without nom were measured after equilibration for 2 h as shown in fig 4 in the absence of nom of the total amount of 5 μm as iii 2 7 μm as iii was bound to cfh and the remaining 2 3 μm was free in the supernatant after centrifugation with the addition of 50 μm ca or 16 mg l 1 hs the amount of free as iii increased indicating the competitive complexation effect of nom interestingly the amount of unoxidized as iii after 30 mins of photoreaction is corresponding to the amount of free as iii in the presence of nom under dark conditions as shown in fig 4 inset there is a significant positive correlation between them with the addition of the same amount of six cas r 2 0 95 indicating that the oxidation efficiency of as iii is highly related to the amount of cfh as iii complex edta which has more coordinating groups and a longer chain results in more free as iii and less oxidized as v by inhibiting the coordination of cfh and as iii however the degree of correlation was insignificant in the presence of hs the molecular weights of hs species were high and their structures were complex bearing many functional groups that can coordinate with cfh in the presence of 16 mg l 1 hs the amount of free as iii increased to 2 8 3 0 μm with little difference between each hs system our results are consistent with the findings of redman s work 2002 on the significant retard of adsorption of both as iii and as v on hematite in water based on the obvious competitive interactions of as iii and nom with cfh the competitive complexation effect needed to be considered when calculating the total inhibition factor t though the adsorption ability of as iii and as v is different as reported as v is generated during the photoreaction and still occupies the sites which are originally occupied by as iii rather than new available sites stachowicz et al 2006 and the competitive adsorption which affects the reaction rate mainly occurs between as iii and nom the competitive effect can be described by the experimentally determined amount of as iii desorbed from the cfh as iii complex in the presence of various concentrations of nom eq 6 is the ratio of the amount of cfh as iii complex in the presence and absence of nom which in fact is the amount of as iii adsorbed on cfh in the presence and absence of nom as iii ads nom and as iii ads 0 respectively since as iii that forms the cfh as iii complex could be precipitated with iron during centrifugation therefore eq 6 can then be transformed to eq 12 12 c as iii ads nom as iii ads 0 as iii 0 as iii sup nom as iii 0 as iii sup 0 where as iii sup 0 and as iii sup nom represent the concentrations of as iii in the centrifuged supernatant in the absence and presence of nom respectively 13 a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p n o m a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p 0 1 a l n o m 1 a l n o m 14 a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p n o m a s i i i 0 a s i i i s u p 0 1 a f n o m 1 b f the desorption isotherms of as iii by various concentrations of nom could be obtained by fitting the modified langmuir eq 13 or freundlich eq 14 models where al af and bf are model constants as shown in figs 5 and 6 both the modified langmuir and freundlich models gave good fitting results for the majority of hss but the langmuir model was not as good as the freundlich model for cas it is probably due to that the freundlich fitting was more suitable for the adsorption model at lower absorbate concentrations whereas the langmuir fitting favored higher concentrations in this way the adsorption ratio of as iii and the competitive complexation inhibition factor c at nom concentration of 0 16 mg l 1 for hss and 0 2500 μm for cas could be calculated and listed in tables s6 and s7 3 5 modeling the effect of nom and experimental data comparison combining the theoretical light screening effect and competitive complexation effect as discussed above the total inhibition effect could be calculated according to eq 15 by integrating eqs 7 8 9 and 12 eq 15 can also be deformed to functions directly taking the concentration of nom as the argument eqs 15 1 and 15 2 the experimental values t exp were calculated according to eq 3 based on the apparent rate constants of photooxidation of as iii in the absence and presence of nom the correlation between experimental and calculated values of t is shown in fig 7 and rmse was calculated to measure the deviation between t cal and t exp and to evaluate the reliability of the model due to the differences in the properties of hs and ca and their different effects on photooxidation of as iii the values of t cal and t exp for hs and ca were compared separately 15 t c a l s c 1 10 α l 2

total of 72 sample points relating to various concentrations 0 04 16 mg l 1 of six kinds of hs are shown in fig 7a and b whether using the modified langmuir model rmse 0 1609 or the freundlich model rmse 0 1969 the evaluated values of t exp were basically equal to that of t cal confirming our hypothesis that the inhibition effect of hs on photooxidation of as iii was a combined effect of light screening and competitive complexation and the calculation method was reasonable the product of s factors obtained from the absorbance of hs and the c factors obtained by fitting the amount of as iii desorbed could accurately evaluate the total inhibition factors for cas a total of 46 sample points relating to various concentrations of seven kinds of cas 0 50 μm for oxalic acid 0 500 μm for edta and 0 2500 μm for the other five kinds of cas were used in the fitting because the absorbances of cas are insignificant the s values were set to 1 for all the samples hence the comparison of t exp with t cal was actually the comparison of t exp with competitive complexation factors c as shown in fig 7c and d though the overall fitting results were good when the c factors were obtained from modified freundlich fitting rmse 0 1771 the values of t exp and t cal were only close at high t values 0 7 1 at which concentrations of ca were low compared to the hs systems a relatively large discrepancy between t exp and t cal was observed at higher ca concentrations and the deviations could be probably ascribed to the three factors 1 light screening effect occurred caused by the cfh ca complex which would be formed at sufficiently high ca concentrations and lead to a lower value of t exp than t cal 2 the much wider range of ca concentrations in desorption experiment would lead to the obtained desorption constants not perfect enough for c calculation at the concentration level of 0 2500 μm 3 the minor contribution of ros produced by photochemical reactions of cfh ca complex was neglected which would lead to a higher value of t exp than t cal the deviation in t values for hs caused by the light screening effect was much less because the absorbance of hs alone was already significant and neglecting the absorbance of the cfh hs complex had only minor effects on s evaluation in the ca systems compared with modified freundlich fitting t cal values obtained by modified langmuir fitting deviated more from t exp which was to be expected in view of the inferior fitting of c differences in adsorption mechanisms may also lead to the discrepancies in c calculation for hs and ca hs was adsorbed on cfh through both physical and chemical adsorption whereas ca was mostly dependent on chemical adsorption based on the freundlich model which gave a smaller rmse than the langmuir model a linear equation of t exp versus the product of s and c was obtained as t exp 0 84 0 04 s c 0 02 0 03 pearson s r 0 8358 rmse 0 1700 fig s19 moreover the internal validation was performed and the q loo 2 value 0 691 is higher than 0 5 indicating the model is statistically robust while no obvious overfitting exists and it is more accurate for preliminarily predicting t values of the nom investigated in this work to sum up the total inhibition factor t of nom on photooxidation of as iii in the cfh as iii system could be evaluated by the light screening factor s and the competitive complexation factor c such a theoretical calculation model was more effective for investigating the inhibition effect of nom at the concentration level of natural water and should be appropriate for adequately explaining photochemical processes in the real environment 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of nom including hs and ca on the photochemical oxidation of as iii in the presence of fe iii under neutral ph conditions in contrast to previous work which mainly focused on the photosensitization and photooxidation of nom at high concentrations we have addressed the inhibitory effect on the photooxidation of as iii to quantitatively evaluate the inhibitory effect of various kinds and concentrations of nom a model for calculating the total inhibition factor t was established based on the theory of quantum yield which was defined as the product of light screening factor s and competitive complexation factor c values of s could be calculated by the absorbance of nom or based on the product of the molar absorption coefficient and concentration values of c could be obtained by langmuir or freundlich fitting the amount of as iii desorption and nom addition by comparing the experimental values of t ratio of k obs with and without nom with the calculated values it can be concluded that the model was accurate for evaluating the effects of low concentrations of nom 0 16 mg l 1 for hs and 0 50 μm for ca on the photooxidation of as iii a more complicated and detailed calculation model would be helpful to evaluate the effects of nom at higher concentrations because the photoactivity of nom and the light screening effect of the cfh nom complex could no longer be neglected in summary the effects of nom at the concentration level of natural water on photooxidation of as iii in the cfh as iii system have been evaluated and the calculation method for quantifying the inhibitory factors has been elaborated which may serve as a reference for studying the impact of nom on environmental pollutants credit authorship contribution statement yi wu investigation data curation writing original draft

due to their powerful oxidation capability and wide ph adaptability guan et al 2020 zong et al 2020 however the homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in sr aops are difficult to recycle possibly causing secondary pollution therefore it is ideal to combine eaops and sr aops for complementary strengths achieving high efficiency and low energy consumption for pollutants treatments the electric field can be applied to enhance the activation efficiency of peroxymonosulfate pms to overcome the disadvantages of eaops and sr aops alone researches on cathodic activation of pms have been reported recently but few studies have been conducted on anodes li et al 2022c liu et al 2019 it is generally believed that the activation of pms requires electron transfer to pms while the anode tends to donate electrons rather than gain them in electrooxidation leading to the neglect of pms activation at the anode in fact pms exists in the form of anions in the water and pms anions are more likely to accumulate on the anode surface after applying the electric field but the research on electro activation of pms at anode is still in the initial stage and its performance and reaction mechanism are still unclear different anodes have different oxidation mechanisms which deserves further in depth research anode material is a key component in determining the efficiency of eaops lin et al 2021 it

feii feiii and coiii coii in the bimetallic system can enhance pms activation and reactive oxygen species ros formation hence a new strategy is combining ti4o7 with fe co bimetallic perovskite simultaneously realizing the excellent electrical conductivity and better catalytic activity in pms electro activation system herein perovskite type ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was introduced into ti4o7 substrate

and discussion 3 1 characterization and properties of the pti anode the sharp xrd pattern showed well developed crystalline nature of the synthesized anodes as shown in fig 1 a ti4o7 exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 2 1 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 4 1 2 0 0 2 4 2 1 3 0 2 4 3 2 2 1 4 2 2 2 4 and 3 2 6 crystal planes of the ti4o7 phase jcpds no 72 1722 soroush almassi 2019 when ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was introduced into ti4o7 the peaks of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 gradually appeared and the signals of ti4o7 slightly weakened with the increase of the ratio of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the peaks strengthening at 28 4 32 9 44 7 47 4 and 56 2 proved the successful preparation of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 fig s2 hu et al 2020 sharma and ameta 2017 5 wt pti retained the high purity magneli phases ti4o7 indicating the synthesis of 5 wt ceco0 5fe0 5o3 did not oxidize or reduce ti4o7 however most diffraction peaks of ti4o7 weakened obviously and shifted to higher peak positions with the 25 wt ceco0 5fe0 5o3 similar to tio2 jcpds no 76 0324 the xrd of 5 wt pti remained the peaks of ti4o7 with an extremely weak intensity this result suggested that the amount of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 had better not exceed 5 wt the specific surface area of catalysts is an important index to evaluate the adsorption and degradation properties as depicted in fig 1b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of 5 wt pti belonged to the typical type ii curve with type 3 hysteresis loop based on the iupac classification the bet surface area of pti was 14 5 m2 g higher than the 12 8 m2 g of pure ti4o7 fig s3 fig 1b inset showed that the pore size of pti distributed in the range of 1 8 131 nm among which about 10 were micropores 87 were mesopores and 3 were macropores the average pore diameter was 12 nm and total pore volume was 0 022 cm3 g while there were 68 mesopores and 32 macropores in the ti4o7 and the total pore volume was 0 043 cm3 g compared to the pure ti4o7 the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 contributed to higher bet surface area and smaller pores of pti the multistage porous structure can promote the migration of pollutants to the pti surface and provide more accessible active sites further accelerating the catalytic reaction wang et al 2020b sem images showed the morphology and textural property of ti4o7 and 5 wt pti the surface of the original ti4o7 was smooth and clean fig 1c e whereas the surface of pti presented a rough and homogenous coating layer after introducing the perovskite fig 1f h the massive structure at the bottom was ti4o7 and the thin layer on the ti4o7 was ceco0 5fe0 5o3 perovskite the strong adhesion of the compact perovskite layer might enhance the stability of the anode wang et al 2018 the eds data in fig s4 showed that ti and o appeared on the surface of original ti4o7 the ratio of ti to o atoms of ti4o7 was 4 6 8 close to 4 7 ti o ratio in ti4o7 after introducing the perovskite ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the elements of ce ti co fe and o were evenly distributed fig 1i the eds of pti showed that the mass fractions of ce co and fe were 4 6 wt 1 2 wt and 1 0 wt respectively by dividing the relative atomic mass the molar ratio of ce co fe was approximately 1 9 1 1 1 approaching to 2 1 1 further confirming the successful formation of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 fig s5 electrochemical measurements were conducted to assess the electrochemical characteristics of pti and ti4o7 anodes as the lsv curves shown in fig 2 a pti possessed a higher oxygen evolution potential oep of 1 99 v vs ag agcl than 1 90 v of pure ti4o7 from cv curves in fig 2b pti exhibited a greater current response than the pristine ti4o7 promoting the high catalytic activity and electron transfer process the results were consistent with those in the lsv curves demonstrating the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 improved the conductivity and lowered the oep activity in nyquist plot fig 2c the ohmic resistance r0 of pti and ti4o7 anodes was similar about 20 5 ω it was proposed that the charge transfer resistance rct was related to the electron transfer kinetics and electrocatalytic activity the rct of pti 28 02 ω was far lower than that of ti4o7 72 35 ω indicating the faster charge transfer and higher reaction activity of pti the diffusion resistance rd of pti and ti4o7 anodes were 7 94 ω and 85 12 ω respectively the ultra low rd suggested the interaction of pti was benefit to the electron transfer between fe and co su et al 2022 3 2 the superiority of pti anode for cbz removal the removal efficiency of cbz 10 mg l rate constant and toc removal by pms activation in various processes were compared in fig 3 as described in fig 3a almost no cbz was removed by adsorption in 30 min suggesting that the adsorption capacity of pti anode was negligible the oxidative degradation of cbz by pms alone was less than 5 indicating that pms itself could hardly produce ros around 16 removal efficiency of cbz occurring in e ti4o7 pms system were not satisfactory fig 3a but the catalytic activity was significantly enhanced with the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 demonstrating that pms could easily be activated by pti in the presence of electric field as the amount of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 increased from 2 5 wt to 7 5 wt the removal efficiency of cbz increased and then reduced 5 wt pti showed approximate 100 cbz removal and the fastest reaction rate which was selected as the optimized anode and used in the subsequent experiments fig s6 the electro pti e pti system without pms could only remove 30 cbz mainly by the direct oxidation of the pti anode while the pti activating pms pti pms system achieved 83 cbz removal within 30 min for discussing the rate constants of different systems zero order and pseudo first order reaction kinetics were applied to analyze the degradation process of cbz fig s7 the kinetics rate constants of cbz removal in different systems were listed in table 1 comparing the rate constant and r2 in each system the cbz degradation dynamics in the e pti pms system was fitted well with the first order reaction model k 0 467 min 1 r2 0 99 rather than zero order reaction model k 0 675 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 66 while the pti pms system preferred to the zero order reaction model k 0 292 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 99 and the other systems exhibited same or close r2 fitting with the two kinetic models strikingly 100 cbz was rapidly degraded within 10 min in the e pti pms system with an ultra high rate constant k of 0 467 min 1 approximately 36 times than that in the e pti system the assistance of pms enhanced more than 70 removal of cbz simultaneously reducing the energy consumption significantly from 147 24 to 5 02 kwh kg cbz besides the electric field also highly enhanced the degradation rate of cbz which proved that both electricity and pms were crucial in the e pti pms system compared to the common dsa and bdd anode the e pti pms system was much superior to the e dsa pms system 17 and e bdd pms system 30 the first order kinetic rate constant k of e pti pms system 0 467 min 1 r2 0 99 was remarkably improved approximately 68 68 and 41 times that of ti4o7 0 007 min 1 r2 0 94 dsa 0 007 min 1 r2 0 93 and bdd 0 011 min 1 r2 0 98 respectively table 1 compared to the other anodes the outstanding performance of pti could be ascribed to the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 it has been reported that transition metals fe and co can effectively activate pms and generate ros for pollutants elimination in fig 3b the toc removal of e pti pms system could reach 40 within 120 min while those in the other systems were all less than 20 the k of toc removal 0 0041 min 1 was 2 times higher than that of other systems 0 002 min 1 fig 3b the superiority of e pti pms system might be attributed to the stimulation of electric field fast electron transfer and synergistic effect of fe co bimetallic perovskite which would be further discussed to sum up pti anode was a prospective alternative to dsa and bdd towards high efficient and low cost removal of pollutants in practical application 3 3 effects of the reaction parameters the effects of current density and pms concentration on cbz degradation in the e pti pms system were evaluated fig 4 the applied current was a common and crucial parameter in the electrochemical process in fig 4a when the current density increased from 0 to 1 0 ma cm2 the cbz removal efficiency and the corresponding degradation rate constant k enhanced with the increasing current fig 4b obviously the electric field promoted the rapid decomposition of pms and accelerated the degradation of cbz however as the current density reaching 1 5 ma cm2 the kinetic rate constant was decreased to 0 209 min 1 it was probably because the higher current density would lead to the stronger side reactions for oxygen evolution competing with the cbz degradation cai et al 2019 the energy consumption increased with the rising current density while the eec values maintained at a low level 5 02 kwh kg cbz as the current density below 1 0 ma cm2 the eec leapt to 32 61 kwh kg cbz at 1 5 ma cm2 so 1 0 ma cm2 was the most suitable current density with the highest constant k fig 4c illustrated the influence of the pms concentration varying from 0 to 2 mm on cbz removal in this system when the pms concentration increased from 0 mm to 0 5 mm the removal efficiency of cbz significantly improved from 30 to 96 the cbz removal reached 100 within 10 min at 1 mm pms but slightly decreased as the pms concentration surpassing 1 mm in this system the rate constant k in fig 4d exhibited the same trend that enhancing from 0 013 min 1 0 mm to 0 467 min 1 1 mm and then declining to 0 195 min 1 2 mm this result might be attributed to the active sites on the pti surface have been saturated as the pms dosage reaching a certain level limiting the production of ros lei et al 2022 for further discussing the effect of pms concentration on 1o2 we detected the signal of temp 1o2 under different pms concentrations by epr as shown in fig s8 the signal of temp 1o2 was enhanced when the pms increased from 0 to 1 mm and then gradually weakened with the pms exceeding 1 mm the intensity of 1o2 reached the highest in the condition of 1 mm pms which was consistent with the removal result of cbz it also indicated that the concentration of pms determined the production of 1o2 further affecting the cbz removal therefore excessive pms was unprofitable for cbz elimination from an economic point of view 1 ma cm2 current and 1 mm pms were the optimal choice in the e pti pms system for subsequent experiments 3 4 mechanism in the e pti pms system 3 4 1 the dominant role of 1o2 in the sr aops radicals oh so 4 o 2 and nonradical 1o2 are generally considered as the ros that efficiently removing pollutants the production of ros in the e pti pms system was probed by employing scavengers meoh tba sod and l his meoh would scavenge both oh and so 4 k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so 4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 t buoh could also effectively inhibit oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but not equally valid to so 4 k so 4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 huang and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2022a as shown in fig 5 a all the scavengers impeded the reaction process for cbz degradation tba slightly weakened the cbz degradation suggesting that the contribution of oh on cbz removal was weak the inhibition of meoh 45 was far higher than that of tba which demonstrated the significant role of so 4 epr technique was utilized to further certify the generation of ros in the e pti pms system without cbz the dmpo so 4 signals six line peaks intensities of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh signals four line peaks intensities of 1 2 2 1 appeared and strengthened with time fig 5b sod was used to quench o 2 and the rate constant k declined from 0 467 min 1 to 0 203 min 1 testifying the production of o 2 could not be ignored fig s9 the sextet peaks of dmpo o 2 also emerged and fluctuated at a certain intensity fig 5c l his is an efficient scavenger for nonradical 1o2 k 1 o 2 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 97 8 cbz removal was inhibited after adding l his indicating the large production of 1o2 in this system the strong 1 1 1 triplet signal of temp 1o2 was observed in 2 min then enhancing and retaining a high intensity fig 5d to further explore the contribution of different ros the epr test was conducted in the presence of 10 mg l cbz as discussed in fig 3a before cbz was degraded completely within 10 min in the e pti pms system combined with the fig s10 the intensity of oh so 4 and o 2 decreased a little within 10 min after adding cbz while the signal of 1o2 sharply reduced this phenomenon confirmed that oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all contributed to the cbz removal in the e pti pms system it is reported that cbz potentially react faster with 1o2 owing to 1 3 diene moiety of cbz dong et al 2015 hence most 1o2 was rapidly consumed and dominated the degradation of cbz in the e pti pms system consistent with the result of scavenger action in fig 5a as discussed above cbz was completely degraded within 10 min and 1o2 dominated the cbz removal after 10 min the signal of 1o2 decreased while oh and so 4 strengthened although cbz was 100 degraded in 10 min toc was only removed 4 5 fig s11 the depletion of toc by 1o2 seems to be difficult due to the mild oxidation potential of 1o2 li et al 2023 yu et al 2020a it can be inferred that the increased oh and so 4 would be employed for the toc mineralization after 10 min as shown in fig s11 the toc removal reached 10 5 at 30 min and 40 at 120 min hence 1o2 might play a predominant role for degrading cbz molecules while oh and so 4 contributed more to the toc mineralization in short oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all conduced to the cbz removal while 1o2 played a dominant role in the e pti pms system electron transfer is another typical nonradical process in aops ren et al 2020 to explore the role of the electron transfer process in the e pti pms system electrochemical measurements were conducted to assess the charge transfer between pms and pti as shown in the lsv curves fig 5e the oep increased from 1 99 v vs ag agcl only electrolyte to 2 05 v vs ag agcl pms activation after adding 1 mm pms the higher oep manifested that the introduction of pms could inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction and reduce the energy consumption wang et al 2020a a slight increase of current 2 µa was triggered by the injection of cbz in fig 5f illustrating that a current flow from organics to the nonradical species was formed on the surface of pti zhu et al 2018 these results indicated the electron transfer process occurred among the electron donor cbz electron acceptor pms and electron transfer mediator pti yun et al 2018a however the current response of this system was extremely weak compared to those dominated by electron transfer process in the literature ren et al 2022 illustrating the minor contribution of the electron transfer process in the e pti pms system combing with the 97 8 inhibition of l his in the capture experiments fig 5a most of the cbz molecules were degraded by 1o2 and very few cbz were indirectly oxidized by the electron transfer process in conclusion radicals oh so 4 o 2 nonradical 1o2 and electron transfer process occurred in the e pti pms system but 1o2 played a leading role for cbz removal 3 4 2 proposed pathways of 1o2 generation as reported oh so 4 and o 2 were the important sources of 1o2 li et al 2022c yun et al 2018b firstly 1o2 could be generated from oh as eqs 3 4 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 it was reported that so 4 were inclined to react with hso 5 to produce so 5 with a low oxidative potential 1 1 v and high reaction rate k 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 through eq 5 dong et al 2021 zhao et al 2023 thanks to the high reaction rate k 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 and low activation energy e 7 4 2 4 kcal mol rapid self reaction of so 5 will conduce to the formation of 1o2 eqs 6 and 7 lei et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 as shown in fig 5b and 5d the signal of temp 1o2 sharply increased in the first 5 min and reached the highest at 5 min while the signals of dmpo so 4 and dmpo oh were low within 5 min combined with fig 5a cbz was rapidly degraded by 90 at 5 min and completely removed within 10 min in the e pti pms system obviously 1o2 significantly increased and dominated the cbz degradation in the first 5 min while so 4 and oh were relatively weak it probably illustrated that most of the so 4 and oh were converted to 1o2 cbz was completely removed and 1o2 began to decrease after 10 min which meant that the conversion process of so 4 and oh to 1o2 was weakened as a result the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so 4 strengthened with time the opposite trend also verified the pathway about that 1o2 would be transformed from so 4 and oh 1o2 could be also evoked by the recombination of o 2 from the possible ways in eqs 8 9 yu et al 2020b to explore the source and transformation way of 1o2 the epr spectra of 1o2 were compared after scavenging oh so 4 and o 2 respectively obviously the signals of temp 1o2 all weakened after adding tba meoh or sod indicating that 1o2 would be generated from oh so 4 and o 2 in the e pti pms system fig 6 a besides it was reported that 1o2 might be also generated from oxygen by trapping the activation energy of pms as eqs 10 12 huang et al 2018 to confirm the role of o2 in the e pti pms system we explored the cbz removal by removing o2 from the solution with n2 saturation in fig 6b no significant difference on cbz removal was observed under n2 saturated condition the rate constant in n2 saturation was 0 451 min 1 fig s12 approach to the control 0 467 min 1 obviously o2 played a negligible role in the e pti pms system which further illustrated that o2 was not the main source for 1o2 formation to further investigate the generation pathway of 1o2 oxygen vacancy v o of pti was detected to verify whether v o was the active site to produce 1o2 li et al 2022b zhou et al 2021 specifically the v o was activated to reactive oxygen o by electron transfer and then converted into 1o2 through coupling with pms eqs 13 14 in fig 6c the signal peak g 2 004 was proportional to the quantity of oxygen defects zhang et al 2020b it can be clearly seen that pti possessed a higher intensity of v o than ti4o7 based on the abo3 type structure of perovskites it is known that the oxidation state of b site cation and the formation of oxygen vacancy can be controlled by external cation substitution without destroying the matrix structure zhu et al 2014 the enhanced v o was achieved by the substitution of fe with co into the structure of cefeo3 promoting more 1o2 formation for further discussing the relation between 1o2 and fe co ratio the electrodes with different co fe ratios cefeo3 cefe0 7co0 3o3 cefe0 5co0 5o3 cefe0 3co0 7o3 and cecoo3 were prepared and tested the 1o2 signal by epr as shown in fig s13 the intensity of temp 1o2 firstly enhanced and then decreased with the increase of co fe ratio the signal of 1o2 was the strongest at co fe 1 which proved that partial substitution of fe with co promoted the generation of 1o2 path i 3 o h hs o

and pms the application of electric field was more favorable to the enrichment of hso 5 at the anode through electrostatic attraction enhancing the activation of pms by pti in fig 7 a only 26 pms could be decomposed and activated for cbz removal without electric field when 10 ma current was applied the consumption of pms reached 70 and the rate constant of cbz removal increased from 0 058 to 0 467 min 1 compared with no current applying current significantly accelerated the decomposition of pms which was likely to promote the formation of ros to further explore the contribution of electricity to ros generation epr spectra were measured in the e pti pms and pti pms system we selected the highest intensity of dmpo oh dmpo so 4 dmpo o 2 at 30 min and temp 1o2 at 5 min for further comparing the ros in different systems as illustrated in fig 7b d and fig s14 the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so 4 were weak and dmpo o 2 was absent when no electric field was applied after introducing a 10 ma current into the system the oh and so 4 increased and simultaneously strong o 2 appeared the intensity of 1o2 also strengthened which might be transformed from so 4 o 2 and oh to further confirm the higher amount of 1o2 in the e pti pms system the oxidation of metronidazole mde as a probe of 1o2 k 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2022 with or without electric field was conducted as shown in fig 7e the e pti pms system converted 80 7 mde within 30 min corresponding to a 5 2 fold higher amount than that in the pti pms system combining with the decomposition rate of pms in fig 7a the electric field expedited the decomposition and utilization of pms promoting the formation of 1o2 pms also played a vital role for the ros formation and cbz degradation in the e pti pms system in fig 7b d the dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 were ignorable in the e pti system manifesting 30 removal of cbz fig 3a might be attributed to the direct oxidation on pti anode the oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 were significantly enhanced with the assistance of pms resulting in a rapid and complete degradation of cbz the enhanced performance demonstrated that pms provided a crucial prerequisite for the ros generation in comparison with the pti pms and e pti system the electric field and pms both promoted the production and transformation of ros facilitating the degradation and mineralization of cbz 3 4 4 synergistic effect of active sites fe co for 1o2 generation for ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the rare earth element ce with larger ionic radius occupying a place located on the cube vertices stabilizing crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 ce did not play a catalytic role while fe and co were the active sites of pms in the e pti pms system hso 5 was rapidly accumulated around the pti anode due to the electrostatic attraction then coii and feii activated the adsorbed hso 5 and produce so 4 via eq 15 because of the high redox potential of hso 5 so 4 2 5 3 1 v the generated coiii could be reduced to coii through eq 16 since the redox potentials of coiii coii 1 81 v was higher than that of hso 5 so 5 1 1 v while feiii could not transfer to feii which was ascribed to a lower redox potential 0 77 v subsequently oh generated via so 4 reacting with h2o o h as eqs 17 18 h2o2 was created via the reaction of hso 5 and h2o by eq 19 the production of h2o2 increased with the extension of time and reached 2 58 mg l at 30 min fig s15 the decomposition of h2o2 and the reaction between oh and h2o2 induced o 2 eqs 20 22 then partial 1o2 was transformed from so 4 o 2 and oh following the eqs 3 9 above the synergistic effect of co fe played a crucial role in the e pti pms system the standard redox potential of coiii coii 1 81 v is higher than that of feiii feii 0 77 v prompting electrons transfer from feii to coiii as eq 23 and the active site coii continued to react with hso 5 through eq 15 and produce more ros the efficient cycling of coiii coii promoted by the recycling of feii feiii would be a remarkable step leading to highly efficient 1o2 formation and cbz removal in the e pti pms system in order to verify the synergistic effect of fe co bimetals in the system the high resolution xps spectra of pti before and after 30 reuses were compared fig s16 it is reported that ce as a position in perovskite was responsible for stabilizing the crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 without activating pms pena and fierro 2001 to further verify whether ce played a role in the e pti pms system we analyzed the xps spectra of ce 3d fig s16a the characteristic peaks could be deconvoluted into eight peaks and ce was present in mixed valence states of both ceiii and ceiv the peaks at 916 6 ev 907 6 ev 901 2 ev 898 3 ev 889 0 ev and 882 4 ev attributed to ceiv whereas the peaks at 904 0 ev and 885 5 ev were indicative of ceiii liu et al 2020 as calculated the ratio of ceiii ceiv 30 6 69 4 on the used pti surface was close to the fresh pti 30 8 69 2 indicating that ce played a negligible role in the e pti pms system from the spectra of fe 2p on the fresh pti fig s16b two main peaks at 710 2 ev and 723 8 ev corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 along with a shake up satellite peak occupying 718 ev the relative intensity of feii feiii on pti was 48 7 30 5 before the catalytic reaction which decreased to 43 5 34 3 after 30 recycles analogously in fig s16c the ratio of coii coiii reduced from 45 4 32 2 fresh pti to 42 5 33 9 used pti illustrating that feii and coii played major roles for cbz degradation in the e pti pms system partial oxidation of feii and coii on the pti surface resulted in the movement of fe 2p and co 2p peaks to higher binding energies further confirming that feii and coii were the active sites for pms activation additionally the decrease ratio of coii coiii was less than feii feiii after reusing 30 times of pti indicating that coiii was reduced to coii by feii as eq 23 in the reaction process the synergistic effect of fe co bimetals continuously produced coii with higher activity to activate pms creating more ros and accelerating the removal rate of cbz the possible mechanism in the e pti pms system was proposed in scheme 1 reactive species oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all contributed to the cbz removal while 1o2 played a dominant role in brief pms in the form of hso 5 moved towards the pti anode and accumulated on the surface of pti after applying an electric field then hso 5 could be activated to produce sufficient ros 1o2 would be formed in two ways firstly feii and coii reacted with hso 5 to generate oh so 4 and o 2 subsequently transforming into 1o2 simultaneously the hso 5 was also activated by the v o to produce 1o2 directly the cbz molecules were degraded by 1o2 so 4 oh and o 2 and then oxidized to co2

e pti pms system were detected by lc ms table s3 according to the general rules of cbz electrochemical oxidation the possible pathways for cbz degradation have been proposed in scheme 2 due to the high frontier electron density fed of alkene double bond in cbz ros attacked cbz and epoxidized it into possible product p253 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine at m z 253 compared with other intermediates the abundance of p253 was higher in the mass spectrum proving the precursor role of p253 it can be speculated that four ways might appear in the further degradation of p253 firstly p253 might undergo simple ring shrinkages and amide deletions to form p208a and p208b which usually occurred in a pinacol type rearrangement the generated p208a and p208b transformed to p180 acridine by losing the aldehyde group and carbonyl group wang et al 2022c in the third pathway p253 was converted to p210 due to loss of amide group subsequently p210 transferring to p194 song et al 2021 further conversion of p194 also led to form p180 and p180 was oxidized by 1o2 to yield p198 ding et al 2017 in addition the hydrolysis of the p253 promoted the formation of p271 dihydroxy carbamazepine then p271 was converted into dialdehyde compound p269 n n bis 2 carboxyphenyl urea by opening the heterocyclic ring guo et al 2019 p267 generated through the ring contraction reaction and intramolecular cyclization by electrophilic aromatic substitution of p269 zhao et al 2020 p224 was formed from the acetyl cleavage of p267 and then the aldehyde group of p224 was lysed to p196 finally the above intermediates were attacked by ros and undergo ring cleavage forming small molecules and partially mineralizing 3 6 practical application prospect 3 6 1 efficient activation of pms over wide ph ph value a crucial parameter of the actual water matrixes is also one of the key indexes to estimate the practical application prospect of water treatment technology the initial ph of solution directly affected the surface properties of electrode and substrate as well as the production of ros in the e pti pms system zheng et al 2022 in fig 8 a this system exhibited an excellent cbz removal efficiency 100 in 20 min over a wide ph range 3 10 and the best performance appeared at ph 7 the rate constant k enhanced from 0 342 min 1 at initial ph 3 to 0 467 min 1 at ph 7 then declining to 0 168 min 1 with ph further rising to 10 fig s17 at initial ph 11 the cbz removal was 69 within 30 min with the lower k of 0 039 min 1 similar to previous researches jing et al 2021a the ph evolution during the reaction processes under different initial ph was monitored and displayed in fig 8b in the reaction systems of ph 3 10 the solution ph dramatically decreased and maintained acidic during the reaction process the ph value gradually reduced to 5 92 after the reaction in the condition of ph 11 as the solution ph varying in the range of 3 10 pms primarily presented in the form of hso 5 pka1 0 and pka2 9 88 and then efficiently activated by the pti anode duan et al 2018 when the initial ph reached 11 so 5 2 owning the weaker catalytic activity was the predominant existence of pms hindering the cbz removal the e pti pms system processed superior performance for cbz removal in a wide ph range 3 10 suggesting the potential application in actual water matrixes in order to confirm whether e pti pms system posed an environmental risk the leakages of total cerium cobalt and iron after reaction were detected under different initial ph fig 8c the concentrations of leaching ce co and fe were inversely correlated with the initial ph there was relatively higher leakage in initial ph 3 ce 0 16 mg l co 0 44 mg l fe 0 21 mg l and ph 5 ce 0 08 mg l co 0 30 mg l fe 0 18 mg l the acidic environment tends to corrode the metal surface and crystal structure the ce element locating in the center of the cube stabilized the crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the leakage of ce under acidic conditions manifested that the cube structure of perovskite had been slightly destroyed further resulting in the leakage of transition metals co and fe while the pti exposed to neutral and alkaline environment the structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was still stable hence the leaching ce was lower than 0 03 mg l in the ph range of 7 11 and the leaching fe and co were both inferior to 0 16 mg l to identify the contribution of homogeneous electrocatalysis in different ph the maximum of leached metals was employed to activate pms for cbz degradation as shown in fig 8d higher leakage concentration and suitable reaction environment led to better homogeneous reaction under acidic conditions however the rate constants of the e pti pms system were 2 7 times ph 3 and 4 2 times ph 5 than homogeneous systems fig s18 besides the cbz removal efficiency of homogeneous reaction drastically declined in neutral or alkaline environment the k value of homogeneous reaction decreased from 0 033 min 1 in ph 7 to 0 003 min 1 in ph 11 much lower than 0 467 min 1 ph 7 and 0 039 min 1 ph 11 in the e pti pms system the primary activation mode of pms was sustainable heterogeneous reaction rather than non recyclable homogeneous reaction this system presented wide ph applicability 3 10 and low metal leakages indicating the superiority for cbz elimination without secondary pollution the dominant ros was varying under different ph conditions and the results were shown in fig s19 su et al 2021 in epr spectra the dmpo so 4 signal and dmpo oh signal decreased with the ph increasing fig 9 a as calculated in the previous study the form of free radicals was related to ph as follows so 4 ph 9 so 4 and oh coexisted ph 9 11 oh ph 11 respectively fang et al 2012 in alkaline condition so 4 could be converted to oh so 4 oh oh so 4 2 k 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 and dominated the degradation process it is well known that the oxidation potential e ϕ 1 8 2 7 v and the half life period 10 3 μs of oh are much lower than so 4 e ϕ 2 5 3 1 v 30 40 μs hence oh showed a lower reactivity at alkaline condition also leading to the poor removal of cbz the signal of dmpo o 2 adduct was extremely strong at ph 3 then maintained weak intensities in the range of 5 11 fig 9b in contrast the temp 1o2 signal at ph 3 was negligible as the ph rising the intensity of 1o2 increased firstly and then decreased reaching the maximum at ph 7 fig 9c the results manifested that 1o2 was likely to transformed from o 2 in ph 3 oh so 4 and o 2 were the dominant ros due to fenton like reaction with the obvious decrease of o 2 1o2 appeared and kept in high intensities at ph 5 9 proving oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 synergistically removing cbz the best performance of cbz removal was achieved in ph 7 which might be attributed to the highest intensity of 1o2 at ph 11 the less oh o 2 and 1o2 led to the relatively weaker oxidizability for cbz the various ph resulted in the different contribution ratio of ros 3 6 2 excellent stability and recyclability of the pti anode to evaluate the durability of pti anode a continuous treatment of cbz over 30 cycles was conducted in fig 10 a pti exhibited a satisfactory reusability in 30 cycles maintaining 100 cbz removal in 20 min in the first 15 rounds the degradation of cbz hardly changed with a rate constant k exceeding 0 44 min 1 fig s20 the k value of cbz was still 0 4 min 1 after using 30 cycles slightly less than the first cycle 0 467 min 1 the excellent performance for cbz removal over 30 cycles indicated the outstanding stability and recyclability of this system for further discussing the performance of pti anode the leaching metals were detected after reusing 15 and 30 cycles as shown in fig s21 the concentrations of leaching ce co and fe reduced with the increasing cycles the mass of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was quantified by calcinating the ceco0 5fe0 5o3 precursors of the same mass with the same heat process of pti as calculated 5 wt fresh pti 8 42 g contains 420 mg ceco0 5fe0 5o3 in which ce fe and co were 239 7 mg 47 77 mg and 50 41 mg respectively we selected the maximum leaking concentrations of the fresh pti ce 0 03 mg l co 0 16 mg l fe 0 16 mg l to estimate the total leakage in 30 cycles hence the actual total leaching ce fe and co should be lower than 0 09 mg 0 48 mg and 0 48 mg which was only 0 4 10 and 9 5 of the fresh pti the tiny amount of metal leaching would not affect the performance of the pti anode so it still maintained 100 cbz removal after 30 reuses xrd pattern and ftir spectra were utilized to further estimate the stability of pti as displayed in fig 10b except for a slight decrease in peak intensity the xrd pattern showed no significant difference between the used and fresh pti anode ftir spectra revealed that the functional groups on the anode surface changed little before and after the reaction fig s22 the weak peak at 1384 cm 1 was related to the co 3 2 group bonding on the anode surface owing to exposure to the ambient atmosphere the outstanding reusability indicated the huge potential of pti anode in practical application however as the heterogeneous catalysts in sr aops perovskites usually exhibited poor durability and difficulty to recycle due to the negligible magnetism zhang et al prepared 23wt lacoo3 al2o3 to activate pms for degrading atrazine atz and the removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 74 after three cycles zhang et al 2019 similar result was discovered in the laco0 4cu0 6o3 activating pms system and the elimination of phenol reduced to 80 after using 4 times lu et al 2018 the poor recycle performance of heterogeneous catalysis was mainly attributed to the loss of powder catalysts during recovery and elution procedures compared to the heterogeneous perovskite catalysts the pti anode in this work could be reused at least 30 cycles with ultra high rate constants exceeding 0 4 min 1 the recyclability in the e pti pms system was markedly improved by fixing perovskite on ti4o7 substrate and then pressing them into electrodes 3 6 3 extensive applicability of the e pti pms system the versatility of the reaction system was also a crucial index in practical application the catalytic activity of pti anode was estimated at different cbz concentrations fig 11 a the e pti pms system exhibited nearly 100 cbz removal under the initial concentration of 1 20 mg l especially 1 mg l cbz could be rapidly degraded in 1 min with an ultra high rate constant k of 5 466 min 1 as the cbz concentration increasing to 20 mg l the k decreased to 0 174 min 1 the reduction might be attributed to that inadequate ros slowed down the oxidation rate of high concentration of cbz the highly efficient and stable removal of 1 20 mg l cbz further confirmed the outstanding performance of pti anode to investigate the applicability of e pti pms system for different micropollutants 0 05 mm we selected dyes oii rhb pharmaceuticals cbz tc smt sdz and phenols phenol 4 np 4 cp as representatives as shown in fig 11b the e pti pms system removed nearly 100 dyes pharmaceuticals phenol and 4 cp while exhibited a slightly low elimination to 4 np as 1o2 is the primary ros in the e pti pms system it tends to react with electron rich pollutants with electron donating groups edg ch3 oh nh2 and nr2 but exhibits lower reactivity with electron withdrawing groups ewg no2 wang et al 2022a zhao et al 2022b for further exploring the relationship between the removal efficiency and molecular structure of the pollutants we summarized the characteristics of selected pollutants in table s4 it can be seen that the dyes pharmaceuticals phenol and 4 cp possessed abundant edg of ch3 oh nh2 and nr2 which was likely related to the excellent catalytic activities as for the 4 np the ewg of no2 led to the incomplete removal 96 2 even with the edg of oh as a whole the e pti pms system preferred to the electron rich pollutants like dyes and pharmaceuticals in actual waters inorganic ions and natural organic matters noms possibly disturb the removal process of organic pollutants several typical coexisting substances c l no 3 so 4 2 po 4 3 and ha were selected to explore their effects on the e pti pms system in fig 11c so 4 2 c l and ha showed negligible effect on the cbz removal a minor inhibition 5 appeared in the presence of 10 mm no 3 or po 4 3 which could be ascribed to the competitive effect between ros and no 3 or po 4 3 wang and wang 2018 in general the e pti pms system was hardly interfered by the co existing substances in real waters to further evaluate the potential of the e pti pms system in real matrixes 1 mg l cbz was selected for experiments in lake water secondary wastewater effluent aquaculture wastewater and medical wastewater without adjusting the ph the quality parameters of water wastewater were provided in table s5 as shown in fig 11d 1 mg l cbz was rapidly removed within 5 min in all the real matrixes and the removal rate in aquaculture wastewater was faster than the others it can be observed that the concentration of c l 9535 mg l in the aquaculture wastewater is much higher than that in the other waters which might be related to the superior performance previous study has reported that high content of c l reacted with ros and produced reactive chlorine species rcs c l cl 2 cl2 and hocl accelerating the removal process of pollutants jing et al 2021b hence the e pti pms system has great potential in treating high salinity water due to the advantage of high c l and it showed promising application prospects in other actual matrixes as well 3 6 4 economic analysis energy consumption is another important consideration in practical water treatments the eec and eeo values were calculated and showed in table s6 the eec of e pti pms system was 5 kwh kg cbz only 0 034 times that of e ti4o7 pms system the energy consumption of common anode systems e dsa pms and e bdd pms were 130 and 78 kwh kg cbz much higher than that of e pti pms system besides the eeo value of e pti pms system was 0 025 kwh m3 log which was only 1 0 and 1 3 of e dsa pms 2 363 kwh m3 log and e bdd pms system 1 888 kwh m3 log respectively compared to the common dsa and bdd anodes pti exhibited a superiority with high efficiency and low cost moreover the performances of electro activation process of pms in literatures were compared in table 2 as reported in the literature the cbz was 100 removed within 40 min using an activated carbon fiber acf as the cathode to activate 50 mm pms under ph 3 at current density of 28 6 ma cm2 with the rate constant k of 0 081 min 1 liu et al 2019 in this work 100 cbz could be rapidly degraded within 10 min with a higher k 0 467 min 1 less pms 1 mm and lower current density 1 ma cm2 and the eeo value in this work was only 0 025 kwh m3 log which was only 1 3 that of the e acf pms process 1 89 kwh m3 log the e pti pms system presented excellent performance for tc degradation with the rate constant k of 0 212 min 1 superior to that 0 159 min 1 of ti4o7 cathode with 10 mm pms 10 mm nacl and 20 ma cm2 current density in the previous research li et al 2022a less reagent demand and lower applied current will reduce the energy consumption and save a lot of cost in practical application besides perovskite was firstly applied to enhance the efficiency of electro activation of pms to overcome the shortcomings of eaops and sr aops alone we elaborated the reaction mechanism especially the potentiation role of electric field and pms the 1o2 in this work was generated from the so 4 o 2 oh and v o at the pti anode which was different from h2o2 and o 2 ho 2 in the electro activation of pms process at the graphene oxide iron oxide nanoparticle doped ti4o7 go fe3o4 nps ti4o7 cathode li et al 2022c compared to the eaops the introduction of pms enhanced the oxidation capability expanded the ph adaptability and reduced the energy consumption electro enhanced activation of pms also solved the difficulty of recycling catalysts in homogeneous or heterogeneous sr aops in conclusion the e pti pms system presented an enormous potential in practical application including ultra efficient removal of cbz wide ph range excellent stability and reusability versatility for different pollutants excellent performance in actual matrixes less cost and ultra low energy consumption 4 conclusion in this work electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops and sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops were combined to overcome the disadvantages of using them

15043,traditional free radicals dominated electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops and sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are limited by ph dependence and weak reusability respectively to overcome these shortcomings electro enhanced activation of peroxymonosulfate pms on a novel perovskite ti4o7 composite anode e pti pms system was proposed it achieved an ultra efficient removal rate k 0 467 min 1 of carbamazepine cbz approximately 36 and 8 times of the e pti and pti pms systems singlet oxygen 1o2 played a dominant role in the e pti pms system and transformed from so 4 o 2 oh and oxygen vacancy v o the electric field expedited the decomposition and utilization of pms promoting the generation of radicals and expanding the formation pathway of

their ubiquity in the environment and potential adverse ecological effects ebele et al 2017 snyder et al 2003 yu et al 2020c ppcps are refractory bio accumulative persistent and difficult to be thoroughly removed by traditional processes irrigation with treated wastewater and application of biosolids introduce numerous ppcps into agro food systems posing potential food safety and human health risks fu et al 2019 carbamazepine cbz c15h12n2o one of the most common anti epileptic drugs has been identified as a candidate of future emerging priority pollutant by the european union water

wong 2013 zhang et al 2008 the average concentration of cbz in water bodies is 0 187 μg l and the maximum even reaches 8 05 μg l sundararaman et al 2022 even 1 μg l cbz reveals reproduction toxicity decreases enzymatic activity and bioaccumulation jeopardizing ecological environment and human health braeutigam et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven to be effective to degrade and mineralize refractory contaminants oturan and aaron 2014 wang et al 2023 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops and sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are two typical and efficient processes in aops eaops have the advantages of convenient recovery and reuse of electrodes along with the shortcomings of energy consumption and ph dependence in the processes du et al 2021 moreira et al 2017 the short half life of oh t 10 9 s also causes low utilization of free radicals in eaops sr aops are promising alternatives to conventional water treatment due to their powerful oxidation capability and wide ph adaptability guan et al 2020 zong et al 2020 however the homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in sr aops are difficult to recycle possibly causing secondary pollution therefore it is ideal to combine eaops and sr aops for complementary strengths achieving high efficiency and low energy consumption for pollutants treatments the electric field can be applied to enhance the activation efficiency of peroxymonosulfate pms to overcome the disadvantages of eaops and sr aops alone researches on cathodic activation of pms have been reported recently but few studies have been conducted on anodes li et al 2022c liu et al 2019 it is generally believed that the activation of pms requires electron transfer to pms while the anode tends to donate electrons rather than gain them in electrooxidation leading to the neglect of pms activation at the anode in fact pms exists in the form of anions in the water and pms anions are more likely to accumulate on the anode surface after applying the electric field but the research on electro activation of pms at anode is still in the initial stage and its performance and reaction mechanism are still unclear different anodes have different oxidation mechanisms which deserves further in depth research anode material is a key component in determining the efficiency of eaops lin et al 2021 it is crucial to search a suitable electrode with excellent electrochemical performance and high activation efficiency of pms compared to the common dimensionally stable anodes dsa and boron doping

for electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants and disinfection of viruses wang et al 2018 however strategies to improve the activation of pms are still needed owing to the poor pms activity of pristine ti4o7 gayen et al 2018 perovskite oxides abo3 as cheap alternatives to platinum group metal catalyst exhibit significant catalytic capacity in sr aops due to the tunable structure thermal

ammonia nitrogen and organics hwang et al 2017 a position is the rare earth or alkaline earth metal ion and the b position is the transition metal ion the a position is mainly responsible for stabilizing the crystal structure of perovskite while the b position is the active site for catalysis pena and fierro 2001 a site and b site doping is an effective method to indirectly or directly improve the catalytic performance of perovskite the partial substitution of fe with co at the b site will introduce oxygen vacancies by controlling the oxidation state zhu et al 2014 redox cycle of feii feiii and coiii coii in the bimetallic system can enhance pms activation and reactive oxygen species ros formation hence a new strategy is combining ti4o7 with fe co bimetallic perovskite simultaneously realizing the excellent electrical conductivity and better catalytic activity in pms electro activation system herein perovskite type ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was introduced into ti4o7 substrate for activating pms to integrate eaops with sr aops accomplishing ultra efficient removal of cbz with low energy consumption the main aims of this study were to i investigate the physicochemical

and discussion 3 1 characterization and properties of the pti anode the sharp xrd pattern showed well developed crystalline nature of the synthesized anodes as shown in fig 1 a ti4o7 exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 2 1 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 4 1 2 0 0 2 4 2 1 3 0 2 4 3 2 2 1 4 2 2 2 4 and 3 2 6 crystal planes of the ti4o7 phase jcpds no 72 1722 soroush almassi 2019 when ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was introduced into ti4o7 the peaks of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 gradually appeared and the signals of ti4o7 slightly weakened with the increase of the ratio of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the peaks strengthening at 28 4 32 9 44 7 47 4 and 56 2 proved the successful preparation of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 fig s2 hu et al 2020 sharma and ameta 2017 5 wt pti retained the high purity magneli phases ti4o7 indicating the synthesis of 5 wt ceco0 5fe0 5o3 did not oxidize or reduce ti4o7 however most diffraction peaks of ti4o7 weakened obviously and shifted to higher peak positions with the 25 wt ceco0 5fe0 5o3 similar to tio2 jcpds no 76 0324 the xrd of 5 wt pti remained the peaks of ti4o7 with an extremely weak intensity this result suggested that the amount of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 had better not exceed 5 wt the specific surface area of catalysts is an important index to evaluate the adsorption and degradation properties as depicted in fig 1b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of 5 wt pti belonged to the typical type ii curve with type 3 hysteresis loop based on the iupac classification the bet surface area of pti was 14 5 m2 g higher than the 12 8 m2 g of pure ti4o7 fig s3 fig 1b inset showed that the pore size of pti distributed in the range of 1 8 131 nm among which about 10 were micropores 87 were mesopores and 3 were macropores the average pore diameter was 12 nm and total pore volume was 0 022 cm3 g while there were 68 mesopores and 32 macropores in the ti4o7 and the total pore volume was 0 043 cm3 g compared to the pure ti4o7 the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 contributed to higher bet surface area and smaller pores of pti the multistage porous structure can promote the migration of pollutants to the pti surface and provide more accessible active sites further accelerating the catalytic reaction wang et al 2020b sem images showed the morphology and textural property of ti4o7 and 5 wt pti the surface of the original ti4o7 was smooth and clean fig 1c e whereas the surface of pti presented a rough and homogenous coating layer after introducing the perovskite fig 1f h the massive structure at the bottom was ti4o7 and the thin layer on the ti4o7 was ceco0 5fe0 5o3 perovskite the strong adhesion of the compact perovskite layer might enhance the stability of the anode wang et al 2018 the eds data in fig s4 showed that ti and o appeared on the surface of original ti4o7 the ratio of ti to o atoms of ti4o7 was 4 6 8 close to 4 7 ti o ratio in ti4o7 after introducing the perovskite ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the elements of ce ti co fe and o were evenly distributed fig 1i the eds of pti showed that the mass fractions of ce co and fe were 4 6 wt 1 2 wt and 1 0 wt respectively by dividing the relative atomic mass the molar ratio of ce co fe was approximately 1 9 1 1 1 approaching to 2 1 1 further confirming the successful formation of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 fig s5 electrochemical measurements were conducted to assess the electrochemical characteristics of pti and ti4o7 anodes as the lsv curves shown in fig 2 a pti possessed a higher oxygen evolution potential oep of 1 99 v vs ag agcl than 1 90 v of pure ti4o7 from cv curves in fig 2b pti exhibited a greater current response than the pristine ti4o7 promoting the high catalytic activity and electron transfer process the results were consistent with those in the lsv curves demonstrating the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 improved the conductivity and lowered the oep activity in nyquist plot fig 2c the ohmic resistance r0 of pti and ti4o7 anodes was similar about 20 5 ω it was proposed that the charge transfer resistance rct was related to the electron transfer kinetics and electrocatalytic activity the rct of pti 28 02 ω was far lower than that of ti4o7 72 35 ω indicating the faster charge transfer and higher reaction activity of pti the diffusion resistance rd of pti and ti4o7 anodes were 7 94 ω and 85 12 ω respectively the ultra low rd suggested the interaction of pti was benefit to the electron transfer between fe and co su et al 2022 3 2 the superiority of pti anode for cbz removal the removal efficiency of cbz 10 mg l rate constant and toc removal by pms activation in various processes were compared in fig 3 as described in fig 3a almost no cbz was removed by adsorption in 30 min suggesting that the adsorption capacity of pti anode was negligible the oxidative degradation of cbz by pms alone was less than 5 indicating that pms itself could hardly produce ros around 16 removal efficiency of cbz occurring in e ti4o7 pms system were not satisfactory fig 3a but the catalytic activity was significantly enhanced with the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 demonstrating that pms could easily be activated by pti in the presence of electric field as the amount of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 increased from 2 5 wt to 7 5 wt the removal efficiency of cbz increased and then reduced 5 wt pti showed approximate 100 cbz removal and the fastest reaction rate which was selected as the optimized anode and used in the subsequent experiments fig s6 the electro pti e pti system without pms could only remove 30 cbz mainly by the direct oxidation of the pti anode while the pti activating pms pti pms system achieved 83 cbz removal within 30 min for discussing the rate constants of different systems zero order and pseudo first order reaction kinetics were applied to analyze the degradation process of cbz fig s7 the kinetics rate constants of cbz removal in different systems were listed in table 1 comparing the rate constant and r2 in each system the cbz degradation dynamics in the e pti pms system was fitted well with the first order reaction model k 0 467 min 1 r2 0 99 rather than zero order reaction model k 0 675 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 66 while the pti pms system preferred to the zero order reaction model k 0 292 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 99 and the other systems exhibited same or close r2 fitting with the two kinetic models strikingly 100 cbz was rapidly degraded within 10 min in the e pti pms system with an ultra high rate constant k of 0 467 min 1 approximately 36 times than that in the e pti system the assistance of pms enhanced more than 70 removal of cbz simultaneously reducing the energy consumption significantly from 147 24 to 5 02 kwh kg cbz besides the electric field also highly enhanced the degradation rate of cbz which proved that both electricity and pms were crucial in the e pti pms system compared to the common dsa and bdd anode the e pti pms system was much superior to the e dsa pms system 17 and e bdd pms system 30 the first order kinetic rate constant k of e pti pms system 0 467 min 1 r2 0 99 was remarkably improved approximately 68 68 and 41 times that of ti4o7 0 007 min 1 r2 0 94 dsa 0 007 min 1 r2 0 93 and bdd 0 011 min 1 r2 0 98 respectively table 1 compared to the other anodes the outstanding performance of pti could be ascribed to the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 it has been reported that transition metals fe and co can effectively activate pms and generate ros for pollutants elimination in fig 3b the toc removal of e pti pms system could reach 40 within 120 min while those in the other systems were all less than 20 the k of toc removal 0 0041 min 1 was 2 times higher than that of other systems 0 002 min 1 fig 3b the superiority of e pti pms system might be attributed to the stimulation of electric field fast electron transfer and synergistic effect of fe co bimetallic perovskite which would be further discussed to sum up pti anode was a prospective alternative to dsa and bdd towards high efficient and low cost removal of pollutants in practical application 3 3 effects of the reaction parameters the effects of current density and pms concentration on cbz degradation in the e pti pms system were evaluated fig 4 the applied current was a common and crucial parameter in the electrochemical process in fig 4a when the current density increased from 0 to 1 0 ma cm2 the cbz removal efficiency and the corresponding degradation rate constant k enhanced with the increasing current fig 4b obviously the electric field promoted the rapid decomposition of pms and accelerated the degradation of cbz however as the current density reaching 1 5 ma cm2 the kinetic rate constant was decreased to 0 209 min 1 it was probably because the higher current density would lead to the stronger side reactions for oxygen evolution competing with the cbz degradation cai et al 2019 the energy consumption increased with the rising current density while the eec values maintained at a low level 5 02 kwh kg cbz as the current density below 1 0 ma cm2 the eec leapt to 32 61 kwh kg cbz at 1 5 ma cm2 so 1 0 ma cm2 was the most suitable current density with the highest constant k fig 4c illustrated the influence of the pms concentration varying from 0 to 2 mm on cbz removal in this system when the pms concentration increased from 0 mm to 0 5 mm the removal efficiency of cbz significantly improved from 30 to 96 the cbz removal reached 100 within 10 min at 1 mm pms but slightly decreased as the pms concentration surpassing 1 mm in this system the rate constant k in fig 4d exhibited the same trend that enhancing from 0 013 min 1 0 mm to 0 467 min 1 1 mm and then declining to 0 195 min 1 2 mm this result might be attributed to the active sites on the pti surface have been saturated as the pms dosage reaching a certain level limiting the production of ros lei et al 2022 for further discussing the effect of pms concentration on 1o2 we detected the signal of temp 1o2 under different pms concentrations by epr as shown in fig s8 the signal of temp 1o2 was enhanced when the pms increased from 0 to 1 mm and then gradually weakened with the pms exceeding 1 mm the intensity of 1o2 reached the highest in the condition of 1 mm pms which was consistent with the removal result of cbz it also indicated that the concentration of pms determined the production of 1o2 further affecting the cbz removal therefore excessive pms was unprofitable for cbz elimination from an economic point of view 1 ma cm2 current and 1 mm pms were the optimal choice in the e pti pms system for subsequent experiments 3 4 mechanism in the e pti pms system 3 4 1 the dominant role of 1o2 in the sr aops radicals oh so 4 o 2 and nonradical 1o2 are generally considered as the ros that efficiently removing pollutants the production of ros in the e pti pms system was probed by employing scavengers meoh tba sod and l his meoh would scavenge both oh and so 4 k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so 4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 t buoh could also effectively inhibit oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but not equally valid to so 4 k so 4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 huang and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2022a as shown in fig 5 a all the scavengers impeded the reaction process for cbz degradation tba slightly weakened the cbz degradation suggesting that the contribution of oh on cbz removal was weak the inhibition of meoh 45 was far higher than that of tba which demonstrated the significant role of so 4 epr technique was utilized to further certify the generation of ros in the e pti pms system without cbz the dmpo so 4 signals six line peaks intensities of 1 1 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh signals four line peaks intensities of 1 2 2 1 appeared and strengthened with time fig 5b sod was used to quench o 2 and the rate constant k declined from 0 467 min 1 to 0 203 min 1 testifying the production of o 2 could not be ignored fig s9 the sextet peaks of dmpo o 2 also emerged and fluctuated at a certain intensity fig 5c l his is an efficient scavenger for nonradical 1o2 k 1 o 2 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 97 8 cbz removal was inhibited after adding l his indicating the large production of 1o2 in this system the strong 1 1 1 triplet signal of temp 1o2 was observed in 2 min then enhancing and retaining a high intensity fig 5d to further explore the contribution of different ros the epr test was conducted in the presence of 10 mg l cbz as discussed in fig 3a before cbz was degraded completely within 10 min in the e pti pms system combined with the fig s10 the intensity of oh so 4 and o 2 decreased a little within 10 min after adding cbz while the signal of 1o2 sharply reduced this phenomenon confirmed that oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all contributed to the cbz removal in the e pti pms system it is reported that cbz potentially react faster with 1o2 owing to 1 3 diene moiety of cbz dong et al 2015 hence most 1o2 was rapidly consumed and dominated the degradation of cbz in the e pti pms system consistent with the result of scavenger action in fig 5a as discussed above cbz was completely degraded within 10 min and 1o2 dominated the cbz removal after 10 min the signal of 1o2 decreased while oh and so 4 strengthened although cbz was 100 degraded in 10 min toc was only removed 4 5 fig s11 the depletion of toc by 1o2 seems to be difficult due to the mild oxidation potential of 1o2 li et al 2023 yu et al 2020a it can be inferred that the increased oh and so 4 would be employed for the toc mineralization after 10 min as shown in fig s11 the toc removal reached 10 5 at 30 min and 40 at 120 min hence 1o2 might play a predominant role for degrading cbz molecules while oh and so 4 contributed more to the toc mineralization in short oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all conduced to the cbz removal while 1o2 played a dominant role in the e pti pms system electron transfer is another typical nonradical process in aops ren et al 2020 to explore the role of the electron transfer process in the e pti pms system electrochemical measurements were conducted to assess the charge transfer between pms and pti as shown in the lsv curves fig 5e the oep increased from 1 99 v vs ag agcl only electrolyte to 2 05 v vs ag agcl pms activation after adding 1 mm pms the higher oep manifested that the introduction of pms could inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction and reduce the energy consumption wang et al 2020a a slight increase of current 2 µa was triggered by the injection of cbz in fig 5f illustrating that a current flow from organics to the nonradical species was formed on the surface of pti zhu et al 2018 these results indicated the electron transfer process occurred among the electron donor cbz electron acceptor pms and electron transfer mediator pti yun et al 2018a however the current response of this system was extremely weak compared to those dominated by electron transfer process in the literature ren et al 2022 illustrating the minor contribution of the electron transfer process in the e pti pms system combing with the 97 8 inhibition of l his in the capture experiments fig 5a most of the cbz molecules were degraded by 1o2 and very few cbz were indirectly oxidized by the electron transfer process in conclusion radicals oh so 4 o 2 nonradical 1o2 and electron transfer process occurred in the e pti pms system but 1o2 played a leading role for cbz removal 3 4 2 proposed pathways of 1o2 generation as reported oh so 4 and o 2 were the important sources of 1o2 li et al 2022c yun et al 2018b firstly 1o2 could be generated from oh as eqs 3 4 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 it was reported that so 4 were inclined to react with hso 5 to produce so 5 with a low oxidative potential 1 1 v and high reaction rate k 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 through eq 5 dong et al 2021 zhao et al 2023 thanks to the high reaction rate k 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 and low activation energy e 7 4 2 4 kcal mol rapid self reaction of so 5 will conduce to the formation of 1o2 eqs 6 and 7 lei et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 as shown in fig 5b and 5d the signal of temp 1o2 sharply increased in the first 5 min and reached the highest at 5 min while the signals of dmpo so 4 and dmpo oh were low within 5 min combined with fig 5a cbz was rapidly degraded by 90 at 5 min and completely removed within 10 min in the e pti pms system obviously 1o2 significantly increased and dominated the cbz degradation in the first 5 min while so 4 and oh were relatively weak it probably illustrated that most of the so 4 and oh were converted to 1o2 cbz was completely removed and 1o2 began to decrease after 10 min which meant that the conversion process of so 4 and oh to 1o2 was weakened as a result the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so 4 strengthened with time the opposite trend also verified the pathway about that 1o2 would be transformed from so 4 and oh 1o2 could be also evoked by the recombination of o 2 from the possible ways in eqs 8 9 yu et al 2020b to explore the source and transformation way of 1o2 the epr spectra of 1o2 were compared after scavenging oh so 4 and o 2 respectively obviously the signals of temp 1o2 all weakened after adding tba meoh or sod indicating that 1o2 would be generated from oh so 4 and o 2 in the e pti pms system fig 6 a besides it was reported that 1o2 might be also generated from oxygen by trapping the activation energy of pms as eqs 10 12 huang et al 2018 to confirm the role of o2 in the e pti pms system we explored the cbz removal by removing o2 from the solution with n2 saturation in fig 6b no significant difference on cbz removal was observed under n2 saturated condition the rate constant in n2 saturation was 0 451 min 1 fig s12 approach to the control 0 467 min 1 obviously o2 played a negligible role in the e pti pms system which further illustrated that o2 was not the main source for 1o2 formation to further investigate the generation pathway of 1o2 oxygen vacancy v o of pti was detected to verify whether v o was the active site to produce 1o2 li et al 2022b zhou et al 2021 specifically the v o was activated to reactive oxygen o by electron transfer and then converted into 1o2 through coupling with pms eqs 13 14 in fig 6c the signal peak g 2 004 was proportional to the quantity of oxygen defects zhang et al 2020b it can be clearly seen that pti possessed a higher intensity of v o than ti4o7 based on the abo3 type structure of perovskites it is known that the oxidation state of b site cation and the formation of oxygen vacancy can be controlled by external cation substitution without destroying the matrix structure zhu et al 2014 the enhanced v o was achieved by the substitution of fe with co into the structure of cefeo3 promoting more 1o2 formation for further discussing the relation between 1o2 and fe co ratio the electrodes with different co fe ratios cefeo3 cefe0 7co0 3o3 cefe0 5co0 5o3 cefe0 3co0 7o3 and cecoo3 were prepared and tested the 1o2 signal by epr as shown in fig s13 the intensity of temp 1o2 firstly enhanced and then decreased with the increase of co fe ratio the signal of 1o2 was the strongest at co fe 1 which proved that partial substitution of fe with co promoted the generation of 1o2 path i 3 o h hs o

and pms the application of electric field was more favorable to the enrichment of hso 5 at the anode through electrostatic attraction enhancing the activation of pms by pti in fig 7 a only 26 pms could be decomposed and activated for cbz removal without electric field when 10 ma current was applied the consumption of pms reached 70 and the rate constant of cbz removal increased from 0 058 to 0 467 min 1 compared with no current applying current significantly accelerated the decomposition of pms which was likely to promote the formation of ros to further explore the contribution of electricity to ros generation epr spectra were measured in the e pti pms and pti pms system we selected the highest intensity of dmpo oh dmpo so 4 dmpo o 2 at 30 min and temp 1o2 at 5 min for further comparing the ros in different systems as illustrated in fig 7b d and fig s14 the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so 4 were weak and dmpo o 2 was absent when no electric field was applied after introducing a 10 ma current into the system the oh and so 4 increased and simultaneously strong o 2 appeared the intensity of 1o2 also strengthened which might be transformed from so 4 o 2 and oh to further confirm the higher amount of 1o2 in the e pti pms system the oxidation of metronidazole mde as a probe of 1o2 k 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2022 with or without electric field was conducted as shown in fig 7e the e pti pms system converted 80 7 mde within 30 min corresponding to a 5 2 fold higher amount than that in the pti pms system combining with the decomposition rate of pms in fig 7a the electric field expedited the decomposition and utilization of pms promoting the formation of 1o2 pms also played a vital role for the ros formation and cbz degradation in the e pti pms system in fig 7b d the dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 were ignorable in the e pti system manifesting 30 removal of cbz fig 3a might be attributed to the direct oxidation on pti anode the oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 were significantly enhanced with the assistance of pms resulting in a rapid and complete degradation of cbz the enhanced performance demonstrated that pms provided a crucial prerequisite for the ros generation in comparison with the pti pms and e pti system the electric field and pms both promoted the production and transformation of ros facilitating the degradation and mineralization of cbz 3 4 4 synergistic effect of active sites fe co for 1o2 generation for ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the rare earth element ce with larger ionic radius occupying a place located on the cube vertices stabilizing crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 ce did not play a catalytic role while fe and co were the active sites of pms in the e pti pms system hso 5 was rapidly accumulated around the pti anode due to the electrostatic attraction then coii and feii activated the adsorbed hso 5 and produce so 4 via eq 15 because of the high redox potential of hso 5 so 4 2 5 3 1 v the generated coiii could be reduced to coii through eq 16 since the redox potentials of coiii coii 1 81 v was higher than that of hso 5 so 5 1 1 v while feiii could not transfer to feii which was ascribed to a lower redox potential 0 77 v subsequently oh generated via so 4 reacting with h2o o h as eqs 17 18 h2o2 was created via the reaction of hso 5 and h2o by eq 19 the production of h2o2 increased with the extension of time and reached 2 58 mg l at 30 min fig s15 the decomposition of h2o2 and the reaction between oh and h2o2 induced o 2 eqs 20 22 then partial 1o2 was transformed from so 4 o 2 and oh following the eqs 3 9 above the synergistic effect of co fe played a crucial role in the e pti pms system the standard redox potential of coiii coii 1 81 v is higher than that of feiii feii 0 77 v prompting electrons transfer from feii to coiii as eq 23 and the active site coii continued to react with hso 5 through eq 15 and produce more ros the efficient cycling of coiii coii promoted by the recycling of feii feiii would be a remarkable step leading to highly efficient 1o2 formation and cbz removal in the e pti pms system in order to verify the synergistic effect of fe co bimetals in the system the high resolution xps spectra of pti before and after 30 reuses were compared fig s16 it is reported that ce as a position in perovskite was responsible for stabilizing the crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 without activating pms pena and fierro 2001 to further verify whether ce played a role in the e pti pms system we analyzed the xps spectra of ce 3d fig s16a the characteristic peaks could be deconvoluted into eight peaks and ce was present in mixed valence states of both ceiii and ceiv the peaks at 916 6 ev 907 6 ev 901 2 ev 898 3 ev 889 0 ev and 882 4 ev attributed to ceiv whereas the peaks at 904 0 ev and 885 5 ev were indicative of ceiii liu et al 2020 as calculated the ratio of ceiii ceiv 30 6 69 4 on the used pti surface was close to the fresh pti 30 8 69 2 indicating that ce played a negligible role in the e pti pms system from the spectra of fe 2p on the fresh pti fig s16b two main peaks at 710 2 ev and 723 8 ev corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 along with a shake up satellite peak occupying 718 ev the relative intensity of feii feiii on pti was 48 7 30 5 before the catalytic reaction which decreased to 43 5 34 3 after 30 recycles analogously in fig s16c the ratio of coii coiii reduced from 45 4 32 2 fresh pti to 42 5 33 9 used pti illustrating that feii and coii played major roles for cbz degradation in the e pti pms system partial oxidation of feii and coii on the pti surface resulted in the movement of fe 2p and co 2p peaks to higher binding energies further confirming that feii and coii were the active sites for pms activation additionally the decrease ratio of coii coiii was less than feii feiii after reusing 30 times of pti indicating that coiii was reduced to coii by feii as eq 23 in the reaction process the synergistic effect of fe co bimetals continuously produced coii with higher activity to activate pms creating more ros and accelerating the removal rate of cbz the possible mechanism in the e pti pms system was proposed in scheme 1 reactive species oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 all contributed to the cbz removal while 1o2 played a dominant role in brief pms in the form of hso 5 moved towards the pti anode and accumulated on the surface of pti after applying an electric field then hso 5 could be activated to produce sufficient ros 1o2 would be formed in two ways firstly feii and coii reacted with hso 5 to generate oh so 4 and o 2 subsequently transforming into 1o2 simultaneously the hso 5 was also activated by the v o to produce 1o2 directly the cbz molecules were degraded by 1o2 so 4 oh and o 2 and then oxidized to co2

e pti pms system were detected by lc ms table s3 according to the general rules of cbz electrochemical oxidation the possible pathways for cbz degradation have been proposed in scheme 2 due to the high frontier electron density fed of alkene double bond in cbz ros attacked cbz and epoxidized it into possible product p253 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine at m z 253 compared with other intermediates the abundance of p253 was higher in the mass spectrum proving the precursor role of p253 it can be speculated that four ways might appear in the further degradation of p253 firstly p253 might undergo simple ring shrinkages and amide deletions to form p208a and p208b which usually occurred in a pinacol type rearrangement the generated p208a and p208b transformed to p180 acridine by losing the aldehyde group and carbonyl group wang et al 2022c in the third pathway p253 was converted to p210 due to loss of amide group subsequently p210 transferring to p194 song et al 2021 further conversion of p194 also led to form p180 and p180 was oxidized by 1o2 to yield p198 ding et al 2017 in addition the hydrolysis of the p253 promoted the formation of p271 dihydroxy carbamazepine then p271 was converted into dialdehyde compound p269 n n bis 2 carboxyphenyl urea by opening the heterocyclic ring guo et al 2019 p267 generated through the ring contraction reaction and intramolecular cyclization by electrophilic aromatic substitution of p269 zhao et al 2020 p224 was formed from the acetyl cleavage of p267 and then the aldehyde group of p224 was lysed to p196 finally the above intermediates were attacked by ros and undergo ring cleavage forming small molecules and partially mineralizing 3 6 practical application prospect 3 6 1 efficient activation of pms over wide ph ph value a crucial parameter of the actual water matrixes is also one of the key indexes to estimate the practical application prospect of water treatment technology the initial ph of solution directly affected the surface properties of electrode and substrate as well as the production of ros in the e pti pms system zheng et al 2022 in fig 8 a this system exhibited an excellent cbz removal efficiency 100 in 20 min over a wide ph range 3 10 and the best performance appeared at ph 7 the rate constant k enhanced from 0 342 min 1 at initial ph 3 to 0 467 min 1 at ph 7 then declining to 0 168 min 1 with ph further rising to 10 fig s17 at initial ph 11 the cbz removal was 69 within 30 min with the lower k of 0 039 min 1 similar to previous researches jing et al 2021a the ph evolution during the reaction processes under different initial ph was monitored and displayed in fig 8b in the reaction systems of ph 3 10 the solution ph dramatically decreased and maintained acidic during the reaction process the ph value gradually reduced to 5 92 after the reaction in the condition of ph 11 as the solution ph varying in the range of 3 10 pms primarily presented in the form of hso 5 pka1 0 and pka2 9 88 and then efficiently activated by the pti anode duan et al 2018 when the initial ph reached 11 so 5 2 owning the weaker catalytic activity was the predominant existence of pms hindering the cbz removal the e pti pms system processed superior performance for cbz removal in a wide ph range 3 10 suggesting the potential application in actual water matrixes in order to confirm whether e pti pms system posed an environmental risk the leakages of total cerium cobalt and iron after reaction were detected under different initial ph fig 8c the concentrations of leaching ce co and fe were inversely correlated with the initial ph there was relatively higher leakage in initial ph 3 ce 0 16 mg l co 0 44 mg l fe 0 21 mg l and ph 5 ce 0 08 mg l co 0 30 mg l fe 0 18 mg l the acidic environment tends to corrode the metal surface and crystal structure the ce element locating in the center of the cube stabilized the crystal structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 the leakage of ce under acidic conditions manifested that the cube structure of perovskite had been slightly destroyed further resulting in the leakage of transition metals co and fe while the pti exposed to neutral and alkaline environment the structure of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was still stable hence the leaching ce was lower than 0 03 mg l in the ph range of 7 11 and the leaching fe and co were both inferior to 0 16 mg l to identify the contribution of homogeneous electrocatalysis in different ph the maximum of leached metals was employed to activate pms for cbz degradation as shown in fig 8d higher leakage concentration and suitable reaction environment led to better homogeneous reaction under acidic conditions however the rate constants of the e pti pms system were 2 7 times ph 3 and 4 2 times ph 5 than homogeneous systems fig s18 besides the cbz removal efficiency of homogeneous reaction drastically declined in neutral or alkaline environment the k value of homogeneous reaction decreased from 0 033 min 1 in ph 7 to 0 003 min 1 in ph 11 much lower than 0 467 min 1 ph 7 and 0 039 min 1 ph 11 in the e pti pms system the primary activation mode of pms was sustainable heterogeneous reaction rather than non recyclable homogeneous reaction this system presented wide ph applicability 3 10 and low metal leakages indicating the superiority for cbz elimination without secondary pollution the dominant ros was varying under different ph conditions and the results were shown in fig s19 su et al 2021 in epr spectra the dmpo so 4 signal and dmpo oh signal decreased with the ph increasing fig 9 a as calculated in the previous study the form of free radicals was related to ph as follows so 4 ph 9 so 4 and oh coexisted ph 9 11 oh ph 11 respectively fang et al 2012 in alkaline condition so 4 could be converted to oh so 4 oh oh so 4 2 k 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 and dominated the degradation process it is well known that the oxidation potential e ϕ 1 8 2 7 v and the half life period 10 3 μs of oh are much lower than so 4 e ϕ 2 5 3 1 v 30 40 μs hence oh showed a lower reactivity at alkaline condition also leading to the poor removal of cbz the signal of dmpo o 2 adduct was extremely strong at ph 3 then maintained weak intensities in the range of 5 11 fig 9b in contrast the temp 1o2 signal at ph 3 was negligible as the ph rising the intensity of 1o2 increased firstly and then decreased reaching the maximum at ph 7 fig 9c the results manifested that 1o2 was likely to transformed from o 2 in ph 3 oh so 4 and o 2 were the dominant ros due to fenton like reaction with the obvious decrease of o 2 1o2 appeared and kept in high intensities at ph 5 9 proving oh so 4 o 2 and 1o2 synergistically removing cbz the best performance of cbz removal was achieved in ph 7 which might be attributed to the highest intensity of 1o2 at ph 11 the less oh o 2 and 1o2 led to the relatively weaker oxidizability for cbz the various ph resulted in the different contribution ratio of ros 3 6 2 excellent stability and recyclability of the pti anode to evaluate the durability of pti anode a continuous treatment of cbz over 30 cycles was conducted in fig 10 a pti exhibited a satisfactory reusability in 30 cycles maintaining 100 cbz removal in 20 min in the first 15 rounds the degradation of cbz hardly changed with a rate constant k exceeding 0 44 min 1 fig s20 the k value of cbz was still 0 4 min 1 after using 30 cycles slightly less than the first cycle 0 467 min 1 the excellent performance for cbz removal over 30 cycles indicated the outstanding stability and recyclability of this system for further discussing the performance of pti anode the leaching metals were detected after reusing 15 and 30 cycles as shown in fig s21 the concentrations of leaching ce co and fe reduced with the increasing cycles the mass of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 was quantified by calcinating the ceco0 5fe0 5o3 precursors of the same mass with the same heat process of pti as calculated 5 wt fresh pti 8 42 g contains 420 mg ceco0 5fe0 5o3 in which ce fe and co were 239 7 mg 47 77 mg and 50 41 mg respectively we selected the maximum leaking concentrations of the fresh pti ce 0 03 mg l co 0 16 mg l fe 0 16 mg l to estimate the total leakage in 30 cycles hence the actual total leaching ce fe and co should be lower than 0 09 mg 0 48 mg and 0 48 mg which was only 0 4 10 and 9 5 of the fresh pti the tiny amount of metal leaching would not affect the performance of the pti anode so it still maintained 100 cbz removal after 30 reuses xrd pattern and ftir spectra were utilized to further estimate the stability of pti as displayed in fig 10b except for a slight decrease in peak intensity the xrd pattern showed no significant difference between the used and fresh pti anode ftir spectra revealed that the functional groups on the anode surface changed little before and after the reaction fig s22 the weak peak at 1384 cm 1 was related to the co 3 2 group bonding on the anode surface owing to exposure to the ambient atmosphere the outstanding reusability indicated the huge potential of pti anode in practical application however as the heterogeneous catalysts in sr aops perovskites usually exhibited poor durability and difficulty to recycle due to the negligible magnetism zhang et al prepared 23wt lacoo3 al2o3 to activate pms for degrading atrazine atz and the removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 74 after three cycles zhang et al 2019 similar result was discovered in the laco0 4cu0 6o3 activating pms system and the elimination of phenol reduced to 80 after using 4 times lu et al 2018 the poor recycle performance of heterogeneous catalysis was mainly attributed to the loss of powder catalysts during recovery and elution procedures compared to the heterogeneous perovskite catalysts the pti anode in this work could be reused at least 30 cycles with ultra high rate constants exceeding 0 4 min 1 the recyclability in the e pti pms system was markedly improved by fixing perovskite on ti4o7 substrate and then pressing them into electrodes 3 6 3 extensive applicability of the e pti pms system the versatility of the reaction system was also a crucial index in practical application the catalytic activity of pti anode was estimated at different cbz concentrations fig 11 a the e pti pms system exhibited nearly 100 cbz removal under the initial concentration of 1 20 mg l especially 1 mg l cbz could be rapidly degraded in 1 min with an ultra high rate constant k of 5 466 min 1 as the cbz concentration increasing to 20 mg l the k decreased to 0 174 min 1 the reduction might be attributed to that inadequate ros slowed down the oxidation rate of high concentration of cbz the highly efficient and stable removal of 1 20 mg l cbz further confirmed the outstanding performance of pti anode to investigate the applicability of e pti pms system for different micropollutants 0 05 mm we selected dyes oii rhb pharmaceuticals cbz tc smt sdz and phenols phenol 4 np 4 cp as representatives as shown in fig 11b the e pti pms system removed nearly 100 dyes pharmaceuticals phenol and 4 cp while exhibited a slightly low elimination to 4 np as 1o2 is the primary ros in the e pti pms system it tends to react with electron rich pollutants with electron donating groups edg ch3 oh nh2 and nr2 but exhibits lower reactivity with electron withdrawing groups ewg no2 wang et al 2022a zhao et al 2022b for further exploring the relationship between the removal efficiency and molecular structure of the pollutants we summarized the characteristics of selected pollutants in table s4 it can be seen that the dyes pharmaceuticals phenol and 4 cp possessed abundant edg of ch3 oh nh2 and nr2 which was likely related to the excellent catalytic activities as for the 4 np the ewg of no2 led to the incomplete removal 96 2 even with the edg of oh as a whole the e pti pms system preferred to the electron rich pollutants like dyes and pharmaceuticals in actual waters inorganic ions and natural organic matters noms possibly disturb the removal process of organic pollutants several typical coexisting substances c l no 3 so 4 2 po 4 3 and ha were selected to explore their effects on the e pti pms system in fig 11c so 4 2 c l and ha showed negligible effect on the cbz removal a minor inhibition 5 appeared in the presence of 10 mm no 3 or po 4 3 which could be ascribed to the competitive effect between ros and no 3 or po 4 3 wang and wang 2018 in general the e pti pms system was hardly interfered by the co existing substances in real waters to further evaluate the potential of the e pti pms system in real matrixes 1 mg l cbz was selected for experiments in lake water secondary wastewater effluent aquaculture wastewater and medical wastewater without adjusting the ph the quality parameters of water wastewater were provided in table s5 as shown in fig 11d 1 mg l cbz was rapidly removed within 5 min in all the real matrixes and the removal rate in aquaculture wastewater was faster than the others it can be observed that the concentration of c l 9535 mg l in the aquaculture wastewater is much higher than that in the other waters which might be related to the superior performance previous study has reported that high content of c l reacted with ros and produced reactive chlorine species rcs c l cl 2 cl2 and hocl accelerating the removal process of pollutants jing et al 2021b hence the e pti pms system has great potential in treating high salinity water due to the advantage of high c l and it showed promising application prospects in other actual matrixes as well 3 6 4 economic analysis energy consumption is another important consideration in practical water treatments the eec and eeo values were calculated and showed in table s6 the eec of e pti pms system was 5 kwh kg cbz only 0 034 times that of e ti4o7 pms system the energy consumption of common anode systems e dsa pms and e bdd pms were 130 and 78 kwh kg cbz much higher than that of e pti pms system besides the eeo value of e pti pms system was 0 025 kwh m3 log which was only 1 0 and 1 3 of e dsa pms 2 363 kwh m3 log and e bdd pms system 1 888 kwh m3 log respectively compared to the common dsa and bdd anodes pti exhibited a superiority with high efficiency and low cost moreover the performances of electro activation process of pms in literatures were compared in table 2 as reported in the literature the cbz was 100 removed within 40 min using an activated carbon fiber acf as the cathode to activate 50 mm pms under ph 3 at current density of 28 6 ma cm2 with the rate constant k of 0 081 min 1 liu et al 2019 in this work 100 cbz could be rapidly degraded within 10 min with a higher k 0 467 min 1 less pms 1 mm and lower current density 1 ma cm2 and the eeo value in this work was only 0 025 kwh m3 log which was only 1 3 that of the e acf pms process 1 89 kwh m3 log the e pti pms system presented excellent performance for tc degradation with the rate constant k of 0 212 min 1 superior to that 0 159 min 1 of ti4o7 cathode with 10 mm pms 10 mm nacl and 20 ma cm2 current density in the previous research li et al 2022a less reagent demand and lower applied current will reduce the energy consumption and save a lot of cost in practical application besides perovskite was firstly applied to enhance the efficiency of electro activation of pms to overcome the shortcomings of eaops and sr aops alone we elaborated the reaction mechanism especially the potentiation role of electric field and pms the 1o2 in this work was generated from the so 4 o 2 oh and v o at the pti anode which was different from h2o2 and o 2 ho 2 in the electro activation of pms process at the graphene oxide iron oxide nanoparticle doped ti4o7 go fe3o4 nps ti4o7 cathode li et al 2022c compared to the eaops the introduction of pms enhanced the oxidation capability expanded the ph adaptability and reduced the energy consumption electro enhanced activation of pms also solved the difficulty of recycling catalysts in homogeneous or heterogeneous sr aops in conclusion the e pti pms system presented an enormous potential in practical application including ultra efficient removal of cbz wide ph range excellent stability and reusability versatility for different pollutants excellent performance in actual matrixes less cost and ultra low energy consumption 4 conclusion in this work electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops and sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops were combined to overcome the disadvantages of using them alone perovskite ti4o7 composite pti anode was successfully fabricated and applied for electro enhanced activation of pms e pms the introduction of ceco0 5fe0 5o3 presented faster charge transfer and higher reaction activity achieving 100 cbz removal within 10 min in the e pti pms system nonradical 1o2 played a leading role for degrading cbz at ph 7 and the dominant ros was varying under different ph conditions the efficient cycling of coiii coii promoted by the feii feiii provided constant active site coii to continually react with pms and produce more ros the main degradation byproducts in the e pti pms system were detected and the possible pathways for cbz degradation have been proposed the wide ph adaptability outstanding reusability and extensive applicability for various contaminants and waters wastewaters indicated the huge potential of pti anode in practical application these results gained a promising insight towards high efficiency and deep degradation of cbz via

15044,the low efficiency of conventional complete denitrification as well as the unstable nitrite supply for partial denitrification coupled anammox pd a restrict the efficient removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewaters herein we proposed an optical strategy to bidirectionally regulate denitrification by introducing lights at different wavelengths and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated accordingly it turned out that yellow light at wavelength of 590 nm accelerated denitrification by 35 4 while blue light delayed denitrification with stable nitrite accumulation above 86 9 and high nitrate removal 99 8 microbial physiology and viability further supported the positive effects of yellow light on microbial activity additionally despite the sluggish denitrification aroused by blue light negligible cellular damage was observed antioxidant capability divergence microbial community shifting and metabolic flux redirection contributed to the wavelength dependent effects halomonas and pseudomonas were identified as high credit taxonomic biomarkers of yellow and blue light as revealed by metabolomics pantothenate and coa biosynthesis glutamate metabolism and alkaloid biosynthesis presented high impact values co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics based on microbial topology further distinguished pivotal metabolic pathways and genes oxidative phosphorylation contributed to the divergent denitrification performance through electron transfer chains whereas glutamate and glutathione metabolism contributed to oxidative stress alleviation and mediated the metabolic flux between peroxisome and nitrogen metabolism this study shed a light on the application of optical strategy to regulate denitrification performance and achieve either complete denitrification or pd a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification nitrite accumulation light wavelength metagenomics metabolomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive nitrogen containing wastewaters are generated from different industries such as stainless steels fertilizers metal processing semiconductors oil and gas production fernández nava et al 2008 bio denitrification is widely implemented for nitrogen removal for its high efficiency and low energy consumption however these industrial wastewaters were usually featured with extreme high nitrate concentrations high salinity and toxicity which cause great inhibition on the denitrifying microbes gao et al 2021a moreover extensive organic carbon is required to achieve nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas n2 especially for the high concentrations of nitrate wastewater luo et al 2022 this makes it costly energy intensive and high carbon footprint therefore the development of innovative technologies is of great importance for the treatment of wastewaters with high concentrations of nitrate compared to conventional nitrification denitrification process anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox aroused extensive attention anammox bacteria anaob performed short cut nitrogen removal through oxidizing ammonia to n2 with nitrite as electron acceptor hence it is featured with less oxygen and organic requirement as well as lower sludge production and greenhouse gas emission kartal et al 2010 li et al 2018a however the stable supply of nitrite is one of the greatest challenges and this restricts the large scale application of anammox process without sufficient and stable nitrite anammox can hardly work despite nitrite is an essential substrate for anammox high concentrations of nitrite exerts inhibitory effects on microbial community you et al 2020 partial denitrification pd is the first stage of complete denitrification terminating nitrate reduction to nitrite it is widely regarded as an effective strategy to provide substrate for anammox for stable and efficient nitrite accumulation du et al 2019 in this regard partial denitrification coupled anammox pd a process provides a new opportunity to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and organic substances removal with much less energy consumption and lower sludge production you et al 2020 it has been proved that pd a has feasibility and potential in nitrogen removal of mainstream and side stream wastewater treatment du et al 2019 nonetheless application of pd a in industrial wastewater is still at early stage though gradient increase of salinity realized enrichment of pd community with 75 nitrite accumulation li et al 2018b a highly stable pd process requires strict controlling on c n and ph zhang et al 2020 the unstable microbial community composition and nitrite accumulation restricted its application therefore it is imperative to develop a universal and cost effective regulatory strategy of denitrification to regulate bio denitrification for tunable nitrite supply some physio chemical methods have been proposed such as functional material addition bian et al 2022 dou et al 2022 ph adjustment qian et al 2019 carbon sources optimization shi et al 2019 magnetic field coupling ahmad et al 2021 and electrochemistry kondaveeti et al 2014 these efforts enhanced the controllability of denitrification performance but their scale up application is restricted by high cost energy intensive and secondary pollution jadhav et al 2022 ruiz beviá and fernández torres 2019 comparatively light driven technology such as solar energy and photocatalysis is cost effective and sustainable being widely regarded as a promising method for social and production activity kannan and vakeesan 2016 mekhilef et al 2011 biological light utilization is ubiquitous and it has also been employed to regulate microbial nitrogen metabolism lu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however light inhibition is prevalent for most microorganism and the cellular oxidative stress aroused by photochemical reactions exhibit deactivation effects on microbes giannakis et al 2015 which restrained the construction of effective light facilitated photic biosystem bian et al 2022 wang et al 2021 therefore it is of great significance to alleviate inhibitory effects of light towards microbes via sustainable and environmental friendly strategy considering the counter interaction between light and microbes there were some studies made exploration on the underlying mechanism between light and nitrogen metabolism on the community level some phototrophic bacteria and functional microorganism were tolerant to irradiation and could outcompete denitrifier for nutrients thus hindered denitrification process gao et al 2021a on the genome level natural illumination could inhibit the expression of nirs gene xiao et al 2021 a molecular marker that encoded cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase additionally photosynthesis and other metabolism pathways competed with denitrification system for electron exerting a backpressure on denitrification respiratory chain causing sluggish denitrifying activity kirchhoff et al 2018 recently the development of next generation sequencing has updated our understanding on photic bio process for instance light emitting diode led of different wavelength could serve as signals to regulate microbial activity based on optogenetics wei and jin 2022 however few study has focused on the wavelength dependent effects on bio denitrification moreover the poor elucidated optogenetic mechanism limited the further development and application of optical strategy in this work we proposed an optical strategy to achieve bidirectional regulation of denitrification microbiota and aimed to 1 comprehensively evaluate the system performance under different wavelength illumination including nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism and biomass synthesis 2 investigate the microbial physiology and antioxidant capability variation under different lights 3 reveal the microbial community composition and wavelength dependent shifting and identify high credit photo responsive taxonomy of certain wavelength 4 identify the crucial metabolism pathways and genes for nitrate removal based on topological co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics our study opened up a brand new photo biochemical strategy for flexible bio denitrification regulation and advanced the regulation of denitrification process via environmental friendly physical method additionally this study provided insights into microbial community and metabolism in response to light and raised intriguing questions for further studies 2 material and methods 2 1 photo denitrification experiment photo denitrification was conducted in 40 ml quartz serum bottles covered with a customed made lid to deprive the light outside the denitrification microbiota were reactivated with nitrate acetate trace elements table s2 and basic culture medium table s3 in a flask for 1 day the activation condition maintained at 30 c 200 rpm in an incubator activated denitrification microbiota was used as inoculum in basic culture medium with nitrate and acetate and stirred well at 200 rpm ar aeration before illumination ensured relative anaerobic condition model denitrifier paraccocus denitrificans atcc 19367 was used in pure strain control experiment it was purchased from guangdong microbial culture collection center gdmcc in china and rejuvenated in liquid luria bertani lb broth in air bath shaker at 170 rpm 30 c and then stored at 4 c the activation and inoculation of p deinitrificans for photo denitrification is the same as acclimated microbiota xe lamp was used to simulate solar light the light intensity was adjusted to similar level with led light 2 0 0 5 mw cm 2 detailed information on light characterization and illumination setting are provided in supporting information 2 2 characterization of cellular morphology and physiology cfda and pi were employed as stains to indicate the esterase activity and membrane damage of microbes by confocal laser scanning microscopy zeiss lsm880 to determine the live and dead cell the clsm data were proceed by zen 3 1 blue edition to derive the statistical parameters to deduce fluorescence pattern which represents the statistical similarity of the distribution of live and dead cells the meanings of statistical parameters are as follows mean sum and maximum represent the average total and the highest value of fluorescence intensity of clsm image respectively variance and standard deviation depicted the fluctuation of intensity value kurtosis and skewness measured the tailedness and asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real valued random variable in our case the fluorescence intensity microbial viability was assessed by microbial viability assay kit wst dojindo tsukatani et al 2008 briefly wst solution and electron mediator reagent dmso were mixed together to form coloring regent cell suspensions was taken by syringe from batch bottle cell suspension and coloring regent were added to 96 well microplate and incubated in microplate reader under 37 c and measured the absorbance at 450 nm continuously for 30 min the kinetic constant of electron transfer quantified by coloring absorbance variance was calculated by origin 2021 2 3 dna extraction library construction and sequencing after photo denitrification triplicate cell samples 15 samples in total were used for dna and metabolite extraction the genomics dna was extracted utilizing nucleospin soil kit macherey nagel german as instructed dna was quantified with a qubit fluorometer with qubit dsdna br assay kit invitrogen usa and the quality was checked by running aliquot on 1 agarose genomic dna was randomly fragmented and dna fragments with average size of 200 400 bp were selected for end repair and a tailing adapter ligation and pcr amplification the products were purified with magnetic beads after quality control of the obtained library qualified libraries were sequenced on dnbseq platform bgi shenzhen china with an average of 10 gb per sample 2 4 metabolites extraction quality control and uhplc ms ms analysis methanol water 4 1 v v was used to extract metabolites the mixture was settled down and treated by high throughput tissue crusher wonbio 96c shanghai wanbo biotechnology co ltd at 50 hz vortexed well and ultrasound at 40 khz for half an hour the samples were placed at 20 c for 30 min to precipitate proteins after centrifugation at 13 000 g at 4 c for 15 min supernatants were used for lc ms ms analysis the equal volumes of all samples were mixed as quality control qc sample which was treated the same as other samples metabolites was separated by thermo uhplc system equipped with an acquity beh c18 column waters milford usa positive and negative ion mode was performed respectively on a mass spectrometry thermo uhplc q exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization esi the detail parameters of chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry can be found in supporting information 2 5 differential taxonomy metabolites and pathways analysis linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 was used to distinguish taxonomy biomarkers of different light from high dimension matrix with all against all comparison mode p value of 0 05 was set as biomarker threshold metabolites with vip value 1 and p value 0 05 were selected as significant differential metabolites and mapped to the metabolism pathways through enrichment and pathways analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database we evaluated the importance of differential metabolites towards metabolic pathways via metaboanalyst pang et al 2021 quantifying the by a comprehensive indicator impact value of metabolites through its relative location on metabolic pathways enrichment ratio was quantified by ratio in study to ratio in population 2 6 pathway interaction network construction and topological analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to generate correlation matrix of metabolic pathways which was derived from kegg ontology ko and quantified by rpkm based on that an undirected interaction network was constructed in gephi 0 9 7 network overview was evaluated by degree and weighted degree community detection was carried out with build in algorithm and initialized the parameters with randomize on use edge weights on and resolution 1 0 nodes overview was performed according to undirected graph characterized by clustering coefficient and eigenvector centrality 100 iteration edge overview was ganged by graph distance connected nodes were assigned graph distance 1 betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were employed for clustering analysis 2 7 analysis cell suspension were filtered by 0 45 μm micropore filter for nitrate nitrite and acetate concentration assessment through iron chromatography thermo fisher scientific integrion ics 5000 all uv vis spectra and absorbance were obtained through microplate reader thermo fisher scientific tencan spark biomass concentration was estimated by od600 to assay enzymatic activity cells were collected after photo denitrification and washed with pbs buffer 0 01 m ph 7 4 the resuspended bacteria was crushed with ultrasonic cell crusher biosafer 650e in ice bath 260 w 4 min 3 s interval and centrifuge at 12 000 g for 5 min to obtain crude extracts cat assay kit nanjing jiancheng bio ins and sod assay kit wst dojindo were used to evaluate relative antioxidant capability with dark as control group hydrogen peroxide was measured by colorimetric method based on titanium sulfate as described in standard rohwer 1963 the detail bioinformatics analysis of metagenomics and metabolomics was provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of bidirectional optical regulated denitrification the microbiota were collected from a pilot scale sequence batch reactor fig s1 which have been acclimated for several months the detailed acclimation process is available at supporting information photo denitrification experiments were conducted with acclimated microbiota under the irradiation of wavelength divergent lights fig s2 and the wavelength dependent effects on denitrifiers during photo denitrification were illustrated in fig 1 yellow and blue groups exhibited the most significant effects among visible lights the illumination of yellow light accelerated denitrification significantly with the kinetic constant of nitrate reduction 35 4 higher than dark scenario fig s3 however blue light showed inhibitory effects on denitrification and the kinetic constant of nitrate reduction was decreased by 33 6 as compared to the dark notably nitrite reduction to n2 was also inhibited and maintained a stable accumulative nitrite concentration 247 0 mg no2 n l 1 even at 60 h along with almost complete nitrate removed 99 8 this suggested dynamic balance of nitrite concentration under blue light compared to other groups blue light also induced higher peak nitrite accumulation ratio 86 9 but relative lower nitrite concentration 276 2 mg no2 n l 1 at 18 5 h which was more favorable for attenuating the nitrite inhibition on microbiota you et al 2020 green and red light had little effects on denitrification uv irradiation possesses higher frequency and is usually employed to eliminate bacteria and thus negligible denitrification activity was observed due to microbial deactivation giannakis et al 2015 similar illumination effects also arose on biomass synthesis and acetate utilization fig 1c d yellow light boosted acetate utilization and biomass synthesis while blue light delayed both processes it was noteworthy that biomass synthesis was not active during the early stage of denitrification 0 21 h nitrate reduction was carried out in this stage then most of biomass was accumulated at nitrite reduction stage 21 38 h except blue and uv light other groups achieved similar cell density at the end of photo denitrification demonstrating that both blue and uv light engendered growth arrest interestingly despite the ceased growth microbes under blue light irradiation kept taking on acetate implying that divergent metabolism was triggered by blue light this explained for the inhibited metabolism in bio hybrid nitrogen removal system bian et al 2022 wavelength based optical strategy potentially can be employed to conquer this issue for instance leds with different wavelength were used to produce biomass and pigments through wastewater zhou et al 2015 control the dissolved oxygen do concentrations kang et al 2018 and develop biological sensor to regulate microbial metabolism emiliani et al 2022a 3 2 microbial physiology characteristics and antioxidation performance to figure out the effects of light wavelength on the physiological status of denitrifiers we investigated the physiological properties of microbial community confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was utilized to reveal the cellular damage level fig 2 as expected uv light damaged most of cells 88 1 suggesting the cellular deactivation effect of uv irradiation whereas yellow light contributed to the highest cellular viability 92 7 consistent with the results of nitrogen reduction and carbon utilization in fig 1 surprisingly although blue light inhibited biomass synthesis no significant cellar damage was observed fig 2a instead blue light group exhibited comparable live dead cells ratio with dark red and green light fig 2b cluster analysis of fluorescence pattern based on live and dead cells quantified the light induced live and dead statistics and spatial distribution fig 2c d it turned out that blue and uv light exhibited comparable patterns on live cells indicating similar data distribution of blue and uv lights on live cells instead of quantity yellow light was striking in enhancing transmembrane activity stained by green suggesting activated cellular metabolism fig 2c as for pi fluorescence pattern fig 2d i e cell damage effects yellow and blue light were clustered together presenting the longest distance to uv light which further demonstrated the intriguing denitrification regulatory mechanism of blue light the discrepant morphology can also be observed in digital photographs fig s4 as uv group bacteria suspension turned to slight yellow while other groups maintained milky white bacteria suspension including bacteria irradiated by blue light this further confirmed that blue light realized nitrite accumulation without significant cellular damage instead it inhibited the reaction of nitrite reduction and caused metabolic dysfunction dai et al 2012 previous studies showed that yellow light led to photo activation of the cell whereas blue and green light presented mild photoreactivation but partially damaged the cells giannakis et al 2015 which were well consistent with our results combined with the photo denitrification experiments results it can be deduced that blue light inhibited denitrification and acetate utilization through metabolism regulation instead of deactivation to figure out the mechanism of photo activation and inhibition on cellular metabolism we investigated the microbial viability and enzymatic activity based on the existing forms of nitrogen the total reaction process was divided into denitrification stage and nitrogen depletion stage the microbial viability quantified by the redox state cycling rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp was measured to investigate the cellular physiological status along with the nitrogen removal process fig 3 a 3b yellow light aroused the highest viability at both denitrification stage and nitrogen depletion stage whereas microbial community irradiated by blue and uv light exhibited lower viability moreover the microbial viability under dark green and red light increased during nitrogen depletion stage compared to denitrification stage which is due to the alleviated inhibitory effects of nitrate you et al 2020 the enzymatic activity of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase is critical for denitrification the relative activity of nitrate reductase was consistent with denitrification performance fig 1 indicating that low activity or expression of nitrite reductase attributed to nitrite accumulation interestingly after being illuminated by blue light nitrate reductase still showed significantly p 0 01 high relative activity the slightly delayed denitrification of blue light was due to biomass synthesis fig 1d these results indicated that blue light selectively affected the enzymatic activity rather than deactivation illumination usually results in cellular oxidative pressure due to photo biochemical reaction giannakis et al 2015 and the antioxidant system was essential in adapting oxidative environment tsang et al 2014 therefore the enzymatic activity of antioxidant system might also contribute to the wavelength differential metabolism and it is intriguing to explore the microbial antioxidant capability through enzymatic activity of representative enzymes superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat could catalyze the decomposition of oxidative superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide respectively eqs 1 and 2 with regard to sod fig 3c the blue light group stood out with remarkably high relative activity 86 2 higher than dark the enhanced sod activity has also been reported in other microbes such as coral tissue and symbiotic algae as an adaptation strategy to blue light the dominant light wavelength of oligotrophic waters levy et al 2006 the enhanced sod activity usually predicted high level of intracellular produced o2 storz and imlay 1999 which likely intervene the bio denitrification process lundberg et al 2008 despite enhanced sod activity would produce more h2o2 cat was not significantly activated fig 3d in addition there was no considerable extracellular h2o2 generation for all groups less than 0 005 this indicated that other metabolic pathways might contribute to the decomposition and consumption of h2o2 in the blue group to relieve oxidative stress apel and hirt 2004a it was worth noting that functional genes that harbored high photo sensing ability in response to blue light such as photosynthetic and optogenetic genes were reported to play a role in divergent metabolism emiliani et al 2022b wei and jin 2022 uv irradiation caused deactivation of both sod and cat indicating loss of antioxidant capability most of lights inhibited the relative cat activity compared to dark except yellow light suggesting the intact antioxidant function contribute to the high activity under yellow light 1 o 2 sod o 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 cat o 2 h 2 o 3 3 microbial community shifting to investigate the collective microbial photo response a model denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans p denitrificans was employed as raw denitrifying microbe to compare with the acclimated microbiota light inhibition is ubiquitous for microorganisms and the inhibition effects were observed for p denitrificans as well the denitrification performance fig s5a and biomass synthesis fig s5b of p denitrificans were significantly hindered in contrast compared to p denitrificans the microbiota presented higher illumination resilience 25 8 higher kinetic constant fig s6a and nitrite accumulation efficiency 87 3 times fig s6b without significant difference in cell density fig s6c suggesting the excellent robustness and partial denitrification performance of acclimated microbiota the comparable biomass increments implied that instead of cells reproduction there might be other microbial strategy that contributed to the capability of nitrite accumulation and light resilience of denitrification microbiota this inspired us to identify the functional bacteria and genes and decipher the microbial community interaction among microbiota microbial community especially functional bacteria is of great importance on the performance of optical regulated biosystem xiao et al 2021 metagenomics sequencing was conducted to obtain taxonomic information after quality control reads assembly genes prediction and non redundant gene catalog construction non redundant genes were annotated to non redundant protein sequence database nr database and revealed the microbial community composition fig 4 a among the total 1874 genus pseudomonas 41 1 halomonas 21 8 aequorivita 5 1 marinobacter 3 6 aliidiomarina 1 8 and acetoanaerobium 1 2 dominated across all samples most of them were commonly seen in wastewater treatment and identified as functional genera in partial denitrification microbiota li et al 2018b principal coordinate analysis pcoa revealed significant clustering occurred among different groups as illustrated in fig 4b blue light induced the longest distance to dark indicating that blue light possessed the most obvious selection effects on microbiota yellow light was located in the opposite quadrant with blue light corresponding to the bi directional effects on denitrification performance in fig 1 green and red light was close to and had overlap with dark group suggesting slight microbial community shifting among these groups to further reveal the underlying connection between light resilience and microbial taxonomic phylogenetic variation profile was obtained by lefse segata et al 2011 to identify taxonomic biomarkers i e taxonomies that tend to get enriched by certain wavelength of lights fig 4c green yellow and red lights possess relatively higher number of biomarkers while only few taxonomies were enriched under blue light and dark condition evident clustering of biomarkers under different light was observed it turned out that blue light exhibited high selectivity on genus pseudomonas and the green light biomarkers were scattered across all phylum this suggested blue possessed high selection pressure on microbial community while green light had minor effects consistent with the wavelength dependent effects in fig 1 the taxonomies enriched by yellow light illumination belonged to phylum proteobacteria and firmicutes all the taxonomic biomarkers of red light were subjected to phylum bacteroidetes these phyla have been reported to play a key role in high concentrate nitrate wastewater treatment luo et al 2022 notably yellow and blue light exhibited highly efficient and selective screening on genus halomonas and pseudomonas fig s7 indicating that halomonas and pseudomonas were high credit photo responsive bacteria towards yellow and blue light respectively halomonas was able to use photoelectrons with different energy for nitrate reduction liu et al 2020 and the photon of yellow light might be preferred for it to utilize for enhanced denitrification pseudomonas is a well studied model genus and multiple approaches have been put forward to regulate its denitrification including photo sensing quorum sensing and bioengineering based on those properties barak yoram et al 1998 mukherjee et al 2019 these results well explain the enhanced denitrification performance in the yellow light group and superior nitrite accumulation efficiency in the blue light group 3 4 metabolomics profiles in response to illumination although metagenomics can reveal microbial compositions and gene abundances genes with the highest abundance may not necessarily be the greatest contributor to the community function i e not necessarily highly expressed therefore we conducted non target metabolomics to figure out gene expression on the metabolism level given the remarkable divergence of microbial activity under blue and yellow light further investigation on metabolism profiles was performed on them with dark group as control partial least squares discriminate analysis pls da distinguished the clustering of each group fig s8 which inferred the wavelength dependent metabolism variation notably blue light triggered the longest distance with other groups suggesting the distinct metabolic flux redirection several metabolites stood out fig s9 as their prominent expression profiles in response to blue and yellow light the highly expressed metabolites illuminated by both blue and yellow light mainly belong to amino acids and peptides which account for the active microbial activities and cell synthesis in response to environmental stress gao et al 2021b other functional metabolites were also up regulated and their detailed descriptions were illustrated in supporting information interestingly biosynthesis of gaba γ aminobutyric acid through glutamate was induced by blue light which potentially played a role in antioxidation won et al 2015 and maintaining carbon and nitrogen balance and energy supply bown and shelp 1997 additionally gaba and glutamate could signal cellular aging in response to blue light yang et al 2022 and participate in quorum sensing khan et al 2018 corresponding with the functions of dominant genus psudomonas mentioned in fig 4 in industrial wastewater treatment exogenous gaba could facilitate nutrients removal from molasses wastewater qiao et al 2022 differentially abundant metabolites distribution further disclosed the optogenetic metabolism discrepancy including potential biological active substances that can play a critical role even with trace amount among 712 metabolites across all samples 269 were differentially expressed compared to dark 245 for blue light and 53 for yellow light fig s10 corresponding to the distinguished denitrification and physiological changes mentioned above figs 1 and 2 expression profile and variable importance in the projection vip of most differentially abundant metabolites depicted the potential metabolic biomarker fig s11 it turned out that microbiota adapted to blue and yellow light through regulating expression of antibacterial metabolites murugan et al 2020 including alkaloid and terpenoid blue light induced higher expression of antibacterial metabolites corresponding to the inhibited viability fig 3a b whereas the decreased expression of terpenoid of yellow light groups might attribute to higher activity the active fatty acid synthesis and transmembrane activity of yellow light well supported the activated metabolism sethi and vidal puig 2007 the highly abundant and differentially expressed metabolites profiles suggested that illumination engendered wavelength dependent metabolic flux redirection to figure out the pathways that metabolic fluxes were redirected to differential metabolites were annotated to kegg database pantothenate and coa biosynthesis lysine degradation arginine biosynthesis and carbapenem biosynthesis were significantly enriched by blue light fig 5 a generally microbiota was dominated by bacteria tian and wang 2021 but pathways enriched by yellow light were not highly relevant with bacterial metabolism fig s12 which ascribed to the divergent location of different pathways in metabolic network and their impacts varied therefore pathway topological analysis was conducted pantothenate and coa biosynthesis lysine degradation and arginine biosynthesis got high credits on both enrichment values and impact values pantothenate and coa biosynthesis involves in the metabolism of vitamins and coenzymes that played a role in central metabolism especially coenzyme a which is essential for citric acid cycle tca cycle alberts et al 2002 interestingly glutamate metabolism exhibited high impact under both blue and yellow light implying its critical role in light induced metabolism corresponding to gaba and glutamate metabolism mentioned in fig s9 alkaloid biosynthesis presented high impact value agreeing with the differentially expressed alkaloid e g arborine in response to light to regulate metabolic flux fig s11 some alkaloid presents biological toxicity and was the main component of some industrial wastewater and the photo induced biological alkaloid metabolism changes provided new insights into the treatment of the industrial wastewater wick et al 2011 3 5 comparative metabolomics and metagenomics for pathway reconstruction metabolomics unvalied the potential functional pathways however it is hard to elucidate the correlation of metabolism pathways and identify the functional genes which could be compensated by metagenomics analysis hence we innovatively constructed an interaction network based on metagenomic abundance of kegg ontology fig s13 furthermore the statistical topological patterns were quantified to elucidate the metabolism redirection through correlation analysis and identify the critical metabolic pathways and genes fig s14 data s2 there were 327 nodes that represented metabolism pathways and 16301 edges among them that linked correlated pathways fig s13 edge weights were used to denote how closely pathways were connected data s2 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 and peroxisome ko04146 pathways sod and cat subjected to were on the central network and connected with a great number of pathways suggesting their central roles in metabolism however their comprehensive topological statistical indicators fig s14 demonstrated that their connections were loose i e low correlation weights data s2 which implied that there might be other pathways mediated the metabolism flux between nitrogen metabolism and peroxisome ruiz et al 2017 clustering based on topological patterns disclosed the divergent global and local impacts of metabolic pathways fig s14 it turned out that alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism ko00250 and lysine degradation ko00310 potentially served as mediating pathways that played a role in alleviating light inhibition and nitrite reduction as mentioned in fig 3 antioxidant capability contributed to wavelength divergent denitrification but the mechanism of h2o2 pressure alleviation remained unclear to identify the relevant functional genes we compared the correlation weights of paired pathways data s2 crucial pathways relevant to light oxidative stress and metabolomics were highlighted for genes abundance analysis fig s16 fig s22 the highly abundant genes were compared fig 6 to reconstruct metabolic pathways and elucidate the underlying optogenetic mechanism surprisingly there was ignorable divergence on gene abundance under different illumination conditions suggesting that the genomic change was not the major reason for light induced metabolism variance it also demonstrated that metagenomics only represented the existence of genes but performed poorly in reflecting metabolic behavior notably genes encoding glutathione s transferase gst evidently took on higher abundance than other genes fig 6 it played a pivotal role in reactive oxygen species metabolism fig s20 pathways relevant to the antioxidant capability fig 3c 3d gst can be induced by h2o2 wagner et al 2002 and alleviate the oxidative stress through catalyzing the nucleophilic reaction of glutathione with electrophilic nitrogen atoms hayes et al 2005 josephy 2010 in addition glutathione was an important compound in glutathione peroxidase cycle an important enzymatic reactive oxygen species ros scavenging mode mediated by glutathione reductase gsr and glutathione peroxidase gpx apel and hirt 2004b among nitrogen metabolism fig s17 genes encoding glutamate synthetase glul exhibited strikingly high abundance and directed the metabolic flux to glutamate metabolism the high gene abundance related to glutathione and glutamate metabolism was consistent with the metabolomics results of enriched metabolites and high impact value fig 5 oxidative phosphorylation a vital pathway that involved in atp generation and electron transport through nadh nad nath and villadsen 2015 also exhibited high abundance fig 6 corresponding to the disparate viability fig 3a b several modules and enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation stood out with high relative abundance fig s16 nadh quinone oxidoreductase m00144 complex i dominated and was significantly enriched by yellow light compared to both blue and dark groups fig s15 it can drive the electron transfer from nadh to nox reductase in denitrification respiratory chain and complex iv in oxygen respiratory chain chen and strous 2013a thus resulting in enhanced denitrification and overall viability cytochrome c oxidase m00155 complex iv also presented remarkable high relative abundance and was enriched by blue light in the hybrid electron transfer chains of denitrification and oxygen respiration complex iv competes with nox reductase for electrons the proton motive force induced by light contributes to the inhibition of denitrification chen and strous 2013b kirchhoff et al 2018 therefore the enriched complex iv under blue light inhibited the electron flows to nox reductase contributing to the sluggish denitrification most enzymes in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis presented a considerable abundance fig s21 consistent with the high impact value mentioned above notably a quorum sensing enzyme the transporter of gaba from k01995 to k01999 was remarkably abundant fig s20 given the fact that quorum sensing can be used to deliver the signals stimulated by light berg et al 2015 it is suggestive a population signal role that gaba played in light induced microbial shifting and cellular metabolism explaining for the metabolomic profile under different illumination conditions fig s9 combining metagenomics with metabolomics profiles a metabolic optogenetics model for bio denitrification was proposed fig 7 as light with different wavelengths i e photons with divergent energy stimulated the oxidative phosphorylation the electron flows along the respiratory chain varied more specifically yellow light enriched complex i to drive electron transfer along respiratory chain for energy supply and cellular anabolism while blue light aroused higher abundance of cytochrome c oxidase the terminal oxidase in aerobic respiration competing electrons with denitrification respiratory chain thus inhibited denitrification chen and strous 2013a during oxidative phosphorylation complexes pump protons to balance electron flow which triggered the production of ros finkel and holbrook 2000 to relieve the oxidative stress caused by ros antioxidant systems were activated including sod cat as well as glutathione peroxidase cycle between glutathione and glutathione disulfide apel and hirt 2004b h2o2 stimulated gst to drive glutathione peroxidase cycle to alleviate oxidative stress caused by h2o2 wagner et al 2002 which was even more essential given the high gene abundance and corresponding metabolites moreover the substrate of gst r s glutathione is originated from l glutamate and ammonia mediated by glul thus glutamate and glutathione metabolism bridged the light induced oxidative stress alleviation and nitrogen metabolism 4 conclusions this study proposed an optical strategy for controllable denitrification and demonstrated the underlying mechanism typically blue light triggered sluggish denitrification and maintained a relatively stable nitrite accumulation without obvious cellular damage yellow light accelerated denitrification greatly as well as carbon metabolism and biomass synthesis metagenomics results revealed the wavelength dependent taxonomic shifting metabolomics distinguished differentially expressed metabolites and pathways e g pantothenate and coa biosynthesis glutamate metabolism alkaloid biosynthesis co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics based on metabolic network topology identified the crucial pathways and genes for metabolism network reconstruction it turned out that electron transfer chains along the oxidative phosphorylation contributed to the wavelength dependent denitrification performances and complex i and cytochrome c oxidase were the determinative enzymes the remarkably high abundance of gst implied its role in relieving oxidative stress caused by h2o2 glutamate and glutathione metabolism played a vital role in mediating antioxidant capability and nitrogen metabolism overall our work opened up an optical strategy to realize tunable nitrite supply for anammox as well as elucidated the underlying mechanism of the double edged role of illumination in the future more efforts are needed to elaborate the interactions

15044,the low efficiency of conventional complete denitrification as well as the unstable nitrite supply for partial denitrification coupled anammox pd a restrict the efficient removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewaters herein we proposed an optical strategy to bidirectionally regulate denitrification by introducing lights at different wavelengths and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated accordingly it turned out that yellow light at wavelength of 590 nm accelerated denitrification by 35 4 while blue light delayed denitrification with stable nitrite accumulation above 86 9 and high nitrate removal 99 8 microbial physiology and viability further supported the positive effects of yellow light on microbial activity additionally despite the sluggish denitrification aroused by blue light negligible cellular damage was observed antioxidant capability divergence microbial community shifting and metabolic flux redirection contributed to the wavelength dependent effects halomonas and pseudomonas were identified as high credit taxonomic biomarkers of yellow and blue light as revealed by metabolomics pantothenate and coa biosynthesis glutamate metabolism and alkaloid biosynthesis presented high impact values co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics based on microbial topology further distinguished pivotal metabolic pathways and genes oxidative phosphorylation contributed to the divergent denitrification performance through electron transfer chains whereas glutamate and glutathione metabolism contributed to oxidative stress alleviation and mediated the metabolic flux between peroxisome and nitrogen metabolism this study shed a light on the application of optical strategy to regulate denitrification performance and achieve either complete denitrification or pd a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification nitrite accumulation light wavelength metagenomics metabolomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive nitrogen containing wastewaters are generated from different industries such as stainless steels fertilizers metal processing semiconductors oil and gas production fernández nava et al 2008 bio denitrification is widely implemented for nitrogen removal for its high efficiency and low energy consumption however these industrial wastewaters were usually featured with extreme high nitrate concentrations high salinity and toxicity which cause great inhibition on the denitrifying microbes gao et al 2021a moreover extensive organic carbon is required to achieve nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas n2 especially for the high concentrations of nitrate wastewater luo et al 2022 this makes it costly energy intensive and high carbon footprint therefore the development of innovative technologies is of great importance for the treatment of wastewaters with high concentrations of nitrate compared to conventional nitrification denitrification process anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox aroused extensive attention anammox bacteria anaob performed short cut nitrogen removal through oxidizing ammonia to n2 with nitrite as electron acceptor hence it is featured with less oxygen and organic requirement as well as lower sludge production and greenhouse gas emission kartal et al 2010 li et al 2018a however the stable supply of nitrite is one of the greatest challenges and this restricts the large scale application of anammox process without sufficient and stable nitrite anammox can hardly work despite nitrite is an essential substrate for anammox high concentrations of nitrite exerts inhibitory effects on microbial community you et al 2020 partial denitrification pd is the first stage of complete denitrification terminating nitrate reduction to nitrite it is widely regarded as an effective strategy to provide substrate for anammox for stable and efficient nitrite accumulation du et al 2019 in this regard partial denitrification coupled anammox pd a process provides a new opportunity to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and organic substances removal with much less energy consumption and lower sludge production you et al 2020 it has been proved that pd a has feasibility and potential in nitrogen removal of mainstream and side stream wastewater treatment du et al 2019 nonetheless application of pd a in industrial wastewater is still at early stage though gradient increase of salinity realized enrichment of pd community with 75 nitrite accumulation li et al 2018b a highly stable pd process requires strict controlling on c n and ph zhang et al 2020 the unstable microbial community composition and nitrite accumulation restricted its application therefore it is imperative to develop a universal and cost effective regulatory strategy of denitrification to regulate bio denitrification for tunable nitrite supply some physio chemical methods have been proposed such as functional material addition bian et al 2022 dou et al 2022 ph adjustment qian et al 2019 carbon sources optimization shi et al 2019 magnetic field coupling ahmad et al 2021 and electrochemistry kondaveeti et al 2014 these efforts enhanced the controllability of denitrification performance but their scale up application is restricted by high cost energy intensive and secondary pollution jadhav et al 2022 ruiz beviá and fernández torres 2019 comparatively light driven technology such as solar energy and photocatalysis is cost effective and sustainable being widely regarded as a promising method for social and production activity kannan and vakeesan 2016 mekhilef et al 2011 biological light utilization is ubiquitous and it has also been employed to regulate microbial nitrogen metabolism lu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however light inhibition is prevalent for most microorganism and the cellular oxidative stress aroused by photochemical reactions exhibit deactivation effects on microbes giannakis et al 2015 which restrained the construction of effective light facilitated photic biosystem bian et al 2022 wang et al 2021 therefore it is of great significance to alleviate inhibitory effects of light towards microbes via sustainable and environmental friendly strategy considering the counter interaction between light and microbes there were some studies made exploration on the underlying mechanism between light and nitrogen metabolism on the community level some phototrophic bacteria and functional microorganism were tolerant to irradiation and could outcompete denitrifier for nutrients thus hindered denitrification process gao et al 2021a on the genome level natural illumination could inhibit the expression of nirs gene xiao et al 2021 a molecular marker that encoded cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase additionally photosynthesis and other metabolism pathways competed with denitrification system for electron exerting a backpressure on denitrification respiratory chain causing sluggish denitrifying activity kirchhoff et al 2018 recently the development of next generation sequencing has updated our understanding on photic bio process for instance light emitting diode led of different wavelength could serve as signals to regulate microbial activity based on optogenetics wei and jin 2022 however few study has focused on the wavelength dependent effects on bio denitrification moreover the poor elucidated optogenetic mechanism limited the further development and application of optical strategy in this work we proposed an optical strategy to achieve bidirectional regulation of denitrification microbiota and aimed to 1 comprehensively evaluate the system performance under different wavelength illumination including nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism and biomass synthesis 2 investigate the microbial physiology and antioxidant capability variation under different lights 3 reveal the microbial community composition and wavelength dependent shifting and identify high credit photo responsive taxonomy of certain wavelength 4 identify the crucial metabolism pathways and genes for nitrate removal based on topological co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics our study opened up a brand new photo biochemical strategy for flexible bio denitrification regulation and advanced the regulation of denitrification process via environmental friendly physical method additionally this study provided insights into microbial community and metabolism in response to light and raised intriguing questions for further studies 2 material and methods 2 1 photo denitrification experiment photo denitrification was conducted in 40 ml quartz serum bottles covered with a customed made lid to deprive the light outside the denitrification microbiota were reactivated with nitrate acetate trace elements table s2 and basic culture medium table s3 in a flask for 1 day the activation condition maintained at 30 c 200 rpm in an incubator activated denitrification microbiota was used as inoculum in basic culture medium with nitrate and acetate and stirred well at 200 rpm ar aeration before illumination ensured relative anaerobic condition model

luria bertani lb broth in air bath shaker at 170 rpm 30 c and then stored at 4 c the activation and inoculation of p deinitrificans for photo denitrification is the same as acclimated microbiota xe lamp was used to simulate solar light the light intensity was adjusted to similar level with led light 2 0 0 5 mw cm 2 detailed information on light characterization and illumination setting are provided in supporting information 2 2 characterization of cellular morphology and physiology cfda and pi were employed as stains to indicate the esterase activity and membrane damage of microbes by confocal laser scanning microscopy zeiss lsm880 to determine the live and dead cell the clsm data were proceed by zen 3 1 blue edition to derive the statistical parameters to deduce fluorescence pattern which represents the statistical similarity of the distribution of live and dead cells the meanings of statistical parameters are as follows mean sum and maximum represent the average total and the highest value of fluorescence intensity of clsm image respectively variance and standard deviation depicted the fluctuation of intensity value kurtosis and skewness measured the tailedness and asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real valued random variable in our case the fluorescence intensity microbial viability was assessed by microbial viability assay kit wst dojindo tsukatani et al 2008 briefly wst solution and electron mediator reagent dmso were mixed together to form coloring regent cell suspensions was taken by syringe from batch bottle cell suspension and coloring regent were added to 96 well microplate and incubated in microplate reader under 37 c and measured the absorbance at 450 nm continuously for 30 min the kinetic constant of electron transfer quantified by coloring absorbance variance was calculated by origin 2021 2 3 dna extraction library construction and sequencing after photo denitrification triplicate cell samples 15 samples in total were used for dna and metabolite extraction the genomics dna was extracted utilizing nucleospin soil kit macherey nagel german as instructed dna was quantified with a qubit fluorometer with qubit dsdna br assay kit invitrogen usa and the quality was checked by running aliquot on 1 agarose genomic dna was randomly fragmented and dna fragments with average size of 200 400 bp were selected for end repair and a tailing adapter ligation and pcr amplification the products were purified with magnetic beads after quality control of the obtained library qualified libraries were sequenced on dnbseq platform bgi shenzhen china with an average of 10 gb per sample 2 4 metabolites extraction quality control and uhplc ms ms analysis methanol water 4 1 v v was used to extract metabolites the mixture was settled down and treated by high throughput tissue crusher wonbio 96c shanghai wanbo biotechnology co ltd at 50 hz vortexed well and ultrasound at 40 khz for half an hour the samples were placed at 20 c for 30 min to precipitate proteins after centrifugation at 13 000 g at 4 c for 15 min supernatants were used for lc ms ms analysis the equal volumes of all samples were mixed as quality control qc sample which was treated the same as other samples metabolites was separated by thermo uhplc system equipped with an acquity beh c18 column waters milford usa positive and negative ion mode was performed respectively on a mass spectrometry thermo uhplc q exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization esi the detail parameters of chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry can be found in supporting information 2 5 differential taxonomy metabolites and pathways analysis linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 was used to distinguish taxonomy biomarkers of different light from high dimension matrix with all against all comparison mode p value of 0 05 was set as biomarker threshold metabolites with vip value 1 and p value 0 05 were selected as significant differential metabolites and mapped to the metabolism pathways through enrichment and pathways analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database we evaluated the importance of differential metabolites towards metabolic pathways via metaboanalyst pang et al 2021 quantifying the by a comprehensive indicator impact value of metabolites through its relative location on metabolic pathways enrichment ratio was quantified by ratio in study to ratio in population 2 6 pathway interaction network construction and topological analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to generate correlation matrix of metabolic pathways which was derived from kegg ontology ko and quantified by rpkm based on that an undirected interaction network was constructed in gephi 0 9 7 network overview was evaluated by degree and weighted degree community detection was carried out with build in algorithm and initialized the parameters with randomize on use edge weights on and resolution 1 0 nodes overview was performed according to undirected graph characterized by clustering coefficient and eigenvector centrality 100 iteration edge overview was ganged by graph distance connected nodes were assigned graph distance 1 betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were employed for clustering analysis 2 7 analysis cell suspension were filtered by 0 45 μm micropore filter for nitrate nitrite and acetate concentration assessment through iron chromatography thermo fisher scientific integrion ics 5000 all uv vis spectra and absorbance were obtained through microplate reader thermo fisher scientific tencan spark biomass concentration was estimated by od600 to assay enzymatic activity cells were collected after photo denitrification and washed with pbs buffer 0 01 m ph 7 4 the resuspended bacteria was crushed with ultrasonic cell crusher biosafer 650e in ice bath 260 w 4 min 3 s interval and centrifuge at 12 000 g for 5 min to obtain crude extracts cat assay kit nanjing jiancheng bio ins and sod assay kit wst dojindo were used to evaluate relative antioxidant capability with dark as control group hydrogen peroxide was measured by colorimetric method based on titanium sulfate as described in standard rohwer 1963 the detail bioinformatics analysis of metagenomics and metabolomics was provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of bidirectional optical regulated denitrification the microbiota were collected from a pilot scale sequence batch reactor fig s1 which have been acclimated for several months the detailed acclimation process is available at supporting information photo denitrification experiments were conducted with acclimated microbiota under the irradiation of wavelength divergent lights fig s2 and the wavelength dependent effects on denitrifiers during photo denitrification were illustrated in fig 1 yellow and blue groups exhibited the most significant effects among visible lights the illumination of yellow light accelerated denitrification significantly with the kinetic constant of nitrate reduction 35 4 higher than dark scenario fig s3 however blue light showed inhibitory effects on denitrification and the kinetic constant of nitrate reduction was decreased by 33 6 as compared to the dark notably nitrite reduction to n2 was also inhibited and maintained a stable accumulative nitrite concentration 247 0 mg no2 n l 1 even at 60 h along with almost complete nitrate removed 99 8 this suggested dynamic balance of nitrite concentration under blue light compared to other groups blue light also induced higher peak nitrite accumulation ratio 86 9 but relative lower nitrite concentration 276 2 mg no2 n l 1 at 18 5 h which was more favorable for attenuating the nitrite inhibition on microbiota you et al 2020 green and red light had little effects on denitrification uv irradiation possesses higher frequency and is usually employed to eliminate bacteria and thus negligible denitrification activity was observed due to microbial deactivation giannakis et al 2015 similar illumination effects also arose on biomass synthesis and acetate utilization fig 1c d yellow light boosted acetate utilization and biomass synthesis while blue light delayed both processes it was noteworthy that biomass synthesis was not active during the early stage of denitrification 0 21 h nitrate reduction was carried out in this stage then most of biomass was accumulated at nitrite reduction stage 21 38 h except blue and uv light other groups achieved similar cell density at the end of photo denitrification demonstrating that both blue and uv light engendered growth arrest interestingly despite the ceased growth microbes under blue light irradiation kept taking on acetate implying that divergent metabolism was triggered by blue light this explained for the inhibited metabolism in bio hybrid nitrogen removal system bian et al 2022 wavelength based optical strategy potentially can be employed to conquer this issue for instance leds with different wavelength were used to produce biomass and pigments through wastewater zhou et al 2015 control the dissolved oxygen do concentrations kang et al 2018 and develop biological sensor to regulate microbial metabolism emiliani et al 2022a 3 2 microbial physiology characteristics and antioxidation performance to figure out the effects of light wavelength on the physiological status of denitrifiers we investigated the physiological properties of microbial community confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was utilized to reveal the cellular damage level fig 2 as expected uv light damaged most of cells 88 1 suggesting the cellular deactivation effect of uv irradiation whereas yellow light contributed to the highest cellular viability 92 7 consistent with the results of nitrogen reduction and carbon utilization in fig 1 surprisingly although blue light inhibited biomass synthesis no significant cellar damage was observed fig 2a instead blue light group exhibited comparable live dead cells ratio with dark red and green light fig 2b cluster analysis of fluorescence pattern based on live and dead cells quantified the light induced live and dead statistics and spatial distribution fig 2c d it turned out that blue and uv light exhibited comparable patterns on live cells indicating similar data distribution of blue and uv lights on live cells instead of quantity yellow light was striking in enhancing transmembrane activity stained by green suggesting activated cellular metabolism fig 2c as for pi fluorescence pattern fig 2d i e cell damage effects yellow and blue light were clustered together presenting the longest distance to uv light which further demonstrated the intriguing denitrification regulatory mechanism of blue light the discrepant morphology can also be observed in digital photographs fig s4 as uv group bacteria suspension turned to slight yellow while other groups maintained milky white bacteria suspension including bacteria irradiated by blue light this further confirmed that blue light realized nitrite accumulation without significant cellular damage instead it inhibited the reaction of nitrite reduction and caused metabolic dysfunction dai et al 2012 previous studies showed that yellow light led to photo activation of the cell whereas blue and green light presented mild photoreactivation but partially damaged the cells giannakis et al 2015 which were well consistent with our results combined with the photo denitrification experiments results it can be deduced that blue light inhibited denitrification and acetate utilization through metabolism regulation instead of deactivation to figure out the mechanism of photo activation and inhibition on cellular metabolism we investigated the microbial viability and enzymatic activity based on the existing forms of nitrogen the total reaction process was divided into denitrification stage and nitrogen depletion stage the microbial viability quantified by the redox state cycling rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp was measured to investigate the cellular physiological status along with the nitrogen removal process fig 3 a 3b yellow light aroused the highest viability at both denitrification stage and nitrogen depletion stage whereas microbial community irradiated by blue and uv light exhibited lower viability moreover the microbial viability under dark green and red light increased during nitrogen depletion stage compared to denitrification stage which is due to the alleviated inhibitory effects of nitrate you et al 2020 the enzymatic activity of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase is critical for denitrification the relative activity of nitrate reductase was consistent with denitrification performance fig 1 indicating that low activity or expression of nitrite reductase attributed to nitrite accumulation interestingly after being illuminated by blue light nitrate reductase still showed significantly p 0 01 high relative activity the slightly delayed denitrification of blue light was due to biomass synthesis fig 1d these results indicated that blue light selectively affected the enzymatic activity rather than deactivation illumination usually results in cellular oxidative pressure due to photo biochemical reaction giannakis et al 2015 and the antioxidant system was essential in adapting oxidative environment tsang et al 2014 therefore the enzymatic activity of antioxidant system might also contribute to the wavelength differential metabolism and it is intriguing to explore the microbial antioxidant capability through enzymatic activity of representative enzymes superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat could catalyze the decomposition of oxidative superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide respectively eqs 1 and 2 with regard to sod fig 3c the blue light group stood out with remarkably high relative activity 86 2 higher than dark the enhanced sod activity has also been reported in other microbes such as coral tissue and symbiotic algae as an adaptation strategy to blue light the dominant light wavelength of oligotrophic waters levy et al 2006 the enhanced sod activity usually predicted high level of intracellular produced o2 storz and imlay 1999 which likely intervene the bio denitrification process lundberg et al 2008 despite enhanced sod activity would produce more h2o2 cat was not significantly activated fig 3d in addition there was no considerable extracellular h2o2 generation for all groups less than 0 005 this indicated that other metabolic pathways might contribute to the decomposition and consumption of h2o2 in the blue group to relieve oxidative stress apel and hirt 2004a it was worth noting that functional genes that harbored high photo sensing ability in response to blue light such as photosynthetic and optogenetic genes were reported to play a role in divergent metabolism emiliani et al 2022b wei and jin 2022 uv irradiation caused deactivation of both sod and cat indicating loss of antioxidant capability most of lights inhibited the relative cat activity compared to dark except yellow light suggesting the intact antioxidant function contribute to the high activity under yellow light 1 o 2 sod o 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 cat o 2 h 2 o 3 3 microbial community shifting to investigate the collective microbial photo response a model denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans p denitrificans was employed as raw denitrifying microbe to compare with the acclimated microbiota light inhibition is ubiquitous for microorganisms and the inhibition effects were observed for p denitrificans as well the denitrification performance fig s5a and biomass synthesis fig s5b of p denitrificans were significantly hindered in contrast compared to p denitrificans the microbiota presented higher illumination resilience 25 8 higher kinetic constant fig s6a and nitrite accumulation efficiency 87 3 times fig s6b without significant difference in cell density fig s6c suggesting the excellent robustness and partial denitrification performance of acclimated microbiota the comparable biomass increments implied that instead of cells reproduction there might be other microbial strategy that contributed to the capability of nitrite accumulation and light resilience of denitrification microbiota this inspired us to identify the functional bacteria and genes and decipher the microbial community interaction among microbiota microbial community especially functional bacteria is of great importance on the performance of optical regulated biosystem xiao et al 2021 metagenomics sequencing was conducted to obtain taxonomic information after quality control reads assembly genes prediction and non redundant gene catalog construction non redundant genes were annotated to non redundant protein sequence database nr database and revealed the microbial community composition fig 4 a among the total 1874 genus pseudomonas 41 1 halomonas 21 8 aequorivita 5 1 marinobacter 3 6 aliidiomarina 1 8 and acetoanaerobium 1 2 dominated across all samples most of them were commonly seen in wastewater treatment and identified as functional genera in partial denitrification microbiota li et al 2018b principal coordinate analysis pcoa revealed significant clustering occurred among different groups as illustrated in fig 4b blue light induced the longest distance to dark indicating that blue light possessed the most obvious selection effects on microbiota yellow light was located in the opposite quadrant with blue light corresponding to the bi directional effects on denitrification performance in fig 1 green and red light was close to and had overlap with dark group suggesting slight microbial community shifting among these groups to further reveal the underlying connection between light resilience and microbial taxonomic phylogenetic variation profile was obtained by lefse segata et al 2011 to identify taxonomic biomarkers i e taxonomies that tend to get enriched by certain wavelength of lights fig 4c green yellow and red lights possess relatively higher number of biomarkers while only few taxonomies were enriched under blue light and dark condition evident clustering of biomarkers under different light was observed it turned out that blue light exhibited high selectivity on genus pseudomonas and the green light biomarkers were scattered across all phylum this suggested blue possessed high selection pressure on microbial community while green light had minor effects consistent with the wavelength dependent effects in fig 1 the taxonomies enriched by yellow light illumination belonged to phylum proteobacteria and firmicutes all the taxonomic biomarkers of red light were subjected to phylum bacteroidetes these phyla have been reported to play a key role in high concentrate nitrate wastewater treatment luo et al 2022 notably yellow and blue light exhibited highly efficient and selective screening on genus halomonas and pseudomonas fig s7 indicating that halomonas and pseudomonas were high credit photo responsive bacteria towards yellow and blue light respectively halomonas was able to use photoelectrons with different energy for nitrate reduction liu et al 2020 and the photon of yellow light might be preferred for it to utilize for enhanced denitrification pseudomonas is a well studied model genus and multiple approaches have been put forward to regulate its denitrification including photo sensing quorum sensing and bioengineering based on those properties barak yoram et al 1998 mukherjee et al 2019 these results well explain the enhanced denitrification performance in the yellow light group and superior nitrite accumulation efficiency in the blue light group 3 4 metabolomics profiles in response to illumination although metagenomics can reveal microbial compositions and gene abundances genes with the highest abundance may not necessarily be the greatest contributor to the community function i e not necessarily highly expressed therefore we conducted non target metabolomics to figure out gene expression on the metabolism level given the remarkable divergence of microbial activity under blue and yellow light further investigation on metabolism profiles was performed on them with dark group as control partial least squares discriminate analysis pls da distinguished the clustering of each group fig s8 which inferred the wavelength dependent metabolism variation notably blue light triggered the longest distance with other groups suggesting the distinct metabolic flux redirection several metabolites stood out fig s9 as their prominent expression profiles in response to blue and yellow light the highly expressed metabolites illuminated by both blue and yellow light mainly belong to amino acids and peptides which account for the active microbial activities and cell synthesis in response to environmental stress gao et al 2021b other functional metabolites were also up regulated and their detailed descriptions were illustrated in supporting information interestingly biosynthesis of gaba γ aminobutyric acid through glutamate was induced by blue light which potentially played a role in antioxidation won et al 2015 and maintaining carbon and nitrogen balance and energy supply bown and shelp 1997 additionally gaba and glutamate could signal cellular aging in response to blue light yang et al 2022 and participate in quorum sensing khan et al 2018 corresponding with the functions of dominant genus psudomonas mentioned in fig 4 in industrial wastewater treatment exogenous gaba could facilitate nutrients removal from molasses wastewater qiao et al 2022 differentially abundant metabolites distribution further disclosed the optogenetic metabolism discrepancy including potential biological active substances that can play a critical role even with trace amount among 712 metabolites across all samples 269 were differentially expressed compared to dark 245 for blue light and 53 for yellow light fig s10 corresponding to the distinguished denitrification and physiological changes mentioned above figs 1 and 2 expression profile and variable importance in the projection vip of most differentially abundant metabolites depicted the potential metabolic biomarker fig s11 it turned out that microbiota adapted to blue and yellow light through regulating expression of antibacterial metabolites murugan et al 2020 including alkaloid and terpenoid blue light induced higher expression of antibacterial metabolites corresponding to the inhibited viability fig 3a b whereas the decreased expression of terpenoid of yellow light groups might attribute to higher activity the active fatty acid synthesis and transmembrane activity of yellow light well supported the activated metabolism sethi and vidal puig 2007 the highly abundant and differentially expressed metabolites profiles suggested that illumination engendered wavelength dependent metabolic flux redirection to figure out the pathways that metabolic fluxes were redirected to differential metabolites were annotated to kegg database pantothenate and coa biosynthesis lysine degradation arginine biosynthesis and carbapenem biosynthesis were significantly enriched by blue light fig 5 a generally microbiota was dominated by bacteria tian and wang 2021 but pathways enriched by yellow light were not highly relevant with bacterial metabolism fig s12 which ascribed to the divergent location of different pathways in metabolic network and their impacts varied therefore pathway topological analysis was conducted pantothenate and coa biosynthesis lysine degradation and arginine biosynthesis got high credits on both enrichment values and impact values pantothenate and coa biosynthesis involves in the metabolism of vitamins and coenzymes that played a role in central metabolism especially coenzyme a which is essential for citric acid cycle tca cycle alberts et al 2002 interestingly glutamate metabolism exhibited high impact under both blue and yellow light implying its critical role in light induced metabolism corresponding to gaba and glutamate metabolism mentioned in fig s9 alkaloid biosynthesis presented high impact value agreeing with the differentially expressed alkaloid e g arborine in response to light to regulate metabolic flux fig s11 some alkaloid presents biological toxicity and was the main component of some industrial wastewater and the photo induced biological alkaloid metabolism changes provided new insights into the treatment of the industrial wastewater wick et al 2011 3 5 comparative metabolomics and metagenomics for pathway reconstruction metabolomics unvalied the potential functional pathways however it is hard to elucidate the correlation of metabolism pathways and identify the functional genes which could be compensated by metagenomics analysis hence we innovatively constructed an interaction network based on metagenomic abundance of kegg ontology fig s13 furthermore the statistical topological patterns were quantified to elucidate the metabolism redirection through correlation analysis and identify the critical metabolic pathways and genes fig s14 data s2 there were 327 nodes that represented metabolism pathways and 16301 edges among them that linked correlated pathways fig s13 edge weights were used to denote how closely pathways were connected data s2 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 and peroxisome ko04146 pathways sod and cat subjected to were on the central network and connected with a great number of pathways suggesting their central roles in metabolism however their comprehensive topological statistical indicators fig s14 demonstrated that their connections were loose i e low correlation weights data s2 which implied that there might be other pathways mediated the metabolism flux between nitrogen metabolism and peroxisome ruiz et al 2017 clustering based on topological patterns disclosed the divergent global and local impacts of metabolic pathways fig s14 it turned out that alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism ko00250 and lysine degradation ko00310 potentially served as mediating pathways that played a role in alleviating light inhibition and nitrite reduction as mentioned in fig 3 antioxidant capability contributed to wavelength divergent denitrification but the mechanism of h2o2 pressure alleviation remained unclear to identify the relevant functional genes we compared the correlation weights of paired pathways data s2 crucial pathways relevant to light oxidative stress and metabolomics were highlighted for genes abundance analysis fig s16 fig s22 the highly abundant genes were compared fig 6 to reconstruct metabolic pathways and elucidate the underlying optogenetic mechanism surprisingly there was ignorable divergence on gene abundance under different illumination conditions suggesting that the genomic change was not the major reason for light induced metabolism variance it also demonstrated that metagenomics only represented the existence of genes but performed poorly in reflecting metabolic behavior notably genes encoding glutathione s transferase gst evidently took on higher abundance than other genes fig 6 it played a pivotal role in reactive oxygen species metabolism fig s20 pathways relevant to the antioxidant capability fig 3c 3d gst can be induced by h2o2 wagner et al 2002 and alleviate the oxidative stress through catalyzing the nucleophilic reaction of glutathione with electrophilic nitrogen atoms hayes et al 2005 josephy 2010 in addition glutathione was an important compound in glutathione peroxidase cycle an important enzymatic reactive oxygen species ros scavenging mode mediated by glutathione reductase gsr and glutathione peroxidase gpx apel and hirt 2004b among nitrogen metabolism fig s17 genes encoding glutamate synthetase glul exhibited strikingly high abundance and directed the metabolic flux to glutamate metabolism the high gene abundance related to glutathione and glutamate metabolism was consistent with the metabolomics results of enriched metabolites and high impact value fig 5 oxidative phosphorylation a vital pathway that involved in atp generation and electron transport through nadh nad nath and villadsen 2015 also exhibited high abundance fig 6 corresponding to the disparate viability fig 3a b several modules and enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation stood out with high relative abundance fig s16 nadh quinone oxidoreductase m00144 complex i dominated and was significantly enriched by yellow light compared to both blue and dark groups fig s15 it can drive the electron transfer from nadh to nox reductase in denitrification respiratory chain and complex iv in oxygen respiratory chain chen and strous 2013a thus resulting in enhanced denitrification and overall viability cytochrome c oxidase m00155 complex iv also presented remarkable high relative abundance and was enriched by blue light in the hybrid electron transfer chains of denitrification and oxygen respiration complex iv competes with nox reductase for electrons the proton motive force induced by light contributes to the inhibition of denitrification chen and strous 2013b kirchhoff et al 2018 therefore the enriched complex iv under blue light inhibited the electron flows to nox reductase contributing to the sluggish denitrification most enzymes in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis presented a considerable abundance fig s21 consistent with the high impact value mentioned above notably a quorum sensing enzyme the transporter of gaba from k01995 to k01999 was remarkably abundant fig s20 given the fact that quorum sensing can be used to deliver the signals stimulated by light berg et al 2015 it is suggestive a population signal role that gaba played in light induced microbial shifting and cellular metabolism explaining for the metabolomic profile under different illumination conditions fig s9 combining metagenomics with metabolomics profiles a metabolic optogenetics model for bio denitrification was proposed fig 7 as light with different wavelengths i e photons with divergent energy stimulated the oxidative phosphorylation the electron flows along the respiratory chain varied more specifically yellow light enriched complex i to drive electron transfer along respiratory chain for energy supply and cellular anabolism while blue light aroused higher abundance of cytochrome c oxidase the terminal oxidase in aerobic respiration competing electrons with denitrification respiratory chain thus inhibited denitrification chen and strous 2013a during oxidative phosphorylation complexes pump protons to balance electron flow which triggered the production of ros finkel and holbrook 2000 to relieve the oxidative stress caused by ros antioxidant systems were activated including sod cat as well as glutathione peroxidase cycle between glutathione and glutathione disulfide apel and hirt 2004b h2o2 stimulated gst to drive glutathione peroxidase cycle to alleviate oxidative stress caused by h2o2 wagner et al 2002 which was even more essential given the high gene abundance and corresponding metabolites moreover the substrate of gst r s glutathione is originated from l glutamate and ammonia mediated by glul thus glutamate and glutathione metabolism bridged the light induced oxidative stress alleviation and nitrogen metabolism 4 conclusions this study proposed an optical strategy for controllable denitrification and demonstrated the underlying mechanism typically blue light triggered sluggish denitrification and maintained a relatively stable nitrite accumulation without obvious cellular damage yellow light accelerated denitrification greatly as well as carbon metabolism and biomass synthesis metagenomics results revealed the wavelength dependent taxonomic shifting metabolomics distinguished differentially expressed metabolites and pathways e g pantothenate and coa biosynthesis glutamate metabolism alkaloid biosynthesis co analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics based on metabolic network topology identified the crucial pathways and genes for metabolism network reconstruction it turned out that electron transfer chains along the oxidative phosphorylation contributed to the wavelength dependent denitrification performances and complex i and cytochrome c oxidase were the determinative enzymes the remarkably high abundance of gst implied its role in relieving oxidative stress caused by h2o2 glutamate and glutathione metabolism played a vital role in mediating antioxidant capability and nitrogen metabolism overall our work opened up an optical strategy to realize tunable nitrite supply for anammox as well as elucidated the underlying mechanism of the double edged role of illumination in the future more efforts are needed to elaborate the interactions
