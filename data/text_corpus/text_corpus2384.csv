hydrogeology groundwater potential map india 1 introduction groundwater is one of the vital resources of freshwater and is a component of the hydrological cycle essential for human sustenance narasimhan 2009 it is essentially required for our existence and well being and is the major source of drinking water in both urban and rural areas in india it is preserved and located in various geological formations underneath the surface and is delineated using geophysical and hydrogeological study kumar et al 2014a the delineation of the groundwater resources in the alluvium region is not a difficult task but when the amount of clay content in such region is more or less in equal proportion along with the alluvium sand then finding the prospect source of groundwater is a challenge one in the sedimentary regions the unique property of clayey materials tends to hold more moisture and have a higher concentration of ion to conduct electricity therefore clayey formations have resistivity values less than 100 ω m telford et al 1990 thus the electrical resistivity method is the most favourable geophysical method to understand the geological formations associated with sand and clay geological setting there are only few works done in and around ghaziabad india area utilizing geophysical and hydrogeological techniques for groundwater exploration studies most of the studies have been done on groundwater quality and few on groundwater potential zonation based on conventional geophysical technique one dimensional vertical electrical sounding ves ghaziabad belongs to a densely populated city and is a part of the national capital region ncr of the national capital of new delhi india where the groundwater deterioration rate is very high which leads to depletion in the groundwater table while considering previous work and interpretations a study was accomplished by kumar et al 2014a using modern geophysical exploration techniques like 2d electrical resistivity tomography 2d ert technique at jamia hamdard university new delhi india which is nearby ghaziabad city india for groundwater resource exploration study the study focused on the groundwater exploration and prospecting within the clayey sand and weathered fractured quartzite geological formations using different configurations namely pole pole and pole dipole for optimal depth delineation of groundwater exploration and prospecting based on their study the interpreted resistivity models revealed depths of the potential aquifer lies between 40 and 88 m bgl and the aquifer resistivity lies between 3 35 and 100 200 ω m which shows high variability of aquifer resistivity in the region kumar et al 2014a it is established that the electrical resistivity tomography technique is most frequently used for site investigation especially when the overburden soil is clay dominated cook and nostrand 1954 which is the case in the present study another recent study by imam and hassan 2019 based on a conventional geophysical technique for delineating potential aquifer zones was conducted around the ncr region inside jamia milia islamia campus new delhi their study showed the average groundwater table varies between 10 5 m and 18 3 m below ground level bgl while the conventional 1d geophysical results revealed that most of the alluvium covers overlying low resistivity beds was rich in silt or sand content and indicated a favourable groundwater exploitation zone at 11 m depth which contains sufficient water bearing geological strata the review on the past literature indicated that under similar type of geological settings throughout india most of the work was accomplished with the conventional resistivity method along with the geological hydrogeological and hydro geochemistry studies for evaluating the groundwater scenario in this context there are relevant studies conducted for groundwater a combined integrated study conducted by kumar et al 2014b using geophysical approach and hydro geochemistry to delineate arsenic hot spots as well as a potential safe zone for groundwater extraction in the quaternary alluvial aquifers of bhagalpur district bihar in the central gangetic plains india the results of vertical electrical sounding ves revealed low subsurface resistivity which corresponds to the presence of very fine silt and clayey soil with resistivity 10 ω m up to 16 m depth further down to 40 m depth there is a thick layer of fine sand which is characterized as a potentially safe zone for groundwater extraction similar work using electrical resistivity ves geological and hydrogeological studies was carried out in gwalior madhya pradesh india sanjeev 2017 the interpretation of the sounding curves deciphered three geoelectric layers up to 45 m depth with distinct geological formations namely clay clay with kankar lateritic sand 2 30 ω m altered and contiguous shale layers 30 100 ω m hard and compact shale 100 300 ω m as well as dolerite dyke 300 ω m which controls the movement of groundwater within the subsurface from the results the prospect groundwater zone was identified between 30 and 45 m depth based on available lithology in this area sanjeev 2017 the overall study suggested that the unsaturated and unconfined upper granular zone up to 30 m depth could be effectively used for artificial recharged through rainwater recovery measures which ultimately increases the groundwater resources of the existing aquifers geoelectrical resistivity method at kaushambi district uttar pradesh india was conducted for groundwater evaluation as well as determination of the thickness and depth of the aquifer zones singh and tripathi 2009 the results of the study revealed the depth of the aquifer lies between 8 and 67 m depth and the average thickness of the aquifer 53 m the study indicated that the average depth to the top of the aquifer is 35 m the bedrock was delineated at an average 89 m depth this study indicated that the groundwater reservoirs are mainly confined to the alluvial aquifer further remote sensing and gis techniques have been applied successfully for prospect groundwater mapping and recharge sites jasrotia et al 2011 2019 and integrated remote sensing and gis techniques have also been used to delineate potential groundwater zones anuradha and prabhavathy 2010 oh et al 2011 gyeltshen et al 2019 in the present scenario the application of remote sensing techniques in groundwater hydrogeology is one of the widely recognized attempts in the field of earth sciences neal 2004 ganapuram et al 2009 nampak et al 2014 lee et al 2018 while the integration of remote sensing inputs with geological and hydrogeological surveys provide better predictive results haque et al 2020 in addition weighted overlay analysis using remote sensing and gis have been used in our present work which proved its versatility in correlation with geophysical dataset and validated the major findings one such crucial and detailed study was carried out in and around council of scientific and industrial research human resources and development centre csir hrdc area which is situated in the ghaziabad district of uttar pradesh india ghaziabad is usually a suburban district of northern india of the national capital region ncr it is bounded by longitude 77 27ʹ39ʺ e and latitude 28 41ʹ 11ʺ n and the district is situated in the middle of ganga yamuna doab with a spread over an area of 1966 square km having longitude 77 12 e to 78 13 e and latitude 28 26 n to 28 54 n ghaziabad area is drained by the yamuna river ganga and its tributaries hindon and kali and the small distributors of the sewers are kali nadi chaiya nala and chhoiya nadi the major issue in the csir hrdc area is the groundwater problem in terms of quantity and it is meagerly available at shallow depths it is also found during the hydrogeological study that the shallow boreholes in the csir hrdc area were not yielding water as well as not functional it also suffers from groundwater depletion because of the widespread use of groundwater for irrigation and domestic purposes in and around the area rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 the regular failure of the monsoon and the overuse of groundwater have caused a rapid drop in the groundwater level in many areas singh et al 2017 in north western india where the water table and water quality are deteriorating much faster than any other region of india leads to the shortage of safe drinking water supply siebert et al 2010 gontia and patil 2012 it is thus important to understand the hydrogeology and aquifer characteristics of the study area using high resolution geophysical technique and detailed hydrogeological study along with borehole lithology kumar et al 2020a b geology stratigraphy and hydrogeomorphology of the area krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 which is the utmost need of the study area 2 study area the study area of csir hrdc in ghaziabad is located within the longitude 77 27ʹ39ʺ e and latitude 28 41ʹ 28ʺ n and is a flat area fig 1 within the study area there are 4 existing boreholes but only one is functional and at present water is being pumped daily which is having a diameter of 12 inches and its depth is 91 44 m water is continuously pumped out from the functional borehole with a daily frequency of 10 h of groundwater exploitation to meet the requirement of the csir hrdc area its static water level is 26 72 m below ground level bgl the depth of the second borehole is 36 6 m which is not being pumped for the last one year due to either lowering of water level or the aquifer may be at the deeper depth the water level of the second borehole is not responding through the water level recorder up to a depth of 40 m while the measured static water level at the third borehole is 28 86 m bgl the fourth borehole is also not functional since last year due to unavailability of water the area consists of different forms of soil such as sandy soil sandy clay and light brown colour soil the soil ranges from sand to stiff clays verma 2009 the region is covered with different types of soil having the highest percentage of loam of 43 sandy loam 26 and clay loam 12 respectively the climate of this region is continental and temperature ranges up to 43 c in summer while in winter it is as low as 3 c the winter months having more rainfall than summer verma 2009 rainfall often occurs in the southwest with an average of 80 85 rainfall in the july september months the remaining rain from 15 to 20 is unevenly distributed between january and march months and thus accounts for the mean annual rainfall of the region is 810 mm and is varying spatially in the sub region of the district area 3 geological setting and hydrogeology the study area is located in the ghaziabad district is situated in the middle of ganga yamuna doab which is underlain by quaternary sediments the geological map of the area and its surrounding is shown in figure 2a the geology of the area belongs to holocene and middle late pleistocene period and a few of the meghalayan period varies in between newer alluvium to older alluvium i e of quaternary age 2 6 million years old the surface and near surface deposits belong to sandy and clayey facies and their formation is of loharu aeolian terrace and channel alluvium deposits morphologically the area can be divided into 3 physiographic units viz i older alluvial plain ii older flood plain and iii active flood plain fig 2 b this area is almost flat plain and the drainage pattern is dendritic in nature the watershed of the study area is having an even distribution of drainage lines and contains the highest 3rd order stream the rock type revealed in ghaziabad related to lower early age and consists of quartzite and phyllite these rocks are covered with sediment and separated by debris depth and structural hills and pediments singh et al 2014 the upper strata are made up of alluvium and quaternary sediments their thickness increases from west to east and also towards the northeast geologically ghaziabad forms the part of indo gangetic alluvium which constitutes the various lithological features i e yellowish brown loose sand without kankar oxidized silt clay with kankar and micaceous sand grey micaceous sand silt and clay regionally the eastern part of the district is a part of the alluvial plain of the ganga whereas the western is near the hindon and yamuna rivers large alluvium deposits and the presence of high clay contents the formation behave as aquitard and also it depicted that groundwater generally trapped in these formations the thickness of the aquifer in the western part of the district is decreasing and the depth of the bedrock is shallow based on exploratory drilling carried out in the area the three tier level aquifer system was identified down to a depth of 450 m bgl the first aquifer system extends to a depth of 125 m bgl as well as up to 200 m bgl in the north part of the district the yield of the exploratory boreholes ranges from 1000 to 2500 lpm verma 2009 the second aquifer system lies at a depth of 170 m bgl to 350 m bgl the aquifer constitutes medium to fine grained sand and occasional coarse grained sand with good water quality while the third aquifer system lies between 350 m and continues up to a maximum depth of 450 m groundwater is extracted in unconsolidated sediments within the saturated zone during the monsoon period the water depth ranges from 4 70 m to 2 46 m and in general it ranges from 10 m to 15 m depth major water bearing formations are medium to coarse sand and gravel it is studied that the average depth of groundwater in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period is 23 m bgl and 21 m bgl respectively verma 2009 geological features like lineaments and fault provides connectivity to the subsurface aquifer zone and thus act as a passage to the fractured fissured zone the presence of very few geological lineaments and fault resulted in less groundwater recharge 4 materials and methods 4 1 borehole lithology the lithology of two existing boreholes of the study area up to 110 m depth was studied in detail which depicted a wide variety of sedimentary litho units as well as intermittent clay zones in the entire depth column and their thickness varies from near surface layers to deeper depths fig 3 a b the presence of clay is a major hindrance in the movement of groundwater flow and on the other hand when it solidifies it behaves as a hard formation and hence shows a high resistivity signature within the geological formation the detailed description of subsurface lithological information from both the existing borehole lithology has been minutely studied for the variations in geological formations the borehole lithologs revealed that most of the lithology consisted of quaternary sediments of older alluviums which belongs to the archaean period it was also observed that most of the lithology is weathered and compact clay with or without traces of sand as well as mixed with kankar at different depths which exist at various depths from top to bottom vertically down from top to bottom in a cross section the top layer comprises surface clay which is characteristics of sandy and loamy facies up to the depth of 5 m bgl and thickness varies between 4 and 5 m further moving down sequentially there is a layer of sandy clay with kankar having thickness of 5 9 m found at the depth of 5 m followed by the layer of medium sand generally found below the top and intermediate zones having thickness 3 5 m at the upper zone and 12 20 m at intermediate zone which encounter at the depths of 25 42 55 and 90 m bgl descending there are several layers of clay almost at all depths whose thickness varies from 8 m to 18 m strikes at the depths 18 27 74 87 m bgl fig 3 a b the thickness of clay with kankar varies from 2 to 12 m and found at the depth of 12 16 30 37 m bgl fig 3 a b there are few sheets of sand with kankar generally at intermediate and at deeper depths having thickness varies between 2 and 13 m found at the depth of 42 55 79 m bgl fig 3 a b in addition there is the presence of sandy clay and sand at the depths of 31 m bgl and 58 m bgl and their thickness are 6 m and 14 m respectively it is established based on detailed borehole lithology study within the study area there is a wide variety of alluvium formation with distinct hydrogeological properties 4 2 hydrogeological investigation of the area the hydrogeological investigation was carried out within the csir hrdc area and around the study area in order to know the general water table scenario as well as the availability of groundwater in and around the area of study the water level was measured from 4 existing boreholes using a water level recorder with a light and sound system it was found that the static water levels vary from 26 72 m to 28 86 m bgl this suggests the water table in and around the study area is deep this also indicates that there is no heavy recharge to the water table which is reflected in terms of deep water levels in and around the study area 4 3 electrical resistivity tomography state of the art two dimensional 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert survey was carried out in the csir hrdc area in the month of february 2020 for detailed mapping of the subsurface geology and hydrogeology for groundwater exploration the electrical resistivity tomography technique utilizes optimal current reception in the ground for a better signal to noise ratio in order to have a better quality of the measured resistivity dataset using the electrical resistivity tomography technique we can achieve large resistivity data acquisition in a profile within less optimum time which helps to interpret the subsurface hydrogeological feature s geological structures s with much more clarity than with the conventional resistivity method ert gives the continuous variation of resistivity with depths in two dimensions while the conventional resistivity method gives the variation of resistivity with depths at a point it also gives fast data acquisition due to 4 channel system or higher channels and good resolution of geological structures and thus we measure high quality data we use terrameter ls equipment ert system which utilizes a constant current transmitter that sends an almost perfect square current wave this means that the instrument is less sensitive to noise disturbances the different equations used for different arrays in data acquisition was elaborated here namely for the wenner pole dipole and gradient array to have the utmost data benefit during the data acquisition wenner array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is 1 ρ 2 π a δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes and δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i pole dipole array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is 2 ρ 2 π n n 1 a δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i and n is the factor which is the ratio of the distance between the current potential electrodes to the inline and remote current electrodes dipole spacing gradient array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is given as 3 ρ 2 π n a n 1 m m 1 n n 1 m m 1 δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i and 2 π n a n 1 m m 1 n n 1 m m 1 is the geometric factor value for gradient array where n is the relative spacing between the potential dipole and the closest current electrode whereas midpoint factor m is the position of the midpoint of the potential electrode dipole relative to the midpoint of the two current electrodes thus electrical resistivity tomography state of the art survey was conducted at seven sites site 1 to site 7 refer fig 1 out of the seven sites two sites are located in the guest house campus area and five sites are located in the csir hrdc main campus area the total coverage of all profile is 2 36 km line in the present ert survey we use gradient wenner and pole dipole arrays using various combinations of electrodes viz 24 to 41 and with an electrode spacing of 10 m depending on the accessibility of the space and its availability at these seven sites required for optimal ert data acquisition in the present study the number of data points varies from 102 to 1040 and the data levels range from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 40 this leads to understanding the subsurface rock strata in detail and their variability in terms of physical property from near surface layers to depths as well as to delineate prospect zones of groundwater for necessary exploitation and development of the groundwater resource kumar 2012 within the study area 4 3 1 processing and interpretation of resistivity tomography data the measured electrical resistivity tomography data is first seen physically about its quality and outliers bad data points if any such bad data point s is available in the gathered dataset then it is first eliminated from the measured dataset in processing of data we should basically satisfy ourselves about the data collected in the field as per the layout of the survey we look and analyze the data set closely for its quality whether it is smooth or noisy experience counts a lot in analyzing the dataset accordingly the damping factor is to be introduced in the dataset as well as based on the minimum and maximum measured apparent resistivity variations of the measured dataset for each particular site we assign the inversion parameters type of modelling approach and method to be required for subsequent inversion of the individual dataset this all has to done very carefully during the processing stage of the data and before we do inversion of data filtering is one way to reduce the very noisy data if at all it exists in the measured dataset as it masks the important and realistic subsurface feature s it is one of the important steps during the processing stage of the data after doing the detailed processing of the acquired resistivity dataset we then perform the inversion of the measured individual dataset to achieve the best realistic subsurface inverse resistivity model the best way in the electrical tomography survey is to collect the best quality dataset in the field itself for that we have to take utmost care in the field layout of the survey line of ert proper plantation of the electrodes into the ground minimizing the contact resistance between the ground and the electrodes so that maximum current goes into the ground that is what as a geophysicist we should do in the field if we do not take care of all the above said our inversion of the dataset is badly affected and we will never reach the true subsurface electrical resistivity model once we achieve the true resistivity inverse model of the subsurface at a specific site area and with this inverse model we then performed the detailed interpretation of the resistivity model taking in to account the geology structure hydrogeology and near surface condition of the specific site area 4 4 weighted overlay analysis the weighted overlay technique is used as a part of an integrated study for getting know how about spatially deciphered groundwater potential zone classes in which the study area falls for this watershed adjoining our ert sites were taken for the study and all the thematic map were prepared up to the extent of the watershed using remote sensing and gis these remotely sensed classes are useful while checking its co relation with acquired geophysical data and might act as good integration with the modern resistivity mapping technique during weighted overlay analysis the ranking has been given for each parameter of each thematic map ranging in between 1 and 10 on a priority basis chiefly responsible for water recharging and water holding capacity in aquifer zones and appropriate weights were assigned such as soil 25 geomorphology 25 slope 15 lineament density 5 drainage density 5 and land use land cover 25 table 1 taking consideration of their surface interaction with rainwater as suggested by various researchers in their studies nagarajan and singh 2009 khan et al 2020 further potential groundwater zones were determined by overlaying these all thematic maps in the terms of weighted sum or overlay methods using spatial analyst tools in arcgis and were classified in terms of poor low moderate good and very good the groundwater potential index gwpi is a unitless entity that represents the classification of gwpzs in a given region and can be computed using the general formula given below malczewski 1999 4 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x x i where w j represents the normalized weight of the parameter j whereas x i represents the weight of the i class of the

99 km2 area adjoining the csir hrdc campus thematic maps such as slope and drainage were prepared using alos palsar digital elevation models which have been taken from alaska satellite facility of 12 5 m resolution land use land cover map was prepared using sentinel 2 imagery datasets 10 m resolution from usgs and the acquired datasets were further processed in erdas image processing software and arcgis to obtain land use land cover map for the study area soil data was taken from the bhuvan a data archive platforms of national remote sensing centre nrsc lithology and geomorphology of the study area were acquired from bhukosh a geospatial data platform of geological survey of india gsi lineaments were extracted using several extraction tools available in the geomatica software which facilitate satellite imagery lineament extraction and furthermost lineament density and drainage density were determined using arcgis line density tool all these layers are further integrated and overlayed to obtain the final output map in arcgis as shown in a methodology flow chart fig 4 5 results 5 1 interpretation of 2d electrical resistivity tomography models site 1 profile 1 this site is located in the campus area of hrdc in front of the guest house in the sw ne direction the 2d ert profile is laid parallel to the boundary of the campus and 60 m away from the boundary wall the two dimensional 2d inverted resistivity model at site 1 shows a resistivity variation of 30 200 ohm m from sw to ne direction up to a depth of 73 8 m fig 5 a groundwater prospect scenario is revealed from the resistivity inverted model at a depth of 65 m and beyond between 260 m and 310 m lateral distance fig 5a compared to the ne side the sw part of the model depicted a favourable groundwater scenario for prospecting it also reveals a source of recharge close to near surface layer from the sw direction which contributes to the groundwater system in the aquifer of the region site 3 profile 3 site 3 is located near the backside of the building of the main campus area the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the ne sw direction with lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground as shown in figure 5 b the 2d inverted resistivity subsurface model depicted clear cut highly contrasting subsurface geological feature at a depth from 40 m to 86 2 m fig 5b towards the ne side the low resistivity geological formation between 5 and 20 ohm m and between 40 and 86 2 m depth is the potential target for groundwater prospecting while the geological formation with high resistivity values between 80 and 200 ohm m towards sw direction is water devoid zone as revealed from the resistivity model fig 5b there is also an indication of water saturated formation towards the ne side which is connected to the near surface layers and is the source of recharge to the groundwater system site 4 profile 4 the 2d resistivity profile is located opposite the side of the site 3 and is laid in the ne e to sw w direction with a lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground fig 5c the 2d modelled resistivity section shows a high resistivity formation between 50 and 125 ohm m in the near surface layers and up to 10 m depth fig 5c but the subsurface geological formation at a depth 20 m have a low resistivity formation which revealed groundwater prospect scenario towards ne e direction as compared to the sw w direction fig 5c the modelled resistivity section also depicts there is a source of recharge from the ne e direction which is feeding the deeper geological strata of the aquifer system but the scenario towards the sw w side is not favourable in terms of groundwater prospecting and development site 5 profile 5 the site 5 is located in a small forest in front of the main building and 30 m away from the first borehole which is the only yielding functional borehole for groundwater exploitation in the study area the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the s n direction with a lateral coverage of 340 m on the ground fig 5d the 2d inverted resistivity model depicts a high resistivity geological formation in the near surface layers which restricts the direct heavy recharge to the aquifer system but there is a small connecting zone at the near surface towards the n end of the profile with a resistivity of 25 30 ohm m which acts as a source of recharge to the groundwater table this source of recharge from the n end is connected to the shallow aquifer zones at 30 m depth fig 5d this shallow aquifer zone is further down connected to the deeper aquifer up to 131 2 m depth which is a huge potential aquifer system fig 5d that is the reason functional borehole is sustaining till today and is being pumped daily for groundwater exploitation in this area this borehole which is about 30 m away from the 2d resistivity profile line and its depth is 91 44 m is connected internally to the deeper large aquifer system and thus producing groundwater supply regularly site 6 profile 6 the 2d resistivity profile is located near and parallel to the boundary of the hrdc campus area and lies in the small forest area it is laid in the sw w to ne e direction with a lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground fig 5e the profile is passing near the end boundary of the main building and up to the main pump house in the study area the 2d inverted resistivity model depicts a highly heterogeneous subsurface geological formation especially from near surface layers to 60 m depths down to 60 m depth and up to 150 m it revealed a prospect groundwater scenario towards the sw w direction fig 5e as compared to the ne e direction the modelled resistivity revealed that the deeper depths greater than 100 m are more potential for groundwater prospecting from sw w direction to the centre of the profile fig 5e that is the reason the third borehole located very close to the 2d line and at 205 m lateral distance fig 5e which is falling in the hard rock formation where the borehole depth is 36 6 m have no traces of water in it and is corroborating with resistivity model fig 5e site 7 profile 7 this site is located near the boundary of the guest house area parallel to the wall and behind the guest house the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the se nw direction with a lateral coverage of 280 m fig 5f the 2d inverted resistivity model clearly revealed a major recharge source in the near surface layers towards se direction as compared to the nw direction fig 5f which is likely to be connected to the deeper geological rock strata formation and thus this deeper zone at a depth of 40 50 m is the prospect groundwater zone towards se direction fig 5f while the modelled resistivity section revealed a high resistivity 100 ohm m geological formation towards the nw direction which is totally devoid of groundwater resources 5 2 weighted overlay analysis weighted overlay analysis technique used shows its versatility in groundwater potential zone mapping where the different thematic parameters were weighted considering expert knowledge based on various literature reviews prepared thematic layers have assigned values in the range of 1 10 here a maximum of 7 was assigned to the classes having a consequential impact on groundwater recharge whereas 1 to those of having least importance towards potential groundwater recharge table 1 showing the various thematic layers with their per cent influence and assigned weight of their various classes parameters such as slope is a key parameter that has a strong impact on an area s groundwater charging capacity which directly influence the infiltration of rainfall smooth or flat topography supports groundwater recharge as low slopes enable water to remain percolate for a long time the slope in the area varies in between 0 and 14 and it has been divided into five classes weight of various slope classes is shown in table 1 the highest of 5 ranks has given to slope class ranging between 0 and 3 whereas lowest of 1 is provided to the highest range of 12 14 geomorphology of an area plays a significant role in movement and occurrence of groundwater and hence influences the groundwater potentiality of the area a major geomorphological feature in the area is alluvium with the assigned rank of 4 the rank and weightage assigned to each geomorphic unit given in table 1 land use land cover plays a central role and greatly affects by the groundwater recharge impervious structures built up or concrete do not allow water infiltration whereas water bodies and healthy vegetation facilitates infiltration to groundwater the major parts of the landscape are covered by intense agriculture followed by built up land fig 6 weight and rank assigned to land use land cover classes are given in table 1 a maximum of 8 is given to the water body followed by shrubs open forest 7 intense agriculture 6 sparse agriculture 6 and built up land 1 lineaments are linear structures that reflects the geological sub surface structures such as fault cleavage fracture etc areas with high lineament density is recognized as an ideal site for groundwater prospect here lineament density is categorized into five classes fig 6 a high ranking of 5 has been given to the class with lineament density 37 and a low ranking to the class with lineament density 10 table 1 showing the weight and rank assigned to various classes of lineament density the drainage density bears an inverse relation to the water permeability of aquifers and plays an essential role in the distribution and infiltration of runoff high drainage density exemplifies the impervious sub surface medium with a steep slope whereas low drainage density signifies the porous sub surface medium with a mild slope a drainage density map of the area has been prepared which was further classified into five categories fig 6 the various rank of the density classes and thematic weight is shown in table 1 in the water infiltration phase soil texture and thickness play a significant role infiltration shows the ability of the soil to allow water to pass in and through the profile of the soil the main soil groups available in the region are clayey and loamy fig 6 most of the surface is covered with loam soil these soils have excellent water bearing characteristics the rank assigned to this soil group is shown in table 1 finally by overlaying these thematic layers a map for groundwater potential zones was created using the arcgis weighted overlay tool based on the appropriate weight and rank of the thematic layer and its classes hence groundwater potential zone map was created which are categorized in five classes i poor 0 14 km2 ii low 0 16 km2 moderate 0 05 km2 good 0 39 km2 very good 0 23 km2 showing most of the area falls in good potential zones fig 7 6 discussion the comprehensive study and the results of the 2d resistivity tomography models in the study area and their detailed interpretation in terms of hydrogeology revealed the presence of groundwater prospect scenario at different depth levels mostly lying between 30 and 160 m depths table 2 the perspective behind this study to utilize the application of remote sensing and gis technique along with high resolution geophysical resistivity mapping to establish a validating relationship between both the findings the results and detailed analysis of the six high resolution resistivity tomography models revealed eight targeted prospect groundwater zones table 2 and these are marked in fig 7 based on their hydrogeological complexities and likely sustainable groundwater exploitation scenario inferred from individual resistivity models taking these considerations targeted zones namely a b d e and h were categorized in terms of medium to good c and g as good to very good and f as very good to excellent groundwater prospect scenario table 2 which are corroborating to the most extent as per the spatially predicted potential zones based on weighted overlay analysis where these targeted zones are falling mostly in good to very good potential zone s fig 7 the hydrogeological interpretation of the resistivity models as well as the static water levels measurement clearly revealed the prospect groundwater zones are located at the deeper depths due to channelization of groundwater recharge at the deeper levels which is connected to the near surface recharge source the availability of groundwater at shallow depths i e 50 m is meagre large alluvium deposits and the presence of more clay contents behave as aquitard formation and also depicted groundwater generally trapped in these formations the dominated clay content within the alluvium restricts the flow of water at various depths at the same time study area lies in a high water ridge zone where no water sustaining stream passes nearby which may lead to groundwater shortage but the deeper aquifer can be tapped for groundwater exploitation based on the high resolution electrical resistivity results the inferred resistivity of the groundwater prospect zones aquifers ranges from 10 to 60 ohm m in preparation of the groundwater potential zonation map the weighted overlay technique is used for acquiring information about the different spatially deciphered potential zone classes within the area this helped to evolve the groundwater potential zonation map fig 7 which is categorized in terms of various classes namely poor low moderate good and very good the outcome of groundwater potential map fig 7 is very useful and is correlated with the electrical resistivity tomography results to confirm the potentiality of the groundwater zones in various 2d resistivity profiles further the overall interpretation and the evolution of the spatially interpolated inverse distance weighted prospect groundwater depth and generalized resistivity maps fig 8 a and b give detailed insight and complexities of the study area as well as near the surrounding scenario of groundwater variability with depths hence the integrated results and findings is used for proper and judicious planning for groundwater prospecting and sustainable development in the present study as well as the surrounding area in the present geological setting 7 conclusions the integrated study comprising detailed geology hydrogeology borehole lithology hydrogeomorphology and high resolution electrical resistivity tomography technique helped immensely in understanding the subsurface geological rock strata for groundwater exploration in quaternary sediments and alluvium geological formation state of the art high resolution electrical resistivity tomography technique mapped the entire subsurface geological horizon and delineated potential aquifer zones lying between 30 and 160 m depths where the characteristics resistivity of the fresh groundwater is 60 ohm m within the study area nevertheless the interpretation of the 2d resistivity models at six sites exemplified the availability of groundwater potential zone at the deeper depths due to substantial recharge for future prospecting and exploitation subsequently the evolution of groundwater potential zonation map based on weighted overlay technique is very useful and being correlated with the electrical resistivity tomography models to confirm the availability and potentiality of the groundwater zones which corroborated each other at the same time the better detailed understanding of the prospect groundwater scenario was achieved using spatially interpolated resistivity variation of the geological formations and the groundwater depths using the results from the resistivity tomography technique this clearly depicted and confirmed that the deeper aquifer is more productive as compared to shallower depth and established their connectivity to the large aquifer system at deeper depths the present study emphasized the significant results and findings which is very beneficial for a definite guideline and strategy for groundwater exploration prospecting and sustainable development programme using integration of electrical resistivity tomography results along with remote sensing

hydrogeology groundwater potential map india 1 introduction groundwater is one of the vital resources of freshwater and is a component of the hydrological cycle essential for human sustenance narasimhan 2009 it is essentially required for our existence and well being and is the major source of drinking water in both urban and rural areas in india it is preserved and located in various geological formations underneath the surface and is delineated using geophysical and hydrogeological study kumar et al 2014a the delineation of the groundwater resources in the alluvium region is not a difficult task but when the amount of clay content in such region is more or less in equal proportion along with the alluvium sand then finding the prospect source of groundwater is a challenge one in the sedimentary regions the unique property of clayey materials tends to hold more moisture and have a higher concentration of ion to conduct electricity therefore clayey formations have resistivity values less than 100 ω m telford et al 1990 thus the electrical resistivity method is the most favourable geophysical method to understand the geological formations associated with sand and clay geological setting there are only few works done in and around ghaziabad india area utilizing geophysical and hydrogeological techniques for groundwater exploration studies most of the studies have been done on groundwater quality and few on groundwater potential zonation based on conventional geophysical technique one dimensional vertical electrical sounding ves ghaziabad belongs to a densely populated city and is a part of the national capital region ncr of the national capital of new delhi india where the groundwater deterioration rate is very high which leads to depletion in the groundwater table while considering previous work and interpretations a study was accomplished by kumar et al 2014a using modern geophysical exploration techniques like 2d electrical resistivity tomography 2d ert technique at jamia hamdard university new delhi india which is nearby ghaziabad city india for groundwater resource exploration study the study focused on the groundwater exploration and prospecting within the clayey sand and weathered fractured quartzite geological formations using different configurations namely pole pole and pole dipole for optimal depth delineation of groundwater exploration and prospecting based on their study the interpreted resistivity models revealed depths of the potential aquifer lies between 40 and 88 m bgl and the aquifer resistivity lies between 3 35 and 100 200 ω m which shows high variability of aquifer resistivity in the region kumar et al 2014a it is established that the electrical resistivity tomography technique is most frequently used for site investigation especially when the overburden soil is clay dominated cook and nostrand 1954 which is the case in the present study another recent study by imam and hassan 2019 based on a conventional geophysical technique for delineating potential aquifer zones was conducted around the ncr region inside jamia milia islamia campus new delhi their study showed the average groundwater table varies between 10 5 m and 18 3 m below ground level bgl while the conventional 1d geophysical results revealed that most of the alluvium covers overlying low resistivity beds was rich in silt or sand content and indicated a favourable groundwater exploitation zone at 11 m depth which contains sufficient water bearing geological strata the review on the past literature indicated that under similar type of geological settings throughout india most of the work was accomplished with the conventional resistivity method along with the geological hydrogeological and hydro geochemistry studies for evaluating the groundwater scenario in this context there are relevant studies conducted for groundwater a combined integrated study conducted by kumar et al 2014b using geophysical approach and hydro geochemistry to delineate arsenic hot spots as well as a potential safe zone for groundwater extraction in the quaternary alluvial aquifers of bhagalpur district bihar in the central gangetic plains india the results of vertical electrical sounding ves revealed low subsurface resistivity which corresponds to the presence of very fine silt and clayey soil with resistivity 10 ω m up to 16 m depth further down to 40 m depth there is a thick layer of fine sand which is characterized as a potentially safe zone for groundwater extraction similar work using electrical resistivity ves geological and hydrogeological studies was carried out in gwalior madhya pradesh india sanjeev 2017 the interpretation of the sounding curves deciphered three geoelectric layers up to 45 m depth with distinct geological formations namely clay clay with kankar lateritic sand 2 30 ω m altered and contiguous shale layers 30 100 ω m hard and compact shale 100 300 ω m as well as dolerite dyke 300 ω m which controls the movement of groundwater within the subsurface from the results the prospect groundwater zone was identified between 30 and 45 m depth based on available lithology in this area sanjeev 2017 the overall study suggested that the unsaturated and unconfined upper granular zone up to 30 m depth could be effectively used for artificial recharged through rainwater recovery measures which ultimately increases the groundwater resources of the existing aquifers geoelectrical resistivity method at kaushambi district uttar pradesh india was conducted for groundwater evaluation as well as determination of the thickness and depth of the aquifer zones singh and tripathi 2009 the results of the study revealed the depth of the aquifer lies between 8 and 67 m depth and the average thickness of the aquifer 53 m the study indicated that the average depth to the top of the aquifer is 35 m the bedrock was delineated at an average 89 m depth this study indicated that the groundwater reservoirs are mainly confined to the alluvial aquifer further remote sensing and gis techniques have been applied successfully for prospect groundwater mapping and recharge sites jasrotia et al 2011 2019 and integrated remote sensing and gis techniques have also been used to delineate potential groundwater zones anuradha and prabhavathy 2010 oh et al 2011 gyeltshen et al 2019 in the present scenario the application of remote sensing techniques in groundwater hydrogeology is one of the widely recognized attempts in the field of earth sciences neal 2004 ganapuram et al 2009 nampak et al 2014 lee et al 2018 while the integration of remote sensing inputs with geological and hydrogeological surveys provide better predictive results haque et al 2020 in addition weighted overlay analysis using remote sensing and gis have been used in our present work which proved its versatility in correlation with geophysical dataset and validated the major findings one such crucial and detailed study was carried out in and around council of scientific and industrial research human resources and development centre csir hrdc area which is situated in the ghaziabad district of uttar pradesh india ghaziabad is usually a suburban district of northern india of the national capital region ncr it is bounded by longitude 77 27ʹ39ʺ e and latitude 28 41ʹ 11ʺ n and the district is situated in the middle of ganga yamuna doab with a spread over an area of 1966 square km having longitude 77 12 e to 78 13 e and latitude 28 26 n to 28 54 n ghaziabad area is drained by the yamuna river ganga and its tributaries hindon and kali and the small distributors of the sewers are kali nadi chaiya nala and chhoiya nadi the major issue in the csir hrdc area is the groundwater problem in terms of quantity and it is meagerly available at shallow depths it is also found during the hydrogeological study that the shallow boreholes in the csir hrdc area were not yielding water as well as not functional it also suffers from groundwater depletion because of the widespread use of groundwater for irrigation and domestic purposes in and around the area rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 the regular failure of the monsoon and the overuse of groundwater have caused a rapid drop in the groundwater level in many areas singh et al 2017 in north western india where the water table and water quality are deteriorating much faster than any other region of india leads to the shortage of safe drinking water supply siebert et al 2010 gontia and patil 2012 it is thus important to understand the hydrogeology and aquifer characteristics of the study area using high resolution geophysical technique and detailed hydrogeological study along with borehole lithology kumar et al 2020a b geology stratigraphy and hydrogeomorphology of the area krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 which is the utmost need of the study area 2 study area the study area of csir hrdc in ghaziabad is located within the longitude 77 27ʹ39ʺ e and latitude 28 41ʹ 28ʺ n and is a flat area fig 1 within the study area there are 4 existing boreholes but only one is functional and at present water is being pumped daily which is having a diameter of 12 inches and its depth is 91 44 m water is continuously pumped out from the functional borehole with a daily frequency of 10 h of groundwater exploitation to meet the requirement of the csir hrdc area its static water level is 26 72 m below ground level bgl the depth of the second borehole is 36 6 m which is not being pumped for the last one year due to either lowering of water level or the aquifer may be at the deeper depth the water level of the second borehole is not responding through the water level recorder up to a depth of 40 m while the measured static water level at the third borehole is 28 86 m bgl the fourth borehole is also not functional since last year due to unavailability of water the area consists of different forms of soil such as sandy soil sandy clay and light brown colour soil the soil ranges from sand to stiff clays verma 2009 the region is covered with different types of soil having the highest percentage of loam of 43 sandy loam 26 and clay loam 12 respectively the climate of this region is continental and temperature ranges up to 43 c in summer while in winter it is as low as 3 c the winter months having more rainfall than summer verma 2009 rainfall often occurs in the southwest with an average of 80 85 rainfall in the july september months the remaining rain from 15 to 20 is unevenly distributed between january and march months and thus accounts for the mean annual rainfall of the region is 810 mm and is varying spatially in the sub region of the district area 3 geological setting and hydrogeology the study area is located in the ghaziabad district is situated in the middle of ganga yamuna doab which is underlain by quaternary sediments the geological map of the area and its surrounding is shown in figure 2a the geology of the area belongs to holocene and middle late pleistocene period and a few of the meghalayan period varies in between newer alluvium to older alluvium i e of quaternary age 2 6 million years old the surface and near surface deposits belong to sandy and clayey facies and their formation is of loharu aeolian terrace and channel alluvium deposits morphologically the area can be divided into 3 physiographic units viz i older alluvial plain ii older flood plain and iii active flood plain fig 2 b this area is almost flat plain and the drainage pattern is dendritic in nature the watershed of the study area is having an even distribution of drainage lines and contains the highest 3rd order stream the rock type revealed in ghaziabad related to lower early age and consists of quartzite and phyllite these rocks are covered with sediment and separated by debris depth and structural hills and pediments singh et al 2014 the upper strata are made up of alluvium and quaternary sediments their thickness increases from west to east and also towards the northeast geologically ghaziabad forms the part of indo gangetic alluvium which constitutes the various lithological features i e yellowish brown loose sand without kankar oxidized silt clay with kankar and micaceous sand grey micaceous sand silt and clay regionally the eastern part of the district is a part of the alluvial plain of the ganga whereas the western is near the hindon and yamuna rivers large alluvium deposits and the presence of high clay contents the formation behave as aquitard and also it depicted that groundwater generally trapped in these formations the thickness of the aquifer in the western part of the district is decreasing and the depth of the bedrock is shallow based on exploratory drilling carried out in the area the three tier level aquifer system was identified down to a depth of 450 m bgl the first aquifer system extends to a depth of 125 m bgl as well as up to 200 m bgl in the north part of the district the yield of the exploratory boreholes ranges from 1000 to 2500 lpm verma 2009 the second aquifer system lies at a depth of 170 m bgl to 350 m bgl the aquifer constitutes medium to fine grained sand and occasional coarse grained sand with good water quality while the third aquifer system lies between 350 m and continues up to a maximum depth of 450 m groundwater is extracted in unconsolidated sediments within the saturated zone during the monsoon period the water depth ranges from 4 70 m to 2 46 m and in general it ranges from 10 m to 15 m depth major water bearing formations are medium to coarse sand and gravel it is studied that the average depth of groundwater in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period is 23 m bgl and 21 m bgl respectively verma 2009 geological features like lineaments and fault provides connectivity to the subsurface aquifer zone and thus act as a passage to the fractured fissured zone the presence of very few geological lineaments and fault resulted in less groundwater recharge 4 materials and methods 4 1 borehole lithology the lithology of two existing boreholes of the study area up to 110 m depth was studied in detail which depicted a wide variety of sedimentary litho units as well as intermittent clay zones in the entire depth column and their thickness varies from near surface layers to deeper depths fig 3 a b the presence of clay is a major hindrance in the movement of groundwater flow and on the other hand when it solidifies it behaves as a hard formation and hence shows a high resistivity signature within the geological formation the detailed description of subsurface lithological information from both the existing borehole lithology has been minutely studied for the variations in geological formations the borehole lithologs revealed that most of the lithology consisted of quaternary sediments of older alluviums which belongs to the archaean period it was also observed that most of the lithology is weathered and compact clay with or without traces of sand as well as mixed with kankar at different depths which exist at various depths from top to bottom vertically down from top to bottom in a cross section the top layer comprises surface clay which is characteristics of sandy and loamy facies up to the depth of 5 m bgl and thickness varies between 4 and 5 m further moving down sequentially there is a layer of sandy clay with kankar having thickness of 5 9 m found at the depth of 5 m followed by the layer of medium sand generally found below the top and intermediate zones having thickness 3 5 m at the upper zone and 12 20 m at intermediate zone which encounter at the depths of 25 42 55 and 90 m bgl descending there are several layers of clay almost at all depths whose thickness varies from 8 m to 18 m strikes at the depths 18 27 74 87 m bgl fig 3 a b the thickness of clay with kankar varies from 2 to 12 m and found at the depth of 12 16 30 37 m bgl fig 3 a b there are few sheets of sand with kankar generally at intermediate and at deeper depths having thickness varies between 2 and 13 m found at the depth of 42 55 79 m bgl fig 3 a b in addition there is the presence of sandy clay and sand at the depths of 31 m bgl and 58 m bgl and their thickness are 6 m and 14 m respectively it is established based on detailed borehole lithology study within the study area there is a wide variety of alluvium formation with distinct hydrogeological properties 4 2 hydrogeological investigation of the area the hydrogeological investigation was carried out within the csir hrdc area and around the study area in order to know the general water table scenario as well as the availability of groundwater in and around the area of study the water level was measured from 4 existing boreholes using a water level recorder with a light and sound system it was found that the static water levels vary from 26 72 m to 28 86 m bgl this suggests the water table in and around the study area is deep this also indicates that there is no heavy recharge to the water table which is reflected in terms of deep water levels in and around the study area 4 3 electrical resistivity tomography state of the art two dimensional 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert survey was carried out in the csir hrdc area in the month of february 2020 for detailed mapping of the subsurface geology and hydrogeology for groundwater exploration the electrical resistivity tomography technique utilizes optimal current reception in the ground for a better signal to noise ratio in order to have a better quality of the measured resistivity dataset using the electrical resistivity tomography technique we can achieve large resistivity data acquisition in a profile within less optimum time which helps to interpret the subsurface hydrogeological feature s geological structures s with much more clarity than with the conventional resistivity method ert gives the continuous variation of resistivity with depths in two dimensions while the conventional resistivity method gives the variation of resistivity with depths at a point it also gives fast data acquisition due to 4 channel system or higher channels and good resolution of geological structures and thus we measure high quality data we use terrameter ls equipment ert system which utilizes a constant current transmitter that sends an almost perfect square current wave this means that the instrument is less sensitive to noise disturbances the different equations used for different arrays in data acquisition was elaborated here namely for the wenner pole dipole and gradient array to have the utmost data benefit during the data acquisition wenner array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is 1 ρ 2 π a δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes and δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i pole dipole array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is 2 ρ 2 π n n 1 a δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i and n is the factor which is the ratio of the distance between the current potential electrodes to the inline and remote current electrodes dipole spacing gradient array the governing equation for apparent resistivity ρ is given as 3 ρ 2 π n a n 1 m m 1 n n 1 m m 1 δ v i where a is the spacing between the two potential electrodes δv is the change in the potential difference between the electrodes that causes the flow of electric current i and 2 π n a n 1 m m 1 n n 1 m m 1 is the geometric factor value for gradient array where n is the relative spacing between the potential dipole and the closest current electrode whereas midpoint factor m is the position of the midpoint of the potential electrode dipole relative to the midpoint of the two current electrodes thus electrical resistivity tomography state of the art survey was conducted at seven sites site 1 to site 7 refer fig 1 out of the seven sites two sites are located in the guest house campus area and five sites are located in the csir hrdc main campus area the total coverage of all profile is 2 36 km line in the present ert survey we use gradient wenner and pole dipole arrays using various combinations of electrodes viz 24 to 41 and with an electrode spacing of 10 m depending on the accessibility of the space and its availability at these seven sites required for optimal ert data acquisition in the present study the number of data points varies from 102 to 1040 and the data levels range from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 40 this leads to understanding the subsurface rock strata in detail and their variability in terms of physical property from near surface layers to depths as well as to delineate prospect zones of groundwater for necessary exploitation and development of the groundwater resource kumar 2012 within the study area 4 3 1 processing and interpretation of resistivity tomography data the measured electrical resistivity tomography data is first seen physically about its quality and outliers bad data points if any such bad data point s is available in the gathered dataset then it is first eliminated from the measured dataset in processing of data we should basically satisfy ourselves about the data collected in the field as per the layout of the survey we look and analyze the data set closely for its quality whether it is smooth or noisy experience counts a lot in analyzing the dataset accordingly the damping factor is to be introduced in the dataset as well as based on the minimum and maximum measured apparent resistivity variations of the measured dataset for each particular site we assign the inversion parameters type of modelling approach and method to be required for subsequent inversion of the individual dataset this all has to done very carefully during the processing stage of the data and before we do inversion of data filtering is one way to reduce the very noisy data if at all it exists in the measured dataset as it masks the important and realistic subsurface feature s it is one of the important steps during the processing stage of the data after doing the detailed processing of the acquired resistivity dataset we then perform the inversion of the measured individual dataset to achieve the best realistic subsurface inverse resistivity model the best way in the electrical tomography survey is to collect the best quality dataset in the field itself for that we have to take utmost care in the field layout of the survey line of ert proper plantation of the electrodes into the ground minimizing the contact resistance between the ground and the electrodes so that maximum current goes into the ground that is what as a geophysicist we should do in the field if we do not take care of all the above said our inversion of the dataset is badly affected and we will never reach the true subsurface electrical resistivity model once we achieve the true resistivity inverse model of the subsurface at a specific site area and with this inverse model we then performed the detailed interpretation of the resistivity model taking in to account the geology structure hydrogeology and near surface condition of the specific site area 4 4 weighted overlay analysis the weighted overlay technique is used as a part of an integrated study for getting know how about spatially deciphered groundwater potential zone classes in which the study area falls for this watershed adjoining our ert sites were taken for the study and all the thematic map were prepared up to the extent of the watershed using remote sensing and gis these remotely sensed classes are useful while checking its co relation with acquired geophysical data and might act as good integration with the modern resistivity mapping technique during weighted overlay analysis the ranking has been given for each parameter of each thematic map ranging in between 1 and 10 on a priority basis chiefly responsible for water recharging and water holding capacity in aquifer zones and appropriate weights were assigned such as soil 25 geomorphology 25 slope 15 lineament density 5 drainage density 5 and land use land cover 25 table 1 taking consideration of their surface interaction with rainwater as suggested by various researchers in their studies nagarajan and singh 2009 khan et al 2020 further potential groundwater zones were determined by overlaying these all thematic maps in the terms of weighted sum or overlay methods using spatial analyst tools in arcgis and were classified in terms of poor low moderate good and very good the groundwater potential index gwpi is a unitless entity that represents the classification of gwpzs in a given region and can be computed using the general formula given below malczewski 1999 4 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x x i where w j represents the normalized weight of the parameter j whereas x i represents the weight of the i class of the

99 km2 area adjoining the csir hrdc campus thematic maps such as slope and drainage were prepared using alos palsar digital elevation models which have been taken from alaska satellite facility of 12 5 m resolution land use land cover map was prepared using sentinel 2 imagery datasets 10 m resolution from usgs and the acquired datasets were further processed in erdas image processing software and arcgis to obtain land use land cover map for the study area soil data was taken from the bhuvan a data archive platforms of national remote sensing centre nrsc lithology and geomorphology of the study area were acquired from bhukosh a geospatial data platform of geological survey of india gsi lineaments were extracted using several extraction tools available in the geomatica software which facilitate satellite imagery lineament extraction and furthermost lineament density and drainage density were determined using arcgis line density tool all these layers are further integrated and overlayed to obtain the final output map in arcgis as shown in a methodology flow chart fig 4 5 results 5 1 interpretation of 2d electrical resistivity tomography models site 1 profile 1 this site is located in the campus area of hrdc in front of the guest house in the sw ne direction the 2d ert profile is laid parallel to the boundary of the campus and 60 m away from the boundary wall the two dimensional 2d inverted resistivity model at site 1 shows a resistivity variation of 30 200 ohm m from sw to ne direction up to a depth of 73 8 m fig 5 a groundwater prospect scenario is revealed from the resistivity inverted model at a depth of 65 m and beyond between 260 m and 310 m lateral distance fig 5a compared to the ne side the sw part of the model depicted a favourable groundwater scenario for prospecting it also reveals a source of recharge close to near surface layer from the sw direction which contributes to the groundwater system in the aquifer of the region site 3 profile 3 site 3 is located near the backside of the building of the main campus area the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the ne sw direction with lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground as shown in figure 5 b the 2d inverted resistivity subsurface model depicted clear cut highly contrasting subsurface geological feature at a depth from 40 m to 86 2 m fig 5b towards the ne side the low resistivity geological formation between 5 and 20 ohm m and between 40 and 86 2 m depth is the potential target for groundwater prospecting while the geological formation with high resistivity values between 80 and 200 ohm m towards sw direction is water devoid zone as revealed from the resistivity model fig 5b there is also an indication of water saturated formation towards the ne side which is connected to the near surface layers and is the source of recharge to the groundwater system site 4 profile 4 the 2d resistivity profile is located opposite the side of the site 3 and is laid in the ne e to sw w direction with a lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground fig 5c the 2d modelled resistivity section shows a high resistivity formation between 50 and 125 ohm m in the near surface layers and up to 10 m depth fig 5c but the subsurface geological formation at a depth 20 m have a low resistivity formation which revealed groundwater prospect scenario towards ne e direction as compared to the sw w direction fig 5c the modelled resistivity section also depicts there is a source of recharge from the ne e direction which is feeding the deeper geological strata of the aquifer system but the scenario towards the sw w side is not favourable in terms of groundwater prospecting and development site 5 profile 5 the site 5 is located in a small forest in front of the main building and 30 m away from the first borehole which is the only yielding functional borehole for groundwater exploitation in the study area the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the s n direction with a lateral coverage of 340 m on the ground fig 5d the 2d inverted resistivity model depicts a high resistivity geological formation in the near surface layers which restricts the direct heavy recharge to the aquifer system but there is a small connecting zone at the near surface towards the n end of the profile with a resistivity of 25 30 ohm m which acts as a source of recharge to the groundwater table this source of recharge from the n end is connected to the shallow aquifer zones at 30 m depth fig 5d this shallow aquifer zone is further down connected to the deeper aquifer up to 131 2 m depth which is a huge potential aquifer system fig 5d that is the reason functional borehole is sustaining till today and is being pumped daily for groundwater exploitation in this area this borehole which is about 30 m away from the 2d resistivity profile line and its depth is 91 44 m is connected internally to the deeper large aquifer system and thus producing groundwater supply regularly site 6 profile 6 the 2d resistivity profile is located near and parallel to the boundary of the hrdc campus area and lies in the small forest area it is laid in the sw w to ne e direction with a lateral coverage of 400 m on the ground fig 5e the profile is passing near the end boundary of the main building and up to the main pump house in the study area the 2d inverted resistivity model depicts a highly heterogeneous subsurface geological formation especially from near surface layers to 60 m depths down to 60 m depth and up to 150 m it revealed a prospect groundwater scenario towards the sw w direction fig 5e as compared to the ne e direction the modelled resistivity revealed that the deeper depths greater than 100 m are more potential for groundwater prospecting from sw w direction to the centre of the profile fig 5e that is the reason the third borehole located very close to the 2d line and at 205 m lateral distance fig 5e which is falling in the hard rock formation where the borehole depth is 36 6 m have no traces of water in it and is corroborating with resistivity model fig 5e site 7 profile 7 this site is located near the boundary of the guest house area parallel to the wall and behind the guest house the 2d resistivity profile is laid in the se nw direction with a lateral coverage of 280 m fig 5f the 2d inverted resistivity model clearly revealed a major recharge source in the near surface layers towards se direction as compared to the nw direction fig 5f which is likely to be connected to the deeper geological rock strata formation and thus this deeper zone at a depth of 40 50 m is the prospect groundwater zone towards se direction fig 5f while the modelled resistivity section revealed a high resistivity 100 ohm m geological formation towards the nw direction which is totally devoid of groundwater resources 5 2 weighted overlay analysis weighted overlay analysis technique used shows its versatility in groundwater potential zone mapping where the different thematic parameters were weighted considering expert knowledge based on various literature reviews prepared thematic layers have assigned values in the range of 1 10 here a maximum of 7 was assigned to the classes having a consequential impact on groundwater recharge whereas 1 to those of having least importance towards potential groundwater recharge table 1 showing the various thematic layers with their per cent influence and assigned weight of their various classes parameters such as slope is a key parameter that has a strong impact on an area s groundwater charging capacity which directly influence the infiltration of rainfall smooth or flat topography supports groundwater recharge as low slopes enable water to remain percolate for a long time the slope in the area varies in between 0 and 14 and it has been divided into five classes weight of various slope classes is shown in table 1 the highest of 5 ranks has given to slope class ranging between 0 and 3 whereas lowest of 1 is provided to the highest range of 12 14 geomorphology of an area plays a significant role in movement and occurrence of groundwater and hence influences the groundwater potentiality of the area a major geomorphological feature in the area is alluvium with the assigned rank of 4 the rank and weightage assigned to each geomorphic unit given in table 1 land use land cover plays a central role and greatly affects by the groundwater recharge impervious structures built up or concrete do not allow water infiltration whereas water bodies and healthy vegetation facilitates infiltration to groundwater the major parts of the landscape are covered by intense agriculture followed by built up land fig 6 weight and rank assigned to land use land cover classes are given in table 1 a maximum of 8 is given to the water body followed by shrubs open forest 7 intense agriculture 6 sparse agriculture 6 and built up land 1 lineaments are linear structures that reflects the geological sub surface structures such as fault cleavage fracture etc areas with high lineament density is recognized as an ideal site for groundwater prospect here lineament density is categorized into five classes fig 6 a high ranking of 5 has been given to the class with lineament density 37 and a low ranking to the class with lineament density 10 table 1 showing the weight and rank assigned to various classes of lineament density the drainage density bears an inverse relation to the water permeability of aquifers and plays an essential role in the distribution and infiltration of runoff high drainage density exemplifies the impervious sub surface medium with a steep slope whereas low drainage density signifies the porous sub surface medium with a mild slope a drainage density map of the area has been prepared which was further classified into five categories fig 6 the various rank of the density classes and thematic weight is shown in table 1 in the water infiltration phase soil texture and thickness play a significant role infiltration shows the ability of the soil to allow water to pass in and through the profile of the soil the main soil groups available in the region are clayey and loamy fig 6 most of the surface is covered with loam soil these soils have excellent water bearing characteristics the rank assigned to this soil group is shown in table 1 finally by overlaying these thematic layers a map for groundwater potential zones was created using the arcgis weighted overlay tool based on the appropriate weight and rank of the thematic layer and its classes hence groundwater potential zone map was created which are categorized in five classes i poor 0 14 km2 ii low 0 16 km2 moderate 0 05 km2 good 0 39 km2 very good 0 23 km2 showing most of the area falls in good potential zones fig 7 6 discussion the comprehensive study and the results of the 2d resistivity tomography models in the study area and their detailed interpretation in terms of hydrogeology revealed the presence of groundwater prospect scenario at different depth levels mostly lying between 30 and 160 m depths table 2 the perspective behind this study to utilize the application of remote sensing and gis technique along with high resolution geophysical resistivity mapping to establish a validating relationship between both the findings the results and detailed analysis of the six high resolution resistivity tomography models revealed eight targeted prospect groundwater zones table 2 and these are marked in fig 7 based on their hydrogeological complexities and likely sustainable groundwater exploitation scenario inferred from individual resistivity models taking these considerations targeted zones namely a b d e and h were categorized in terms of medium to good c and g as good to very good and f as very good to excellent groundwater prospect scenario table 2 which are corroborating to the most extent as per the spatially predicted potential zones based on weighted overlay analysis where these targeted zones are falling mostly in good to very good potential zone s fig 7 the hydrogeological interpretation of the resistivity models as well as the static water levels measurement clearly revealed the prospect groundwater zones are located at the deeper depths due to channelization of groundwater recharge at the deeper levels which is connected to the near surface recharge source the availability of groundwater at shallow depths i e 50 m is meagre large alluvium deposits and the presence of more clay contents behave as aquitard formation and also depicted groundwater generally trapped in these formations the dominated clay content within the alluvium restricts the flow of water at various depths at the same time study area lies in a high water ridge zone where no water sustaining stream passes nearby which may lead to groundwater shortage but the deeper aquifer can be tapped for groundwater exploitation based on the high resolution electrical resistivity results the inferred resistivity of the groundwater prospect zones aquifers ranges from 10 to 60 ohm m in preparation of the groundwater potential zonation map the weighted overlay technique is used for acquiring information about the different spatially deciphered potential zone classes within the area this helped to evolve the groundwater potential zonation map fig 7 which is categorized in terms of various classes namely poor low moderate good and very good the outcome of groundwater potential map fig 7 is very useful and is correlated with the electrical resistivity tomography results to confirm the potentiality of the groundwater zones in various 2d resistivity profiles further the overall interpretation and the evolution of the spatially interpolated inverse distance weighted prospect groundwater depth and generalized resistivity maps fig 8 a and b give detailed insight and complexities of the study area as well as near the surrounding scenario of groundwater variability with depths hence the integrated results and findings is used for proper and judicious planning for groundwater prospecting and sustainable development in the present study as well as the surrounding area in the present geological setting 7 conclusions the integrated study comprising detailed geology hydrogeology borehole lithology hydrogeomorphology and high resolution electrical resistivity tomography technique helped immensely in understanding the subsurface geological rock strata for groundwater exploration in quaternary sediments and alluvium geological formation state of the art high resolution electrical resistivity tomography technique mapped the entire subsurface geological horizon and delineated potential aquifer zones lying between 30 and 160 m depths where the characteristics resistivity of the fresh groundwater is 60 ohm m within the study area nevertheless the interpretation of the 2d resistivity models at six sites exemplified the availability of groundwater potential zone at the deeper depths due to substantial recharge for future prospecting and exploitation subsequently the evolution of groundwater potential zonation map based on weighted overlay technique is very useful and being correlated with the electrical resistivity tomography models to confirm the availability and potentiality of the groundwater zones which corroborated each other at the same time the better detailed understanding of the prospect groundwater scenario was achieved using spatially interpolated resistivity variation of the geological formations and the groundwater depths using the results from the resistivity tomography technique this clearly depicted and confirmed that the deeper aquifer is more productive as compared to shallower depth and established their connectivity to the large aquifer system at deeper depths the present study emphasized the significant results and findings which is very beneficial for a definite guideline and strategy for groundwater exploration prospecting and sustainable development programme using integration of electrical resistivity tomography results along with remote sensing

study shows the concentration of eighteen trace elements in groundwater samples collected from the bastar region during the prm and pom periods of 2017 in addition to the tabulation of mean concentrations of the elemental species for all groundwater samples collected on the two periods similar statistics were presented separately for dug well and bore well groundwater samples in table 1 further these concentrations were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability source apportionment and health risk assessment to achieve a clear groundwater hydrochemistry scenario in the study area the abundance order based on the geometric mean gm value of trace elements concentration in overall groundwater samples of the study area were as follows fe zn mn ba b al as be li ni cu cr co v se sb sn cd in prm and fe zn mn ba b as li be al ni cu cr v se co sn cd sb in pom among all the trace elements the highest average concentration was obtained for fe gm 388 40 374 29 μg l 1 in prm and gm 357 37 405 90 μg l 1 in pom the insignificant variation between prm and pom indicates the consistency of a similar source of origin geological crustal during both seasonal periods mondal et al 2010 bhutiani et al 2016 singh and kamal 2017 the concentration of fe in approximately 49 of samples in prm and pom was above the permissible limit of 300 μg l 1 given by bis 2012 mn another abundant crustal element usually found in groundwater singh and kamal 2017 revealed concentrations of gm 145 57 170 79 μg l 1 in prm and gm 178 07 338 07 μg l 1 in pom mn in 37 and 42 of the prm and pom

and mor 2019 ni a potentially toxic element was also found exceeding the permissible limits of 20 μg l 1 in 16 and 9 samples of prm and pom respectively bis 2012 sites with higher groundwater ni concentrations are mostly located in agricultural fields the use of ni enriched insecticides fertilizers might be the primary reason for increased ni concentration in groundwater samples gimeno garcía et al 1996 defarge et al 2018 other measured elemental species b ba be cd cr co cu li se sn sb v zn were found in trace amounts and within the respective permissible limits for drinking water 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of trace elements the coefficient of spatial variation cv determined by dividing the standard deviation by the overall mean across the sites is presented in table 1 separately for dw and bw sites and for prm and pom seasons to evaluate spatiotemporal variability a graph was also plotted using origin 8 1 between the values obtained by dividing cv for each trace element in pom by prm and visa versa with a mathematical factor 1 to evaluate spatiotemporal variability fig 2 except for fe as co and mn all other elemental species concentrations have shown higher spatial variability of 100 across both dw and bw sites during prm it underscores the wide contribution of mineral rich beds to hydrochemistry of the study region through mineral dissolution on evaluating the spatial variability in temporal scale spatiotemporal variability across dw sites cu zn ni mn al and b elemental concentrations have shown multi fold higher spatial variability in prm compared to the pom period on the contrary cv associated with co sb and cr concentrations were higher in pom than prm in bw sites concentrations of several elements as zn ni co mn cr v have shown higher spatial variability in prm than pom this may be attributed to an increase in mineral concentration and a decrease in groundwater table during prm 4 3 factor analysis using pca technique the principal component analysis pca is a receptor technique for recognizing patterns explaining the variance of significant inter correlated variables and could be altered to independent variables helena et al 2000 krishna et al 2009 belkhiri and narany 2015 pca method has been described in detail in s1 pca was executed for extracting significant factors to evaluate possible source types of groundwater chemical contaminants using chemical profiles of elemental concentrations along with reported ionic concentrations factors were determined with a group of heavy elements and ions in groundwater which were strongly correlated in the factor matrix after operating the varimax rotation table 2 supplementary tables s2 s3 show details of pca including principal components pcs percentage of variance and cumulative percentage of each pcs for prm and pom period respectively kmo and bartlett s sphericity test was performed in data sets of both prm and pom periods for examining the accuracy of factor analysis and found p 0 85 for prm and p 0 84 for pom well beyond the prescribed values of p 0 5 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 similarly χ2 values were also within prescribed good fit parameters underscore the appropriateness of factor analysis using pca the total variance was found 80 18 prm and 77 95 pom three factors were extracted by relevant variables based on kaiser s rule as the eigenvalue for the first three components was 1 in both sampling periods the scree plots of prm and pom were depicted in fig 3 a and b the first factor exhibits 42 53 prm and 43 68 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of be cd cr cu k li na ni se sb sn v and so4 2 while negative loading on ba f and mn interaction of acidic components of atmospheric wet precipitation with soil followed by percolation to groundwater might be the indicator of the first source factor this factor could be attributed to the natural sources which signify the percolation of elements and ions present in the soil through the rainwater or may enter the groundwater aquifer through surface water via various biochemical processes such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange etc drever 1997 sethy et al 2016 loh et al 2020 the second factor shows 20 84 prm and 19 19 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of as ba ca2 co f fe hco3 mg2 and mn while negative loading of cr se and sb the second factor might be originated by geogenic sources which resulted in the dissolution of minerals like calcite caco3 and iron oxides e g goethite feo oh and hematite fe2o3 lu et al 2012 kashyap et al 2018 crustal elements e g fe mn ca2 and mg2 found in minerals present in the study area are dissolved into groundwaters by rock water interaction processes the third factor exhibits 16 82 prm and 15 07 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of al b cl no3 and zn while negative factor loading of cr as sb ba and hco3 this factor could be attributed to the agricultural sources as the fertilizer rich water may enter the aquifer and contaminate the groundwater hudak 2012 jassas and merkel 2015 4 4 source apportionment using positive matrix factorization pmf 5 0 u s epa s pmf 5 0 was executed using chemical profiles of 27 chemical species concentrations and related uncertainties of 160 groundwater samples for source apportionment of ions and heavy elements during prm and pom sampling seasons respectively pmf 5 0 receptor model has been described in detail in s2 the optimal number of factors 03 were determined by the iteration with the lowest q robust qexp value picked up by performing 20 random runs paatero 1997 norris et al 2014 the factor fingerprints obtained from pmf5 0 were presented using the percentage of individual species concerning all species and the species concentration related to source factors have been shown in fig 4 species with 50 contribution were used to designate a particulate source factor the factor profile of groundwater chemical species for prm and pom has been shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in prm factor 1 contributes 41 26 to chemical contaminants of groundwater samples with a major contribution of mn fe se co ba f ca2 as mg2 ba and hco3 species derived from geogenic sources viz rock weathering e g fluorite caf₂ hematite and arsenopyrite feass into groundwaters lu et al 2012 mahato et al 2016 factor 2 is characterized by higher concentrations of be v cr ni cu cd sn sb na k and so4 2 with 35 97 factor contribution indicates the natural source these chemical species are commonly found in soil and may enter the groundwater aquifers by percolation through rainwater or surface water chen et al 2019 loh et al 2020 factor 3 represents the agricultural sources with a 20 76 factor contribution and higher factor loading of b al zn cl and no3 jassas and merkel 2015 comparatively higher contribution of geogenic sources in prm might be due to lowering in groundwater table in summertime prm consequently increasing the concentrations of species known for geogenic origin for the pom period factor 1 has shown 38 56 factor contribution with a higher concentration of v cr ni cu cd se sn sb na k and so4 2 representing the natural sources factor 2 contributes 36 56 with a higher factor loading of fe mn as se ba ca2 mg2 f hco3 representing the geogenic sources in contrast factor 3 has shown 25 10 factor contribution representing the agricultural sources with a higher concentration of b al co zn cl and no3 the relatively higher contribution of natural sources in groundwater contamination in the pom period might be due to wet monsoon precipitation the average contribution of sources in prm and pom is shown in fig 7 4 5 inter comparison of pca and pmf results source identifications and quantitative source contribution estimates of groundwater chemical contaminants were performed using the pca and pmf 5 0 receptor modelling techniques respectively both methods are different in the aspects of the software method and associated operations in pca scree plot and kmo values were used to estimate the principal components or number of factors whereas in pmf 5 0 factor fingerprint represented the factor contribution of each chemical species which was used to identify the marker species for each factor although both models have shown a similar source of the chemical contaminant of groundwater samples but pca technique is limited to predicting the possible source factors whereas pmf5 0 results are quantitative and more precise as it is applicable in complete data including outliers and can estimate each source s composition comero et al 1999 4 6 health risk assessment health risk assessment is an important aspect to understand the potential of trace elements to cause health hazards in humans via different exposure routes health risk has been evaluated for the heavy elements in groundwater samples through oral and dermal exposure routes in children and adults for evaluating the annual health risk data the mean value of prm and pom concentrations has been considered outcomes of health risk analysis relevant to the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks have been summarized in table 4 4 6 1 non carcinogenic risk assessment to compute the extent of health hazard resulted due to the exposure to trace and potentially toxic heavy metals metalloids n 19 hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were evaluated reference dose rfd values were available only for al as ba be b cd co cr cu fe li mn ni sb se v zn f and no3 therefore the non carcinogenic risk was evaluated only for these elements the computed overall non carcinogenic ingestion risk hqing values for children was 3 57 e 00 while for adults 1 53 e 00 the lowest and the highest non carcinogenic risk associated with exposure via ingestion was estimated for al and as it is noteworthy that hqing for all the elements was 1 00 e 00 except for as in children the hqing values of as for children was 1 61 e 00 which indicates that children are more susceptible to the non carcinogenic risk posed by drinking as contaminated water higher ingestion of as may have a negative impact on the growth of children and may trigger cardiovascular diseases who 2011 the total non carcinogenic dermal risk hqd value for adults and children was 1 30e 01 and 7 57e 02 respectively within the safe limit of hqd 1 00 e 00 for all the elements it indicates non carcinogenic dermal risk in adults as well as in children non carcinogenic total risk estimated by hitotal value evaluated for both the exposure routes both in children and adults was found 3 70 e 00 and 1 61 e 00 respectively above the threshold limit of 1 00 e 00 the hi value of all other elements was within the limit except for as 1 62 e 00 in children the results show that the non carcinogenic risk is posed only by the as in the groundwater of the study area and children are more susceptible to risk than adults 4 6 2 carcinogenic risk assessment the potential carcinogenic risk was estimated for only as and cr as the slope factor was available only for these two elements the overall carcinogenic risk calculated via the ingestion route cring was 7 73e 04 in children and 3 31e 04 in adults both above the maximum threshold limit 1 00e 04 the results estimated for groundwater of the study area have shown that among the two elements as has a higher cr the ingestion risk is 7 76e 04 and 3 11e 04 for children and adults respectively it suggests that lifelong consumption of as rich water may raise the cancer risk in the inhabitants the total carcinogenic dermal risk crd in children and adults was below the safe limit 1 00e 04 the total carcinogenic risk cr from as and cr in children and adult groups were found to be 7 80e 04 and 3 36e 04 respectively while as resulted in cr value of 7 28e 04 in children and 3 12e 04 in adults the results suggested that the carcinogenic risk is more vulnerable to children than to adults cr distribution by samples on the study area is presented in fig 8 the cr distribution shows that the geogenic sources mineral leaching may be the major contributor of arsenic in the groundwater of the study region volcanic rock weathering leads to the leaching of arsenic onto ferric hydroxide and gets deposited with the sediment which later on interaction with groundwater aquifers result in as contamination of groundwater pandey et al 2006 5 conclusion this study reports the spatiotemporal variability source apportionment and health risk assessment of trace and toxic elements including heavy metals ions and metalloids in the groundwater of the tribal belt of the bastar region the concentration of al as fe mn and ni were significantly higher than the permissible limit in the groundwater of the study area in both prm and pom source apportionment result of pca and pmf shows that natural geogenic and agricultural sources contributed to the groundwater chemical contaminants in the study area the exposure risk model has shown that all elements were under a safe limit except for as which has shown higher carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk values result predicts that prolonged exposure to arsenic through contaminated water may cause carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risks among the inhabitants of the study area it is noteworthy that children were more susceptible to the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk as compared to adults hence a conclusion can be drawn that the overall groundwater of the field area is appropriate for both drinking except for some locations where concentrations of some trace elements especially as are higher and require proper groundwater treatment very few works have been done in the bastar region on groundwater quality thus this study would provide detailed knowledge so that policymakers would take proper steps to improve the water quality of the bastar region further

groundwater to meet water demand for drinking and domestic purposes clark et al 1996 ahada and suthar 2018 among all contaminants inorganic trace elements are of much concern as they are xenobiotic compounds and can accumulate in the water resources for a long period ravindra and mor 2019 groundwater has the potential to accumulate trace elements that reach the water table and pollute it through various natural and anthropogenic sources such as precipitation rock water interaction percolation of soil water industrial wastewater agricultural domestic wastes etc boateng et al 2016 bouderbala

study shows the concentration of eighteen trace elements in groundwater samples collected from the bastar region during the prm and pom periods of 2017 in addition to the tabulation of mean concentrations of the elemental species for all groundwater samples collected on the two periods similar statistics were presented separately for dug well and bore well groundwater samples in table 1 further these concentrations were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability source apportionment and health risk assessment to achieve a clear groundwater hydrochemistry scenario in the study area the abundance order based on the geometric mean gm value of trace elements concentration in overall groundwater samples of the study area were as follows fe zn mn ba b al as be li ni cu cr co v se sb sn cd in prm and fe zn mn ba b as li be al ni cu cr v se co sn cd sb in pom among all the trace elements the highest average concentration was obtained for fe gm 388 40 374 29 μg l 1 in prm and gm 357 37 405 90 μg l 1 in pom the insignificant variation between prm and pom indicates the consistency of a similar source of origin geological crustal during both seasonal periods mondal et al 2010 bhutiani et al 2016 singh and kamal 2017 the concentration of fe in approximately 49 of samples in prm and pom was above the permissible limit of 300 μg l 1 given by bis 2012 mn another abundant crustal element usually found in groundwater singh and kamal 2017 revealed concentrations of gm 145 57 170 79 μg l 1 in prm and gm 178 07 338 07 μg l 1 in pom mn in 37 and 42 of the prm and pom samples respectively found exceeding the permissible limit of 100 μg l 1 bis 2012 arsenic as has been categorized as a human carcinogen that results in skin and lung cancer iarc 2012 exposure at higher levels can cause severe neurological cardiovascular reproductive and respiratory disorders wang et al 2007 rahman et al 2009 the concentration of as in groundwater was found gm 7 22 3 46 μg l 1 and gm 7 29 2 57 μg l 1 in prm and pom respectively with a higher concentration in 11 prm and 24 pom samples compared to the permissible level of 10 μg l 1 who 2011 the higher concentration of fe and mn oxides and as suggests that it is mobilized because of the reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides with as oxy anions in groundwater aquifer rahman et al 2009 aluminium was found to be gm 8 01 21

and mor 2019 ni a potentially toxic element was also found exceeding the permissible limits of 20 μg l 1 in 16 and 9 samples of prm and pom respectively bis 2012 sites with higher groundwater ni concentrations are mostly located in agricultural fields the use of ni enriched insecticides fertilizers might be the primary reason for increased ni concentration in groundwater samples gimeno garcía et al 1996 defarge et al 2018 other measured elemental species b ba be cd cr co cu li se sn sb v zn were found in trace amounts and within the respective permissible limits for drinking water 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of trace elements the coefficient of spatial variation cv determined by dividing the standard deviation by the overall mean across the sites is presented in table 1 separately for dw and bw sites and for prm and pom seasons to evaluate spatiotemporal variability a graph was also plotted using origin 8 1 between the values obtained by dividing cv for each trace element in pom by prm and visa versa with a mathematical factor 1 to evaluate spatiotemporal variability fig 2 except for fe as co and mn all other elemental species concentrations have shown higher spatial variability of 100 across both dw and bw sites during prm it underscores the wide contribution of mineral rich beds to hydrochemistry of the study region through mineral dissolution on evaluating the spatial variability in temporal scale spatiotemporal variability across dw sites cu zn ni mn al and b elemental concentrations have shown multi fold higher spatial variability in prm compared to the pom period on the contrary cv associated with co sb and cr concentrations were higher in pom than prm in bw sites concentrations of several elements as zn ni co mn cr v have shown higher spatial variability in prm than pom this may be attributed to an increase in mineral concentration and a decrease in groundwater table during prm 4 3 factor analysis using pca technique the principal component analysis pca is a receptor technique for recognizing patterns explaining the variance of significant inter correlated variables and could be altered to independent variables helena et al 2000 krishna et al 2009 belkhiri and narany 2015 pca method has been described in detail in s1 pca was executed for extracting significant factors to evaluate possible source types of groundwater chemical contaminants using chemical profiles of elemental concentrations along with reported ionic concentrations factors were determined with a group of heavy elements and ions in groundwater which were strongly correlated in the factor matrix after operating the varimax rotation table 2 supplementary tables s2 s3 show details of pca including principal components pcs percentage of variance and cumulative percentage of each pcs for prm and pom period respectively kmo and bartlett s sphericity test was performed in data sets of both prm and pom periods for examining the accuracy of factor analysis and found p 0 85 for prm and p 0 84 for pom well beyond the prescribed values of p 0 5 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 similarly χ2 values were also within prescribed good fit parameters underscore the appropriateness of factor analysis using pca the total variance was found 80 18 prm and 77 95 pom three factors were extracted by relevant variables based on kaiser s rule as the eigenvalue for the first three components was 1 in both sampling periods the scree plots of prm and pom were depicted in fig 3 a and b the first factor exhibits 42 53 prm and 43 68 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of be cd cr cu k li na ni se sb sn v and so4 2 while negative loading on ba f and mn interaction of acidic components of atmospheric wet precipitation with soil followed by percolation to groundwater might be the indicator of the first source factor this factor could be attributed to the natural sources which signify the percolation of elements and ions present in the soil through the rainwater or may enter the groundwater aquifer through surface water via various biochemical processes such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange etc drever 1997 sethy et al 2016 loh et al 2020 the second factor shows 20 84 prm and 19 19 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of as ba ca2 co f fe hco3 mg2 and mn while negative loading of cr se and sb the second factor might be originated by geogenic sources which resulted in the dissolution of minerals like calcite caco3 and iron oxides e g goethite feo oh and hematite fe2o3 lu et al 2012 kashyap et al 2018 crustal elements e g fe mn ca2 and mg2 found in minerals present in the study area are dissolved into groundwaters by rock water interaction processes the third factor exhibits 16 82 prm and 15 07 pom of total variance with a positive factor loading of al b cl no3 and zn while negative factor loading of cr as sb ba and hco3 this factor could be attributed to the agricultural sources as the fertilizer rich water may enter the aquifer and contaminate the groundwater hudak 2012 jassas and merkel 2015 4 4 source apportionment using positive matrix factorization pmf 5 0 u s epa s pmf 5 0 was executed using chemical profiles of 27 chemical species concentrations and related uncertainties of 160 groundwater samples for source apportionment of ions and heavy elements during prm and pom sampling seasons respectively pmf 5 0 receptor model has been described in detail in s2 the optimal number of factors 03 were determined by the iteration with the lowest q robust qexp value picked up by performing 20 random runs paatero 1997 norris et al 2014 the factor fingerprints obtained from pmf5 0 were presented using the percentage of individual species concerning all species and the species concentration related to source factors have been shown in fig 4 species with 50 contribution were used to designate a particulate source factor the factor profile of groundwater chemical species for prm and pom has been shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in prm factor 1 contributes 41 26 to chemical contaminants of groundwater samples with a major contribution of mn fe se co ba f ca2 as mg2 ba and hco3 species derived from geogenic sources viz rock weathering e g fluorite caf₂ hematite and arsenopyrite feass into groundwaters lu et al 2012 mahato et al 2016 factor 2 is characterized by higher concentrations of be v cr ni cu cd sn sb na k and so4 2 with 35 97 factor contribution indicates the natural source these chemical species are commonly found in soil and may enter the groundwater aquifers by percolation through rainwater or surface water chen et al 2019 loh et al 2020 factor 3 represents the agricultural sources with a 20 76 factor contribution and higher factor loading of b al zn cl and no3 jassas and merkel 2015 comparatively higher contribution of geogenic sources in prm might be due to lowering in groundwater table in

cd se sn sb na k and so4 2 representing the natural sources factor 2 contributes 36 56 with a higher factor loading of fe mn as se ba ca2 mg2 f hco3 representing the geogenic sources in contrast factor 3 has shown 25 10 factor contribution representing the agricultural sources with a higher concentration of b al co zn cl and no3 the relatively higher contribution of natural sources in groundwater contamination in the pom period might be due to wet monsoon precipitation the average contribution of sources in prm and pom is shown in fig 7 4 5 inter comparison of pca and pmf results source identifications and quantitative source contribution estimates of groundwater chemical contaminants were performed using the pca and pmf 5 0 receptor modelling techniques respectively both methods are different in the aspects of the software method and associated operations in pca scree plot and kmo values were used to estimate the principal components or number of factors whereas in pmf 5 0 factor fingerprint represented the factor contribution of each chemical species which was used to identify the marker species for each factor although both models have shown a similar source of the chemical contaminant of groundwater samples but pca technique is limited to predicting the possible source factors whereas pmf5 0 results are quantitative and more precise as it is applicable in complete data including outliers and can estimate each source s composition comero et al 1999 4 6 health risk assessment health risk assessment is an important aspect to understand the potential of trace elements to cause health hazards in humans via different exposure routes health risk has been evaluated for the heavy elements in groundwater samples through oral and dermal exposure routes in children and adults for evaluating the annual health risk data the mean value of prm and pom concentrations has been considered outcomes of health risk analysis relevant to the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks have been summarized in table 4 4 6 1 non carcinogenic risk assessment to compute the extent of health hazard resulted due to the exposure to trace and potentially toxic heavy metals metalloids n 19 hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi were evaluated reference dose rfd values were available only for al as ba be b cd co cr cu fe li mn ni sb se v zn f and no3 therefore the non carcinogenic risk was evaluated only for these elements the computed overall non carcinogenic ingestion risk hqing values for children was 3 57 e 00 while for adults 1 53 e 00 the lowest and the highest non carcinogenic risk associated with exposure via ingestion was estimated for al and as it is noteworthy that hqing for all the elements was 1 00 e 00 except for as in children the hqing values of as for children was 1 61 e 00 which indicates that children are more susceptible to the non carcinogenic risk posed by drinking as contaminated water higher ingestion of as may have a negative impact on the growth of children and may trigger cardiovascular diseases who 2011 the total non carcinogenic dermal risk hqd value for adults and children was 1 30e 01 and 7 57e 02 respectively within the safe limit of hqd 1 00 e 00 for all the elements it indicates non carcinogenic dermal risk in adults as well as in children non carcinogenic total risk estimated by hitotal value evaluated for both the exposure routes both in children and adults was found 3 70 e 00 and 1 61 e 00 respectively above the threshold limit of 1 00 e 00 the hi value of all other elements was within the limit except for as 1 62 e 00 in children the results show that the non carcinogenic risk is posed only by the as in the groundwater of the study area and children are more susceptible to risk than adults 4 6 2 carcinogenic risk assessment the potential carcinogenic risk was estimated for only as and cr as the slope factor was available only for these two elements the overall carcinogenic risk calculated via the ingestion route cring was 7 73e 04 in children and 3 31e 04 in adults both above the maximum threshold limit 1 00e 04 the results estimated for groundwater of the study area have shown that among the two elements as has a higher cr the ingestion risk is 7 76e 04 and 3 11e 04 for children and adults respectively it suggests that lifelong consumption of as rich water may raise the cancer risk in the inhabitants the total carcinogenic dermal risk crd in children and adults was below the safe limit 1 00e 04 the total carcinogenic risk cr from as and cr in children and adult groups were found to be 7 80e 04 and 3 36e 04 respectively while as resulted in cr value of 7 28e 04 in children and 3 12e 04 in adults the results suggested that the carcinogenic risk is more vulnerable to children than to adults cr distribution by samples on the study area is presented in fig 8 the cr distribution shows that the geogenic sources mineral leaching may be the major contributor of arsenic in the groundwater of the study region volcanic rock weathering leads to the leaching of arsenic onto ferric hydroxide and gets deposited with the sediment which later on interaction with groundwater aquifers result in as contamination of groundwater pandey et al 2006 5 conclusion this study reports the spatiotemporal variability source apportionment and health risk assessment of trace and toxic elements including heavy metals ions and metalloids in the groundwater of the tribal belt of the bastar region the concentration of al as fe mn and ni were significantly higher than the permissible limit in the groundwater of the study area in both prm and pom source apportionment result of pca and pmf shows that natural geogenic and agricultural sources contributed to the groundwater chemical contaminants in the study area the exposure risk model has shown that all elements were under a safe limit except for as which has shown higher carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk values result predicts that prolonged exposure to arsenic through contaminated water may cause carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risks among the inhabitants of the study area it is noteworthy that children were more susceptible to the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk as compared to adults hence a conclusion can be drawn that the overall groundwater of the field area is appropriate for both drinking except for some locations where concentrations of some trace elements especially as are higher and require proper groundwater treatment very few works have been done in the bastar region on groundwater quality thus this study would provide detailed knowledge so that policymakers would take proper steps to improve the water quality of the bastar region further

11922,this study aims to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an alluvial aquifer experiencing seasonally variable meteorological inputs and to investigate the aquifer characteristics that influence its response times the sliding cross correlogram approach was used in this study to correlate the amount of water infiltrating the subsurface with changes in water table levels that were monitored at six piezometers the results showed a significant variation of aquifer response times over the study area this finding indicates that the hydraulic behavior of an aquifer may differ from one location to another within the same aquifer aquifer response times were found to be influenced by the variations of the vadose zone thickness these variations however were not observed to be a significant factor controlling the spatiotemporal changes in the aquifer response times instead it was the intensity of the vertical inflow events and the local recharge rate that were found to exert an impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer response times it was assumed that large amounts of vertical inflow increase the soil s volumetric water content above the water table leading to higher values of hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils thus contributing to shortening aquifer response times a better understanding of the effects of aquifer characteristics on aquifer response times is useful for groundwater resource management graphical abstract image 1 keywords cross correlation sliding window water table level water infiltration snowmelt canada 1 introduction granular deposits are increasingly exploited worldwide for many activities either through sand extraction for manufacturing cement construction of facilities or given their potential to provide important quantities and quality of groundwater as water supply reservoirs it has long been recognized that understanding the functioning of these granular aquifers is highly relevant especially in developing regions for the long term management and protection of water resources detailed knowledge of granular deposits is made difficult because of i the heterogeneity of aquifer sediments which often present a complex spatial distribution of granular sizes with varying hydrogeological properties boumaiza et al 2015 hsien tsung et al 2010 vienken and dietrich 2011 and ii the heterogeneity of landscape catchment characteristics including vegetation cover and topography brodersen et al 2000 lozano parra et al 2015 uchida et al 2006 liquid precipitation infiltrating into the subsurface influences the soil water content altering water flow infiltration manifests as changes in i aquifer water table level ii spring discharge and or iii neighboring river levels bailly comte et al 2008 bouchaou et al 2002 chiaudani et al 2017 duvert et al 2015 rathay et al 2018 a delayed response has been commonly observed between a change in water table level and its corresponding input precipitation event indeed the time lag between a precipitation event and the water table response to this event this time lag is what constitutes the aquifer response time has been reported in many studies across a wide range of aquifers either in fractured rock systems cai and ofterdinger 2016 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 pavlić and parlov 2019 tam et al 2004 or in alluvial granular deposits chiaudani et al 2017 duvert et al 2015 imagawa et al 2013 the relationship between the occurrence of a precipitation event and the water table fluctuations that are subsequently manifested provides information on the hydrogeological characteristics of vadose zone the water transit time through the vadose zone and the aquifer s groundwater recharge processes allocca et al 2015 carretero and kruse 2012 jeong and park 2017 owor et al 2009 turkeltaub et al 2015 an aquifer s response time is known to be shorter during the high water table level period wet season and longer during the low water table level period dry season larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 imagawa et al 2013 investigated the response time of the alluvial aquifer of takashima japan according to three contrasting climate patterns they established that the aquifer response time in dry conditions was at least twice as long as the response time during wet periods of abundant rainfall lee et al 2006 demonstrated the existence of a direct positive and proportional relationship between the vadose zone thickness and the aquifer response time i e when the thickness increases the response time increases the effect of the vadose zone thickness is further enhanced by its degree of saturation when the thickness increases the degree of saturation diminishes in turn a reduced saturation of the vadose zone diminishes the overall hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone and increases the aquifer response time delbart et al 2014 showed that the aquifer response time is more closely related to the saturation of the aquifer vadose zone and this saturation has been observed to be linked to greater rainfall intensity explaining the consequent shorter response time of their examined aquifer it can be understood that an aquifer s behavior in terms of its response time is controlled by the climate and by subsurface conditions thus the variation over time of these conditions leads to the variation over time of an aquifer s response time most of the studies on aquifer response times have been conducted on sites where the inflow originates mainly from rainfall allocca et al 2015 cai and ofterdinger 2016 carretero and kruse 2012 chiaudani et al 2017 delbart et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 lee et al 2006 owor et al 2009 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 pavlić and parlov 2019 tam et al 2004 turkeltaub et al 2015 the spatiotemporal dynamic of aquifer response times and the effect of aquifer characteristics on these response times have more rarely been investigated in northern regions characterized by diverse meteorological inputs occurring over long periods of time the main objectives of the present study are i to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an aquifer subject to diverse meteorological inputs and ii to investigate the aquifer characteristics that influence its response times the saint honoré aquifer located in the saguenay lac saint jean slsj region of quebec canada was selected to conduct the present study this aquifer is subject to a typical northern humid climate characterized by diverse seasonal meteorological episodes i e snowfall snowpack snowmelt and rainfall the saint honoré aquifer has been the object of numerous hydrogeological research studies boumaiza 2008 boumaiza et al 2015 2017 2019 2020a 2020b chesnaux and stumpp 2018 labrecque et al 2020 tremblay 2005 however no study had yet been conducted with the specific objectives of the present study knowledge of aquifer response times makes it possible to determine groundwater recharge times thus assessing the variation over time of aquifer response times may further contribute to improving groundwater resource management in the present study this aquifer is considered as a box that controls the relationship between the two studied time series of data i e 1 the amount of water available for infiltration into the subsurface and 2 the water table level here water infiltrating into the subsurface displaces the existing pore water by pushing it deeper down until it eventually penetrates into the saturated zone duffy and gelhar 1986 horton and hawkins 1965 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographic location and climate the aquifer of saint honoré belongs to the slsj region of quebec canada fig 1 the saint honoré aquifer covers a surface of approximately 60 km2 this extended surface posed some difficulty in studying the entire aquifer system however a portion of this aquifer located around the saint honoré airport fig 1 presents an appropriately distributed number of piezometers that have been monitored for a number of months this section of the aquifer is considered in the present study as being representative of the saint honoré aquifer it is covered by forest agricultural lands and urban areas including the small regional saint honoré airport fig 1 precipitations over the study area are captured as rainfall and snowfall the study area experiences heavy snow accumulation with limited water infiltration during the winter spring seasons from november to march april the snowfall accumulated as snowpack during this cold period is subject to occasional melting in response to occasional increases in temperature before melting completely during the snowmelt period generally occurring in april may when 4 5 months of accumulated snowpack is rapidly transformed into water available for infiltration the snowmelt episode is subsequently followed by rainy events over the summer autumn seasons the saint honoré aquifer captures a uniformly distributed mean annual precipitation of 930 mm standard deviation of 21 mm including an equivalent of 320 mm of water representing the mean annual snow accumulation in the present study the term vertical inflow is used to designate the amount of rainfall or snowmelt generated from snowpack as well as the sum of rainfall and snowmelt amounts when they occur simultaneously 2 1 2 geology the study area was marked by the last glaciation event which began approximately 85 000 years ago during the early stage of the wisconsinan period and ended approximately 7000 years ago parent and occhietti 1988 during its retreat toward the north the last glacier covering the slsj region left behind a discontinuous and heterogeneous layer of till terminal moraines and glaciolacustrine fluvioglacial deposits which were derived from basement rocks deposits daigneault et al 2011 lasalle and tremblay 1978 pagé 1999 following the glacier s retreat the slsj region was invaded by the laflamme sea 11 800 years ago lasalle and tremblay 1978 this marine invasion led to the deposition of semi continuous material mainly composed of clayey silt and silty clay overlying these fine grained sediments are the post glacial granular sediments i e littoral deltaic deposits that were deposited during the regression of the laflamme sea the saint honoré aquifer was deposited at the mouth of the valin river that flowed north to south into the post glacial laflamme sea the quaternary material thus deposited then formed an unconfined aquifer having a depth of approximately 50 m it is mainly composed of sand with silt overlying a precambrian crystalline bedrock belonging to the canadian precambrian shield hébert and lacoste 1998 lasalle and tremblay 1978 laurin and sharma 1975 2 1 3 hydrogeological background recharge in the saint honoré aquifer is mainly dominated by snowmelt that usually occurs in the late spring season a mean recharge rate of 70 was estimated for this aquifer using a method based on stable isotopes boumaiza et al 2020b chesnaux and stumpp 2018 this rate is representative of the summer autumn period as during the winter spring period there is negligible snowmelt and the surface soil is usually frozen and covered by thick snowpack up to 1 m which acts as a barrier to water infiltration with an average effective porosity of 42 calculated from in situ laboratory soil sample analyses boumaiza 2008 boumaiza et al 2015 the unconfined aquifer of saint honoré constitutes an important groundwater reservoir and is subject to intense use supplying 34 of the total groundwater for domestic and commercial use in the slsj region cerm paces 2013 the granular deposits of the saint honoré aquifer are composed of highly permeable material indeed the average hydraulic conductivity obtained from soil sample granulometry and by in situ variable head permeability tests was evaluated to be 2 44 10 2 cm s boumaiza et al 2015 labrecque et al 2020 the bedrock specifically located under the saint honoré aquifer has not been very well documented but based on research conducted in neighboring regions cerm paces 2013 chesnaux and elliott 2011 it may be hydraulically connected with the overlying granular deposits through the possible presence of fractures in the top layer of the bedrock the topography of the water table of the st honoré aquifer replicates and generally runs parallel to the surface topography before discharging primarily into the saguenay river boumaiza et al 2021 meinken and stober 1997 tremblay 2005 walter et al 2017 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 water table level for this study the water table levels were monitored at six piezometers la 2 pz 1 pz 16 pz 18 pz 20 and pz 21 over a period ranging from november 2 2016 to december 8 2017 except for pz 1 whose monitoring started one week later on november 9 2016 the locations of the six monitored piezometers are shown in fig 1 these piezometers were implemented by the company laboratoires s l inc in 1981 as part of a hydrogeology study the specific characteristics at each piezometer s location sediment stratigraphy ground surface elevation elevation of the piezometer bottom elevation of the screened section and mean water table elevation are presented in fig 2 for this study the six piezometers were equipped with pressure sensors to monitor local fluctuations of the water table at 15 min time intervals these fluctuations are considered to be representative of natural conditions because they are not affected by anthropogenic activities such as excessive pumping in the wells and or leaking pipelines sometimes observed in urbanized areas because agricultural activities in the study area are limited to the summer season and are based on natural irrigation lesser impacts are expected of agricultural activities on water table fluctuations data collected were converted to mean daily values in order to be consistent with precipitation data that are also recorded on a daily basis see next section 2 2 2 vertical inflows vertical input data was obtained from the bagotville climate station located 25 km away from the saint honoré aquifer government of canada 2019 the change in the aquifer s water table level within the aquifer is assumed to be uniquely the result of the infiltrated amount of vertical inflow snowmelt and rainfall water equivalent in mm originating from occasional or continuous snowmelt episodes is calculated from the daily thickness of lost snow in cm the ratio used for water equivalent conversion is the ubiquitous 10 1 which gives a value of 1 mm of water for 10 mm of snow on the ground potter 1965 for example on the day of february 21 2017 the accumulated snow on the ground surface was recorded as 86 cm whereas the next day february 22 2017 this value decreased to 84 cm thus for february 22 2017 a vertical input of 2 mm was considered when only rainfall is captured during a given day the considered daily vertical input is equivalent to the recorded rainfall amount in mm when rainfall and snowmelt occur simultaneously a combined estimation of vertical inflows is calculated fig 3 shows the variation of the vertical inflows over 3 years november 1 2014 to december 8 2017 including the period covering the groundwater monitoring using the piezometers the piezographs of piezometer pz 18 are included as an example the snow water equivalent calculated from the daily thickness of lost snow can lead to uncertainty concerning the amount of vertical inflow because other natural processes such as sublimation could potentially contribute to reducing snow thickness on the ground surface without however contributing to the amount of water available for infiltration for future research projects in comparable areas experiencing snowfall as meteorological input it is strongly recommended to employ suitable methods for considering the sublimation effect 2 3 correlogram method 2 3 1 preliminary examination of time series data a prior step was undertaken to visualize the overall time lag between the vertical inflows and the water table response by plotting together the vertical inflows and the water table level time series data as those times series data have shown detectable frequency variations fig 3 as a first step their subsets were adjusted by smoothing out the original time series data using a simple 15 day moving average to decrease the detectable frequency variations secondly the adjusted time series data were normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing the result by the standard deviation fig 4 a shows the normalized vertical inflow and water table level data for piezometer pz 18 provided as an example fig 4b shows the period in which the two sets of normalized time series data have similar shapes and are separated by a distinct time period indicating that the water table level is responding to the vertical inflow after a certain time lag for example from fig 4b time lag 1 105 days 2 71 days and 3 128 days 4 months this last appears to be the longest time lag hence the correlogram process should consider a period for the vertical inflow events starting at least 4 months before the first day of the water table level monitoring a period of 5 months is considered in the present study see fig 5 a 2 3 2 cross correlation the cross correlation function can be used to determine the relationship between two time series when one of them is delayed in time with respect to the other in this case water table fluctuations occur after vertical inflows the cross correlation data processing produces a curve representing a continuous series of similarity evaluations in which the peak of this curve occurs at a time lag for which the two time series are best correlated in other words most similar box et al 1994 in the case of water table fluctuations relative to vertical inflow the cross correlation peak corresponds to the time lag defining the aquifer response time delbart et al 2014 mathematically the cross correlation function is solved as follows 1 r x y k c x y k σ x σ y where r xy k is the cross correlation function c xy k is the cross correlogram equation 2 σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the two x and y time series 2 c x y k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y where k is the time interval between the finite time series limited by n n is the length of the time series x t and y t are respectively the input and output time series x and y are respectively the input and output average time series 2 3 3 sliding cross correlation method the aquifer s response time was assessed using the sliding cross correlogram method delbart et al 2014 an illustration of the cross correlogram processing conducted in the present study is shown in fig 5 the method consists in selecting a period in the time series data for the water table level fixed window and determining the location of a similar period in the time series data for the vertical inflows sliding window the process of selecting a fixed window from the water table fluctuations time series data and a sliding window from the vertical inflows time series data does not imply that the water table level is impacting the vertical inflow according to a certain time lag processing starts by correlating the first fixed window with the first sliding window the first window starts at the beginning of the time series data fig 5a this processing aims to mathematically evaluate the degree of similarity between the two correlated windows this evaluation produces a correlation coefficient value the fixed window is maintained in position at the beginning of the time series data while sliding of the sliding window is gradually performed through the entire time series data according to a defined sliding time interval in the present study the sliding time interval is 20 days fig 5a to follow the gradual seasonal variation over time of the vertical inflows and water table fluctuations cross correlation provides a series of correlation coefficients that can be illustrated as a cross correlation function curve fig 5b wherein the peak occurs at a time lag for which the fixed and sliding window time series data are highly similar this time lag represents the aquifer response time a single cross correlation function curve may present several peaks however and as practiced by delbart et al 2014 only the first correlation peak is considered in the present study for a cross correlation to be acceptable the correlating process result must attain a significant degree of confidence 95 confidence level i e the correlation coefficient r k corresponding to the peak value must be superior to the standard error determined as 2 n 1 2 where n is the number of values in the data set diggle 1990 a similar significance test has been used in similar studies to determine the acceptability of cross correlation coefficients chiaudani et al 2017 delbart et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 lee et al 2006 in this study several cross correlation processing attempts were put to the test using different time windows 90 100 110 days etc the acceptable correlation coefficient values observed in the present study were obtained based on a time window of 160 days when the cross correlogram obtained with the first fixed window was completed fig 5b the same process was repeated with a second fixed window by sliding from the first fixed window according to a defined sliding time interval of 20 days fig 5a again this sliding time interval is considered to follow the gradual seasonal variation over time of the vertical inflows and water table fluctuations another cross correlation function curve is then produced fig 5c and so on see another example in fig 5d the cross correlation values were processed using a codified automated program implemented in matlab r2018a an example of the compiled results representing the aquifer response times art is shown in fig 5e in fig 5e for instance the art10 is assessed to be 74 days i e the vertical inflow event that occurred on february 16 2017 reached the water table on may 1 2017 after a travel time of 74 days through the subsurface may 1 2017 is the first day of the relative fixed window and the aquifer response time is considered to be representative of the first vertical inflow date this date is determined by subtracting the determined time lag the aquifer response time from the first day of the relative fixed window 3 results and discussions 3 1 vertical inflows and water table level time series the calculated vertical inflows representing the amount of water available for infiltration over the considered period june 2 2016 to december 8 2017 are shown in fig 6 a intense rainy events occurred during the summer and autumn seasons during which considerable vertical inflows were expected large amounts of water are also expected during the snowmelt period generally occurring in the mid spring season april when 4 5 months of accumulated snowpack is rapidly transformed into water available for infiltration fig 6a shows that only limited water amounts are available for infiltration during the period when snow covers the land during this period cold conditions greatly limit the recharge of the aquifer nonetheless occasional snow melt occurring as a response to occasional increases in temperature have generated minor amounts of water available for infiltration as can be observed in fig 6a the daily water table levels at the six monitored piezometers la 2 pz 1 pz 16 pz 18 pz 20 and pz 21 have shown different variation intervals table 1 significant seasonal variations of the water table level are distinguishable for all the monitored piezometers featuring periods showing high water table levels summer autumn seasons interspersed with periods of lower water table levels winter spring seasons all six monitored piezometers produced generally similar patterns suggesting that the study area captures precipitation according to a generally uniform distribution pattern however as can be seen in fig 6b and table 1 there are certain discernible differences in water table levels between the monitored piezometers such differences may be related to piezometer site characteristics including surface and bedrock leveling 3 2 assessed aquifer response time using a sliding window of 160 days and a sliding interval of 20 days over the entire water table level time series from november 2 2016 to december 8 2017 13 sliding window cross correlogram functions were generated for each monitored piezometer excepting pz 1 for the latter 12 rather than 13 sliding window cross correlogram functions were generated because at this piezometer measurements of the water table level were taken starting on november 9 2016 rather than on november 2 2016 as was the case for all the other piezometers the number of values in each data set n is 160 because the considered windows are for 160 days thus the calculated standard error value 2 n 1 2 is 0 16 through cross correlogram processing all the first peaks of the correlation coefficient r k are found to be significant with standard error values greater than 0 16 see illustrative examples in fig 5b c and d showing r k greater than 0 16 the aquifer response times obtained at the six monitored piezometers are presented in fig 7 which shows that each piezometer exhibited specific and different aquifer response times compared to the other piezometers the different aquifer response times obtained from the six monitored piezometers in the same aquifer indicate that the hydraulic behavior at each piezometer is related to specific highly localized site effects potentially controlled by aquifer characteristics that appear to be different from one location piezometer to another we investigated the available specific characteristics observed at the site of each of the piezometers thought to explain the observed differences in the aquifer response times table 2 the longest mean aquifer response time of 91 days observed for pz 16 is associated with the greatest mean thickness of the vadose zone at 13 28 m this observation illustrates the usual positive relationship between the aquifer response time and the thickness of the vadose zone i e when the thickness increases the response time increases lee et al 2006 however pz 1 presenting the thinnest mean vadose zone of 1 2 m table 2 exhibits a longer mean aquifer response time of 58 days compared to other piezometers that exhibit a relatively thick mean vadose zone such as pz 20 pz 21 and la 2 table 2 furthermore piezometer la 2 with a mean vadose zone 4 25 m thicker than that of pz 20 1 63 m shows a shorter mean aquifer response time 31 days compared to that of pz 20 41 days accordingly it can be deduced that the thickness of the vadose zone is not the main site characteristic influencing the observed differences in aquifer response times between the monitored piezometers of the study area when considering 4 of the 6 piezometers pz 16 pz 18 pz 1 and pz 21 table 2 a clear relationship is observed between the vertical inflow intensity and the aquifer response time when the vertical inflow intensity increases the aquifer response time decreases this observation could be related to the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity because the infiltrated water contributes soil volumetric water content above the water table leading to higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity however the vertical inflow intensity cannot exert a significant effect on the aquifer response time when the captured precipitation even if intense is totally or partially lost via possible runoff and or evapotranspiration for this reason the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which potentially controls the aquifer response time is mostly affected by the amount of the water available for infiltration recharge table 2 shows the mean local recharge rate at the monitored piezometer sites wherein the observed difference in recharge can be associated with site effects such as runoff process and topography chesnaux and stumpp 2018 labrecque et al 2020 when 5 monitored piezometers pz 16 pz 18 pz 1 pz 21 and pz 20 are considered in table 2 a direct proportional inverse relationship between the mean local recharge and the mean aquifer response time is observed when the mean local recharge increases the mean aquifer response time decreases hence the effect of recharge on the aquifer response time can be confirmed in this study the intense recharge combined with the higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity create a cumulative effect leading to shorter aquifer response times the potential effect of differences in subsurface material on the aquifer response times is not considered in the present study because all the monitored piezometers are surrounded by similar geological material mostly dominated by fine to medium sand with some traces of silt fig 2 the numerical modeling of groundwater flow through the vadose zone can be used to verify the assumptions related to the factors influencing the aquifer response time including the vertical distribution of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity but such numerical modeling would require an intense and continuous technical fieldwork monitoring data of the entire thickness of the vadose zone hopmans et al 2002 konikow 2011 vereecken et al 2016 vero et al 2017 which is outside the scope of the present study as observed in fig 7 the aquifer response time is generally variable over the study period for all the monitored piezometers in addition each piezometer shows different aquifer response times however the similarity in shape between the response time trends fig 7 suggests a generally similar influence of seasonal conditions pz 18 was the only piezometer monitored in this study to be located in an urbanized area the other monitored piezometers were located mainly within forested areas despite this pz 18 did not display distinctly different aquifer response times from the others the longest mean aquifer response time 91 days was observed for pz 16 while the shortest mean aquifer response time 31 days was found for la 2 it should be noted that urbanization may slow down the natural recharge of aquifers due to ground surface sealing by concrete and asphalt cover baier et al 2014 waterproofing due to ground sealing could affect the spatial and deep distribution of groundwater compounded by the conversion of precipitation into runoff rather than infiltration into the aquifer wakode et al 2018 although the area surrounding pz 18 is documented as urbanized it contains only the local airport of saint honoré with its short landing runways as well as several small scale associated buildings hence in effect the pz 18 sector is not densely urbanized and consequently the effect of urbanization on aquifer response times at pz 18 was found to be insignificant pz 1 shows a mean response time of 58 days over a vadose zone thickness of 1 2 m this means that at the pz 1 site infiltrating water takes approximately 1 year to travel 7 m through the vadose zone this result was confirmed in other studies by using stable isotope based method boumaiza et al 2020b and numerical modeling boumaiza et al 2020a at an investigated site located 100 m from pz 1 these findings support the outcomes of the present study in fig 7 the piezometers show a decreasing trend of the aquifer response times from longer to shorter over the winter period overall from november to march fig 7 before increasing from early spring to late summer overall from march to july fig 7 this means that the shorter aquifer responses times generally occurred during the winter season whereas the longer aquifer responses times occurred during the summer season aquifer response times were found to be shorter during periods of high water table levels and longer during periods of low water table levels larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 in this northern study area however the winter season is known to be associated with lower water table levels due to limited water amounts available for infiltration because of snowpack cover while the summer season is known to be associated with higher water table levels because of high amounts of infiltrated water originating from snowmelt episodes during the spring season and rain events occurring during the summer season the observation in the present study which is contrary to the norm the norm is shorter response times during the low depth of water table level period and longer response times during the high depth of water table level period is explained by the long duration of the aquifer response time in fact all the monitored piezometers reveal a relatively long mean aquifer response time with a mean magnitude ranging from 31 to 91 days table 2 aquifer response times up to 110 days have been measured in alluvial aquifers duvert et al 2015 whereas in fractured rock aquifers much shorter mean response times of 17 h have been determined by larocque et al 1998 let us compare the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock aquifers against that of alluvial aquifers in fractured rock aquifers experiencing shorter response times the captured rainfall quickly reaches the water table for this reason there is a general inverse relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level when one increases the other diminishes and vice versa however this inverse relationship cannot be rapidly observed in granular aquifers by reason of the inherent longer response times in the case of our granular aquifer to plot this inverse relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level the water table level should be considered at the time corresponding to the date of occurrence of the vertical inflow rather than the moment when the water table reacts to the vertical inflow event this is considered for linking the water table level to the moment corresponding to the date of occurrence of the vertical inflow for example the aquifer s first response time for pz 21 is determined to be 45 days fig 7 the water table level corresponding to this aquifer response time is the level that existed 45 days before the date of the beginning of the first fixed time window i e november 2 2016 we consider the first fixed time window because the given example is for the aquifer s first response time even though the available water table monitoring data does not cover the period before november 2 2016 we may nonetheless regard the yearly water table monitoring data 2016 2017 as representative of yearly fluctuations in the local water table the error associated with this assumption is expected to be minimal as seasonal climate characteristics have not experienced significant changes over the monitored year 2016 2017 or the previous year 2015 2016 as can be observed in fig 4a fig 8 shows the determined back tracked water table levels and the corresponding aquifer response times for all the monitored piezometers in which an inverse relationship between the water table level and the aquifer response time is generally observed when one increases the other diminishes and vice versa delbart et al 2014 found that fractured rock aquifer response times are shorter during the summer while larocque et al 1998 who also studied a fractured rock aquifer as well as lee et al 2006 who investigated a chalk aquifer soft fractured limestone found that aquifer response times are shorter in wet seasons than in dry seasons dry seasons are usually summer and autumn imagawa et al 2013 also assessed the aquifer response times in an alluvial aquifer according to three contrasting climate patterns they established that response times in dry conditions were at least twice longer than during wet periods of elevated rainfall larocque et al 1998 explained that the saturation of the aquifer s fracture network during the wet seasons allows a more rapid transmission of the water pulse compared to dry seasons where the aquifer s fracture network is unsaturated and consequently the water pulse is transmitted more slowly during the wet seasons lee et al 2006 observed a high water table level in the chalk aquifer they studied with a thinner vadose zone compared to dry seasons these authors established a direct positive proportional relationship between the aquifer response times and the thickness of the vadose zone a similar relationship was observed in the present study fig 8 shows the relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level as the water table level increases the vadose zone diminishes inversely when the water table is lower an increase of the vadose zone is observed there is general agreement concerning the existence of a direct positive relationship between aquifer response times and vadose zone thickness i e shorter response times are observed when the water table level rises and the vadose zone decreases and vice versa fig 8 this observation is potentially related to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in fact a thinner vadose zone induces a shorter response time because a shallow water table yields a higher soil volumetric water content above it close to the soil saturated value leading to a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity inversely a thicker vadose zone causes a longer aquifer response time because a deeper water table yields lower soil saturated values leading to low values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the effect of vadose zone saturation on aquifer response times has been mentioned by delbart et al 2014 who showed that variations in response times are more likely due to variability of the transfer velocity within the vadose zone this transfer velocity depends on the saturation of the vadose zone s fracture network the saturation of the fractured rock aquifer was observed to be linked to higher rainfall intensity explaining the observed shorter response time of the aquifer for the alluvial system investigated in the present study fig 9 showing the intensity of vertical inflows and the corresponding response times of the aquifer at the monitored piezometers confirms the inverse relationship that exists between the intensity of the vertical inflows and the aquifer response times it was generally observed for the six monitored piezometers that when the vertical inflow increases the aquifer response times decreased fig 9 4 conclusions the case study research reported in the present study is based on the analysis of aquifer response time over an alluvial aquifer subject to variations of meteorological inputs over time analysis of correlations was conducted between the amount of vertical inflows available for infiltration and water table levels to determine the aquifer response time the present study demonstrates that the sliding cross correlogram approach provides a useful analysis for assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an alluvial aquifer and for investigating the impact of aquifer characteristics on these response times the aquifer response times obtained at the six monitored piezometers showed that each piezometer exhibited specific and different aquifer response times compared to the other piezometers spatiotemporal variability of aquifer response times over the study area were observed with mean aquifer response times varying from 31 to 91 days this study highlights not only the seasonal variation of aquifer response times in the study area but it also indicates based on the observed differences in aquifer response times in different sectors of the same aquifer that it would be erroneous to assume that a single aquifer must always exhibit the same hydraulic behavior at its different studied locations the results obtained in the present study further highlight the known relationships between aquifer response times and site characteristics shorter aquifer response times are related to the rise of the water table level and subsequently to the variations over time of the vadose zone thickness a further observation is that aquifer response times are often observed to be linked to the vertical inflow intensity when vertical inflow intensity increases aquifer response times decrease this observation is potentially related to the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the infiltrated water contributes soil volumetric water content above the water table this process subsequently leads to higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the hydraulic conductivity is also impacted by the amount of water available for infiltration an inverse relationship is observed in the present study between the aquifer response times and the local recharge rate when the local recharge rate increases the aquifer response times decrease hence the effects of the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are combined with that of recharge a cumulative effect the geological history of the slsj region has given rise to several hydrogeological systems which produce abundant drinking water of high quality therefore the framework followed in the present study can be usefully applied to those aquifers which are under similar climate conditions assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of the aquifer response times and understanding the effect of aquifer properties on aquifer response times can support the decision of whether to explicitly consider the effect of site characteristics on the time lag between precipitation and water table fluctuations in the present study only a portion of the saint honoré aquifer was considered for investigation as the monitored piezometers are appropriately distributed over this portion however additional piezometers are recommended to be installed over the entire area of the saint honoré aquifer to gain a comprehensive understanding concerning the distribution of aquifer response times any future implementation of additional piezometers in the investigated aquifer should include a plan to sample continuous vertical sediment cores in order to estimate the hydraulic properties of the main geological units affecting the vertical water flow this would contribute valuable information to the study and interpretation of aquifer response times

11922,this study aims to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an alluvial aquifer experiencing seasonally variable meteorological inputs and to investigate the aquifer characteristics that influence its response times the sliding cross correlogram approach was used in this study to correlate the amount of water infiltrating the subsurface with changes in water table levels that were monitored at six piezometers the results showed a significant variation of aquifer response times over the study area this finding indicates that the hydraulic behavior of an aquifer may differ from one location to another within the same aquifer aquifer response times were found to be influenced by the variations of the vadose zone thickness these variations however were not observed to be a significant factor controlling the spatiotemporal changes in the aquifer response times instead it was the intensity of the vertical inflow events and the local recharge rate that were found to exert an impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer response times it was assumed that large amounts of vertical inflow increase the soil s volumetric water content above the water table leading to higher values of hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils thus contributing to shortening aquifer response times a better understanding of the effects of aquifer characteristics on aquifer response times is useful for groundwater resource management graphical abstract image 1 keywords cross correlation sliding window water table level water infiltration snowmelt canada 1 introduction granular deposits are increasingly exploited worldwide for many activities either through sand extraction for manufacturing cement construction of facilities or given their potential to provide important quantities and quality of groundwater as water supply reservoirs it has long been recognized that understanding the functioning of these granular aquifers is highly relevant especially in developing regions for the long term management and protection of water resources detailed knowledge of granular deposits is made difficult because of i the heterogeneity of aquifer sediments which often present a complex spatial distribution of granular sizes with varying hydrogeological properties boumaiza et al 2015 hsien tsung et al 2010 vienken and dietrich 2011 and ii the heterogeneity of landscape catchment characteristics including vegetation cover and topography brodersen et al 2000 lozano parra et al 2015 uchida et al 2006 liquid precipitation infiltrating into the subsurface influences the soil water content altering water flow infiltration manifests as changes in i aquifer water table level ii spring discharge and or iii neighboring river levels bailly comte et al 2008 bouchaou et al 2002 chiaudani et al 2017 duvert et al 2015 rathay et al 2018 a delayed response has been commonly observed between a change in water table level and its corresponding input precipitation event indeed the time lag between a precipitation event and the water table response to this event this time lag is what constitutes the aquifer response time has been reported in many studies across a wide range of aquifers either in fractured rock systems cai and ofterdinger 2016 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 pavlić and parlov 2019 tam et al 2004 or in alluvial granular deposits chiaudani et al 2017 duvert et al 2015 imagawa et al 2013 the relationship between the occurrence of a precipitation event and the water table fluctuations that are subsequently manifested provides information on the hydrogeological characteristics of vadose zone the water transit time through the vadose zone and the aquifer s groundwater recharge processes allocca et al 2015 carretero and kruse 2012 jeong and park 2017 owor et al 2009 turkeltaub et al 2015 an aquifer s response time is known to be shorter during the high water table level period wet season and longer during the low water table level period dry season larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 imagawa et al 2013 investigated the response time of the alluvial aquifer of takashima japan according to three contrasting climate patterns they established that the aquifer response time in dry conditions was at least twice as long as the response time during wet periods of abundant rainfall lee et al 2006 demonstrated the existence of a direct positive and proportional relationship between the vadose zone thickness and the aquifer response time i e when the thickness increases the response time increases the effect of the vadose zone thickness is further enhanced by its degree of saturation when the thickness increases the degree of saturation diminishes in turn a reduced saturation of the vadose zone diminishes the overall hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone and increases the aquifer response time delbart et al 2014 showed that the aquifer response time is more closely related to the saturation of the aquifer vadose zone and this saturation has been observed to be linked to greater rainfall intensity explaining the consequent shorter response time of their examined aquifer it can be understood that an aquifer s behavior in terms of its response time is controlled by the climate and by subsurface conditions thus the variation over time of these conditions leads to the variation over time of an aquifer s response time most of the studies on aquifer response times have been conducted on sites where the inflow originates mainly from rainfall allocca et al 2015 cai and ofterdinger 2016 carretero and kruse 2012 chiaudani et al 2017 delbart et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 lee et al 2006 owor et al 2009 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 pavlić and parlov 2019 tam et al 2004 turkeltaub et al 2015 the spatiotemporal dynamic of aquifer response times and the effect of aquifer characteristics on these response times have more rarely been investigated in northern regions characterized by diverse meteorological inputs occurring over long periods of time the main objectives of the present study are i to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an aquifer subject to diverse meteorological inputs and ii to investigate the aquifer characteristics that influence its response times the saint honoré aquifer located in the saguenay lac saint jean slsj region of quebec canada was selected to conduct the present study this aquifer is subject to a typical northern humid climate characterized by diverse seasonal meteorological episodes i e snowfall snowpack snowmelt and rainfall the saint honoré aquifer has been the object of numerous hydrogeological research studies boumaiza 2008 boumaiza et al 2015 2017 2019 2020a 2020b chesnaux and stumpp 2018 labrecque et al 2020 tremblay 2005 however no study had yet been conducted with the specific objectives of the present study knowledge of aquifer response times makes it possible to determine groundwater recharge times thus assessing the variation over time of aquifer response times may further contribute to improving groundwater resource management in the present study this aquifer is considered as a box that controls the relationship between the two studied time series of data i e 1 the amount of water available for infiltration into the subsurface and 2 the water table level here water infiltrating into the subsurface displaces the existing pore water by pushing it deeper down until it eventually penetrates into the saturated zone duffy and gelhar 1986 horton and hawkins 1965 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographic location and climate the aquifer of saint honoré belongs to the slsj region of quebec canada fig 1 the saint honoré aquifer covers a surface of approximately 60 km2 this extended surface posed some difficulty in studying the entire aquifer system however a portion of this aquifer located around the saint honoré airport fig 1 presents an appropriately distributed number of piezometers that have been monitored for a number of months this section of the aquifer is considered in the present study as being representative of the saint honoré aquifer it is covered by forest agricultural lands and urban areas including the small regional saint honoré airport fig 1 precipitations over the study area are captured as rainfall and snowfall the study area experiences heavy snow accumulation with limited water infiltration during the winter spring seasons from november to march april the snowfall accumulated as snowpack during this cold period is subject to occasional melting in response to occasional increases in temperature before melting completely during the snowmelt period generally occurring in april may when 4 5 months of accumulated snowpack is rapidly transformed into water available for infiltration the snowmelt episode is subsequently followed by rainy events over the summer autumn seasons the saint honoré aquifer captures a uniformly distributed mean annual precipitation of 930 mm standard deviation of 21 mm including an equivalent of 320 mm of water representing the mean annual snow accumulation in the present study the term vertical inflow is used to designate the amount of rainfall or snowmelt generated from snowpack as well as the sum of rainfall and snowmelt amounts when they occur simultaneously 2 1 2 geology the study area was marked by the last glaciation event which began approximately 85 000 years ago during the early stage of the wisconsinan period and ended approximately 7000 years ago parent and occhietti 1988 during its retreat toward the north the last glacier covering the slsj region left behind a discontinuous and heterogeneous layer of till terminal moraines and glaciolacustrine fluvioglacial deposits which were derived from basement rocks deposits daigneault et al 2011 lasalle and tremblay 1978 pagé 1999 following the glacier s retreat the slsj region was invaded by the laflamme sea 11 800 years ago lasalle and tremblay 1978 this marine invasion led to the deposition of semi continuous material mainly composed of clayey silt and silty clay overlying these fine grained sediments are the post glacial granular sediments i e littoral deltaic deposits that were deposited during the regression of the laflamme sea the saint honoré aquifer was deposited at the mouth of the valin river that flowed north to south into the post glacial laflamme sea the quaternary material thus deposited then formed an unconfined aquifer having a depth of approximately 50 m it is mainly composed of sand with silt overlying a precambrian crystalline bedrock belonging to the canadian precambrian shield hébert and lacoste 1998 lasalle and tremblay 1978 laurin and sharma 1975 2 1 3 hydrogeological background recharge in the saint honoré aquifer is mainly dominated by snowmelt that usually occurs in the late spring season a mean recharge rate of 70 was estimated for this aquifer using a method based on stable isotopes boumaiza et al 2020b chesnaux and stumpp 2018 this rate is representative of the summer autumn period as during the winter spring period there is negligible snowmelt and the surface soil is usually frozen and covered by thick snowpack up to 1 m which acts as a barrier to water infiltration with an average effective porosity of 42 calculated from in situ laboratory soil sample analyses boumaiza 2008 boumaiza et al 2015 the unconfined aquifer of saint honoré constitutes an important groundwater reservoir and is subject to intense use supplying 34 of the total groundwater for domestic and commercial use in the slsj region cerm paces 2013 the granular deposits of the saint honoré aquifer are composed of highly permeable material indeed the average hydraulic conductivity obtained from soil sample granulometry and by in situ variable head permeability tests was evaluated to be 2 44 10 2 cm s boumaiza et al 2015 labrecque et al 2020 the bedrock specifically located under the saint honoré aquifer has not been very well documented but based on research conducted in neighboring regions cerm paces 2013 chesnaux and elliott 2011 it may be hydraulically connected with the overlying granular deposits through the possible presence of fractures in the top layer of the bedrock the topography of the water table of the st honoré aquifer replicates and generally runs parallel to the surface topography before discharging primarily into the saguenay river boumaiza et al 2021 meinken and stober 1997 tremblay 2005 walter et al 2017 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 water table level for this study the water table levels were monitored at six piezometers la 2 pz 1 pz 16 pz 18 pz 20 and pz 21 over a period ranging from november 2 2016 to december 8 2017 except for pz 1 whose monitoring started one week later on november 9 2016 the locations of the six monitored piezometers are shown in fig 1 these piezometers were implemented by the company laboratoires s l inc in 1981 as part of a hydrogeology study the specific characteristics at each piezometer s location sediment stratigraphy ground surface elevation elevation of the piezometer bottom elevation of the screened section and mean water table elevation are presented in fig 2 for this study the six piezometers were equipped with pressure sensors to monitor local fluctuations of the water table at 15 min time intervals these fluctuations are considered to be representative of natural conditions because they are not affected by anthropogenic activities such as excessive pumping in the wells and or leaking pipelines sometimes observed in urbanized areas because agricultural activities in the study area are limited to the summer season and are based on natural irrigation lesser impacts are expected of agricultural activities on water table fluctuations data collected were converted to mean daily values in order to be consistent with precipitation data that are also recorded on a daily basis see next section 2 2 2 vertical inflows vertical input data was obtained from the bagotville climate station located 25 km away from the saint honoré aquifer government of canada 2019 the change in the aquifer s water table level within the aquifer is assumed to be uniquely the result of the infiltrated amount of vertical inflow snowmelt and rainfall water equivalent in mm originating from occasional or continuous snowmelt episodes is calculated from the daily thickness of lost snow in cm the ratio used for water equivalent conversion is the ubiquitous 10 1 which gives a value of 1 mm of water for 10 mm of snow on the ground potter 1965 for example on the day of february 21 2017 the accumulated snow on the ground surface was recorded as 86 cm whereas the next day february 22 2017 this value decreased to 84 cm thus for february 22 2017 a vertical input of 2 mm was considered when only rainfall is captured during a given day the considered daily vertical input is equivalent to the recorded rainfall amount in mm when rainfall and snowmelt occur simultaneously a combined estimation of vertical inflows is calculated fig 3 shows the variation of the vertical inflows over 3 years november 1 2014 to december 8 2017 including the period covering the groundwater monitoring using the piezometers the piezographs of piezometer pz 18 are included as an example the snow water equivalent calculated from the daily thickness of lost snow can lead to uncertainty concerning the amount of vertical inflow because other natural processes such as sublimation could potentially contribute to reducing snow thickness on the ground surface without however contributing to the amount of water available for infiltration for future research projects in comparable areas experiencing snowfall as meteorological input it is strongly recommended to employ suitable methods for considering the sublimation effect 2 3 correlogram method 2 3 1 preliminary examination of time series data a prior step was undertaken to visualize the overall time lag between the vertical inflows and the water table response by plotting together the vertical inflows and the water table level time series data as those times series data have shown detectable frequency variations fig 3 as a first step their subsets were adjusted by smoothing out the original time series data using a simple 15 day moving average to decrease the detectable frequency variations secondly the adjusted time series data were normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing the result by the standard deviation fig 4 a shows the normalized vertical inflow and water table level data for piezometer pz 18 provided as an example fig 4b shows the period in which the two sets of normalized time series data have similar shapes and are separated by a distinct time period indicating that the water table level is responding to the vertical inflow after a certain time lag for example from fig 4b time lag 1 105 days 2 71 days and 3 128 days 4 months this last appears to be the longest time lag hence the correlogram process should consider a period for the vertical inflow events starting at least 4 months before the first day of the water table level monitoring a period of 5 months is considered in the present study see fig 5 a 2 3 2 cross correlation the cross correlation function can be used to determine the relationship between two time series when one of them is delayed in time with respect to the other in this case water table fluctuations occur after vertical inflows the cross correlation data processing produces a curve representing a continuous series of similarity evaluations in which the peak of this curve occurs at a time lag for which the two time series are best correlated in other words most similar box et al 1994 in the case of water table fluctuations relative to vertical inflow the cross correlation peak corresponds to the time lag defining the aquifer response time delbart et al 2014 mathematically the cross correlation function is solved as follows 1 r x y k c x y k σ x σ y where r xy k is the cross correlation function c xy k is the cross correlogram equation 2 σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the two x and y time series 2 c x y k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y where k is the time interval between the finite time series limited by n n is the length of the time series x t and y t are respectively the input and output time series x and y are respectively the input and output average time series 2 3 3 sliding cross correlation method the aquifer s response time was assessed using the sliding cross correlogram method delbart et al 2014 an illustration of the cross correlogram processing conducted in the present study is shown in fig 5 the method consists in selecting a period in the time series data for the water table level fixed window and determining the location of a similar period in the time series data for the vertical inflows sliding window the process of selecting a fixed window from the water table fluctuations time series data and a sliding window from the vertical inflows time series data does not imply that the water table level is impacting the vertical inflow according to a certain time lag processing starts by correlating the first fixed window with the first sliding window the first window starts at the beginning of the time series data fig 5a this processing aims to mathematically evaluate the degree of similarity between the two correlated windows this evaluation produces a correlation coefficient value the fixed window is maintained in position at the beginning of the time series data while sliding of the sliding window is gradually performed through the entire time series data according to a defined sliding time interval in the present study the sliding time interval is 20 days fig 5a to follow the gradual seasonal variation over time of the vertical inflows and water table fluctuations cross correlation provides a series of correlation coefficients that can be illustrated as a cross correlation function curve fig 5b wherein the peak occurs at a time lag for which the fixed and sliding window time series data are highly similar this time lag represents the aquifer response time a single cross correlation function curve may present several peaks however and as practiced by delbart et al 2014 only the first correlation peak is considered in the present study for a cross correlation to be acceptable the correlating process result must attain a significant degree of confidence 95 confidence level i e the correlation coefficient r k corresponding to the peak value must be superior to the standard error determined as 2 n 1 2 where n is the number of values in the data set diggle 1990 a similar significance test has been used in similar studies to determine the acceptability of cross correlation coefficients chiaudani et al 2017 delbart et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 lee et al 2006 in this study several cross correlation processing attempts were put to the test using different time windows 90 100 110 days etc the acceptable correlation coefficient values observed in the present study were obtained based on a time window of 160 days when the cross correlogram obtained with the first fixed window was completed fig 5b the same process was repeated with a second fixed window by sliding from the first fixed window according to a defined sliding time interval of 20 days fig 5a again this sliding time interval is considered to follow the gradual seasonal variation over time of the vertical inflows and water table fluctuations another cross correlation function curve is then produced fig 5c and so on see another example in fig 5d the cross correlation values were processed using a codified automated program implemented in matlab r2018a an example of the compiled results representing the aquifer response times art is shown in fig 5e in fig 5e for instance the art10 is assessed to be 74 days i e the vertical inflow event that occurred on february 16 2017 reached the water table on may 1 2017 after a travel time of 74 days through the subsurface may 1 2017 is the first day of the relative fixed window and the aquifer response time is considered to be representative of the first vertical inflow date this date is determined by subtracting the determined time lag the aquifer response time from the first day of the relative fixed window 3 results and discussions 3 1 vertical inflows and water table level time series the calculated vertical inflows representing the amount of water available for infiltration over the considered period june 2 2016 to december 8 2017 are shown in fig 6 a intense rainy events occurred during the summer and autumn seasons during which considerable vertical inflows were expected large amounts of water are also expected during the snowmelt period generally occurring in the mid spring season april when 4 5 months of accumulated snowpack is rapidly transformed into water available for infiltration fig 6a shows that only limited water amounts are available for infiltration during the period when snow covers the land during this period cold conditions greatly limit the recharge of the aquifer nonetheless occasional snow melt occurring as a response to occasional increases in temperature have generated minor amounts of water available for infiltration as can be observed in fig 6a the daily water table levels at the six monitored piezometers la 2 pz 1 pz 16 pz 18 pz 20 and pz 21 have shown different variation intervals table 1 significant seasonal variations of the water table level are distinguishable for all the monitored piezometers featuring periods showing high water table levels summer autumn seasons interspersed with periods of lower water table levels winter spring seasons all six monitored piezometers produced generally similar patterns suggesting that the study area captures precipitation according to a generally uniform distribution pattern however as can be seen in fig 6b and table 1 there are certain discernible differences in water table levels between the monitored piezometers such differences may be related to piezometer site characteristics including surface and bedrock leveling 3 2 assessed aquifer response time using a sliding window of 160 days and a sliding interval of 20 days over the entire water table level time series from november 2 2016 to december 8 2017 13 sliding window cross correlogram functions were generated for each monitored piezometer excepting pz 1 for the latter 12 rather than 13 sliding window cross correlogram functions were generated because at this piezometer measurements of the water table level were taken starting on november 9 2016 rather than on november 2 2016 as was the case for all the other piezometers the number of values in each data set n is 160 because the considered windows are for 160 days thus the calculated standard error value 2 n 1 2 is 0 16 through cross correlogram processing all the first peaks of the correlation coefficient r k are found to be significant with standard error values greater than 0 16 see illustrative examples in fig 5b c and d showing r k greater than 0 16 the aquifer response times obtained at the six monitored piezometers are presented in fig 7 which shows that each piezometer exhibited specific and different aquifer response times compared to the other piezometers the different aquifer response times obtained from the six monitored piezometers in the same aquifer indicate that the hydraulic behavior at each piezometer is related to specific highly localized site effects potentially controlled by aquifer characteristics that appear to be different from one location piezometer to another we investigated the available specific characteristics observed at the site of each of the piezometers thought to explain the observed differences in the aquifer response times table 2 the longest mean aquifer response time of 91 days observed for pz 16 is associated with the greatest mean thickness of the vadose zone at 13 28 m this observation illustrates the usual positive relationship between the aquifer response time and the thickness of the vadose zone i e when the thickness increases the response time increases lee et al 2006 however pz 1 presenting the thinnest mean vadose zone of 1 2 m table 2 exhibits a longer mean aquifer response time of 58 days compared to other piezometers that exhibit a relatively thick mean vadose zone such as pz 20 pz 21 and la 2 table 2 furthermore piezometer la 2 with a mean vadose zone 4 25 m thicker than that of pz 20 1 63 m shows a shorter mean aquifer response time 31 days compared to that of pz 20 41 days accordingly it can be deduced that the thickness of the vadose zone is not the main site characteristic influencing the observed differences in aquifer response times between the monitored piezometers of the study area when considering 4 of the 6 piezometers pz 16 pz 18 pz 1 and pz 21 table 2 a clear relationship is observed between the vertical inflow intensity and the aquifer response time when the vertical inflow intensity increases the aquifer response time decreases this observation could be related to the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity because the infiltrated water contributes soil volumetric water content above the water table leading to higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity however the vertical inflow intensity cannot exert a significant effect on the aquifer response time when the captured precipitation even if intense is totally or partially lost via possible runoff and or evapotranspiration for this reason the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which potentially controls the aquifer response time is mostly affected by the amount of the water available for infiltration recharge table 2 shows the mean local recharge rate at the monitored piezometer sites wherein the observed difference in recharge can be associated with site effects such as runoff process and topography chesnaux and stumpp 2018 labrecque et al 2020 when 5 monitored piezometers pz 16 pz 18 pz 1 pz 21 and pz 20 are considered in table 2 a direct proportional inverse relationship between the mean local recharge and the mean aquifer response time is observed when the mean local recharge increases the mean aquifer response time decreases hence the effect of recharge on the aquifer response time can be confirmed in this study the intense recharge combined with the higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity create a cumulative effect leading to shorter aquifer response times the potential effect of differences in subsurface material on the aquifer response times is not considered in the present study because all the monitored piezometers are surrounded by similar geological material mostly dominated by fine to medium sand with some traces of silt fig 2 the numerical modeling of groundwater flow through the vadose zone can be used to verify the assumptions related to the factors influencing the aquifer response time including the vertical distribution of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity but such numerical modeling would require an intense and continuous technical fieldwork monitoring data of the entire thickness of the vadose zone hopmans et al 2002 konikow 2011 vereecken et al 2016 vero et al 2017 which is outside the scope of the present study as observed in fig 7 the aquifer response time is generally variable over the study period for all the monitored piezometers in addition each piezometer shows different aquifer response times however the similarity in shape between the response time trends fig 7 suggests a generally similar influence of seasonal conditions pz 18 was the only piezometer monitored in this study to be located in an urbanized area the other monitored piezometers were located mainly within forested areas despite this pz 18 did not display distinctly different aquifer response times from the others the longest mean aquifer response time 91 days was observed for pz 16 while the shortest mean aquifer response time 31 days was found for la 2 it should be noted that urbanization may slow down the natural recharge of aquifers due to ground surface sealing by concrete and asphalt cover baier et al 2014 waterproofing due to ground sealing could affect the spatial and deep distribution of groundwater compounded by the conversion of precipitation into runoff rather than infiltration into the aquifer wakode et al 2018 although the area surrounding pz 18 is documented as urbanized it contains only the local airport of saint honoré with its short landing runways as well as several small scale associated buildings hence in effect the pz 18 sector is not densely urbanized and consequently the effect of urbanization on aquifer response times at pz 18 was found to be insignificant pz 1 shows a mean response time of 58 days over a vadose zone thickness of 1 2 m this means that at the pz 1 site infiltrating water takes approximately 1 year to travel 7 m through the vadose zone this result was confirmed in other studies by using stable isotope based method boumaiza et al 2020b and numerical modeling boumaiza et al 2020a at an investigated site located 100 m from pz 1 these findings support the outcomes of the present study in fig 7 the piezometers show a decreasing trend of the aquifer response times from longer to shorter over the winter period overall from november to march fig 7 before increasing from early spring to late summer overall from march to july fig 7 this means that the shorter aquifer responses times generally occurred during the winter season whereas the longer aquifer responses times occurred during the summer season aquifer response times were found to be shorter during periods of high water table levels and longer during periods of low water table levels larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 in this northern study area however the winter season is known to be associated with lower water table levels due to limited water amounts available for infiltration because of snowpack cover while the summer season is known to be associated with higher water table levels because of high amounts of infiltrated water originating from snowmelt episodes during the spring season and rain events occurring during the summer season the observation in the present study which is contrary to the norm the norm is shorter response times during the low depth of water table level period and longer response times during the high depth of water table level period is explained by the long duration of the aquifer response time in fact all the monitored piezometers reveal a relatively long mean aquifer response time with a mean magnitude ranging from 31 to 91 days table 2 aquifer response times up to 110 days have been measured in alluvial aquifers duvert et al 2015 whereas in fractured rock aquifers much shorter mean response times of 17 h have been determined by larocque et al 1998 let us compare the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock aquifers against that of alluvial aquifers in fractured rock aquifers experiencing shorter response times the captured rainfall quickly reaches the water table for this reason there is a general inverse relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level when one increases the other diminishes and vice versa however this inverse relationship cannot be rapidly observed in granular aquifers by reason of the inherent longer response times in the case of our granular aquifer to plot this inverse relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level the water table level should be considered at the time corresponding to the date of occurrence of the vertical inflow rather than the moment when the water table reacts to the vertical inflow event this is considered for linking the water table level to the moment corresponding to the date of occurrence of the vertical inflow for example the aquifer s first response time for pz 21 is determined to be 45 days fig 7 the water table level corresponding to this aquifer response time is the level that existed 45 days before the date of the beginning of the first fixed time window i e november 2 2016 we consider the first fixed time window because the given example is for the aquifer s first response time even though the available water table monitoring data does not cover the period before november 2 2016 we may nonetheless regard the yearly water table monitoring data 2016 2017 as representative of yearly fluctuations in the local water table the error associated with this assumption is expected to be minimal as seasonal climate characteristics have not experienced significant changes over the monitored year 2016 2017 or the previous year 2015 2016 as can be observed in fig 4a fig 8 shows the determined back tracked water table levels and the corresponding aquifer response times for all the monitored piezometers in which an inverse relationship between the water table level and the aquifer response time is generally observed when one increases the other diminishes and vice versa delbart et al 2014 found that fractured rock aquifer response times are shorter during the summer while larocque et al 1998 who also studied a fractured rock aquifer as well as lee et al 2006 who investigated a chalk aquifer soft fractured limestone found that aquifer response times are shorter in wet seasons than in dry seasons dry seasons are usually summer and autumn imagawa et al 2013 also assessed the aquifer response times in an alluvial aquifer according to three contrasting climate patterns they established that response times in dry conditions were at least twice longer than during wet periods of elevated rainfall larocque et al 1998 explained that the saturation of the aquifer s fracture network during the wet seasons allows a more rapid transmission of the water pulse compared to dry seasons where the aquifer s fracture network is unsaturated and consequently the water pulse is transmitted more slowly during the wet seasons lee et al 2006 observed a high water table level in the chalk aquifer they studied with a thinner vadose zone compared to dry seasons these authors established a direct positive proportional relationship between the aquifer response times and the thickness of the vadose zone a similar relationship was observed in the present study fig 8 shows the relationship between the aquifer response time and the water table level as the water table level increases the vadose zone diminishes inversely when the water table is lower an increase of the vadose zone is observed there is general agreement concerning the existence of a direct positive relationship between aquifer response times and vadose zone thickness i e shorter response times are observed when the water table level rises and the vadose zone decreases and vice versa fig 8 this observation is potentially related to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in fact a thinner vadose zone induces a shorter response time because a shallow water table yields a higher soil volumetric water content above it close to the soil saturated value leading to a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity inversely a thicker vadose zone causes a longer aquifer response time because a deeper water table yields lower soil saturated values leading to low values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the effect of vadose zone saturation on aquifer response times has been mentioned by delbart et al 2014 who showed that variations in response times are more likely due to variability of the transfer velocity within the vadose zone this transfer velocity depends on the saturation of the vadose zone s fracture network the saturation of the fractured rock aquifer was observed to be linked to higher rainfall intensity explaining the observed shorter response time of the aquifer for the alluvial system investigated in the present study fig 9 showing the intensity of vertical inflows and the corresponding response times of the aquifer at the monitored piezometers confirms the inverse relationship that exists between the intensity of the vertical inflows and the aquifer response times it was generally observed for the six monitored piezometers that when the vertical inflow increases the aquifer response times decreased fig 9 4 conclusions the case study research reported in the present study is based on the analysis of aquifer response time over an alluvial aquifer subject to variations of meteorological inputs over time analysis of correlations was conducted between the amount of vertical inflows available for infiltration and water table levels to determine the aquifer response time the present study demonstrates that the sliding cross correlogram approach provides a useful analysis for assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of the response times of an alluvial aquifer and for investigating the impact of aquifer characteristics on these response times the aquifer response times obtained at the six monitored piezometers showed that each piezometer exhibited specific and different aquifer response times compared to the other piezometers spatiotemporal variability of aquifer response times over the study area were observed with mean aquifer response times varying from 31 to 91 days this study highlights not only the seasonal variation of aquifer response times in the study area but it also indicates based on the observed differences in aquifer response times in different sectors of the same aquifer that it would be erroneous to assume that a single aquifer must always exhibit the same hydraulic behavior at its different studied locations the results obtained in the present study further highlight the known relationships between aquifer response times and site characteristics shorter aquifer response times are related to the rise of the water table level and subsequently to the variations over time of the vadose zone thickness a further observation is that aquifer response times are often observed to be linked to the vertical inflow intensity when vertical inflow intensity increases aquifer response times decrease this observation is potentially related to the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the infiltrated water contributes soil volumetric water content above the water table this process subsequently leads to higher soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the hydraulic conductivity is also impacted by the amount of water available for infiltration an inverse relationship is observed in the present study between the aquifer response times and the local recharge rate when the local recharge rate increases the aquifer response times decrease hence the effects of the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are combined with that of recharge a cumulative effect the geological history of the slsj region has given rise to several hydrogeological systems which produce abundant drinking water of high quality therefore the framework followed in the present study can be usefully applied to those aquifers which are under similar climate conditions assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of the aquifer response times and understanding the effect of aquifer properties on aquifer response times can support the decision of whether to explicitly consider the effect of site characteristics on the time lag between precipitation and water table fluctuations in the present study only a portion of the saint honoré aquifer was considered for investigation as the monitored piezometers are appropriately distributed over this portion however additional piezometers are recommended to be installed over the entire area of the saint honoré aquifer to gain a comprehensive understanding concerning the distribution of aquifer response times any future implementation of additional piezometers in the investigated aquifer should include a plan to sample continuous vertical sediment cores in order to estimate the hydraulic properties of the main geological units affecting the vertical water flow this would contribute valuable information to the study and interpretation of aquifer response times

et al 2015 in ethiopia gw has been used as the major source of water supply in the 1970s and its potential is estimated to be 40 billion m3 nationwide mengistu et al 2019 gw is the primary water source for drinking and irrigation purposes in the lake tana basin the northwestern part of ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2011 during recent years gw sources and their quality in ethiopia are influenced by climate change setegn et al 2011 population growth mengistu et al 2019 the rapid urban expansion and agricultural activities kawo and karuppannan 2018 a study by moges et al 2016 figured out that abundant agricultural activities such as use of fertilizers pesticides and herbicides result in non point groundwater contamination sources in northwestern ethiopia anthropogenic contamination of the aquifers could be through accidental spills surface leaching waste ponds septic systems road salting road runoff to recharge basins and landfill leachate mays and scheibe 2018 once the gw is contaminated it is difficult costly and complex to revert back its quality by stopping the pollutants from the source therefore its quality should be regularly monitored to avoid it getting contaminated verma et al 2020 several studies indicated that poorly managed agricultural operations could contaminate surface and groundwater with nutrients and pesticides khatri and tyagi 2015 barilari et al 2020 foster et al 2018 identified as regular use of different types of products in agriculture causing dispersion within the ground through runoff and drainage this may result in

urbanization increasing industrial sectors extensive use of fertilizers in irrigation areas insufficient sanitation systems urban infrastructure human and animal waste lead to groundwater pollution adimalla and qian 2021 puckett et al 2011 have also revealed that the nitrate concentrations in groundwater have increased from 2 mg l in the early 1940s to about 15 mg l in 2003 consistent with fertilizer use trends in the united states in ethiopia the intensification of agriculture has led to the increased use of uncontrolled fertilizers and manure during the last decades thus groundwater especially shallow aquifers are susceptible to pollution quickly there are several approaches for determining gw suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes arumugam and elangovan 2009 e g regional flux based risk assessment approach jamin et al 2012 multiple isotope approach hosono et al 2011 triad like approach crévecoeur et al 2011 moreover conventional techniques viz trilinear plots and statistical techniques are widely accepted methods to determine water quality kumar et al 2019 however the water quality index wqi has been the most effective tool to monitor surface and gw pollution nong et al 2020 wqi use an equation to transform a large set of water quality data into a single number by generating a score that describes water quality it gives information on a rating scale from zero to a hundred to represent the overall water quality to indicate the suitability of water for human consumption štambuk giljanović 1999 recently the suitability of gw is evaluated by the integrating water quality index wqi with the geographic information systems gis kawo and karuppannan 2018 the exsisting research work in the study mostly focuses on gw potential i e quantity

possible health risk at northwestern border of lake tana located in dembiya district of northwest ethiopia this study attempts to fill this gap according to mengistu et al 2019 data on gw quality in ethiopia is very limited therefore the present study provided a significant opportunity to advance the understanding of spatial variability of gw quality in the study area consequently this study aims to evaluate groundwater quality by using the water quality index wqi in northwestern ethiopia to contribute threefold firstly it contributes to understanding gw contamination based on physicochemical parameters major anions and cations data in the region thus providing policy input secondly the assessment of shallow gw quality status using wqi for its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes is beneficial because most of the population resides in rural areas and depends on gw sources thirdly spatial variation of wqi was interpolated in a gis environment to identify more polluted

acidic strength indicating the acidicity or alkalinity of the groundwater the study area s groundwater is slightly alkaline as its ph is in the 6 99 8 40 range with a mean value of 7 36 fig 2a this study revealed that all samples ph values are within the specified guideline value range 6 5 8 5 for drinking water who 2011 as shown in table 2 ec values in the sampled water ranges from 0 801 to 4 20 ds l with an average value of 2 282 ds l the anthropogenic intervention and the mineralogical process could be the reason for variation in electrical conductivity kant et al 2018 3 1 2 total dissolved substance tds and total hardness th total dissolved solids tds exemplify underground water salt concentration behaviour water sources having a tds value of more than 500 mg l is considered inappropriate for drinking water supplies who 2011 however up to 1000 mg l tds is permitted in developing countries farid et al 2012 as a result shown in fig 2b and table 2 the tds ranges between 513 and 2778 mg l in the study area this variation is due to the influence of anthropogenic sources such as domestic sewage and agricultural activities the total hardness th values range from 350 to 7400 mg l with a mean value of 3074 5 mg l table 2 the maximum permissible limit of th for drinking purposes is 300 mg l as per the who guideline drinking water exceeding this limit is considered very hard who 2011 approximately 96 7 of samples exceed the 500 mg l maximum allowable levels 3 1 3 major cations the presence of calcium and magnesium ions in groundwater lead to its hardness high hardness levels tend to promote scales in water systems due to the precipitation of ca mg salts antony et al 2011 the cation ca2 na k and mg2 concentration ranges between 0 5 and 135 16 to 129 75 1 72 to 8 86 and 1 14 mg l with a mean concentration value of 54 55 73 77 4 99 and 6 94 respectively fig 3 a as per the who 2011 guidelines the maximum concentration of calcium ions greater than the acceptable limit 75 mg l can cause abdominal diseases and is unsuitable for domestic purposes as it causes encrustation and scaling 13 3 of groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible limit of who standards for hardness meanwhile all the samples have sodium value within the who 2011 permissible limit table 3 in gw samples mg2 concentration ranges between 1 and 14 with the mean value of 6 94 mg l which is less than the recommendable limit fig 3a illustrates the minimum and maximum potassium concentration k 1 72 and 8 86 mg l respectively the value of potassium concentration in all the samples exceeds the who i e 1 5 mg l 3 1 4 major anions no3 are commonly found naturally in drinking water and wastewater generated by natural vegetation degradation released by chemical fertilizers used in intensive farming and nitrogen compounds in sewage and industrial waste okafor and ogbonna 2003 among the anions the concentration of po43 no3 hco3 and cl ranges between 4 7 and 17 2 mg l 0 6 20 2 mg l and 3 47 11 01 mg l 0 3 28 06 mg lwith mean concentration values of 10 59 7 21 6 6 and 4 27 mg l respectively fig 3b the value of hco3 and cl concentration in all the groundwater in samples are lower than the who recommended limit po4 concentration in the study area is much lower than the who recommended limit 250 mg l thus the value of po4 concentration in all the groundwater in samples is under the who recommended limit however 33 3 of the samples have no3 concentration is within the who recommended limit as shown in table 3 the values of physicochemical parameters presented in table 2 were compared to the corresponding limits set in the ethiopian drinking water standard table 3 ces 2013 who 2011 sodium magnesium iron and phosphate concentrations and ph values of groundwater samples in the study area are below the recommended limits however total hardness th tds calcium nitrate and potassium concentration in only 3 3 40 86 33 3 and 0 respectively of samples are within the recommended limit hence most of the wells are not suitable for drinking purposes the compulsory ethiopian standard for drinking water specification as shown in table 3 outlines the physical chemical and bacteriological specifications for drinking water ces 2013 this limit was established by ces 2013 in collaboration with who 2015 and the world bank 2015 3 2 hydrochemical facies hydrogeochemical facies are genetically distinct zones with major cation and anion concentration groups that help understand and detect distinct water compositions in mixed assemblages it can be determined by deciphering rock water interactions geology especially lithology aquifer matrix and contamination sources lima et al 2020 based on piper 1944 diagram the water types have been classified mainly as type i ca mg hco3 type ii mg ca cl hco3 type iii na k cl so4 and type iv na k hco3 fig 4 a from the result the dominant 43 of samples type is na k cl so4 the next major water type identified was ca mg hco3 13 33 the schoeller diagram shows the absolute value of each major ion and identifies the highest concentrations accordingly fig 4b ca2 is the dominant cation while the dominant anion is hco3 the gibbs diagram is employed to investigate the impact of hydrogeochemical processes on groundwater geochemistry such as precipitation rock water interaction and evaporation gibbs 1970 as shown in fig 5 the gibbs plot indicated that the source of cations and anions in groundwater is mostly rock water interaction and evaporation crystallization this clearly indicates that the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by the weathering of rocks and evaporation sedimentation 3 3 drinking water quality index dwqi the most effective technique for evaluating surface and groundwater pollution is the water quality index wqi that can be used to plan measures to improve water quality global environment monitoring system gems 2007 as in previous studies viz gebrehiwot et al 2011 nag and das 2017 abbasnia et al 2019 each parameter has been weighted wi according to its relative importance for overall water quality the relative weight wi was computed using the equation eq 1 due to their primary significance in water quality evaluation parameters such as total dissolved solids sulphate and nitrate have been given a maximum weight of 5 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 other parameters viz calcium magnesium sodium and potassium have been assigned weight between 1 and 3 considering their effect on health and potability value in the overall dwqi who 2006 table 4 water quality rating qi were estimated using the standard who water parameters in mg l prescribed by the ethiopian water quality standard and the sub water quality index sli based on eq 2 the result led the drinking water quality index dwqi ranges from 46 to 67 5 see appendix table 1 thus almost all physicochemical parameters are within the who recommended limits for drinking water quality who 2011 broadly used gw quality assessment techniques include 1 geostatistical techniques such as krings e g ghazaryan et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 semivaiogram e g mabit and bernard 2007 and 2 non geostatistical techniques such as inverse distance interpolation idw e g fenta et al 2020 singh et al 2015 and radial basis functions rbf e g burrough and mcdonnell 1998 singh and verma 2019 this study employed ordinary kring s techniques in a gis environment to decipher the spatial variability of groundwater quality the computed wqi values are used to classify water based on its quality into these categories excellent wqi

important in determining its efficiency for irrigation are 1 tds 2 relative na concentration w r t other major cations magnesium calcium etc many dissolved salts harm plant health and reduce crop productivity parihar et al 2015 the suitability of gw for irrigation tds and relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium and magnesium and the relative proportion of sodium to calcium jasrotia et al 2018 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 ions are found in a carbonate system of chemical equilibrium associated with water ph and hardness when ph is more than 8 2 co3 and hco3 predominate dinak et al 2015 dissolution of carbonate rocks e g limestone dolomite magnesites produces co3 and hco3 ions which yields co3 precipitation nikanorov and brazhnikova 2014 the overall irrigation water quality has evaluated using iwqi viz sar mar ssp rsc pi na and kr see appendix table 2 the relative proportion of sodium in gw to other cations has been commonly described as the major cations sodium percentage as idw results shown in fig 7 a the study area s spatial variability per cent na varied from 27 to 92 with a mean value of 73 water with conductivity lower than 0 75 ds l is generally appropriate for irrigation however water with conductivity in a range of 0 75 2 25 ds l is commonly used which acids in sufficient crop growth is under favorable drainage conditions rao et al 2019 sodium adsorption ratio sar used to determine the relative activity of sodium ions in soil ion exchange is a measure of the water s suitability for irrigation with relation to the salinity sodium hazard tiwari et al 2019 in the study area sar ranged from 0 25 to 12 75 with a mean value of 6 62 the highest value was found in the southern and northern parts of east dembiya and the lowest value is in the central part of the study area fig 7b soluble sodium percentage ssp in irrigation is exchanged in clay particles by ions mg2 and ca2 this exchange process reduces soil permeability and induces low internal drainage and soil hardening which adversely affects soil quality and seedling growth foster et al 2018 the estimated value of ssp varies from 25 to 93 throughout the study area fig 8 d in the study area the ec ds l ranged from 0 801 to 4 340 with a mean value of 2 971 the lowest and highest value is observed in the northern and southern part of eastern dembiya fig 8c respectively calcium and magnesium in most waters sustain a balance represented by a ratio namely magnesium hazard index mh katyal 2011 the lowest 0 08 and highest 0 91 value of mh are observed in the northern and southern part of eastern dembiya fig 9 e respectively the kelly s ratio kr of unity or 1 is indicative of the good quality water for irrigation whereas kr 1 is suggestive of unsuitability for agricultural purposes due to alkali hazards kelly 1940 as illustrated in fig 9f the highest kr is found in the northern part of the study area whereas the lowest value 1 is observed in the central and southern parts grading of groundwater samples based on water quality indices were employed to evaluate gw quality for irrigation purposes dinka et al 2015 table 5 show that suitability as of the total samples of water for irrigation based on these indices as follows the ec 46 7 sar 97 kr 53 ssp 53 3 mh 100 and na 50 however ec 44 3 of the total samples values exceeded the maximum recommended limit of 2 25 ds l for irrigation purposes generally based on total hardness sar rsc pi ssp and mh values the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes 4 conclusion and implications in the present study gw quality and its suitability for irrigation and drinking purposes were evaluated by using various physicochemical and water quality parameters shallow wells are crucial for improving access to and the quality of water especially in rural areas as prioritized in sustainable development goals the results were compared with compulsory ethiopian standards for drinking purposes and the who recommendations the dwqi of the dembiya district of ethiopia range from 46 to 67 5 i e it is suitable for drinking water however wqi results from shallow wells located in the wetland area near lake tana are unsuitable for drinking this due to high tds th no3 and ec which exceed the maximum permissible limit most of the physicochemical parameters for groundwater samples of the study area were within the who recommended limits for irrigation purpose the results indicated that suitability of water based on the quality indices are as follows as of total samples ec 47 sar 97 kr 53 ssp 53 3 mh 100 and na 50 however ec 50 of the samples have values exceeding the maximum recommended limit of 2 25 ds l rao et al 2017 for irrigation purposes based on the iwqi most groundwater samples of the study area are within the safe limit except for ec the classification of irrigation water based on salinity and sodium levels shows low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation thus iwqi shows that most gw wells are suitable for irrigation most gw samples have a water quality index indicating a moderately suitable water class for drinking purposes for water quality management wqi is one of the most effective ways to communicate water quality trends to the community government policymakers r d academia and the scientific

11923,groundwater gw which contributes to the quality of life economic development improved food security and rural society stability is essential to improving rural water supply access and quality given its multi purpose uses gw quality has been degraded and polluted by global climate change population growth human activities land use land cover lulc transition gw quality therefore should be evaluated and tracked continuously to secure its multi purpose uses herein this study aims to assess the shallow gw standard using water quality indices wqi and gis techniques in the northwestern

water use for being suitable for irrigation than surface water siebert et al 2010 access to sufficient and safe water is fundamental to human development who 2016 muzenda et al 2019 as reported by the world health organization who 2016 an estimated 663 million people worldwide primarily those living in developing nations depend upon unsafe or faecal contaminated water for drinking and cooking purpose in coastal alluvial aquifer gw quality is significantly deteriorated by the uncontrolled discharge of urban wastewaters intensive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture and overexploitation of gw aladejana et al 2020 over exploitation of gw has degraded gw quality through the intrusion of saline water flow reduction in streams wetlands and springs in india excessive use of gw resource has resulted in water level depletion shortage in water supply worsening groundwater quality e g sidhu et al 2021 saltwater intrusion threatens the quality of coastal freshwater aquifers bhadra et al 2020 gw contamination is a severe problem and challenge in many countries however it is still less polluted and cleaner than surface water adimalla et al 2020 some of the causes of gw quality decline include 1 industrialization zacchaeus et al 2020 2 population growth bate et al 2018 3 urbanization masindi and abiye 2018 4 agricultural activities selvakumar et al 2017 5 land use land cover lulc changes wu et al 2020 and 6 global climate change in arid and semi arid regions he and wu 2019 natural and anthropogenic contaminants are increasingly deteriorating their quality wu and sun 2016 gw quality depends on the geological formation of underlying strata the aquifer size and the sampling location duarte et al 2015 it is controlled by local and regional geology water rock interactions dilution due to precipitation zaidi et al 2015 land disposal of solid waste is the groundwater contamination source of most current concerns in many developing countries srivastava et al 2015 in ethiopia gw has been used as the major source of water supply in the 1970s and its potential is estimated to be 40 billion m3 nationwide mengistu et al 2019 gw is the primary water source for drinking and irrigation purposes in the lake tana basin the northwestern part of ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2011 during recent years gw sources and their quality in ethiopia are influenced by climate change setegn et al 2011 population growth mengistu et al 2019 the rapid urban expansion and agricultural activities kawo and karuppannan 2018 a study by moges et al 2016 figured out that abundant agricultural activities such as use of fertilizers pesticides and herbicides result in non point groundwater contamination sources in northwestern ethiopia anthropogenic contamination of the aquifers could be through accidental spills surface leaching waste ponds septic systems road salting road runoff to recharge basins and landfill leachate mays and scheibe 2018 once the gw is contaminated it is difficult costly and complex to revert back its quality by stopping the pollutants from the source therefore its quality should be regularly monitored to avoid it getting contaminated verma et al 2020 several studies indicated that poorly managed agricultural operations could contaminate surface and groundwater with nutrients and pesticides khatri and tyagi 2015 barilari et al 2020 foster et al 2018 identified as regular use of different types of products in agriculture causing dispersion within the ground through runoff and drainage this may result in residues reaching gw jia et al 2019 river waters zhu et al 2019 and also coastal waters and lakes nie et al 2018 the nitrate and sulphate concentrations of increase significantly due to large amounts of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture pesticides are the most commonly detected organic contaminants in rural gw jiang et al 2008 toolabi et al 2021 rapid development population growth urbanization increasing industrial sectors extensive use of fertilizers in irrigation areas insufficient sanitation systems urban infrastructure human and animal waste lead to groundwater pollution adimalla and qian 2021 puckett et al 2011 have also revealed that the nitrate concentrations in groundwater have increased from 2 mg l in the early 1940s to about 15 mg l in 2003 consistent with fertilizer use trends in the united states in ethiopia the intensification of agriculture has led to the increased use of uncontrolled fertilizers and manure during the last decades thus groundwater especially shallow aquifers are susceptible to pollution quickly there are several approaches for determining gw suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes arumugam and elangovan 2009 e g regional flux based risk assessment approach jamin et al 2012 multiple isotope approach hosono et al 2011 triad like approach crévecoeur et al 2011 moreover conventional techniques viz trilinear plots and statistical techniques are widely accepted methods to determine water quality kumar et al 2019 however the water quality index wqi has been the most effective tool to monitor surface and gw pollution nong et al 2020 wqi use an equation to transform a large set of water quality data into a single number by generating a score that describes water quality it gives information on a rating scale from zero to a hundred to represent the overall water quality to indicate the suitability of water for human consumption štambuk giljanović 1999 recently the suitability of gw is evaluated by the integrating water quality index wqi with the geographic information systems gis kawo and karuppannan 2018 the exsisting research work in the study mostly focuses on gw potential i e quantity rather than quality e g spatial assessment of gw potential in lake tana basin of ethiopia e g kindie et al 2018 currently there is no comprehensive assessment of shallow groundwater quality and its possible health risk at northwestern border of lake tana located in dembiya district of northwest ethiopia this study attempts to fill this gap according to mengistu et al 2019 data on gw quality in ethiopia is very limited therefore the present study provided a significant opportunity to advance the understanding of spatial variability of gw quality in the study area consequently this study aims to evaluate groundwater quality by using the water quality index wqi in northwestern ethiopia to contribute threefold firstly it contributes to understanding gw contamination based on physicochemical parameters major anions and cations data in the region thus providing policy input secondly the assessment of shallow gw quality status using wqi for its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes is beneficial because most of the population resides in rural areas and depends on gw sources thirdly spatial variation of wqi was interpolated in a gis environment to identify more polluted areas for future emphasis 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted to evaluate shallow groundwater quality from 21 selected kebeles the smallest administrative unit in ethiopia

temperature specific conductance dissolved oxygen and ph were measured in situ using a photometer a photometer is a portable device to analyze water quality using spectrophotometry and ion selective electrode e g fenta et al 2020 2 3 method of analysis 2 3 1 suitability analysis of groundwater quality for drinking purpose the result obtained from the laboratory was compared with who guidelines and compulsory ethiopian standard ces for drinking water specification bivariate plots piper diagram piper 1944 gibb plots gibbs 1970 were used for hydrochemical classification and understanding groundwater evolution lima et al 2020 the dominations were identified using schoeller diagram schoeller 1955 moreover gw suitability for drinking purposes was analyzed using the drinking water quality index dwqi selvam et al 2014 the following steps were employed to compute dwqi adimalla and qian 2019 1 relative weight wi of the parameters was computed using equation eq 1 1 w i j k s i j k 1 j 1 n

suitability analysis of gw for irrigation comprehensive water quality analysis for its suitability for irrigation and evaluating potential negative impacts of contaminated water on crop production is important to mitigate groundwater pollution problems and enhance healthy crop production physicochemical and biological studies on groundwater highlight the dominance of its geogenic contamination through leaching of the contaminants from aquifer matrix rocks and sediments solangi et al 2019 the suitability of water for irrigation can be assessed by calculating various irrigation water quality

results and discussion 3 1 variation of gw quality parameters 3 1 1 ph and electrical conductivity ec fig 2 illustrates ph and electrical conductivity ec in the study area the ph indicates water s acidic strength indicating the acidicity or alkalinity of the groundwater the study area s groundwater is slightly alkaline as its ph is in the 6 99 8 40 range with a mean value of 7 36 fig 2a this study revealed that all samples ph values are within the specified guideline value range 6 5 8 5 for drinking water who 2011 as shown in table 2 ec values in the sampled water ranges from 0 801 to 4 20 ds l with an average value of 2 282 ds l the anthropogenic intervention and the mineralogical process could be the reason for variation in electrical conductivity kant et al 2018 3 1 2 total dissolved substance tds and total hardness th total dissolved solids tds exemplify underground water salt concentration behaviour water sources having a tds value of more than 500 mg l is considered inappropriate for drinking water supplies who 2011 however up to 1000 mg l tds is permitted in developing countries farid et al 2012 as a result shown in fig 2b and table 2 the tds ranges between 513 and 2778 mg l in the study area this variation is due to the influence of anthropogenic sources such as domestic sewage and agricultural activities the total hardness th values range from 350 to 7400 mg l with a mean value of 3074 5 mg l table 2 the maximum permissible limit of th for drinking purposes is 300 mg l as per the who guideline drinking water exceeding this limit is considered very hard who 2011 approximately 96 7 of samples exceed the 500 mg l maximum allowable levels 3 1 3 major cations the presence of calcium and magnesium ions in groundwater lead to its hardness high hardness levels tend to promote scales in water systems due to the precipitation of ca mg salts antony et al 2011 the cation ca2 na k and mg2 concentration ranges between 0 5 and 135 16 to 129 75 1 72 to 8 86 and 1 14 mg l with a mean concentration value of 54 55 73 77 4 99 and 6 94 respectively fig 3 a as per the who 2011 guidelines the maximum concentration of calcium ions greater than the acceptable limit 75 mg l can cause abdominal diseases and is unsuitable for domestic purposes as it causes encrustation and scaling 13 3 of groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible limit of who standards for hardness meanwhile all the samples have sodium value within the who 2011 permissible limit table 3 in gw samples mg2 concentration ranges between 1 and 14 with the mean value of 6 94 mg l which is less than the recommendable limit fig 3a illustrates the minimum and maximum potassium concentration k 1 72 and 8 86 mg l respectively the value of potassium concentration in all the samples exceeds the who i e 1 5 mg l 3 1 4 major anions no3 are commonly found naturally in drinking water and wastewater generated by natural vegetation degradation released by chemical fertilizers used in intensive farming and nitrogen compounds in sewage and industrial waste okafor and ogbonna 2003 among the anions the concentration of po43 no3 hco3 and cl ranges between 4 7 and 17 2 mg l 0 6 20 2 mg l and 3 47 11 01 mg l 0 3 28 06 mg lwith mean concentration values of 10 59 7 21 6 6 and 4 27 mg l respectively fig 3b the value of hco3 and cl concentration in all the groundwater in samples are lower than the who recommended limit po4 concentration in the study area is much lower than the who recommended limit 250 mg l thus the value of po4 concentration in all the groundwater in samples is under the who recommended limit however 33 3 of the samples have no3 concentration is within the who recommended limit as shown in table 3 the values of physicochemical parameters presented in table 2 were compared to the corresponding limits set in the ethiopian drinking water standard table 3 ces 2013 who 2011 sodium magnesium iron and phosphate concentrations and ph values of groundwater samples in the study area are below the recommended limits however total hardness th tds calcium nitrate and potassium concentration in only 3 3 40 86 33 3 and 0 respectively of samples are within the recommended limit hence most of the wells are not suitable for drinking purposes the compulsory ethiopian standard for drinking water specification as shown in table 3 outlines the physical chemical and bacteriological specifications for drinking water ces 2013 this limit was established by ces 2013 in collaboration with who 2015 and the world bank 2015 3 2 hydrochemical facies hydrogeochemical facies are genetically distinct zones with major cation and anion concentration groups that help understand and detect distinct water compositions in mixed assemblages it can be determined by deciphering rock water interactions geology especially lithology aquifer matrix and contamination sources lima et al 2020 based on piper 1944 diagram the water types have been classified mainly as type i ca mg hco3 type ii mg ca cl hco3 type iii na k cl so4 and type iv na k hco3 fig 4 a from the result the dominant 43 of samples type is na k cl so4 the next major water type identified was ca mg hco3 13 33 the schoeller diagram shows the absolute value of each major ion and identifies the highest concentrations accordingly fig 4b ca2 is the dominant cation while the dominant anion is hco3 the gibbs diagram is employed to investigate the impact of hydrogeochemical processes on groundwater geochemistry such as precipitation rock water interaction and evaporation gibbs 1970 as shown in fig 5 the gibbs plot indicated that the source of cations and anions in groundwater is mostly rock water interaction and evaporation crystallization this clearly indicates that the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by the weathering of rocks and evaporation sedimentation 3 3 drinking water quality index dwqi the most effective technique for evaluating surface and groundwater pollution is the water quality index wqi that can be used to plan measures to improve water quality global environment monitoring system gems 2007 as in previous studies viz gebrehiwot et al 2011 nag and das 2017 abbasnia et al 2019 each parameter has been weighted wi according to its relative importance for overall water quality the relative weight wi was computed using the equation eq 1 due to their primary significance in water quality evaluation parameters such as total dissolved solids sulphate and nitrate have been given a maximum weight of 5 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 other parameters viz calcium magnesium sodium and potassium have been assigned weight between 1 and 3 considering their effect on health and potability value in the overall dwqi who 2006 table 4 water quality rating qi were estimated using the standard who water parameters in mg l prescribed by the ethiopian water quality standard and the sub water quality index sli based on eq 2 the result led the drinking water quality index dwqi ranges from 46 to 67 5 see appendix table 1 thus almost all physicochemical parameters are within the who recommended limits for drinking water quality who 2011 broadly used gw quality assessment techniques include 1 geostatistical techniques such as krings e g ghazaryan et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 semivaiogram e g mabit and bernard 2007 and 2 non geostatistical techniques such as inverse distance interpolation idw e g fenta et al 2020 singh et al 2015 and radial basis functions rbf e g burrough and mcdonnell 1998 singh and verma 2019 this study employed ordinary kring s techniques in a gis environment to decipher the spatial variability of groundwater quality the computed wqi values are used to classify water based on its quality into these categories excellent wqi 25 good wqi 25 50 poor wqi 50 75 very poor water wqi 75 100 and unsuitable for drinking wqi 100 brown et al 1972 muzendaa et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 the dwqi graded water was very good 22 good 38 8 and poor unsafe 39 2 for drinking purposes 3 4 spatial variability of iwqi developing and sustaining an irrigation water supply system require to salt and alkalinity control the water qualities important in determining its efficiency for irrigation are 1 tds 2 relative na concentration w r t other major cations magnesium calcium etc many dissolved salts harm plant health and reduce crop productivity parihar et al 2015 the suitability of gw for irrigation tds and relative proportion of bicarbonate to calcium and magnesium and the relative proportion of sodium to calcium jasrotia et al 2018 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 ions are found in a carbonate system of chemical equilibrium associated with water ph and hardness when ph is more than 8 2 co3 and hco3 predominate dinak et al 2015 dissolution of carbonate rocks e g limestone dolomite magnesites produces co3 and hco3 ions which yields co3 precipitation nikanorov and brazhnikova 2014 the overall irrigation water quality has evaluated using iwqi viz sar mar ssp rsc pi na and kr see appendix table 2 the relative proportion of sodium in gw to other cations has been commonly described as the major cations sodium percentage as idw results shown in fig 7 a the study area s spatial variability per cent na varied from 27 to 92 with a mean value of 73 water with conductivity lower than 0 75 ds l is generally appropriate for irrigation however water with conductivity in a range of 0 75 2 25 ds l is commonly used which acids in sufficient crop growth is under favorable drainage conditions rao et al 2019 sodium adsorption ratio sar used to determine the relative activity of sodium ions in soil ion exchange is a measure of the water s suitability for irrigation with relation to the salinity sodium hazard tiwari et al 2019 in the study area sar ranged from 0 25 to 12 75 with a mean value of 6 62 the highest value was found in the southern and northern parts of east dembiya and the lowest value is in the central part of the study area fig 7b soluble sodium percentage ssp in irrigation is exchanged in clay particles by ions mg2 and ca2 this exchange process reduces soil permeability and induces low internal drainage and soil hardening which adversely affects soil quality and seedling growth foster et al 2018 the estimated value of ssp varies from 25 to 93 throughout the study area fig 8 d in the study area the ec ds l ranged from 0 801 to 4 340 with a mean value of 2 971 the lowest and highest value is observed in the northern and southern part of eastern dembiya fig 8c respectively calcium and magnesium in most waters sustain a balance represented by a ratio namely magnesium hazard index mh katyal 2011 the lowest 0 08 and highest 0 91 value of mh are observed in the northern and southern part of eastern dembiya fig 9 e respectively the kelly s ratio kr of unity or 1 is indicative of the good quality water for irrigation whereas kr 1 is suggestive of unsuitability for agricultural purposes due to alkali hazards kelly 1940 as illustrated in fig 9f the highest kr is found in the northern part of the study area whereas the lowest value 1 is observed in the central and southern parts grading of groundwater samples based on water quality indices were employed to evaluate gw quality for irrigation purposes dinka et al 2015 table 5 show that suitability as of the total samples of water for irrigation based on these indices as follows the ec 46 7 sar 97 kr 53 ssp 53 3 mh 100 and na 50 however ec 44 3 of the total samples values exceeded the maximum recommended limit of 2 25 ds l for irrigation purposes generally based on total hardness sar rsc pi ssp and mh values the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes 4 conclusion and implications in the present study gw quality and its suitability for irrigation and drinking purposes were evaluated by using various physicochemical and water quality parameters shallow wells are crucial for improving access to and the quality of water especially in rural areas as prioritized in sustainable development goals the results were compared with compulsory ethiopian standards for drinking purposes and the who recommendations the dwqi of the dembiya district of ethiopia range from 46 to 67 5 i e it is suitable for drinking water however wqi results from shallow wells located in the wetland area near lake tana are unsuitable for drinking this due to high tds th no3 and ec which exceed the maximum permissible limit most of the physicochemical parameters for groundwater samples of the study area were within the who recommended limits for irrigation purpose the results indicated that suitability of water based on the quality indices are as follows as of total samples ec 47 sar 97 kr 53 ssp 53 3 mh 100 and na 50 however ec 50 of the samples have values exceeding the maximum recommended limit of 2 25 ds l rao et al 2017 for irrigation purposes based on the iwqi most groundwater samples of the study area are within the safe limit except for ec the classification of irrigation water based on salinity and sodium levels shows low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity hazard indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation thus iwqi shows that most gw wells are suitable for irrigation most gw samples have a water quality index indicating a moderately suitable water class for drinking purposes for water quality management wqi is one of the most effective ways to communicate water quality trends to the community government policymakers r d academia and the scientific

11924,due to spatial unevenness in rainfall groundwater dependency for irrigation has increased exponentially which poses a challenge for its sustainability hence the long term behaviour of groundwater level gwl fluctuations needs to be understood for better management of water resources and formulating a new action plan due to semi arid climatic condition most of the agricultural lands in malwa region of punjab in india depend on the groundwater for irrigation the present study focuses on multi decadal trend estimation and spatio temporal variations of gwl changes using geostatistics and analyzing the groundwater fluctuations using the standardized depth to water level index sdwli method over the malwa region for this study gwl data for 90 observation wells piezometers for 21 years 1997 2018 were analyzed the wells were classified into different clusters according to the fluctuation rate using hierarchical cluster analysis the trend for each well s gwl changes was analyzed with the modified mann kendall mmk test and sen s slope the trend analysis results show that most of the wells over the malwa region possess a significantly declining trend of gwl during 1997 2018 the spatio temporal variation maps reveal that more than 30 of tubewells in the eastern part of the study region have seen an average depletion rate of about 40 cm year in both seasons pre and post monsoon in contrast gwl in southwestern part of the malwa region shows an evident rise in water level during the last two decades this rising water level causes severe waterlogging problems during the monsoon period over 21 years we observed that more than 20 of wells had increased gwl in the southwestern part of the malwa region the present study s result raises concern about groundwater resources future in the highly groundwater dependent malwa region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater trend analysis geostatistics hierarchical cluster analysis punjab 1 introduction groundwater constitutes an integral part of global water resources it is used as the primary resource in different regions worldwide for drinking domestic agricultural and industrial purposes in the recent past the population growth and overexploitation of groundwater resources have led to rapidly declining groundwater levels aggarwal et al 2009 the aquifers are under tremendous pressure and are vulnerable to depletion particularly in semi arid and arid regions where the natural recharge is not adequate to balance the withdrawals vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 this is further aggravated by uncertain and uneven rainfall patterns causing overdependence of agriculture on groundwater resources the groundwater fluctuations result mostly due to withdrawal from bore wells less recharge compared to discharge water uptake by the vegetation and periodic moisture disparity rajaveni et al 2014 various groundwater related problems viz groundwater depletion dhillon et al 2019 groundwater quality deterioration lombard et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021a singh et al 2019 land subsidence and hydrological droughts arise due to the declining trend of groundwater levels anand et al 2020 therefore groundwater level quantification and prediction of the trend can be pivotal for sustainable water management primarily due to increasing climatic uncertainties though there is an urgent need to study the impact of groundwater exploitation under climate change very few studies exist in the literature malakar et al 2021 mostly due to the lack of large spatial and temporal datasets india is the largest groundwater consumer globally with an estimated usage of about 251 km3 yr unesco 2012 the demand of water for irrigation in india will rise up to 56 by the year 2050 i e 1072 bcm as indicated by the ministry of water resources baweja et al 2017 cwc 2000 in the past few decades most northern states in india have experienced a severe depletion of groundwater due to over exploitation of groundwater for various purposes cgwb 2016 punjab a state located in north india is amongst the leading agricultural producers of the country more than 85 of land under agriculture in the state depends on groundwater for irrigation gupta 2011 sidhu et al 2021 although canals are also available as irrigation sources they are insufficient to cater to the agricultural water demands during the last five decades the average rice productivity has increased from 1 8 to 6 2 t ha over the same period the irrigated area also increased from 71 to 99 9 and the cropping intensity has increased from 104 to 204 dhillon et al 2019 scott and shah 2004 the exponential growth in agricultural production has come at the cost of deterioration of natural resources especially groundwater depletion the key reason for the depletion of groundwater levels in punjab is the rapid rise in the number of tubewells borewells and increased rice cultivation the number of tubewells in the state has increased from 0 8 to 1 47 million from 1990 to 2018 statistical abstract 2019 the problem of groundwater depletion is not isolated to punjab instead it is an alarming issue for most parts of india asoka et al 2017 dhillon et al 2019 fishman et al 2011 malik and bhagwat 2021 mishra et al 2018 panda et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 sarkar et al 2020 sidhu et al 2021 singh et al 2017 and worldwide arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen et al 2014 schmidt et al 2006 wada 2016 a regional scale study on groundwater depletion using grace showed that 109 km3 of groundwater had been lost across india s northern states such as punjab haryana and rajasthan from 2002 to 2008 rodell et al 2009 water levels in punjab particularly in central and southern regions also known as malwa region have been facing severe decline for the past 20 years dhillon et al 2019 kumar et al 2018a sidhu et al 2021 therefore a study on the spatio temporal scenario of groundwater resources and estimation of the long term groundwater levels trend is essential for groundwater resource management the trend analysis using statistical techniques has become popular in the last few decades especially to understand the hydro climatic time series temporal patterns kumar et al 2019 suryavanshi et al 2014 the study of groundwater level trends provides better knowledge of the long term behaviour of hydraulic heads le brocque et al 2018 and thus proper management of irrigational activities kshetrimayum and bajpai 2012 several studies around the world have been carried out on trend analysis of groundwater data chaudhuri and ale 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2017 shamsudduha et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 in the indian context numerous prior studies on trends of groundwater fluctuation are also available in the literature anand et al 2020 s kumar et al 2018b panda et al 2012 pathak and dodamani 2019 singh et al 2015 singh and kasana 2017 sishodia et al 2016 thakur and thomas 2011 lack of regular and reliable data has been the major constraint for the detailed assessment of groundwater particularly in developing countries machiwal and jha 2014 patle et al 2015 moreover data for groundwater is collected from many wells and may result in significantly mixed results for trend or fluctuation analyses therefore clustering or grouping the wells based on similar characteristics may help draw decisive conclusions indices are commonly used to represent quantitative and qualitative aspects of a phenomenon these indices main advantage is that they assimilate one or multiple variables into a single numerical value which helps communicate the information to a broad audience amirataee and montaseri 2017 standardization approaches are most popular in framing indices as they take the variables statistical properties or phenomena into account swain et al 2017 2021 in hydrology the standardized indices are often used to represent variations in precipitation runoff soil moisture reservoir storage groundwater levels droughts etc fiorillo and guadagno 2010 2012 2010 lópez moreno et al 2009 mcevoy et al 2012 mendicino et al 2008 sheffield et al 2009 sheffield and wood 2008 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 vidal et al 2010 2012 similarly a new index namely standardized depth to water level index sdwli can be framed to analyze the groundwater fluctuations considering the statistical properties of depth to groundwater level dgwl dgwl represents the distance of the groundwater table from the ground level a negative positive value of sdwli indicates groundwater availability at a shallow deeper depth for the long term average value of dgwl hence overexploitation of groundwater resources and reduced groundwater recharge will be reflected in increased dgwl and sdwli considering all the above concerns the key objectives of this study are to a estimate groundwater level trends in different seasons using statistical methods b analyze the groundwater fluctuations in detail using sdwli and c assess the multi decadal changes in groundwater level through geostatistical analysis clustering and spatial interpolations few studies have been found to have comprehensively accomplished all these objectives particularly in the malwa region in punjab 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting punjab state has broadly three major regions i e doaba majha and malwa the area under investigation is part of the malwa region which is located between 29 30 n to 31 05 n and 74 00 e to 76 10 e fig 1 the study area of malwa lies between the sutlej and ghaggar rivers the lands in the study region are extensively used for agriculture with intensive groundwater irrigation rice and wheat are the major crops along with cotton jawar sorghum bajra pearl millet etc produced in this region 2 2 climate the malwa region falls under the arid and semi arid climate zone paul et al 2015 the average temperature ranges from 5 c in the month of december and january to 45 c in the month of may and june the region receives an average annual rainfall of 600 mm however 70 of the annual rainfall occurs from july to september due to the southwest monsoon due to the irregular and scanty rainfall pattern the canals and rivers act as the irrigation source but are not sufficient to fulfil the irrigation water demands therefore significant agricultural water use is provided by groundwater through tubewells or borewells 2 3 hydrogeology and geomorphology the overall regional slope of this region is from northeast ne to southwest sw and the elevation ranges from 118 m to 268 m above mean sea level msl in the sw to ne fig 1 the study region is a part of the sutlej river basin a sub basin of the indus basin the geology of the area consists mostly of indo gangetic alluvial sediments comprised of quaternary deposits cgwb 2016 with aeolian plains mainly in southwestern parts of the area gupta 2011 the quaternary alluvium is comprised of fluvial deposits of sand silt and alternating beds of sand and clay with pebbles and gravels fig 2 these comprise fairly thick and regionally confined and unconfined aquifers down to 300 m below land surface cgwb 2016 the geology of the area constitutes mostly indo gangetic alluvial sediments comprised of quaternary alluvium deposits cgwb 2016 pervious strata of 45 m 50 m thickness is encountered in central and south central parts of the study area and is in certain places separated by one or two clayey layers with thickness ranging between 2 m and 5 m chopra and krishan 2014 the thickness of the freshwater aquifer in the southwest region is much less than the other areas of the study area because of underlying saline water in general groundwater in the southwest region is very hard and unfavourable for both drinking and agricultural practices ahada and suthar 2018 chopra and krishan 2014 the regional hydraulic gradient follows the land surface is from ne to sw fig 2 kumar et al 2014 3 data sets and methods 3 1 collection of tubewell data in this study the data for groundwater level of tubewell was collected for 130 observation wells piezometers for pre and post monsoon season i e june and october respectively fig 1 the data was collected from the department of agriculture punjab for the duration of 21 years i e from october 1997 to june 2018 and thoroughly checked however wells having less than 20 years of observations or discontinuous information were excluded from further analyses following the criteria the observations from 90 tubewells were considered for this study further the information on the number of tubewells installed for groundwater based irrigation in the state during 2000 2016 was collected from the statistical abstracts of punjab 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a method in which samples are categorized into different groups based on the variables similarity and dissimilarity it also organizes the data in a hierarchical structure based on euclidean distance between two points or angles of two vector points tiri et al 2017 this hca method was successfully used by several studies fabbrocino et al 2019 halder et al 2020 pathak and dodamani 2019 rahbar et al 2020 tiri et al 2017 to classify wells or groundwater samples the hca method follows the distance matrix based on the clustering of similar samples or variables later each group is merged with the nearest groups with similar patterns based on ward s linkage method ward 1963 the whole cluster analysis procedure is performed in statistical software r studio version 2019 with the package of the hclust2 distance method in this study the hca method is implemented to cluster wells having a similar fluctuation pattern with 20 years of continuous groundwater level observations 3 3 trend analysis methods the estimation of significant trends in the time series dataset can be done using parametric and nonparametric tests gocic and trajkovic 2013 the parametric test for trend analysis usually requires datasets that are normally distributed however the nonparametric tests are distribution free techniques and require only independent time series datasets due to the ease of computation and comparatively fewer assumptions the nonparametric methods are widely used for trend analysis smith et al 1987 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 among different statistical techniques the nonparametric mann kendall mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 and modified mann kendall mmk hamed and rao 1998 tests are most popular methods as they determine the nature of trend increasing decreasing along with its significance however the mmk test can handle serially correlated datasets and is preferred over the mk test duhan et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 the mk or mmk test is usually applied along with sen s slope estimator sse method sen 1968 which estimates the magnitude of the trend pandey and khare 2018 pingale et al 2014 in this study the mmk test and sse are applied to assess the groundwater level trends the detailed methodologies of both the tests are provided in the appendix 3 4 standardized depth to water level index sdwli in this study the sdwli is applied to analyze the groundwater fluctuations in pre and post monsoon seasons for a particular well the time series of the depth to groundwater is collected and the mean d m and standard deviation σ are determined as follows 1 d m i 1 n d i n 2 σ i 1 n d i d m 2 n 1 where d i is the dgwl for an ith year and n is the total number of years using d m and σ the time series of the depth to groundwater is transformed to have a new time series with a zero mean and unit variance 3 s d w l i i d i d m σ the main advantage of sdwli is that it is simple to compute further it represents both positive and negative deviations from the mean uniformly and can be used to compare the conditions from different wells similar procedures are generally adopted to explore groundwater drought assessments pathak and dodamani 2019 thomas et al 2017 wang et al 2020 as the groundwater level in both pre and post monsoon season varies significantly sdwli is computed separately for an individual season 3 5 spatial variation analysis of groundwater level in the geographical information system gis environment geostatistical modeling can deal with the spatio temporal phenomena and predict the values of different variables for unknown or missing locations using interpolation techniques caers 2005 numerous studies have been carried out in recent years using geostatistical interpolation techniques to investigate the spatio temporal variation of long term groundwater levels ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 anand et al 2020 biswas et al 2018 halder et al 2020 kaur and rishi 2018 singh and kasana 2017 there are several techniques available for spatial interpolation in the gis environment inverse distance weighting idw is the most widely accepted geostatistical method for predicting the missing locations optimal values based on weighted distance from the neighbouring values anand et al 2020 s kumar et al 2018b further this method is considered the best interpolation method for groundwater level fluctuation due to its scalar dimension approach for observing the information in space and time domain gunarathna et al 2016 in the present study the idw interpolation method is used to generate the depth to groundwater level maps for the study region the detailed methodology adopted for the current study is shown in fig 3 for reference 4 results and discussion 4 1 classification of wells based on cluster analysis the groundwater level fluctuation rate over 21 years is calculated for each observation well or piezometer the groundwater fluctuation rate helps to understand the aquifer s characteristics and the conditions for its recharge potential hence the wells are classified using the cluster analysis based on a similar fluctuation rate the dendrogram plot in fig 4 obtained by ward s linkage distance method shows three distinct clusters it can be observed from fig 1 that 42 wells mostly in the southwestern part of the study area fell under cluster 1 based on the fluctuation rate however 15 and 33 wells have fluctuation rates different from wells in cluster 1 and these fell under cluster 2 and 3 respectively the average rate of fluctuation in the southwestern wells ranged from 13 cm to 10 cm yr however the wells fluctuation rate in the other parts of the region in clusters 2 and 3 ranged from 15 cm to 91 cm yr these wells show high decrease in water levels over 21 years which is quite alarming for groundwater sustainability 4 2 trend analysis of dgwl the trend analysis of dgwl using mmk and sen s slope tests for all 90 wells during pre and post monsoon seasons are shown in table 1 for pre monsoon june 65 wells exhibited a positive trend and 61 were statistically significant at a 95 confidence level although 25 wells showed a negative trend of dgwl only six of them are found to be significant the results are also similar for the post monsoon season 67 wells showing a positive trend out of which 58 were significant however 23 wells showed a negative trends of dgwl out of which only three of them are found significant it can be inferred from the results that most of the wells over the malwa region possess significantly increasing trends of dgwl in both pre and post monsoon seasons which implies a severely declining trend of groundwater level during 1997 2018 further it can be noticed from fig 5 that the wells in clusters 2 and 3 located in central and eastern parts possess highly decreasing trends of groundwater level while the wells in cluster 1 mostly located in western parts show increasing trends 4 3 temporal groundwater fluctuation analysis using sdwli the temporal fluctuations in the groundwater of the malwa region are assessed through sdwli regarding the sdwli analysis results it is practically impossible to present the diagrams for all the 90 wells considered in the study the wells are arranged into three clusters according to the water level variations for cluster based analysis a representative well from each cluster is selected to present the detailed results the wells s43 s85 and s23 are chosen as the typical well from clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively the temporal variations in the depth to groundwater level dgwl and the corresponding sdwli for pre and post monsoon seasons are plotted in fig 6 it should be noted that sdwli is the normalized variate of the dgwl hence an increase in the sdwli or dgwl implies a decrease in the groundwater level and vice versa there is a significant decrease in the depth to water level and sdwli over time for s43 this means the water level has risen significantly over the years more importantly the rate of change in dgwl is almost constant therefore there is continuous recharge to the well resulting in the increasing water level which is also inferred from trend analysis fig 6a the sdwli ranged from 1 60 in 1998 to 1 27 in 2018 for june and similarly from 1 55 in 1997 to 1 39 in 2017 for october the sdwli for june and october was closest to zero in june 2011 and october 2010 respectively in contrast to cluster 1 the trend of dgwl and sdwli is monotonically increasing for s85 cluster 2 as presented in fig 6b the rate of groundwater depletion is almost 1 m per year the sdwli ranged from 1 32 in 1998 to 1 82 in 2018 for june and from 1 34 in 1997 to 1 8 in 2017 for october it is interesting to note that there is not a single year where the depth to groundwater level decreased compared to the preceding year during the pre monsoon conditions this may be due to groundwater overexploitation to meet the high water demands in the summer season march to june the scenario is quite similar for the post monsoon season except 2005 where the depth to water level decreased a little compared to that of 2004 the pattern of annual variation of groundwater level in cluster 3 is quite similar to that of cluster 2 from the time series plots of dgwl and sdwli for june and october shown in fig 6c it is apparent that the groundwater level gwl has decreased significantly over the years the sdwli series reveals negligible fluctuation from 1997 to 2000 however there is a sharp increase in the plot during the post 2000 years the sdwli ranged from 1 59 in 2000 to 1 76 in 2018 for june and similarly from 1 44 in 2000 to 1 71 in 2017 for october from the results of nonparametric trend analyses and sdwli assessments it is noticeable that almost all the wells in clusters 2 and 3 possess a significant decrease in the groundwater level over the years on the other hand most of the wells in cluster 1 reveal increasing groundwater levels though relatively few of them are statistically significant this implies the recharge rate to the wells is generally negligible relative to the extraction rate which causes a continuous overdraft of groundwater over the majority of the malwa region this is a dire condition as the continuation of such trends may lead to a deterioration in groundwater quality uneconomical or expensive pumping conditions etc pophare et al 2014 these factors may cause acute water deficits in the future which will be exacerbated under rapid population growth and ever increasing food demands therefore there is an urgent need to develop robust strategies for the replenishment of groundwater the results of this study are a clear alarm emphasizing the necessity of a stringent policy framing for proper planning and management of groundwater over the malwa region 4 4 multi decadal spatio temporal analysis of groundwater level change maps of dgwl for both pre and post monsoon were prepared from 90 observation wells using idw technique in arcgis version 10 4 since the observations are available from october 1997 to june 2018 a comparison of spatial dgwl variation is made between 1998 and 2018 for pre monsoon june and is presented in fig 7 similarly the comparison plot between post monsoon october of 1997 and 2017 is presented in fig 8 the depth to groundwater level across wells varies from 0 5 to 20 m in 1997 1998 and 0 05 38 66 m in 2017 2018 the interpolated maps are classified into five classes according to the dgwl ranges i e below 5 m 5 10 m 10 20 m 20 30 m and 30 40 m the maps indicate that central eastern part of the study area has seen a major decline in gwl in both pre and post monsoon over the last 21 years it can be observed in figs 7 and 8 that the groundwater levels over the malwa region were relatively shallow i e dgwl maximum of 20 m during the year 1997 98 by 2017 18 more than 30 of wells in the eastern part of the study region had been transformed from shallow to deeper dgwl class i e 20 30 m and 30 40 m this severe decline in groundwater level has resulted from irregular rainfall with excess use of groundwater irrigation for paddy kharif crop cultivation the statistical abstract of the government of punjab reveals that the number of tubewells for irrigation increased from 1 07 to 1 42 million in the entire state from 2000 01 to 2015 16 table 2 however the southwestern part of the malwa region has witnessed an opposite scenario in groundwater level variations the maps show clear evidence of a rise in water level in both seasons over the last 21 years where more than 20 of wells have transformed dgwl classes from 5 to 20 m to below 5 m in 2017 18 compared to 1997 98 figs 7 and 8 this is predominant over the southwestern parts of the region due to the natural slope from northeast to southwest waterlogging occurred due to monsoon rainfall and groundwater unsuitability for irrigation due to salinity problems leading to an increase in groundwater level in this part of the indus basin the similar issues of waterlogging and salinity also occur in pakistani punjab region qureshi et al 2008 4 5 rainfall trend analysis the trend of rainfall analysis over this region for last 46 years i e 1972 73 to 2017 18 has been analyzed along with the gwl analysis the monthly rainfall over 10 districts stations in the study area is collected from india meteorological department imd the mk and sen s slope statistics shows that the rainfall trends are negative for all the districts however they are not significant at 5 significance level hence the groundwater depletion is mainly due to anthropogenic activities excessive withdrawals for flooded agriculture in this region the trend of rainfall over 46 years is presented in table 3 for further reference 5 significance of long term dgwl change for groundwater sustainability among the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs formulated by the united nations in 2015 work in water resources has focused largely on sdg 6 access to clean water and sanitation including prioritizing sustainable development of groundwater for drinking purposes bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 mukherjee et al 2021b considerable work on drinking water quality in the developing world has focused on geogenic fluoride and arsenic e g ijumulana et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021a as well as pathogens duttagupta et al 2020 however water is also central to sdg 2 ending hunger achieving food security and nutrition in its emphasis on sustainable agriculture during the 35 years after the green revolution the shifting of agriculture to rice cultivation has resulted in a severe groundwater depletion in punjab dhillon et al 2019 kaur et al 2010 reported a water resources deficit of 2 49 million hectare meter for punjab with annual gross water requirements of 6 15 million hectare meter against the availability of both surface and ground water of 3 66 million hectare meter therefore a strategic plan should be implemented for sustainable management of groundwater the study s overall findings specify that groundwater depletion and waterlogging are significant concerns in different parts of the study area this study has emphasized the severely stressed groundwater condition as evident from the statistical trend analysis of dgwl and the assessment of the sdwli series hence efficient groundwater management strategies should be adopted especially for irrigation advanced technologies such as drip irrigation can save 80 of irrigation water relative to the usual flood irrigation method narayanamoorthy 2004 the localized drip irrigation management improves crop yield and water quality over the region it helps to minimize not only the groundwater loss in the basin but also the farmers operating cost for pumping electricity charges for irrigation sishodia et al 2016 to enhance the groundwater recharge especially in the eastern part of the study basin where the groundwater depletion rate is very high check dams and recharge pits should be constructed using surplus canal water and surface runoff aggarwal et al 2009 this will ultimately increase the recharge thereby minimizing the groundwater depletion in the future the overall findings from this study will help the decision makers and hydrogeologists sustainably manage the groundwater 6 conclusions this present study was carried out to study the multi decadal trends and spatio temporal variations of dgwl in parts of malwa region in punjab india depth of gwl data of 90 observation piezometer wells for pre and post monsoon of each year for a period of 21 years 1997 2018 have been used for the analysis trend analysis using nonparametric statistical techniques shows that most of the wells over the malwa region possess significantly increasing trends of dgwl in both pre and post monsoon seasons which implies a severely declining trend of gwl during the study period the result of trend analysis was validated with the dgwl variation maps more than 30 of tubewells in the eastern part of the study region have a severe decline of groundwater level 20 m decline of dgwl over 21 years i e 1 m year however more than 20 of tubewells in the southwestern part of the malwa region show a water level rise which causes waterlogging problems during the monsoon period the present study concludes that the groundwater level has declined with an average rate of about 40 cm year in both pre and post monsoon seasons during 1997 2018 over the malwa region the over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation mainly for paddy cultivation despite monsoonal rainfall with a sound canal irrigation system is the main reason behind this severe groundwater level decline further unevenly distributed rainfall less recharge and over dependency on groundwater resources in this region cause a sharp decline in groundwater levels crop diversification and augmentation of advanced irrigation techniques and the establishment of new recharge structures to enhance the recharge potential are needed to improve the conditions of groundwater depletion in the particular water stressed region hence need for the hour is to implement a new water act and promote new guidelines by the government to manage groundwater resources better declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂuence the work

11924,due to spatial unevenness in rainfall groundwater dependency for irrigation has increased exponentially which poses a challenge for its sustainability hence the long term behaviour of groundwater level gwl fluctuations needs to be understood for better management of water resources and formulating a new action plan due to semi arid climatic condition most of the agricultural lands in malwa region of punjab in india depend on the groundwater for irrigation the present study focuses on multi decadal trend estimation and spatio temporal variations of gwl changes using geostatistics and analyzing the groundwater fluctuations using the standardized depth to water level index sdwli method over the malwa region for this study gwl data for 90 observation wells piezometers for 21 years 1997 2018 were analyzed the wells were classified into different clusters according to the fluctuation rate using hierarchical cluster analysis the trend for each well s gwl changes was analyzed with the modified mann kendall mmk test and sen s slope the trend analysis results show that most of the wells over the malwa region possess a significantly declining trend of gwl during 1997 2018 the spatio temporal variation maps reveal that more than 30 of tubewells in the eastern part of the study region have seen an average depletion rate of about 40 cm year in both seasons pre and post monsoon in contrast gwl in southwestern part of the malwa region shows an evident rise in water level during the last two decades this rising water level causes severe waterlogging problems during the monsoon period over 21 years we observed that more than 20 of wells had increased gwl in the southwestern part of the malwa region the present study s result raises concern about groundwater resources future in the highly groundwater dependent malwa region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater trend analysis geostatistics hierarchical cluster analysis punjab 1 introduction groundwater constitutes an integral part of global water resources it is used as the primary resource in different regions worldwide for drinking domestic agricultural and industrial purposes in the recent past the population growth and overexploitation of groundwater resources have led to rapidly declining groundwater levels aggarwal et al 2009 the aquifers are under tremendous pressure and are vulnerable to depletion particularly in semi arid and arid regions where the natural recharge is not adequate to balance the withdrawals vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 this is further aggravated by uncertain and uneven rainfall patterns causing overdependence of agriculture on groundwater resources the groundwater fluctuations result mostly due to withdrawal from bore wells less recharge compared to discharge water uptake by the vegetation and periodic moisture disparity rajaveni et al 2014 various groundwater related problems viz groundwater depletion dhillon et al 2019 groundwater quality deterioration lombard et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021a singh et al 2019 land subsidence and hydrological droughts arise due to the declining trend of groundwater levels anand et al 2020 therefore groundwater level quantification and prediction of the trend can be pivotal for sustainable water management primarily due to increasing climatic uncertainties though there is an urgent need to study the impact of groundwater exploitation under climate change very few studies exist in the literature malakar et al 2021 mostly due to the lack of large spatial and temporal datasets india is the largest groundwater consumer globally with an estimated usage of about 251 km3 yr unesco 2012 the demand of water for irrigation in india will rise up to 56 by the year 2050 i e 1072 bcm as indicated by the ministry of water resources baweja et al 2017 cwc 2000 in the past few decades most northern states in india have experienced a severe depletion of groundwater due to over exploitation of groundwater for various purposes cgwb 2016 punjab a state located in north india is amongst the leading agricultural producers of the country more than 85 of land under agriculture in the state depends on groundwater for irrigation gupta 2011 sidhu et al 2021 although canals are also available as irrigation sources they are insufficient to cater to the agricultural water demands during the last five decades the average rice productivity has increased from 1 8 to 6 2 t ha over the same period the irrigated area also increased from 71 to 99 9 and the cropping intensity has increased from 104 to 204 dhillon et al 2019 scott and shah 2004 the exponential growth in agricultural production has come at the cost of deterioration of natural resources especially groundwater depletion the key reason for the depletion of groundwater levels in punjab is the rapid rise in the number of tubewells borewells and increased rice cultivation the number of tubewells in the state has increased from 0 8 to 1 47 million from 1990 to 2018 statistical abstract 2019 the problem of groundwater depletion is not isolated to punjab instead it is an alarming issue for most parts of india asoka et al 2017 dhillon et al 2019 fishman et al 2011 malik and bhagwat 2021 mishra et al 2018 panda et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 sarkar et al 2020 sidhu et al 2021 singh et al 2017 and worldwide arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen et al 2014 schmidt et al 2006 wada 2016 a regional scale study on groundwater depletion using grace showed that 109 km3 of groundwater had been lost across india s northern states such as punjab haryana and rajasthan from 2002 to 2008 rodell et al 2009 water levels in punjab particularly in central and southern regions also known as malwa region have been facing severe decline for the past 20 years dhillon et al 2019 kumar et al 2018a sidhu et al 2021 therefore a study on the spatio temporal scenario of groundwater resources and estimation of the long term groundwater levels trend is essential for groundwater resource management the trend analysis using statistical techniques has become popular in the last few decades especially to understand the hydro climatic time series temporal patterns kumar et al 2019 suryavanshi et al 2014 the study of groundwater level trends provides better knowledge of the long term behaviour of hydraulic heads le brocque et al 2018 and thus proper management of irrigational activities kshetrimayum and bajpai 2012 several studies around the world have been carried out on trend analysis of groundwater data chaudhuri and ale 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2017 shamsudduha et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 in the indian context numerous prior studies on trends of groundwater fluctuation are also available in the literature anand et al 2020 s kumar et al 2018b panda et al 2012 pathak and dodamani 2019 singh et al 2015 singh and kasana 2017 sishodia et al 2016 thakur and thomas 2011 lack of regular and reliable data has been the major constraint for the detailed assessment of groundwater particularly in developing countries machiwal and jha 2014 patle et al 2015 moreover data for groundwater is collected from many wells and may result in significantly mixed results for trend or fluctuation analyses therefore clustering or grouping the wells based on similar characteristics may help draw decisive conclusions indices are commonly used to represent quantitative and qualitative aspects of a phenomenon these indices main advantage is that they assimilate one or multiple variables into a single numerical value which helps communicate the information to a broad audience amirataee and montaseri 2017 standardization approaches are most popular in framing indices as they take the variables statistical properties or phenomena into account swain et al 2017 2021 in hydrology the standardized indices are often used to represent variations in precipitation runoff soil moisture reservoir storage groundwater levels droughts etc fiorillo and guadagno 2010 2012 2010 lópez moreno et al 2009 mcevoy et al 2012 mendicino et al 2008 sheffield et al 2009 sheffield and wood 2008 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 vidal et al 2010 2012 similarly a new index namely standardized depth to water level index sdwli can be framed to analyze the groundwater fluctuations considering the statistical properties of depth to groundwater level dgwl dgwl represents the distance of the groundwater table from the ground level a negative positive value of sdwli indicates groundwater availability at a shallow deeper depth for the long term average value of dgwl hence overexploitation of groundwater resources and reduced groundwater recharge will be reflected in increased dgwl and sdwli considering all the above concerns the key objectives of this study are to a estimate groundwater level trends in different seasons using statistical methods b analyze the groundwater fluctuations in detail using sdwli and c assess the multi decadal changes in groundwater level through geostatistical analysis clustering and spatial interpolations few studies have been found to have comprehensively accomplished all these objectives particularly in the malwa region in punjab 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting punjab state has broadly three major regions i e doaba majha and malwa the area under investigation is part of the malwa region which is located between 29 30 n to 31 05 n and 74 00 e to 76 10 e fig 1 the study area of malwa lies between the sutlej and ghaggar rivers the lands in the study region are extensively used for agriculture with intensive groundwater irrigation rice and wheat are the major crops along with cotton jawar sorghum bajra pearl millet etc produced in this region 2 2 climate the malwa region falls under the arid and semi arid climate zone paul et al 2015 the average temperature ranges from 5 c in the month of december and january to 45 c in the month of may and june the region receives an average annual rainfall of 600 mm however 70 of the annual rainfall occurs from july to september due to the southwest monsoon due to the irregular and scanty rainfall pattern the canals and rivers act as the irrigation source but are not sufficient to fulfil the irrigation water demands therefore significant agricultural water use is provided by groundwater through tubewells or borewells 2 3 hydrogeology and geomorphology the overall regional slope of this region is from northeast ne to southwest sw and the elevation ranges from 118 m to 268 m above mean sea level msl in the sw to ne fig 1 the study region is a part of the sutlej river basin a sub basin of the indus basin the geology of the area consists mostly of indo gangetic alluvial sediments comprised of quaternary deposits cgwb 2016 with aeolian plains mainly in southwestern parts of the area gupta 2011 the quaternary alluvium is comprised of fluvial deposits of sand silt and alternating beds of sand and clay with pebbles and gravels fig 2 these comprise fairly thick and regionally confined and unconfined aquifers down to 300 m below land surface cgwb 2016 the geology of the area constitutes mostly indo gangetic alluvial sediments comprised of quaternary alluvium deposits cgwb 2016 pervious strata of 45 m 50 m thickness is encountered in central and south central parts of the study area and is in certain places separated by one or two clayey layers with thickness ranging between 2 m and 5 m chopra and krishan 2014 the thickness of the freshwater aquifer in the southwest region is much less than the other areas of the study area because of underlying saline water in general groundwater in the southwest region is very hard and unfavourable for both drinking and agricultural practices ahada and suthar 2018 chopra and krishan 2014 the regional hydraulic gradient follows the land surface is from ne to sw fig 2 kumar et al 2014 3 data sets and methods 3 1 collection of tubewell data in this study the data for groundwater level of tubewell was collected for 130 observation wells piezometers for pre and post monsoon season i e june and october respectively fig 1 the data was collected from the department of agriculture punjab for the duration of 21 years i e from october 1997 to june 2018 and thoroughly checked however wells having less than 20 years of observations or discontinuous information were excluded from further analyses following the criteria the observations from 90 tubewells were considered for this study further the information on the number of tubewells installed for groundwater based irrigation in the state during 2000 2016 was collected from the statistical abstracts of punjab 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a method in which samples are categorized into different groups based on the variables similarity and dissimilarity it also organizes the data in a hierarchical structure based on euclidean distance between two points or angles of two vector points tiri et al 2017 this hca method was successfully used by several studies fabbrocino et al 2019 halder et al 2020 pathak and dodamani 2019 rahbar et al 2020 tiri et al 2017 to classify wells or groundwater samples the hca method follows the distance matrix based on the clustering of similar samples or variables later each group is merged with the nearest groups with similar patterns based on ward s linkage method ward 1963 the whole cluster analysis procedure is performed in statistical software r studio version 2019 with the package of the hclust2 distance method in this study the hca method is implemented to cluster wells having a similar fluctuation pattern with 20 years of continuous groundwater level observations 3 3 trend analysis methods the estimation of significant trends in the time series dataset can be done using parametric and nonparametric tests gocic and trajkovic 2013 the parametric test for trend analysis usually requires datasets that are normally distributed however the nonparametric tests are distribution free techniques and require only independent time series datasets due to the ease of computation and comparatively fewer assumptions the nonparametric methods are widely used for trend analysis smith et al 1987 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 among different statistical techniques the nonparametric mann kendall mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 and modified mann kendall mmk hamed and rao 1998 tests are most popular methods as they determine the nature of trend increasing decreasing along with its significance however the mmk test can handle serially correlated datasets and is preferred over the mk test duhan et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 the mk or mmk test is usually applied along with sen s slope estimator sse method sen 1968 which estimates the magnitude of the trend pandey and khare 2018 pingale et al 2014 in this study the mmk test and sse are applied to assess the groundwater level trends the detailed methodologies of both the tests are provided in the appendix 3 4 standardized depth to water level index sdwli in this study the sdwli is applied to analyze the groundwater fluctuations in pre and post monsoon seasons for a particular well the time series of the depth to groundwater is collected and the mean d m and standard deviation σ are determined as follows 1 d m i 1 n d i n 2 σ i 1 n d i d m 2 n 1 where d i is the dgwl for an ith year and n is the total number of years using d m and σ the time series of the depth to groundwater is transformed to have a new time series with a zero mean and unit variance 3 s d w l i i d i d m σ the main advantage of sdwli is that it is simple to compute further it represents both positive and negative deviations from the mean uniformly and can be used to compare the conditions from different wells similar procedures are generally adopted to explore groundwater drought assessments pathak and dodamani 2019 thomas et al 2017 wang et al 2020 as the groundwater level in both pre and post monsoon season varies significantly sdwli is computed separately for an individual season 3 5 spatial variation analysis of groundwater level in the geographical information system gis environment geostatistical modeling can deal with the spatio temporal phenomena and predict the values of different variables for unknown or missing locations using interpolation techniques caers 2005 numerous studies have been carried out in recent years using geostatistical interpolation techniques to investigate the spatio temporal variation of long term groundwater levels ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 anand et al 2020 biswas et al 2018 halder et al 2020 kaur and rishi 2018 singh and kasana 2017 there are several techniques available for spatial interpolation in the gis environment inverse distance weighting idw is the most widely accepted geostatistical method for predicting the missing locations optimal values based on weighted distance from the neighbouring values anand et al 2020 s kumar et al 2018b further this method is considered the best interpolation method for groundwater level fluctuation due to its scalar dimension approach for observing the information in space and time domain gunarathna et al 2016 in the present study the idw interpolation method is used to generate the depth to groundwater level maps for the study region the detailed methodology adopted for the current study is shown in fig 3 for reference 4 results and discussion 4 1 classification of wells based on cluster analysis the groundwater level fluctuation rate over 21 years is calculated for each observation well or piezometer the groundwater fluctuation rate helps to understand the aquifer s characteristics and the conditions for its recharge potential hence the wells are classified using the cluster analysis based on a similar fluctuation rate the dendrogram plot in fig 4 obtained by ward s linkage distance method shows three distinct clusters it can be observed from fig 1 that 42 wells mostly in the southwestern part of the study area fell under cluster 1 based on the fluctuation rate however 15 and 33 wells have fluctuation rates different from wells in cluster 1 and these fell under cluster 2 and 3 respectively the average rate of fluctuation in the southwestern wells ranged from 13 cm to 10 cm yr however the wells fluctuation rate in the other parts of the region in clusters 2 and 3 ranged from 15 cm to 91 cm yr these wells show high decrease in water levels over 21 years which is quite alarming for groundwater sustainability 4 2 trend analysis of dgwl the trend analysis of dgwl using mmk and sen s slope tests for all 90 wells during pre and post monsoon seasons are shown in table 1 for pre monsoon june 65 wells exhibited a positive trend and 61 were statistically significant at a 95 confidence level although 25 wells showed a negative trend of dgwl only six of them are found to be significant the results are also similar for the post monsoon season 67 wells showing a positive trend out of which 58 were significant however 23 wells showed a negative trends of dgwl out of which only three of them are found significant it can be inferred from the results that most of the wells over the malwa region possess significantly increasing trends of dgwl in both pre and post monsoon seasons which implies a severely declining trend of groundwater level during 1997 2018 further it can be noticed from fig 5 that the wells in clusters 2 and 3 located in central and eastern parts possess highly decreasing trends of groundwater level while the wells in cluster 1 mostly located in western parts show increasing trends 4 3 temporal groundwater fluctuation analysis using sdwli the temporal fluctuations in the groundwater of the malwa region are assessed through sdwli regarding the sdwli analysis results it is practically impossible to present the diagrams for all the 90 wells considered in the study the wells are arranged into three clusters according to the water level variations for cluster based analysis a representative well from each cluster is selected to present the detailed results the wells s43 s85 and s23 are chosen as the typical well from clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively the temporal variations in the depth to groundwater level dgwl and the corresponding sdwli for pre and post monsoon seasons are plotted in fig 6 it should be noted that sdwli is the normalized variate of the dgwl hence an increase in the sdwli or dgwl implies a decrease in the groundwater level and vice versa there is a significant decrease in the depth to water level and sdwli over time for s43 this means the water level has risen significantly over the years more importantly the rate of change in dgwl is almost constant therefore there is continuous recharge to the well resulting in the increasing water level which is also inferred from trend analysis fig 6a the sdwli ranged from 1 60 in 1998 to 1 27 in 2018 for june and similarly from 1 55 in 1997 to 1 39 in 2017 for october the sdwli for june and october was closest to zero in june 2011 and october 2010 respectively in contrast to cluster 1 the trend of dgwl and sdwli is monotonically increasing for s85 cluster 2 as presented in fig 6b the rate of groundwater depletion is almost 1 m per year the sdwli ranged from 1 32 in 1998 to 1 82 in 2018 for june and from 1 34 in 1997 to 1 8 in 2017 for october it is interesting to note that there is not a single year where the depth to groundwater level decreased compared to the preceding year during the pre monsoon conditions this may be due to groundwater overexploitation to meet the high water demands in the summer season march to june the scenario is quite similar for the post monsoon season except 2005 where the depth to water level decreased a little compared to that of 2004 the pattern of annual variation of groundwater level in cluster 3 is quite similar to that of cluster 2 from the time series plots of dgwl and sdwli for june and october shown in fig 6c it is apparent that the groundwater level gwl has decreased significantly over the years the sdwli series reveals negligible fluctuation from 1997 to 2000 however there is a sharp increase in the plot during the post 2000 years the sdwli ranged from 1 59 in 2000 to 1 76 in 2018 for june and similarly from 1 44 in 2000 to 1 71 in 2017 for october from the results of nonparametric trend analyses and sdwli assessments it is noticeable that almost all the wells in clusters 2 and 3 possess a significant decrease in the groundwater level over the years on the other hand most of the wells in cluster 1 reveal increasing groundwater levels though relatively few of them are statistically significant this implies the recharge rate to the wells is generally negligible relative to the extraction rate which causes a continuous overdraft of groundwater over the majority of the malwa region this is a dire condition as the continuation of such trends may lead to a deterioration in groundwater quality uneconomical or expensive pumping conditions etc pophare et al 2014 these factors may cause acute water deficits in the future which will be exacerbated under rapid population growth and ever increasing food demands therefore there is an urgent need to develop robust strategies for the replenishment of groundwater the results of this study are a clear alarm emphasizing the necessity of a stringent policy framing for proper planning and management of groundwater over the malwa region 4 4 multi decadal spatio temporal analysis of groundwater level change maps of dgwl for both pre and post monsoon were prepared from 90 observation wells using idw technique in arcgis version 10 4 since the observations are available from october 1997 to june 2018 a comparison of spatial dgwl variation is made between 1998 and 2018 for pre monsoon june and is presented in fig 7 similarly the comparison plot between post monsoon october of 1997 and 2017 is presented in fig 8 the depth to groundwater level across wells varies from 0 5 to 20 m in 1997 1998 and 0 05 38 66 m in 2017 2018 the interpolated maps are classified into five classes according to the dgwl ranges i e below 5 m 5 10 m 10 20 m 20 30 m and 30 40 m the maps indicate that central eastern part of the study area has seen a major decline in gwl in both pre and post monsoon over the last 21 years it can be observed in figs 7 and 8 that the groundwater levels over the malwa region were relatively shallow i e dgwl maximum of 20 m during the year 1997 98 by 2017 18 more than 30 of wells in the eastern part of the study region had been transformed from shallow to deeper dgwl class i e 20 30 m and 30 40 m this severe decline in groundwater level has resulted from irregular rainfall with excess use of groundwater irrigation for paddy kharif crop cultivation the statistical abstract of the government of punjab reveals that the number of tubewells for irrigation increased from 1 07 to 1 42 million in the entire state from 2000 01 to 2015 16 table 2 however the southwestern part of the malwa region has witnessed an opposite scenario in groundwater level variations the maps show clear evidence of a rise in water level in both seasons over the last 21 years where more than 20 of wells have transformed dgwl classes from 5 to 20 m to below 5 m in 2017 18 compared to 1997 98 figs 7 and 8 this is predominant over the southwestern parts of the region due to the natural slope from northeast to southwest waterlogging occurred due to monsoon rainfall and groundwater unsuitability for irrigation due to salinity problems leading to an increase in groundwater level in this part of the indus basin the similar issues of waterlogging and salinity also occur in pakistani punjab region qureshi et al 2008 4 5 rainfall trend analysis the trend of rainfall analysis over this region for last 46 years i e 1972 73 to 2017 18 has been analyzed along with the gwl analysis the monthly rainfall over 10 districts stations in the study area is collected from india meteorological department imd the mk and sen s slope statistics shows that the rainfall trends are negative for all the districts however they are not significant at 5 significance level hence the groundwater depletion is mainly due to anthropogenic activities excessive withdrawals for flooded agriculture in this region the trend of rainfall over 46 years is presented in table 3 for further reference 5 significance of long term dgwl change for groundwater sustainability among the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs formulated by the united nations in 2015 work in water resources has focused largely on sdg 6 access to clean water and sanitation including prioritizing sustainable development of groundwater for drinking purposes bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 mukherjee et al 2021b considerable work on drinking water quality in the developing world has focused on geogenic fluoride and arsenic e g ijumulana et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021a as well as pathogens duttagupta et al 2020 however water is also central to sdg 2 ending hunger achieving food security and nutrition in its emphasis on sustainable agriculture during the 35 years after the green revolution the shifting of agriculture to rice cultivation has resulted in a severe groundwater depletion in punjab dhillon et al 2019 kaur et al 2010 reported a water resources deficit of 2 49 million hectare meter for punjab with annual gross water requirements of 6 15 million hectare meter against the availability of both surface and ground water of 3 66 million hectare meter therefore a strategic plan should be implemented for sustainable management of groundwater the study s overall findings specify that groundwater depletion and waterlogging are significant concerns in different parts of the study area this study has emphasized the severely stressed groundwater condition as evident from the statistical trend analysis of dgwl and the assessment of the sdwli series hence efficient groundwater management strategies should be adopted especially for irrigation advanced technologies such as drip irrigation can save 80 of irrigation water relative to the usual flood irrigation method narayanamoorthy 2004 the localized drip irrigation management improves crop yield and water quality over the region it helps to minimize not only the groundwater loss in the basin but also the farmers operating cost for pumping electricity charges for irrigation sishodia et al 2016 to enhance the groundwater recharge especially in the eastern part of the study basin where the groundwater depletion rate is very high check dams and recharge pits should be constructed using surplus canal water and surface runoff aggarwal et al 2009 this will ultimately increase the recharge thereby minimizing the groundwater depletion in the future the overall findings from this study will help the decision makers and hydrogeologists sustainably manage the groundwater 6 conclusions this present study was carried out to study the multi decadal trends and spatio temporal variations of dgwl in parts of malwa region in punjab india depth of gwl data of 90 observation piezometer wells for pre and post monsoon of each year for a period of 21 years 1997 2018 have been used for the analysis trend analysis using nonparametric statistical techniques shows that most of the wells over the malwa region possess significantly increasing trends of dgwl in both pre and post monsoon seasons which implies a severely declining trend of gwl during the study period the result of trend analysis was validated with the dgwl variation maps more than 30 of tubewells in the eastern part of the study region have a severe decline of groundwater level 20 m decline of dgwl over 21 years i e 1 m year however more than 20 of tubewells in the southwestern part of the malwa region show a water level rise which causes waterlogging problems during the monsoon period the present study concludes that the groundwater level has declined with an average rate of about 40 cm year in both pre and post monsoon seasons during 1997 2018 over the malwa region the over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation mainly for paddy cultivation despite monsoonal rainfall with a sound canal irrigation system is the main reason behind this severe groundwater level decline further unevenly distributed rainfall less recharge and over dependency on groundwater resources in this region cause a sharp decline in groundwater levels crop diversification and augmentation of advanced irrigation techniques and the establishment of new recharge structures to enhance the recharge potential are needed to improve the conditions of groundwater depletion in the particular water stressed region hence need for the hour is to implement a new water act and promote new guidelines by the government to manage groundwater
