25065,marine turtles are intra seasonal iteroparous animals they nest from one to up to 14 times during the nesting season laying up to 180 eggs each time their annual reproductive effort can therefore be estimated from clutch size nesting frequency and length of the nesting season moreover the estimation of nesting frequency usually obtained from the internesting period i e the time in days between two nesting events is essential for assessing the number of females in a population however the internesting period is strongly influenced by variation in individual behaviour of the nesting female including abortion of nesting attempts it is also affected by imprecise detection of females during beach monitoring often related with a lack of fidelity to the nesting beach using an individual focused model based on capture mark recapture data we were able to statistically characterize the nesting behaviour of the populations of green turtles chelonia mydas and olive ridley turtles lepidochelys olivacea in são tomé and príncipe eastern atlantic the developed model proposes a novel approach in estimating the internesting period by including the different factors that lead to the heterogeneity observed in the duration of internesting periods across a single season corrected for the probability of a female aborting a nesting process the calculated lengths of the internesting periods for the two species are congruent with previous estimates validating the model furthermore the inference of the rank of a nest for an individual female is predicted by the model with high accuracy even when the recapture rate is low and the time between observations is long a limitation of the model is its inability to estimate the true clutch frequency at the scale of the population but it was not its purpose keywords chelonia mydas lepidochelys olivacea internesting period iteroparity nesting abortion eastern atlantic 1 introduction female marine turtles come ashore and nest several times during the nesting season at regular intervals miller 1997 the number of days between consecutive clutches named hereafter the internesting period is typical for each species alvarado and murphy 1999 for instance leatherback turtles dermochelys coriacea have the shortest internesting period typically lasting only 10 days fretey and girondot 1988 while for cheloniids this average interval spans from 12 in green turtles chelonia mydas up to 20 days in olive ridley turtles lepidochelys olivacea several factors are thought to influence this intra seasonal iteroparity pattern marine turtles as most ectotherms are mainly capital breeders storing most of their energy at the foraging sites prior to their reproductive migration bonnet et al 1998 myers and hays 2006 the shorter the nesting season is the less time females spend away from their foraging sites on the other hand when the nesting season encompasses several months different clutches of a single female will incubate under various temporal conditions marine turtles are species with temperature dependent sex determination in which sex is determined by temperature during the middle third of the development period of the embryo and so the distribution of clutches along several months could be also a strategy to ensure that both sexes are produced fuentes et al 2017 thus both shorter and longer nesting seasons can be advantageous within each nesting season the internesting period basically the number of days that elapses between 2 clutches frazer and richardson 1985 is related to the time that each clutch of eggs takes to develop inside the turtle s body cavity miller 1997 rostal et al 1996 and to the size of the cavity itself hays 2001 it would be expected that the longer the internesting periods are the more time the female has to develop more eggs and increase clutch size reducing the number of incursions on the beach where it is particularly vulnerable on every monitoring program following individually marked females the observed clutch frequency ocf is simply the number of clutches observed for a single female during the nesting season frazer and richardson 1985 and it is a key parameter in the estimation of population size e g broderick et al 2002 however the actual number of clutches laid by a female within a season is difficult to estimate due to imperfect capture probability either because of fieldwork constraints or of the ability of females to choose different nesting beaches in different nesting events tucker 2009 2010 the regularity of the internesting period ip has been used to calculate the estimated clutch frequency ecf ecf 1 d2 d1 ip with d1 representing the ordinal date of first observation of the nesting female in the season and d2 the ordinal date of last observation of the nesting female in that same season ecf is thus equal to or higher than ocf sound estimates of the interesting period are not easy to obtain for several reasons i some females abort the nesting process upon emergence on the beach not returning to nest until several days later ii some females may not be detected by patrols while being on the beach iii in most situations it is not known if the female has indeed laid eggs or if it has aborted the nesting process and iv fidelity to the nesting beach is not perfect all these different events can co occur making the estimation of the number of days between two nesting events difficult for example when a female leatherback turtle which typically nests every 10 days girondot and fretey 1996 is seen for the second time on the beach 30 days after the first visit it may be interpreted as its third nest after the first observation or the second nest after the first observation if the turtle has aborted 1 or 2 nesting processes or even the first nest if the nesting process was aborted several times it could also be the fourth nest if the internesting period of that particular female is unusually short for example seven days until now this difficulty has been overlooked and the internesting period has been determined empirically when a turtle is seen returning before the minimum expected ip internesting period for example seven days it is considered that the female did not lay a clutch during the first observation indeed six days or less could be not sufficient for ovulation and formation of eggshells miller 1997 rostal et al 1996 and thus two separate nesting events cannot take place within that time if the return interval is longer than maximum expected ip for example 18 days it is considered that the female has deposited one intermediate clutch that has not been observed frazer and richardson 1985 the local ngos associação programa tatô and fundação príncipe trust ensure complete monitoring coverage of all beaches in são tomé and príncipe islands which is complemented by the implementation of a capture mark recapture program through the tagging of nesting females providing the most complete dataset of sea turtle nest distribution in the gulf of guinea these two islands host an important green turtle rookery which is genetically distinct from all others in the atlantic formia et al 2006 j hancock unpubl data the second most common species is the olive ridley turtle believed to represent a fraction of the major rookery for olive ridley in central africa girard et al 2016 using data obtained during the monitoring programs of these two species we propose a novel modelling approach of the internesting period we combine nesting counts and tagging data obtained at a rookery level to estimate this parameter while taking into account the potential heterogeneity in the length of internesting periods resulting from female individual behavior including abortion of the nesting process 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection on são tomé island green turtles nest mostly in the southern coast with most of the nesting activity being concentrated between the beaches of jalé and cabana and also planta on príncipe island this species nests primarily in two beaches praia grande and infante with minor nesting occurring in boi and ribeira izé mocotó beaches the olive ridley turtle nests only on the island of são tomé mostly in the north of the island with most nesting activity concentrated along the 9 km stretch of coastline between the beaches of juventude and tamarindos the importance of these beaches for each species were confirmed by early surveys conducted by graff 1996 and they have been subjected to full monitoring every night from october through february since 2012 olive ridley and 2015 green turtles locations are shown in fig 1 monitoring effort during night patrols was standardized at all above mentioned beaches and set to take place each night between 6 p m and 5 a m by groups of 2 trained assistants each group covering 1 5 km stretch of contiguous coastline during each patrol data on female or track encounters was collected the monitoring protocols in place in são tomé and príncipe require that the investigators walk along the beach just above the high tide line and carefully check each one way track to confirm the presence of a turtle on the beach always ensuring that any turtle is approached from behind without using any light to further minimize interference of the turtle s natural behaviour no turtles were intercepted on their ascent on the beach and encountered turtles were approached very carefully if oviposition is not confirmed to have occurred any tagging and data collection are only performed after successful oviposition or a turtle has initiated her descent to the surf oviposition is always confirmed either by direct observation or by carefully uncovering the top layer of eggs never later than 8 h after suspected oviposition if the clutch is not found the activity is noted as false crawl no body pit or nest chamber or attempt body pit or abandoned nest chamber present flipper tagging was done to allow individual identification and follow up in consequent nesting events by placing a pair of inconel flipper tags national band and tag co style 681 on the trailing edge of each of the fore flippers after egg laying 2 2 data preparation and use the data collection implemented during the monitoring program allowed the compilation of the dates of the first and all subsequent observations re captures of individual females within each season on each beach our dataset comprised of 757 individual green turtle females n 1738 captures and recaptures over two seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 and 635 individual olive ridley turtles n 700 captures and recaptures over four seasons 2012 2017 a summary of the data used is found on table 1 2 3 model development a stochastic model was formulated to describe the nesting process after the first observation of a female on a beach fig 2 if the female was unable to nest and aborted with a probability pabort then it was expected to return for another nesting attempt after logn meanabort sdabort days when it returned to the beach this female would be seen with a probability pcapture after a successful nest the female could not return to nest before the minimum interesting period minip when used minip is an integer its return occurred after logn meanip sdip nclutch 1 deltameanip with nclutch being the rank of the nest i e 1st 2nd etc this female would produce x clutches see below about parametrization of x if it was its last recorded nesting event for the season and it was successful we considered this observation as the final one the model is schematized in fig 2 the distribution of the number of clutches per female after its first observation on the beach df cf is the common acronym for clutch frequency d rather than c is used in this case to indicate that it is not the true cf can be obtained from a parametric model logn meandf sddf an alternative parametrization uses df 1 df 2 to df max df 0 is fixed to 1 and the probability that a female laid x clutches after its first observation on the beach is px abs df x abs df i this parametrization has the advantage of not forcing any shape on the distribution of the clutch frequency it is important to note that df is the distribution of the number of clutches after the first observation of an individual female on the beach and therefore it is not equal to cf which is the distribution of the number of clutches that a female is laying during a complete nesting season taking into account that some females are not observed during their first nesting attempt this model generated a theoretical distribution of the number of observations for 0 to maxdays with maxdays being the maximum number of days before a recapture after the first observation then a set of expected number of captures cday for days 0 to m after the initial capture was obtained 0 indicates that a female was seen twice in the same night after aborting its first nesting attempt these values were transformed into probabilities using pday cday cday fig 2 the larger the n the closer the distribution of pm is to the true distribution the development and testing of the model was performed with the green turtle data because nesting is concentrated on few individual beaches which facilitates the full coverage of each beach by the night patrols and thus increasing the chances of observing a turtle olive ridley turtles nest sparsely over several kilometres of coast reducing the chances of encounters by the night patrols for this reason observations are much sparser than for green turtles we used the data collected for this species for testing and validating the model in cases when recapture rates may be lower resulting in lower quality data this situation is indeed frequent in marine turtle monitoring programs that suffer constraints in field data collection 2 3 1 fitting the parameters of the nesting process the data obtained from the beach monitoring fig 3 was organized in k observations i e k individuals in series of ni days i is the individual and days the number of days after first observation with 0 no capture and 1 capture the likelihood of the observation i given the outputs pday of the model is based on a multinomial distribution l i n 0 n i 0 n m n i m n i n i 0 n i m p 0 n i 0 p m n i m the log likelihood of all the observations given the model is l o g l i 1 k l o g l i with li being the likelihood to capture the individual i after ni 0 to ni m days l is the likelihood of the observations for all the k individuals in this formula the organization level is the individual an alternative option is to use the daily sum top of fig 3 as the values for ndays in this case the organization level is the nesting event but the females with a larger estimated clutch frequency will have a larger impact on global likelihood than the ones with lower estimated clutch frequency this solution has not been retained here the parameters pcapture and pabort were fitted as logit of the corresponding probabilities to ensure that they remained estimable at all times without defining constraints during the fit the parameter values maximizing the likelihood were fitted using the nelder mead followed by broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno method with r package optimx nash and varadhan 2011 to test the suitability of different models fitted with the same datasets we used the aic estimator burnham and anderson 2002 aic is a measure of the quality of the fit penalized by the number of parameters used calculated as 2 log l 2 p with p being the number of parameters of the model akaike 1974 models with lower aic have more chance to better represent the process that generated the data the model has been scripted in r language and is available in the r package phenology version 7 1 and above girondot 2018b 2 3 2 stability of likelihood a stochastic model was used to generate the distribution of pday see previous section thus from run to run the values change we needed to minimize the inter run variability of the likelihood of data given the model to ensure that a maximum likelihood fit could operate under a realistic computing time to determine the best combination of the number of replicates and computing time we ran the model with 104 to 105 steps by 104 steps and 2 105 to 2 106 by 105 steps replicates to study the dispersion of the log likelihood for this test we used the parameters at maximum likelihood fitted using 106 replicates 2 3 3 identifiability of the parameters the metropolis hastings algorithm is a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is not available or difficult chib and greenberg 1995 it was used to estimate the posterior distribution for each parameter over 10 000 iterations this value has been chosen based on the raftery and lewis 1992 diagnostic maximum likelihood estimates were used as initial parameter values during the mcmc search using no adaptation iteration proposed distributions were adapted after every 500 iterations using the method of rosenthal 2011 as implemented in the r package helpersmg girondot 2018a priors were all obtained from a uniform distribution with limits being always very wide to ensure that a large range of parameter values could be checked see supplementary material convergence was first visually examined to ensure that the time series of the parameters were stationary and then tested using the heidelberger and welch 1983 diagnostic the standard error of the parameters was estimated after correction for autocorrelation roberts et al 1996 results from the mcmc were analyzed using the r package coda version 0 19 1 plummer et al 2011 covariations of all parameter pairs were checked visually using bivariate plots and pearson correlation coefficients the comparison between the distribution of priors and posteriors after the metropolis hastings mcmc run show that some parameters cannot be estimated using this model because the posterior distribution is very similar to the prior distribution the df distribution meandf sddf or df x as well as the capture and abort probabilities pcapture and pabort are not identifiable high values 9 of the parameter minip can be excluded but the lowest cannot finally the parameters meanip sdip deltameanip meanabort and sdabort are identifiable see supplementary material the only very strong covariation of parameters is between meanip and deltameanip their negative correlation indicates that when deltameanip tends towards 0 meanip is lower see supplementary materials 2 3 4 from estimating the number of days between observations to clutch frequency by knowing the distribution of the number of days between two clutches or nesting abortions as well as the probabilities of a turtle aborting a nesting process or being observed captured it was possible to relate the number of days between two observations on the beach and the true number of clutches between these two observations a total of 106 simulations were performed using the green turtle fitted parameters in each simulation for each turtle captured we recorded the number of days after its first observation capture on the beach and the number of clutches observed being laid by that female up to that day consolidating this information on a data frame we used it to calculate the probability that an observation of a female x days after its first observation was the nth clutch 2 3 5 stability of the likelihood the likelihood calculated with 104 iterations was quickly estimated but the inter run likelihood variability was too high to be used during the fitting process on the other hand the calculation of the likelihood with 106 iterations took too long to be used routinely a number of 105 iterations was considered an adequate compromise as it provided a correct fit to our data fig 4 and was used thereafter 3 results the distributions of the internesting periods for the two turtle species considering both nesting seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 and islands são tomé and or príncipe are shown in fig 5 the mean shortening of the ip along the successive clutches was similar between different datasets therefore we chose to combine these to have a global estimate for the region with the lowest confidence interval 3 1 green turtles the patterns of the internesting periods observed for either são tomé or príncipe green turtles were very similar fig 3 several peaks were observed for 12 24 36 days after the first observation and successive peaks were entangled i e the lowest part of one peak distribution overlapped the highest part of the previous one other peaks were observed after 40 days but they were more difficult to discriminate because the dispersion of the peaks for the higher number of days is higher making the peaks flatter the number of days between the first and the last observation was highly related to the ordinal date of first observation linear model t test p 0 002 the earlier the turtle was first seen the longer it was observed on the beach the green turtle mean internesting period between the first and the second clutch was estimated at 12 32 days 95 confidence interval from 12 26 to 12 37 the 95 range of all internesting periods was between 10 10 and 15 05 days table 2 showing also the values estimated for other populations the internesting period became shorter as the number of clutches increased deltameanip parameters are all negative supplementary materials this effect is noticed for each of the 4 datasets as well as when combined and the inclusion of the deltameanip parameter greatly improved the fitting of the model δaic 19 76 akaike weight p 0 999 the fitted estimation of the minimal number of days between two clutches was 8 12 days 95 confidence interval from 8 11 to 8 13 days when a nesting attempt was aborted in our model simulation the time before the next attempt was on average 1 59 days 95 confidence interval from 1 57 to 1 60 and 95 of the values were between 0 23 10 88 days it should be noted that the upper 95 limit of the confidence interval 10 88 days was higher than minip 8 12 days therefore the return to the nesting beach after an abortion event could be confused with a new clutch the probability that a female laid a nth clutch when it was recorded x days after its first observation during the season is shown in fig 6 table 3 depicts the probabilities of the various clutch ranks according to the different number of days after the first observation shown as dotted vertical lines in fig 6 3 2 olive ridley turtles the mean internesting period between two successive clutches was estimated at 22 92 days 95 confidence interval ranged from 22 85 to 23 00 days the 95 range of internesting periods varied between 16 58 and 31 70 days table 2 showing also the values estimated for other populations the change of the internesting period dependent on the progression of clutch rank deltameanip parameter could not be calculated due to the paucity of recapture data and deltameanip was fixed to 0 the fitted minimum of the minimal number of days between two clutches was 9 16 95 confidence interval from 8 37 to 9 95 days when we simulated the abortion of a nesting attempt the time until the next attempt averaged 3 47 days 95 confidence interval ranged from 3 23 to 3 71 days and 95 of the values are between 0 54 22 21 days similarly to what was observed for green turtles the upper 95 limit of the confidence interval 23 24 days is higher than minip 9 16 days meaning that the return on the beach after an abortion event could be confused with a new clutch all the results are presented in supplementary materials with the r scripts used for analysis 4 discussion for decades the number of nests counted during a nesting season was converted to the number of nesting females using the formula number of nests clutch frequency gerrodette and taylor 1999 the estimation of total number of nests during a nesting season has received general solutions girondot 2010 2017 girondot and rizzo 2015 and it can be considered as being a solved problem for most of the situations on the other hand a general procedure for the estimation of the number of nests per female clutch frequency is still needed briane et al 2007 the most common procedure used the formula ecf 1 d2 d1 ip with d1 representing the ordinal date of first observation of the nesting female in the season and d2 the ordinal date of last observation of the nesting female in that same season and ip being the internesting period frazer and richardson 1985 estimation of mean ip is then done by averaging the number of days between all consecutive nesting attempts however the actual number of clutches laid by a female within a season is not known due to imperfect capture probability either because of fieldwork constraints or of the ability of females to choose different nesting beaches in different nesting events tucker 2009 2010 therefore we can never be sure that two observations of the same nesting female on the beach refer to consecutive nesting events or if some were missed in consequence the quality of the ip estimate is dependent on our ability to count the true number of nests deposited by a female which may vary from female to female and is nearly impossible to know in a general move in ecology from pattern to process swihart et al 2002 the estimate of such an important parameter cannot be based simply on very strong untestable assumptions this move is particularly relevant for species with a complex life cycle such as marine turtles for which the interpretation of changes in numbers in terms of population mechanisms is quite challenging the identification of a high number of individual females allowed us to observe the typical pattern of succession of peaks at multiples of 12 days which is typical of green turtles fig 3 the broadening of the peaks observed in longer returns is likely due to two phenomena the variability of the internesting periods and the fuzziness resulting from the high rate of nesting abortion classically observed for this species mortimer and portier 1989 this pattern was less clear for olive ridley turtles and it was impossible to clearly identify peaks within our data fig 3 however this result is particularly important because it showed that the internesting period can be evaluated even when data are sparse as for olive ridleys the estimation of the internesting interval for both studied species was very reliable according to the diagnostic tools used showing that the design and implementation of an individual focused statistical model was successful at producing a robust estimate of the internesting period of female marine turtles these internesting periods are likely to be dependent on the turtle s physiological reproductive capacity as well as on local external primarily anthropogenic factors that may disturb turtles attempting to nest tiwari and bjorndal 2000 the observation that the nesting season is longer for early nesters has also been noted for leatherback turtles in french guiana fretey and girondot 1989 two non exclusive explanations were proposed either the turtles arriving first in the nesting site laid a higher number of clutches or most likely the turtles that are seen first later in the season have already nested but were not observed moreover our model shows an important advance in estimating the rank of a clutch in relation to the date of the first observation of a turtle on the beach fig 6 with a particularly high probability of success when the interval of days is small and close to a multiple of the mean internesting period for example for green turtles when a female is observed on the beach after 12 and 24 days the probability that these nests correspond to its second and third clutches are respectively 0 997 and 0 992 table 3 if the number of days is not a multiple of the internesting period then the rank of the clutch is uncertain for an observation 19 days after the previous observation the probability that it is the second or third clutches are 0 578 and 0 397 respectively table 3 when the number of days increase surprisingly the determination of the rank of the clutch did not degrade too much for example if a female is observed after 100 days the probability that it is her 10th clutch is 0 71 table 3 another interesting result from our model is that we demonstrate that for green turtles the internesting period declines as clutch rank increases the inverse relation between internesting period and clutch rank was also demonstrated in loggerhead turtles using data from intensive field work limpus 1985 it is tempting to link this decrease of the internesting period with the lower number of eggs present in the clutches of higher rank as shown in loggerheads limpus 1985 but testing this hypothesis with our dataset was not possible 5 conclusion the use of capture mark recapture cmr studies on nesting beaches can be used to estimate the minimum number of reproductive turtles in each season but interpreting the nesting history of a female is a prerequisite to be able to convert an observed total number of clutches into an estimate of the number of females in a population we consider that up to now no model is yet able to correctly convert a dataset of observed or estimated clutch frequency ocf and ecf into a number of females in a population as the impracticality of assessing this parameter is directly due to field constraints and to the variability in female behaviour the common restraints posed by incomplete datasets that include extended time intervals between individual re observations is solved by our model which can be used to determine with high probability the rank of an observed clutch since the first observation moreover our model demonstrates the usefulness of cmr datasets in understanding patterns in the individual behaviour of a female on the beach and how these affect the variation in internesting periods for a given population declarations of interest none acknowledgments we thank all the beach monitoring staff of marapa in são

ribeira izé mocotó beaches the olive ridley turtle nests only on the island of são tomé mostly in the north of the island with most nesting activity concentrated along the 9 km stretch of coastline between the beaches of juventude and tamarindos the importance of these beaches for each species were confirmed by early surveys conducted by graff 1996 and they have been subjected to full monitoring every night from october through february since 2012 olive ridley and 2015 green turtles locations are shown in fig 1 monitoring effort during night patrols was standardized at all above mentioned beaches and set to take place each night between 6 p m and 5 a m by groups of 2 trained assistants each group covering 1 5 km stretch of contiguous coastline during each patrol data on female or track encounters was collected the monitoring protocols in place in são tomé and príncipe require that the investigators walk along the beach just above the high tide line and carefully check each one way track to confirm the presence of a turtle on the beach always ensuring that any turtle is approached from behind without using any light to further minimize interference of the turtle s natural behaviour no turtles were intercepted on their ascent on the beach and encountered turtles were approached very carefully if oviposition is not confirmed to have occurred any tagging and data collection are only performed after successful oviposition or a turtle has initiated her descent to the surf oviposition is always confirmed either by direct observation or by carefully uncovering the top layer of eggs never later than 8 h after suspected oviposition if the clutch is not found the activity is noted as false crawl no body pit or nest chamber or attempt body pit or abandoned nest chamber present flipper tagging was done to allow individual identification and follow up in consequent nesting events by placing a pair of inconel flipper tags national band and tag co style 681 on the trailing edge of each of the fore flippers after egg laying 2 2 data preparation and use the data collection implemented during the monitoring program allowed the compilation of the dates of the first and all subsequent observations re captures of individual females within each season on each beach our dataset comprised of 757 individual green turtle females n 1738 captures and recaptures over two seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 and 635 individual olive ridley turtles n 700 captures and recaptures over four seasons 2012 2017 a summary of the data used is found on table 1 2 3 model development a stochastic model was formulated to describe the nesting process after the first observation of a female on a beach fig 2 if the female was unable to nest and aborted with a probability pabort then it was expected to return for another nesting attempt after logn meanabort sdabort days when it returned to the beach this female would be seen with a probability pcapture after a successful nest the female could not return to nest before the minimum interesting period minip when used minip is an integer its return occurred after logn meanip sdip nclutch 1 deltameanip with nclutch being the rank of the nest i e 1st 2nd etc this female would produce x clutches see below about parametrization of x if it was its last recorded nesting event for the season and it was successful we considered this observation as the final one the model is schematized in fig 2 the distribution of the number of clutches per female after its first observation on the beach df cf is the common acronym for clutch frequency d rather than c is used in this case to indicate that it is not the true cf can be obtained from a parametric model logn meandf sddf an alternative parametrization uses df 1 df 2 to df max df 0 is fixed to 1 and the probability that a female laid x clutches after its first observation on the beach is px abs df x abs df i this parametrization has the advantage of not forcing any shape on the distribution of the clutch frequency it is important to note that df is the distribution of the number of clutches after the first observation of an individual female on the beach and therefore it is not equal to cf which is the distribution of the number of clutches that a female is laying during a complete nesting season taking into account that some females are not observed during their first nesting attempt this model generated a theoretical distribution of the number of observations for 0 to maxdays with maxdays being the maximum number of days before a recapture after the first observation then a set of expected number of captures cday for days 0 to m after the initial capture was obtained 0 indicates that a female was seen twice in the same night after aborting its first nesting attempt these values were transformed into probabilities using pday cday cday fig 2 the larger the n the closer the distribution of pm is to the true distribution the development and testing of the model was performed with the green turtle data because nesting is concentrated on few individual beaches which facilitates the full coverage of each beach by the night patrols and thus increasing the chances of observing a turtle olive ridley turtles nest sparsely over several kilometres of coast reducing the chances of encounters by the night patrols for this reason observations are much sparser than for green turtles we used the data collected for this species for testing and validating the model in cases when recapture rates may be lower resulting in lower quality data this situation is indeed frequent in marine turtle monitoring programs that suffer constraints in field data collection 2 3 1 fitting the parameters of the nesting process the data obtained from the beach monitoring fig 3 was organized in k observations i e k individuals in series of ni days i is the individual and days the number of days after first observation with 0 no capture and 1 capture the likelihood of the observation i given the outputs pday of the model is based on a multinomial distribution l i n 0 n i 0 n m n i m n i n i 0 n i m p 0 n i 0 p m n i m the log likelihood of all the observations given the model is l o g l i 1 k l o g l i with li being the likelihood to capture the individual i after ni 0 to ni m days l is the likelihood of the observations for all the k individuals in this formula the organization level is the individual an alternative option is to use the daily sum top of fig 3 as the values for ndays in this case the organization level is the nesting event but the females with a larger estimated clutch frequency will have a larger impact on global likelihood than the ones with lower estimated clutch frequency this solution has not been retained here the parameters pcapture and pabort were fitted as logit of the corresponding probabilities to ensure that they remained estimable at all times without defining constraints during the fit the parameter values maximizing the likelihood were fitted using the nelder mead followed by broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno method with r package optimx nash and varadhan 2011 to test the suitability of different models fitted with the same datasets we used the aic estimator burnham and anderson 2002 aic is a measure of the quality of the fit penalized by the number of parameters used calculated as 2 log l 2 p with p being the number of parameters of the model akaike 1974 models with lower aic have more chance to better represent the process that generated the data the model has been scripted in r language and is available in the r package phenology version 7 1 and above girondot 2018b 2 3 2 stability of likelihood a stochastic model was used to generate the distribution of pday see previous section thus from run to run the values change we needed to minimize the inter run variability of the likelihood of data given the model to ensure that a maximum likelihood fit could operate under a realistic computing time to determine the best combination of the number of replicates and computing time we ran the model with 104 to 105 steps by 104 steps and 2 105 to 2 106 by 105 steps replicates to study the dispersion of the log likelihood for this test we used the parameters at maximum likelihood fitted using 106 replicates 2 3 3 identifiability of the parameters the metropolis hastings algorithm is a markov chain monte carlo mcmc method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is not available or difficult chib and greenberg 1995 it was used to estimate the posterior distribution for each parameter over 10 000 iterations this value has been chosen based on the raftery and lewis 1992 diagnostic maximum likelihood estimates were used as initial parameter values during the mcmc search using no adaptation iteration proposed distributions were adapted after every 500 iterations using the method of rosenthal 2011 as implemented in the r package helpersmg girondot 2018a priors were all obtained from a uniform distribution with limits being always very wide to ensure that a large range of parameter values could be checked see supplementary material convergence was first visually examined to ensure that the time series of the parameters were stationary and then tested using the heidelberger and welch 1983 diagnostic the standard error of the parameters was estimated after correction for autocorrelation roberts et al 1996 results from the mcmc were analyzed using the r package coda version 0 19 1 plummer et al 2011 covariations of all parameter pairs were checked visually using bivariate plots and pearson correlation coefficients the comparison between the distribution of priors and posteriors after the metropolis hastings mcmc run show that some parameters cannot be estimated using this model because the posterior distribution is very similar to the prior distribution the df distribution meandf sddf or df x as well as the capture and abort probabilities pcapture and pabort are not identifiable high values 9 of the parameter minip can be excluded but the lowest cannot finally the parameters meanip sdip deltameanip meanabort and sdabort are identifiable see supplementary material the only very strong covariation of parameters is between meanip and deltameanip their negative correlation indicates that when deltameanip tends towards 0 meanip is lower see supplementary materials 2 3 4 from estimating the number of days between observations to clutch frequency by knowing the distribution of the number of days between two clutches or nesting abortions as well as the probabilities of a turtle aborting a nesting process or being observed captured it was possible to relate the number of days between two observations on the beach and the true number of clutches between these two observations a total of 106 simulations were performed using the green turtle fitted parameters in each simulation for each turtle captured we recorded the number of days after its first observation capture on the beach and the number of clutches observed being laid by that female up to that day consolidating this information on a data frame we used it to calculate the probability that an observation of a female x days after its first observation was the nth clutch 2 3 5 stability of the likelihood the likelihood calculated with 104 iterations was quickly estimated but the inter run likelihood variability was too high to be used during the fitting process on the other hand the calculation of the likelihood with 106 iterations took too long to be used routinely a number of 105 iterations was considered an adequate compromise as it provided a correct fit to our data fig 4 and was used thereafter 3 results the distributions of the internesting periods for the two turtle species considering both nesting seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 and islands são tomé and or príncipe are shown in fig 5 the mean shortening of the ip along the successive clutches was similar between different datasets therefore we chose to combine these to have a global estimate for the region with the lowest confidence interval 3 1 green turtles the patterns of the internesting periods observed for either são tomé or príncipe green turtles were very similar fig 3 several peaks were observed for 12 24 36 days after the first observation and successive peaks were entangled i e the lowest part of one peak distribution overlapped the highest part of the previous one other peaks were observed after 40 days but they were more difficult to discriminate because the dispersion of the peaks for the higher number of days is higher making the peaks flatter the number of days between the first and the last observation was highly related to the ordinal date of first observation linear model t test p 0 002 the earlier the turtle was first seen the longer it was observed on the beach the green turtle mean internesting period between the first and the second clutch was estimated at 12 32 days 95 confidence interval from 12 26 to 12 37 the 95 range of all internesting periods was between 10 10 and 15 05 days table 2 showing also the values estimated for other populations the internesting period became shorter as the number of clutches increased deltameanip parameters are all negative supplementary materials this effect is noticed for each of the 4 datasets as well as when combined and the inclusion of the deltameanip parameter greatly improved the fitting of the model δaic 19 76 akaike weight p 0 999 the fitted estimation of the minimal number of days between two clutches was 8 12 days 95 confidence interval from 8 11 to 8 13 days when a nesting attempt was aborted in our model simulation the time before the next attempt was on average 1 59 days 95 confidence interval from 1 57 to 1 60 and 95 of the values were between 0 23 10 88 days it should be noted that the upper 95 limit of the confidence interval 10 88 days was higher than minip 8 12 days therefore the return to the nesting beach after an abortion event could be confused with a new clutch the probability that a female laid a nth clutch when it was recorded x days after its first observation during the season is shown in fig 6 table 3 depicts the probabilities of the various clutch ranks according to the different number of days after the first observation shown as dotted vertical lines in fig 6 3 2 olive ridley turtles the mean internesting period between two successive clutches was estimated at 22 92 days 95 confidence interval ranged from 22 85 to 23 00 days the 95 range of internesting periods varied between 16 58 and 31 70 days table 2 showing also the values estimated for other populations the change of the internesting period dependent on the progression of clutch rank deltameanip parameter could not be calculated due to the paucity of recapture data and deltameanip was fixed to 0 the fitted minimum of the minimal number of days between two clutches was 9 16 95 confidence interval from 8 37 to 9 95 days when we simulated the abortion of a nesting attempt the time until the next attempt averaged 3 47 days 95 confidence interval ranged from 3 23 to 3 71 days and 95 of the values are between 0 54 22 21 days similarly to what was observed for green turtles the upper 95 limit of the confidence interval 23 24 days is higher than minip 9 16 days meaning that the return on the beach after an abortion event could be confused with a new clutch all the results are presented in supplementary materials with the r scripts used for analysis 4 discussion for decades the number of nests counted during a nesting season was converted to the number of nesting females using the formula number of nests clutch frequency gerrodette and taylor 1999 the estimation of total number of nests during a nesting season has received general solutions girondot 2010 2017 girondot and rizzo 2015 and it can be considered as being a solved problem for most of the situations on the other hand a general procedure for the estimation of the number of nests per female clutch frequency is still needed briane et al 2007 the most common procedure used the formula ecf 1 d2 d1 ip with d1 representing the ordinal date of first observation of the nesting female in the season and d2 the ordinal date of last observation of the nesting female in that same season and ip being the internesting period frazer and richardson 1985 estimation of mean ip is then done by averaging the number of days between all consecutive nesting attempts however the actual number of clutches laid by a female within a season is not known due to imperfect capture probability either because of fieldwork constraints or of the ability of females to choose different nesting beaches in different nesting events tucker 2009 2010 therefore we can never be sure that two observations of the same nesting female on the beach refer to consecutive nesting events or if some were missed in consequence the quality of the ip estimate is dependent on our ability to count the true number of nests deposited by a female which may vary from female to female and is nearly impossible to know in a general move in ecology from pattern to process swihart et al 2002 the estimate of such an important parameter cannot be based simply on very strong untestable assumptions this move is particularly relevant for species with a complex life cycle such as marine turtles for which the interpretation of changes in numbers in terms of population mechanisms is quite challenging the identification of a high number of individual females allowed us to observe the typical pattern of succession of peaks at multiples of 12 days which is typical of green turtles fig 3 the broadening of the peaks observed in longer returns is likely due to two phenomena the variability of the internesting periods and the fuzziness resulting from the high rate of nesting abortion classically observed for this species mortimer and portier 1989 this pattern was less clear for olive ridley turtles and it was impossible to clearly identify peaks within our data fig 3 however this result is particularly important because it showed that the internesting period can be evaluated even when data are sparse as for olive ridleys the estimation of the internesting interval for both studied species was very reliable according to the diagnostic tools used showing that the design and implementation of an individual focused statistical model was successful at producing a robust estimate of the internesting period of female marine turtles these internesting periods are likely to be dependent on the turtle s physiological reproductive capacity as well as on local external primarily anthropogenic factors that may disturb turtles attempting to nest tiwari and bjorndal 2000 the observation that the nesting season is longer for early nesters has also been noted for leatherback turtles in french guiana fretey and girondot 1989 two non exclusive explanations were proposed either the turtles arriving first in the nesting site laid a higher number of clutches or most likely the turtles that are seen first later in the season have already nested but were not observed moreover our model shows an important advance in estimating the rank of a clutch in relation to the date of the first observation of a turtle on the beach fig 6 with a particularly high probability of success when the interval of days is small and close to a multiple of the mean internesting period for example for green turtles when a female is observed on the beach after 12 and 24 days the probability that these nests correspond to its second and third clutches are respectively 0 997 and 0 992 table 3 if the number of days is not a multiple of the internesting period then the rank of the clutch is uncertain for an observation 19 days after the previous observation the probability that it is the second or third clutches are 0 578 and 0 397 respectively table 3 when the number of days increase surprisingly the determination of the rank of the clutch did not degrade too much for example if a female is observed after 100 days the probability that it is her 10th clutch is 0 71 table 3 another interesting result from our model is that we demonstrate that for green turtles the internesting period declines as clutch rank increases the inverse relation between internesting period and clutch rank was also demonstrated in loggerhead turtles using data from intensive field work limpus 1985 it is tempting to link this decrease of the internesting period with the lower number of eggs present in the clutches of higher rank as shown in loggerheads limpus 1985 but testing this hypothesis with our dataset was not possible 5 conclusion the use of capture mark recapture cmr studies on nesting beaches can be used to estimate the minimum number of reproductive turtles in each season but interpreting the nesting history of a female is a prerequisite to be able to convert an observed total number of clutches into an estimate of the number of females in a population we consider that up to now no model is yet able to correctly convert a dataset of observed or estimated clutch frequency ocf and ecf into a number of females in a population as the impracticality of assessing this parameter is directly due to field constraints and to the variability in female behaviour the common restraints posed by incomplete datasets that include extended time intervals between individual re observations is solved by our model which can be used to determine with high probability the rank of an observed clutch since the first observation moreover our model demonstrates the usefulness of cmr datasets in understanding patterns in the individual behaviour of a female on the beach and how these affect the variation in internesting periods for a given population declarations of interest none acknowledgments we thank all the beach monitoring staff of marapa in são

25066,the number of invasive species is increasing throughout the world one of the corner stones to successfully control them is to better estimate their dispersal capabilities for flying insects dispersal performance is commonly estimated through flight mill and mark release recapture experiments however each approach has its own bias over and under estimating flying distances respectively the objective of this study was to develop an individual based dispersal model to circumvent these drawbacks the shape of the dispersal kernel was calibrated on distances recorded in flight mill experiments previously done and then model parameters were fine tuned based on mark release recapture experiments presented in this study the pine sawyer beetle monochamus galloprovincialis was used as case study because it is the european vector of the invasive pine wood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus recognized as one of the biggest threats to pine forests worldwide the best fitted model to mark release recapture data was parameterized with a mean flying distance of 2000 m per day which is consistent with flight mill data it was used to further simulate the dispersal of 100 beetles in non fragmented pine forests the cumulative flight distance was 63 km on average at the end of their adult life stage and the mean dispersal distance as the crow flies was of ca 13 km at the end of the maturation period when most nematodes have been already transmitted to host pines via shoot feeding about 80 of the insects were located at more than 500 m from the emergence point these outcomes clearly question the relevance of clear cut zones of 500 m radius required by the european regulation for the eradication of the invasive nematode such dispersal model could be used to support decision making for eradication programs keywords bursaphelenchus xylophilus dispersal model flight distance monochamus galloprovincialis pine wood nematode mark release recapture 1 introduction due to the ecological damage and economic impacts caused by invasive species various management and control measures have to be implemented ranging from early detection eradication containment slow the spread and biological control wittenberg and cock 2001 sharov et al 2002 meentemeyer et al 2008 a corner stone for the success of invasive pests control is to better know their biology and behavior in particular a better estimation of their dispersal capacity is crucial as it affects both their establishment capability robinet and liebhold 2009 tobin et al 2011 and spread rate turchin 1998 although radio tracking is the most accurate method for monitoring animal dispersal in the wild it is often impossible to track small sized species as they cannot carry heavy equipment compared to their own weight or because they can disperse over large areas in this case indirect measures are generally used for insect species that disperse by flying mark release recapture experiments and flight mill experiments are commonly used turchin 1998 martí campoy et al 2016 however each method has its own bias data recorded on flight mills represent artificial flight performance and usually overestimate dispersal capacities while data recorded in mark release recapture hereafter mrr experiments represent interception distances and are limited by the number of traps and the distance between the release point and the furthest trap thus resulting in underestimation of flight performance therefore precisely estimating the dispersal capabilities of insects is often challenging one of the biggest threats of pine forests across the world is the pine wood nematode pwn bursaphelenchus xylophilus as it can potentially kill a pine tree within a few weeks suzuki 2002 webster and mota 2008 vicente et al 2012 native to north america dropkin et al 1981 it has invaded japan in 1905 yano 1913 china in 1982 cheng et al 1986 korea in 1988 yi et al 1989 and portugal in 1999 mota et al 1999 where it has caused extensive mortality it was also detected in spain in 2008 robertson et al 2011 to disperse from one tree to another the pine wood nematode needs an insect vector which always belongs to the monochamus genus in portugal the pine sawyer beetle monochamus galloprovincialis olivier 1795 is the only insect known to carry the pine wood nematode sousa et al 2002 but its flight capability is still not well known to prevent the spread of the pine wood nematode within the european union the european union regulation implementing decision 2012 535 eu requires the member states to implement emergency measures the current contingency plan consists of surveys for nematode detection eradication measures to eliminate the nematode where it is present and containment measures to prevent a further spread of the nematode where it cannot be eradicated the requested eradication measure is to fell remove and dispose of all susceptible plants within a zone called clear cut zone ccz of a minimum radius of 500 m that may be reduced to 100 m subject to conditions around any infected tree despite the regulation measures imposed by the european union the pwn has spread to a large part of portugal and has been repeatedly detected in spain abelleira et al 2011 vicente et al 2012 assessing the dispersal distance of the insect vector is therefore a crucial step to improve the management strategy of the pwn where it has been introduced several mark release recapture experiments have been conducted to determine the dispersal capability of m galloprovincialis in the iberian peninsula the advantage of this method is to measure the dispersal distance of individuals in the field as they were supposed to have very limited flight capabilities traps were generally installed in the neighborhood of the release points e g up to 0 5 km and 0 76 km etxebeste et al 2016 and thus most adults have been caught are very short distances when traps were installed further some insects were caught at greater distances at more than 3 km from the release points with a maximal distance of 5 3 km etxebeste et al 2016 7 1 km hernández et al 2011 8 3 km gallego et al 2012 and 22 1 km mas et al 2013 consequently it seems that the interception distance can be relatively high in some cases the variability in recapture distance between these experiments probably reveals the dilemma in placing the traps when traps are installed close to the release point they catch more insects but obviously long recapture distances cannot be observed turchin 1998 when the traps are installed far from the release point there is low chance to recapture an insect insects that were not caught in the traps may have dispersed further and insects caught in the traps would have perhaps been able to disperse further if they were not caught another method commonly used to estimate the flight performance of insects consists in testing individuals on a flight mill in this method individuals are placed in artificial conditions and the flight performance recorded on a flight mill may not be fully representative of the dispersal capability in the field however it provides an accurate estimate of the probability distribution of flight distances and thus of the proportion of beetles that are able to fly further than the others it also allows recording the distance flown by each individual over its life span under controlled conditions and eventually comparing the effects of different treatments e g according to age sex and temperature conditions the flight performance has already been measured in this way for several insect species such as bark beetle jactel and gaillard 1991 codling moth schumacher et al 1997 mosquito briegel et al 2001 peach fruit moth ishiguri and shirai 2004 monarch butterfly bradley and altizer 2005 emerald ash borer taylor et al 2010 pine processionary moth robinet et al 2012 and predatory ladybirds maes et al 2014 the flight performance of adult beetles of m galloprovincialis was also tested with this method david et al 2014 2015 when emerging from a tree adult beetles are immature for approximately 20 days naves et al 2006 at this immature stage they do not respond to sex pheromone attraction and thus cannot be caught by pheromone traps during this period of sexual maturation young adults are the main vector responsible for nematode transmission which takes place when insect are feeding on fresh pine twigs vectors can transmit the nematode for about 10 weeks since their emergence naves et al 2007 using automatically recording flight mills david et al 2015 showed that flight distance performed each day by immature beetles increased progressively as beetles were aging probably as they develop their muscles and accumulate energy when feeding until reaching a limit in a second experiment david et al 2014 measured the flight performance of mature beetles as 2 km per testing day on average 8 km maximum however it is unknown whether they can fly these distances every day 2 km per day or during the whole week 2 km 7 0 3 km per day as they were tested only once per week during their entire mature adult lifespan they could fly 16 km on average 63 km maximum although these flight distances are higher than the recapture distances their direct comparison is impossible because these distances do not represent the same dispersal measure interception distance versus artificial flight performance individual movement is the result of a complex combination of four basic components internal state of the individual e g its physiology its motion and navigation capacities and external factors e g environmental conditions nathan et al 2008 baguette et al 2014 this movement can be seen as a sequence of several paths going from one point to another each path is generally characterized by a straight line between these two points which can be fully described either by the cartesian coordinates of these two points or by their polar coordinates reporting their distance and angle nathan et al 2012 we used this classical framework of movement ecology to design an individual based dispersal model to simulate the movement of individuals various dispersal models has been developed turchin 1998 some models described the spread of a population such as reaction diffusion models shigesada and kawasaki 1997 whilst other models based on random walks were able to simulate individuals trajectories in the latter case successive dispersal distances and directions were then randomly chosen to characterize the individual s path turchin 1998 for instance these dispersal distances can be chosen from a dispersal kernel providing the probability distribution of dispersal distances the shape of the dispersal kernel is important to define the proportion of individuals able to disperse at long distance klein et al 2006 nathan et al 2012 in this study we developed such an individual based model using both dispersal measures flight mill and mark release recapture data to determine the potential dispersal capability of the insect vector of the pine wood nematode in europe firstly we calibrated the individual based dispersal model using the distances recorded in flight mill experiments david et al 2014 2015 to capture the shape of the dispersal distance distribution then we conducted mark release recapture experiments with both immature and mature m galloprovincialis beetles in a pine plantation landscape to fine tune model parameters fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 calibration of the dispersal kernel with flight mill data the individual based model describes the dispersal of immature and mature m galloprovincialis beetles based on a several parameters table 1 the shape of the dispersal kernel negative exponential model see sm1 was fitted to the flight performance of both mature beetles 35 mature males and 26 mature females and immature beetles recorded on flight mill 49 immature males and 49 immature females david et al 2014 2015 the beetles used in these experiments were collected in south western france in a pine forest each immature beetle was tested during 10 min while each mature beetle was tested during 2 h each week until its death hereafter we present first the model parameterization for mature beetles and then for immature beetles as the latter was derived from the former all the simulations were done in r r core team 2015 2 1 1 dispersal kernel of mature beetles age 20 days following the flight mill experiment with mature beetles 77 of adults flew at least once and only these individuals were considered hereafter among these fliers 61 of flight mill trials showed flight activity long enough 30 s to be considered dispersal flights derived from david et al 2014 in the simulation model we considered that the daily probability of a mature beetle flying was p fm 0 61 then we considered a negative exponential kernel k m such as x 0 k m x d x 1 to determine the probability to disperse at a given distance x in meters during one day klein et al 2006 1 k m x 1 α exp x α where α is the mean daily dispersal distance in meters this function was fitted to the flight mill data david et al 2014 for that we calculated the number of flight distances within intervals of 500 m these distances range from 17 to 8538 m to estimate α we integrated the kernel over the same intervals of 500 m and determined its least squares estimate in r using the nls function r core team 2015 2 1 2 dispersal kernel of immature beetles age 20 days following the flight mill experiment on immature beetles 45 of them showed some flight activity david et al 2015 in the simulation model we considered that the daily probability of an immature beetle flying was p fi 0 45 for immature beetles we assumed that the shape of the kernel was the same as that of mature beetles but according to the results on flight mills david et al 2015 we set the mean dispersal distance to linearly increase with beetle age therefore we considered the following dispersal kernel k i 2 k i x t 1 f t α exp x f t α where x is a given distance in meters t is the age of the immature beetle in days since adult emergence between 1 and 20 α the mean daily dispersal distance of mature beetles in meters and f is an increasing function ranging from 0 to 1 following david et al 2015 the distance flown by immature beetles d in m within 10 min of test was 3 d t 443 63 10 71 t since immature beetles were supposed to have their full dispersal performance when they become mature then we should have f t d t d t 20 and thus 4 f t 0 67 0 016 t with f t 20 1 and k i x t 20 k m x 2 2 mark release recapture experiments in 2014 36 traps distributed within nine clusters of four traps cross vane type and galloprotect pack dispenser were installed in a maritime pine dominated forest landscape in south western france 44 68 n 0 85 w fig 2 the traps in the same cluster were separated by 200 m to maximize the chance of recapturing marked beetles i e about twice the attraction distance jactel et al 2019 the clusters were located as far as possible at the center and at the periphery of two concentric circles of 300 m and 900 m radius fig 2 immature and mature beetles were released from the center of each cluster mature insects were obtained by pheromone trapping nearby in the same forest region called les landes de gascogne in the same type of maritime pine forest immature insects do not respond to the attraction of pheromones at emergence and the first recaptures generally occur around two weeks after adult emergence therefore immature insects were obtained from pieces of dead wood infested by insect larvae identified by the presence of characteristic sawdust insects were individually marked with numbered tags and dots of color paint on the elytra in a way that enabled tracking of their physiological state upon release immature versus mature cluster of release and date of release a total of 499 immature and 3085 mature m galloprovincialis individuals were marked and released in july august 2014 and the traps were checked three times a week during 150 days the date of recapture and the trap that caught each marked insect were recorded 2 3 fine tuning the model parameters using mark release recapture data we used the dispersal model for simulating both mark release recapture experiments with immature and mature beetles in order to compare the simulations and the field data and then fine tune the estimate of model parameters since immature beetles become mature during the experiment the corresponding model was more complex therefore we present first the dispersal of mature beetles and then of immature beetles 2 3 1 simulating the mark release recapture experiment when releasing mature beetles we supposed that mature beetles n 100 were released at the center of each cluster since the beetles tested in this experiment were previously caught in pheromone traps before being marked they did respond to sex pheromone attraction and were thus considered mature their age was not known but it was necessarily above 20 days which is the maturation age m and their longevity was assumed to be l 120 days david et al 2017 consequently the age of the beetles was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution between 20 and 120 days since the beetles were recaptured up to 70 days after their release their dispersal was simulated during 70 days because the beetles were disturbed as they were caught in a trap then marked and released we considered an initial response time δ since the mean recapture time of mature beetles was 12 days see results we tested values going from 4 to 12 days during which the beetles were not supposed to disperse this delay mainly affected the recapture time in the simulations of mark release recapture experiments but it also modified the dispersal distance of beetles at a given time each day after the initial response time the flying beetles were randomly chosen from a binomial distribution with probability p fm among those which were not dead i e beetles which have not been already caught in a trap and which have not reached their maximal longevity and which did not rest to match the time of recapture in experiments we added a parameter to account for a period when beetles rest and feed between two consecutive flights β ranging from 0 to 3 days for each flying beetle we selected at random its dispersal distance from the dispersal kernel of mature beetles previously given depending on α the daily mean dispersal distance the direction of the flight was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution between 0 and 360 the individual flight trajectory of the beetle was then defined by a straight line between the departure point and the arrival point if it crosses the attraction area of a trap disk with a 100 m radius from the trap jactel et al 2019 then the beetle had a given probability λ to be caught in the trap the trap which caught the beetles and the day of capture were recorded to be compared with field observations 2 3 2 simulating the mark release recapture experiment when releasing immature beetles the dispersal model was very similar when simulating the mark release recapture of immature beetles only few changes were done first their initial age was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 7 days after adult emergence because newly emerged beetles were released once per week during the experiment beetles were getting older and they were supposed to become mature on day 20 each day we therefore differentiated immature beetles from mature beetles as long as beetles were immature they had a given probability to fly p fi and following their age we considered the corresponding dispersal kernel k i and daily mean dispersal distance f t α we also considered an initial response time δ but for immature beetles this time did not represent a time to recover from their manipulation as they directly emerged in laboratory but to the time required to respond to the pheromone 2 3 3 fine tuning parameter estimates to improve the goodness of fit of the dispersal model for field data we determined the combination of parameters values that gave the lowest error when comparing simulations to observations for this comparison we considered different outputs for both immature and mature beetles the recapture rate within the same cluster 9 clusters 2 experiments the duration between release and recapture within the same cluster 9 clusters 2 experiments the recapture rate in other clusters 9 8 inter clusters 2 experiments and the duration between release and recapture in other clusters 9 8 inter clusters 2 experiments the error was measured by two statistics the relative bias rb mean predicted mean observed mean observed and the root mean square error rmse mean predicted value observed value 2 since α may vary between 300 and 2000 m per day from david et al 2014 we tested α 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m in addition to α additional parameters were necessary to simulate the mark release recapture experiment and had to be estimated λ the trap efficiency probability of an insect being caught by the pheromone trap given that its trajectory crosses the area of trap attraction δ the delay response time in days and β the rest duration between two consecutive flights in days table 1 based on preliminary simulations we tested the following values λ 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 δ 4 8 and 12 days β 0 1 2 3 days consequently a total of 180 combinations of parameters values was considered 5 values for α 3 values for λ 3 values for δ 4 values for β 180 values for each of the two models mature and immature beetles we had at our disposal 8 criteria to identify the best parameters i e those which would provide the lowest error statistics for the relative bias rb and the root mean square error rmse in recapture rate and duration within and between clusters of pheromone traps we used a multi criteria decision analysis approach based on the promethee algorithm and developed on the visual promethee 1 4 0 0 platform to identify the best combination of parameters e g actions in the promethee vocabulary the complete outranking method was applied mareschal et al 1984 with equal weight for all criteria which were set to be minimized using a preference value of 0 01 2 3 4 simulation of insects dispersal finally the potential dispersal of emerging m galloprovincialis adults n 100 was simulated accounting for the best combination of parameters value table 1 from adult emergence to 20 days after emergence corresponding to the end of the immature stage 70 days after emergence corresponding approximately to the maximum date of pine wood nematode transmission and 120 days corresponding to the maximal adult longevity a sensitivity analysis was also done on the parameter α the dispersal simulations were done in r robinet et al 2018 and we assumed that insects dispersed within a homogeneous landscape representative of a non fragmented pine forest 3 results 3 1 mark release recapture experiments in the mrr experiments the 36 traps distributed into 9 clusters caught a total of 37 marked immatures out of 499 released and 193 marked matures out of 3085 released sm2 the mean recapture rate of immature beetles was ca 5 within trap clusters and ca 0 3 between trap clusters they took at least 18 days on average to be recaptured the mean recapture rate of mature beetles was ca 3 within and 0 4 between clusters of traps they were on average recaptured within 12 days the maximum dispersal distance recorded was 1754 m for immature and 1886 m for mature insects which corresponded more or less to the distance between two most distant clusters the longest recapture time was 61 days for immature and 70 days for mature beetles 3 2 model calibration and fine tuning the estimate of mean dispersal distance based on flight mill data was α 2268 m t test 17 73 p 0 001 and the negative exponential kernel fitted very well the distances recorded in the flight mill experiment fig 3 sm1 when fine tuning the dispersal model the parameter settings were consistent with each other the best fit to mrr data for the dispersal model was obtained with the combination of the following parameters α 2000 m λ 0 01 δ 12 days β 1 day for the release of immature beetles and α 2000 m λ 0 01 δ 8 days β 1 day for the release of mature beetles table 2 sm3 with this parameterization the recapture rates and the times of recapture were very similar in simulations and observations fig 4 only the recapture rate of immatures within the cluster of traps was substantially different nevertheless the absolute value differed by approximately 2 0 only 3 3 simulation of the insect dispersal we simulated the insect dispersal using the best combination of parameter values fig 5 see also the video in robinet et al 2018 a substantial proportion of daily flights 20 for mature beetles and 5 for immature beetles could reach at least 500 m the cumulative distance traveled by 100 insects between their emergence point and the final destination point on day 120 was 63 464 m on average sd 15 907 m however the dispersal distance as the crow flies between the origin and the destination point was lower but still of 13 219 m on average sd 7 313 m due to non unidirectional trajectories fig 5 see also table 3 for dispersal distances on day 20 and 70 and for the median when considering a change 10 in the value of α the cumulative dispersal distance until day 120 was within the interval 56 071 m 69 170 m and the distance as the crow flies from the origin was within 11 968 m 13 903 m on day 20 about 80 of insects were located at more than 500 m from the emergence point and 1 even reached more than 10 km table 3 showing that they could potentially disperse rapidly even during the immature stage at the end of their life span on day 120 more than half of the insects could potentially be located at more than 10 km table 3 and even 23 at more than 20 km from there emergence point 4 discussion 4 1 dispersal modeling a new approach to conciliate dispersal distance from flight mill experiments and mark release recapture experiments many studies focus on one method to assess the potential dispersal of insect species such as flight mill experiments e g jactel and gaillard 1991 schumacher et al 1997 briegel et al 2001 ishiguri and shirai 2004 bradley and altizer 2005 robinet et al 2012 maes et al 2014 and mark release recapture experiments e g turchin and thoeny 1993 marini et al 2010 margaritopoulos et al 2012 the number of species for which the dispersal capabilities have been recorded with different methods is relatively low and these measures generally differed e g from tens of kilometers versus hundreds of meters for m galloprovincialis however it is not possible to compare directly these distances since they represent different measures of the dispersal distance data from flight mill experiments may provide overestimated flight performance but they allowed determining the dispersal kernel i e the shape of distances distribution and the proportion of individuals able to fly long distances e g those mainly contributing to the population range expansion data from mark release recapture experiments provided an interception distance although they were based on individuals dispersal in the field the traps potentially captured individuals that could be able to disperse further until now there was no study comparing dispersal measures based on the same source of population in this study insects tested on the flight mill and in the mark release recapture experiments all originated from a maritime pine dominated forest of south western france therefore variability in dispersal distances may not be attributed to intra specific variability the dispersal model that we developed reveals that the distances recorded in the two types of experiment were actually in good agreement the estimate of the daily mean dispersal distance α 2 0 km was consistent with the flight distance data estimated on the flight mill once per week 1 93 km for females and 2 14 km for males david et al 2014 and with the distance flown between the release point and the most distant trap 1 8 1 9 km another interesting convergence point is that i many marked beetles remained within the same small forest area the one delimited by trap locations ca 1000 hectares for several weeks up to 7 weeks ii the flight mill experiment showed that most of the individual flights were of short duration i e mean individual flight of ca 1 km david et al 2014 and iii the dispersal model revealed that the zig zag trajectories led to a majority of beetles remaining within a much smaller area than predicted with unidirectional flights all these observations are consistent with m galloprovincialis mainly performing foraging flights i e those necessary to find suitable host pine trees for feeding on fresh shoot or laying eggs on dead branches and not migratory flights those required when feeding or ovipositing resources are scarce in space or time 4 2 reconsideration of control measures for the pine wood nematode it has been suggested to use mass trapping for the control of m galloprovincialis sanchez husillos et al 2015 to reduce the transmission and the spread of pwn we are aware of five previous mark release recapture experiments with the pine sawyer beetle in the iberian peninsula gallego et al 2012 hernández et al 2011 mas et al 2013 torres vila et al 2015 etxebeste et al 2016 although the landscape context the number of traps and the distance between traps differed and the populations do not belong to the same genetic clade haran et al 2018 these experiments were all conducted in similar conditions similar traps and lures as our mrr study interestingly they provide consistent estimate of recapture rates using immature beetles etxebeste et al 2016 obtained a mean recapture rate per trap of 1 25 in 2010 and 0 52 in 2011 which is very close to the 1 23 immature beetles recaptured per trap within clusters in our experiment likewise using mature beetles first trapped then marked and released gallego et al 2012 obtained a rate of recapture per trap of 0 66 hernández et al 2011 0 62 0 67 mas et al 2013 0 83 1 83 torres vila et al 2015 0 67 which is very similar to the 0 69 mature beetles recaptured per trap within clusters in our experiment due to these very low levels of trap efficiency one would need a very high density of traps per hectare for capturing enough beetles to impede the reproduction success and thus durably reduce the population density of the insect vector even more problematic it took on average 18 days to recapture the released immature beetles while etxebeste et al 2016 indicated that recaptures occurred 7 14 days after their release this means that they would have had ample time to transmit most of their nematode load while feeding on shoot for sex maturation when considering the high density of traps needed that should be deployed on very large areas e g the pine forest at high risk of invasion in southwestern france covers ca 1 million hectares with the incapacity of trapping immature beetles that transmit pwn it clearly appears that mass trapping should not be recommended as control measure according to the simulated dispersal of m galloprovincialis a substantial proportion of daily flights 20 for mature beetles and 5 for immature beetles could reach at least 500 m which is the radius of the clear cut imposed by the european regulation in addition most of insects about 80 have already gone further than 500 m a few days after their emergence table 3 so far there is no evidence that the flight performance of m galloprovincialis carrying the pine wood nematode is different from those free from the nematode flight distance of 15 infested insect tested on flight mill was not significantly different from those not infested but further studies are needed david 2014 based on these results and the continuous spread of the pine wood nematode in the iberian peninsula despite the european regulation rodrigues et al 2015 it is legitimate to question the effectiveness of the clear cut measure however further research is needed to better assess this effectiveness accounting for the transmission of the pine wood nematode along the adult life span of m galloprovincialis here again a dispersal model would be relevant to simulate the effects of clear cuts on pwn dissemination and transmission assessing the potential dispersal capability is also useful to improve the layout of a network of pheromone traps as required by the european union for the surveillance of the pine wood nematode based on the spatial distribution of dispersal probabilities derived from the model and a given number of traps it is possible to optimize the trapping network so that 1 infested beetles have a good chance to be captured and thus the nematode to be detected as early as possible and 2 the origin of the infestation i e contaminated trees from which the insects emerged could be easily delimited by triangulation however for both objectives it will be necessary to improve the realism of the dispersal model by taking into account landscape compositional heterogeneity as m galloprovincialis might modify its dispersal behavior to cross or avoid non habitat patches like broadleaved forests or crop fields most of mathematical approaches related to population spread in heterogeneous environment have focused on periodic environments alternating very and less favorable areas for survival and dispersal shigesada and kawasaki 1997 berestycki et al 2005 these studies provide important insights into the role of periodic heterogeneity in spread dynamics but are not relevant to determine accurately the effects of real landscapes in addition they are mainly based on the reaction diffusion model fisher kpp which is analog of a gaussian dispersal kernel in our case we have shown that the negative exponential kernel fits better the dispersal of m galloprovincialis with higher proportion of individuals able to disperse at long distance rather we suggest collecting field data on insect dispersal behavior e g using mrr experiments in landscapes of different heterogeneities to test whether some particular configurations can significantly accelerate or impede individuals dispersal by adapting the model to those features we will provide a more effective tool to predict the dispersal capability of the insect vector of one of the most damaging forest pests in realistic

25066,the number of invasive species is increasing throughout the world one of the corner stones to successfully control them is to better estimate their dispersal capabilities for flying insects dispersal performance is commonly estimated through flight mill and mark release recapture experiments however each approach has its own bias over and under estimating flying distances respectively the objective of this study was to develop an individual based dispersal model to circumvent these drawbacks the shape of the dispersal kernel was calibrated on distances recorded in flight mill experiments previously done and then model parameters were fine tuned based on mark release recapture experiments presented in this study the pine sawyer beetle monochamus galloprovincialis was used as case study because it is the european vector of the invasive pine wood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus recognized as one of the biggest threats to pine forests worldwide the best fitted model to mark release recapture data was parameterized with a mean flying distance of 2000 m per day which is consistent with flight mill data it was used to further simulate the dispersal of 100 beetles in non fragmented pine forests the cumulative flight distance was 63 km on average at the end of their adult life stage and the mean dispersal distance as the crow flies was of ca 13 km at the end of the maturation period when most nematodes have been already transmitted to host pines via shoot feeding about 80 of the insects were located at more than 500 m from the emergence point these outcomes clearly question the relevance of clear cut zones of 500 m radius required by the european regulation for the eradication of the invasive nematode such dispersal model could be used to support decision making for eradication programs keywords bursaphelenchus xylophilus dispersal model flight distance monochamus galloprovincialis pine wood nematode mark release recapture 1 introduction due to the ecological damage and economic impacts caused by invasive species various management and control measures have to be implemented ranging from early detection eradication containment slow the spread and biological control wittenberg and cock 2001 sharov et al 2002 meentemeyer et al 2008 a corner stone for the success of invasive pests control is to better know their biology and behavior in particular a better estimation of their dispersal capacity is crucial as it affects both their establishment capability robinet and liebhold 2009 tobin et al 2011 and spread rate turchin 1998 although radio tracking is the most accurate method for monitoring animal dispersal in the wild it is often impossible to track small sized species as they cannot carry heavy equipment compared to their own weight or because they can disperse over large areas in this case indirect measures are generally used for insect species that disperse by flying mark release recapture experiments and flight mill experiments are commonly used turchin 1998 martí campoy et al 2016 however each method has its own bias data recorded on flight mills represent artificial flight performance and usually overestimate dispersal capacities while data recorded in mark release recapture hereafter mrr experiments represent interception distances and are limited by the number of traps and the distance between the release point and the furthest trap thus resulting in underestimation of flight performance therefore precisely estimating the dispersal capabilities of insects is often challenging one of the biggest threats of pine forests across the world is the pine wood nematode pwn bursaphelenchus xylophilus as it can potentially kill a pine tree within a few weeks suzuki 2002 webster and mota 2008 vicente et al 2012 native to north america dropkin et al 1981 it has invaded japan in 1905 yano 1913 china in 1982 cheng et al 1986 korea in 1988 yi et al 1989 and portugal in 1999 mota et al 1999 where it has caused extensive mortality it was also detected in spain in 2008 robertson et al 2011 to disperse from one tree to another the pine wood nematode needs an insect vector which always belongs to the monochamus genus in portugal the pine sawyer beetle monochamus galloprovincialis olivier 1795 is the only insect known to carry the pine wood nematode sousa et al 2002 but its flight capability is still not well known to prevent the spread of the pine wood nematode within the european union the european union regulation implementing decision 2012 535 eu requires the member states to implement emergency measures the current contingency plan consists of surveys for nematode detection eradication measures to eliminate the nematode where it is present and containment measures to prevent a further spread of the nematode where it cannot be eradicated the requested eradication measure is to fell remove and dispose of all susceptible plants within a zone called clear cut zone ccz of a minimum radius of 500 m that may be reduced to 100 m subject to conditions around any infected tree despite the regulation measures imposed by the european union the pwn has spread to a large part of portugal and has been repeatedly detected in spain abelleira et al 2011 vicente et al 2012 assessing the dispersal distance of the insect vector is therefore a crucial step to improve the management strategy of the pwn where it has been introduced several mark release recapture experiments have been conducted to determine the dispersal capability of m galloprovincialis in the iberian peninsula the advantage of this method is to measure the dispersal distance of individuals in the field as they were supposed to have very limited flight capabilities traps were generally installed in the neighborhood of the release points e g up to 0 5 km and 0 76 km etxebeste et al 2016 and thus most adults have been caught are very short distances when traps were installed further some insects were caught at greater distances at more than 3 km from the release points with a maximal distance of 5 3 km etxebeste et al 2016 7 1 km hernández et al 2011 8 3 km gallego et al 2012 and 22 1 km mas et al 2013 consequently it seems that the interception distance can be relatively high in some cases the variability in recapture distance between these experiments probably reveals the dilemma in placing the traps when traps are installed close to the release point they catch more insects but obviously long recapture distances cannot be observed turchin 1998 when the traps are installed far from the release point there is low chance to recapture an insect insects that were not caught in the traps may have dispersed further and insects caught in the traps would have perhaps been able to disperse further if they were not caught another method commonly used to estimate the flight performance of insects consists in testing individuals on a flight mill in this method individuals are placed in artificial conditions and the flight performance recorded on a flight mill may not be fully representative of the dispersal capability in the field however it provides an accurate estimate of the probability distribution of flight distances and thus of the proportion of beetles that are able to fly further than the others it also allows recording the distance flown by each individual over its life span under controlled conditions and eventually comparing the effects of different treatments e g according to age sex and temperature conditions the flight performance has already been measured in this way for several insect species such as bark beetle jactel and gaillard 1991 codling moth schumacher et al 1997 mosquito briegel et al 2001 peach fruit moth ishiguri and shirai 2004 monarch butterfly bradley and altizer 2005 emerald ash borer taylor et al 2010 pine processionary moth robinet et al 2012 and predatory ladybirds maes et al 2014 the flight performance of adult beetles of m galloprovincialis was also tested with this method david et al 2014 2015 when emerging from a tree adult beetles are immature for approximately 20 days naves et al 2006 at this immature stage they do not respond to sex pheromone attraction and thus cannot be caught by pheromone traps during this period of sexual maturation young adults are the main vector responsible for nematode transmission which takes place when insect are feeding on fresh pine twigs vectors can transmit the nematode for about 10 weeks since their emergence naves et al 2007 using automatically recording flight mills david et al 2015 showed that flight distance performed each day by immature beetles increased progressively as beetles were aging probably as they develop their muscles and accumulate energy when feeding until reaching a limit in a second experiment david et al 2014 measured the flight performance of mature beetles as 2 km per testing day on average 8 km maximum however it is unknown whether they can fly these distances every day 2 km per day or during the whole week 2 km 7 0 3 km per day as they were tested only once per week during their entire mature adult lifespan they could fly 16 km on average 63 km maximum although these flight distances are higher than the recapture distances their direct comparison is impossible because these distances do not represent the same dispersal measure interception distance versus artificial flight performance individual movement is the result of a complex combination of four basic components internal state of the individual e g its physiology its motion and navigation capacities and external factors e g environmental conditions nathan et al 2008 baguette et al 2014 this movement can be seen as a sequence of several paths going from one point to another each path is generally characterized by a straight line between these two points which can be fully described either by the cartesian coordinates of these two points or by their polar coordinates reporting their distance and angle nathan et al 2012 we used this classical framework of movement ecology to design an individual based dispersal model to simulate the movement of individuals various dispersal models has been developed turchin 1998 some models described the spread of a population such as reaction diffusion models shigesada and kawasaki 1997 whilst other models based on random walks were able to simulate individuals trajectories in the latter case successive dispersal distances and directions were then randomly chosen to characterize the individual s path turchin 1998 for instance these dispersal distances can be chosen from a dispersal kernel providing the probability distribution of dispersal distances the shape of the dispersal kernel is important to define the proportion of individuals able to disperse at long distance klein et al 2006 nathan et al 2012 in this study we developed such an individual based model using both dispersal measures flight mill and mark release recapture data to determine the potential dispersal capability of the insect vector of the pine wood nematode in europe firstly we calibrated the individual based dispersal model using the distances recorded in flight mill experiments david et al 2014 2015 to capture the shape of the dispersal distance distribution then we conducted mark release recapture experiments with both immature and mature m galloprovincialis beetles in a pine plantation landscape to fine tune model parameters fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 calibration of the dispersal kernel with flight mill data the individual based model describes the dispersal of immature and mature m galloprovincialis beetles based on a several parameters table 1 the shape of the dispersal kernel negative exponential model see sm1 was fitted to the flight performance of both mature beetles 35 mature males and 26 mature females and immature beetles recorded on flight mill 49 immature males and 49 immature females david et al 2014 2015 the beetles used in these experiments were collected in south western france in a pine forest each immature beetle was tested during 10 min while each mature beetle was tested during 2 h each week until its death hereafter we present first the model parameterization for mature beetles and then for immature beetles as the latter was derived from the former all the simulations were done in r r core team 2015 2 1 1 dispersal kernel of mature beetles age 20 days following the flight mill experiment with mature beetles 77 of adults flew at least once and only these individuals were considered hereafter among these fliers 61 of flight mill trials showed flight activity long enough 30 s to be considered dispersal flights derived from david et al 2014 in the simulation model we considered that the daily probability of a mature beetle flying was p fm 0 61 then we considered a negative exponential kernel k m such as x 0 k m x d x 1 to determine the probability to disperse at a given distance x in meters during one day klein et al 2006 1 k m x 1 α exp x α where α is the mean daily dispersal distance in meters this function was fitted to the flight mill data david et al 2014 for that we calculated the number of flight distances within intervals of 500 m these distances range from 17 to 8538 m to estimate α we integrated the kernel over the same intervals of 500 m and determined its least squares estimate in r using the nls function r core team 2015 2 1 2 dispersal kernel of immature beetles age 20 days following the flight mill experiment on immature beetles 45 of them showed some flight activity david et al 2015 in the simulation model we considered that the daily probability of an immature beetle flying was p fi 0 45 for immature beetles we assumed that the shape of the kernel was the same as that of mature beetles but according to the results on flight mills david et al 2015 we set the mean dispersal distance to linearly increase with beetle age therefore we considered the following dispersal kernel k i 2 k i x t 1 f t α exp x f t α where x is a given distance in meters t is the age of the immature beetle in days since adult emergence between 1 and 20 α the mean daily dispersal distance of mature beetles in meters and f is an increasing function ranging from 0 to 1 following david et al 2015 the distance flown by immature beetles d in m within 10 min of test was 3 d t 443 63 10 71 t since immature beetles were supposed to have their full dispersal performance when they become mature then we should have f t d t d t 20 and thus 4 f t 0 67 0 016 t with f t 20 1 and k i x t 20 k m x 2 2 mark release recapture experiments in 2014 36 traps distributed within nine clusters of four traps cross vane type and galloprotect pack dispenser were installed in a maritime pine dominated forest landscape in south western france 44 68 n 0 85 w fig 2 the traps in the same cluster were separated by 200 m to maximize the chance of recapturing marked beetles i e about twice the attraction distance jactel et al 2019 the clusters were located as far as possible at the center and at the periphery of two concentric circles of 300 m and 900 m radius fig 2 immature and mature beetles were released from the center of each cluster mature insects were obtained by pheromone trapping nearby in the same forest region called les landes de gascogne in the same type of maritime pine forest immature insects do not respond to the attraction of pheromones at emergence and the first recaptures generally occur around two weeks after adult emergence therefore immature insects were obtained from pieces of dead wood infested by insect larvae identified by the presence of characteristic sawdust insects were individually marked with numbered tags and dots of color paint on the elytra in a way that enabled tracking of their physiological state upon release immature versus mature cluster of release and date of release a total of 499 immature and 3085 mature m galloprovincialis individuals were marked and released in july august 2014 and the traps were checked three times a week during 150 days the date of recapture and the trap that caught each marked insect were recorded 2 3 fine tuning the model parameters using mark release recapture data we used the dispersal model for simulating both mark release recapture experiments with immature and mature beetles in order to compare the simulations and the field data and then fine tune the estimate of model parameters since immature beetles become mature during the experiment the corresponding model was more complex therefore we present first the dispersal of mature beetles and then of immature beetles 2 3 1 simulating the mark release recapture experiment when releasing mature beetles we supposed that mature beetles n 100 were released at the center of each cluster since the beetles tested in this experiment were previously caught in pheromone traps before being marked they did respond to sex pheromone attraction and were thus considered mature their age was not known but it was necessarily above 20 days which is the maturation age m and their longevity was assumed to be l 120 days david et al 2017 consequently the age of the beetles was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution between 20 and 120 days since the beetles were recaptured up to 70 days after their release their dispersal was simulated during 70 days because the beetles were disturbed as they were caught in a trap then marked and released we considered an initial response time δ since the mean recapture time of mature beetles was 12 days see results we tested values going from 4 to 12 days during which the beetles were not supposed to disperse this delay mainly affected the recapture time in the simulations of mark release recapture experiments but it also modified the dispersal distance of beetles at a given time each day after the initial response time the flying beetles were randomly chosen from a binomial distribution with probability p fm among those which were not dead i e beetles which have not been already caught in a trap and which have not reached their maximal longevity and which did not rest to match the time of recapture in experiments we added a parameter to account for a period when beetles rest and feed between two consecutive flights β ranging from 0 to 3 days for each flying beetle we selected at random its dispersal distance from the dispersal kernel of mature beetles previously given depending on α the daily mean dispersal distance the direction of the flight was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution between 0 and 360 the individual flight trajectory of the beetle was then defined by a straight line between the departure point and the arrival point if it crosses the attraction area of a trap disk with a 100 m radius from the trap jactel et al 2019 then the beetle had a given probability λ to be caught in the trap the trap which caught the beetles and the day of capture were recorded to be compared with field observations 2 3 2 simulating the mark release recapture experiment when releasing immature beetles the dispersal model was very similar when simulating the mark release recapture of immature beetles only few changes were done first their initial age was randomly chosen in a uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 7 days after adult emergence because newly emerged beetles were released once per week during the experiment beetles were getting older and they were supposed to become mature on day 20 each day we therefore differentiated immature beetles from mature beetles as long as beetles were immature they had a given probability to fly p fi and following their age we considered the corresponding dispersal kernel k i and daily mean dispersal distance f t α we also considered an initial response time δ but for immature beetles this time did not represent a time to recover from their manipulation as they directly emerged in laboratory but to the time required to respond to the pheromone 2 3 3 fine tuning parameter estimates to improve the goodness of fit of the dispersal model for field data we determined the combination of parameters values that gave the lowest error when comparing simulations to observations for this comparison we considered different outputs for both immature and mature beetles the recapture rate within the same cluster 9 clusters 2 experiments the duration between release and recapture within the same cluster 9 clusters 2 experiments the recapture rate in other clusters 9 8 inter clusters 2 experiments and the duration between release and recapture in other clusters 9 8 inter clusters 2 experiments the error was measured by two statistics the relative bias rb mean predicted mean observed mean observed and the root mean square error rmse mean predicted value observed value 2 since α may vary between 300 and 2000 m per day from david et al 2014 we tested α 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m in addition to α additional parameters were necessary to simulate the mark release recapture experiment and had to be estimated λ the trap efficiency probability of an insect being caught by the pheromone trap given that its trajectory crosses the area of trap attraction δ the delay response time in days and β the rest duration between two consecutive flights in days table 1 based on preliminary simulations we tested the following values λ 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 δ 4 8 and 12 days β 0 1 2 3 days consequently a total of 180 combinations of parameters values was considered 5 values for α 3 values for λ 3 values for δ 4 values for β 180 values for each of the two models mature and immature beetles we had at our disposal 8 criteria to identify the best parameters i e those which would provide the lowest error statistics for the relative bias rb and the root mean square error rmse in recapture rate and duration within and between clusters of pheromone traps we used a multi criteria decision analysis approach based on the promethee algorithm and developed on the visual promethee 1 4 0 0 platform to identify the best combination of parameters e g actions in the promethee vocabulary the complete outranking method was applied mareschal et al 1984 with equal weight for all criteria which were set to be minimized using a preference value of 0 01 2 3 4 simulation of insects dispersal finally the potential dispersal of emerging m galloprovincialis adults n 100 was simulated accounting for the best combination of parameters value table 1 from adult emergence to 20 days after emergence corresponding to the end of the immature stage 70 days after emergence corresponding approximately to the maximum date of pine wood nematode transmission and 120 days corresponding to the maximal adult longevity a sensitivity analysis was also done on the parameter α the dispersal simulations were done in r robinet et al 2018 and we assumed that insects dispersed within a homogeneous landscape representative of a non fragmented pine forest 3 results 3 1 mark release recapture experiments in the mrr experiments the 36 traps distributed into 9 clusters caught a total of 37 marked immatures out of 499 released and 193 marked matures out of 3085 released sm2 the mean recapture rate of immature beetles was ca 5 within trap clusters and ca 0 3 between trap clusters they took at least 18 days on average to be recaptured the mean recapture rate of mature beetles was ca 3 within and 0 4 between clusters of traps they were on average recaptured within 12 days the maximum dispersal distance recorded was 1754 m for immature and 1886 m for mature insects which corresponded more or less to the distance between two most distant clusters the longest recapture time was 61 days for immature and 70 days for mature beetles 3 2 model calibration and fine tuning the estimate of mean dispersal distance based on flight mill data was α 2268 m t test 17 73 p 0 001 and the negative exponential kernel fitted very well the distances recorded in the flight mill experiment fig 3 sm1 when fine tuning the dispersal model the parameter settings were consistent with each other the best fit to mrr data for the dispersal model was obtained with the combination of the following parameters α 2000 m λ 0 01 δ 12 days β 1 day for the release of immature beetles and α 2000 m λ 0 01 δ 8 days β 1 day for the release of mature beetles table 2 sm3 with this parameterization the recapture rates and the times of recapture were very similar in simulations and observations fig 4 only the recapture rate of immatures within the cluster of traps was substantially different nevertheless the absolute value differed by approximately 2 0 only 3 3 simulation of the insect dispersal we simulated the insect dispersal using the best combination of parameter values fig 5 see also the video in robinet et al 2018 a substantial proportion of daily flights 20 for mature beetles and 5 for immature beetles could reach at least 500 m the cumulative distance traveled by 100 insects between their emergence point and the final destination point on day 120 was 63 464 m on average sd 15 907 m however the dispersal distance as the crow flies between the origin and the destination point was lower but still of 13 219 m on average sd 7 313 m due to non unidirectional trajectories fig 5 see also table 3 for dispersal distances on day 20 and 70 and for the median when considering a change 10 in the value of α the cumulative dispersal distance until day 120 was within the interval 56 071 m 69 170 m and the distance as the crow flies from the origin was within 11 968 m 13 903 m on day 20 about 80 of insects were located at more than 500 m from the emergence point and 1 even reached more than 10 km table 3 showing that they could potentially disperse rapidly even during the immature stage at the end of their life span on day 120 more than half of the insects could potentially be located at more than 10 km table 3 and even 23 at more than 20 km from there emergence point 4 discussion 4 1 dispersal modeling a new approach to conciliate dispersal distance from flight mill experiments and mark release recapture experiments many studies focus on one method to assess the potential dispersal of insect species such as flight mill experiments e g jactel and gaillard 1991 schumacher et al 1997 briegel et al 2001 ishiguri and shirai 2004 bradley and altizer 2005 robinet et al 2012 maes et al 2014 and mark release recapture experiments e g turchin and thoeny 1993 marini et al 2010 margaritopoulos et al 2012 the number of species for which the dispersal capabilities have been recorded with different methods is relatively low and these measures generally differed e g from tens of kilometers versus hundreds of meters for m galloprovincialis however it is not possible to compare directly these distances since they represent different measures of the dispersal distance data from flight mill experiments may provide overestimated flight performance but they allowed determining the dispersal kernel i e the shape of distances distribution and the proportion of individuals able to fly long distances e g those mainly contributing to the population range expansion data from mark release recapture experiments provided an interception distance although they were based on individuals dispersal in the field the traps potentially captured individuals that could be able to disperse further until now there was no study comparing dispersal measures based on the same source of population in this study insects tested on the flight mill and in the mark release recapture experiments all originated from a maritime pine dominated forest of south western france therefore variability in dispersal distances may not be attributed to intra specific variability the dispersal model that we developed reveals that the distances recorded in the two types of experiment were actually in good agreement the estimate of the daily mean dispersal distance α 2 0 km was consistent with the flight distance data estimated on the flight mill once per week 1 93 km for females and 2 14 km for males david et al 2014 and with the distance flown between the release point and the most distant trap 1 8 1 9 km another interesting convergence point is that i many marked beetles remained within the same small forest area the one delimited by trap locations ca 1000 hectares for several weeks up to 7 weeks ii the flight mill experiment showed that most of the individual flights were of short duration i e mean individual flight of ca 1 km david et al 2014 and iii the dispersal model revealed that the zig zag trajectories led to a majority of beetles remaining within a much smaller area than predicted with unidirectional flights all these observations are consistent with m galloprovincialis mainly performing foraging flights i e those necessary to find suitable host pine trees for feeding on fresh shoot or laying eggs on dead branches and not migratory flights those required when feeding or ovipositing resources are scarce in space or time 4 2 reconsideration of control measures for the pine wood nematode it has been suggested to use mass trapping for the control of m galloprovincialis sanchez husillos et al 2015 to reduce the transmission and the spread of pwn we are aware of five previous mark release recapture experiments with the pine sawyer beetle in the iberian peninsula gallego et al 2012 hernández et al 2011 mas et al 2013 torres vila et al 2015 etxebeste et al 2016 although the landscape context the number of traps and the distance between traps differed and the populations do not belong to the same genetic clade haran et al 2018 these experiments were all conducted in similar conditions similar traps and lures as our mrr study interestingly they provide consistent estimate of recapture rates using immature beetles etxebeste et al 2016 obtained a mean recapture rate per trap of 1 25 in 2010 and 0 52 in 2011 which is very close to the 1 23 immature beetles recaptured per trap within clusters in our experiment likewise using mature beetles first trapped then marked and released gallego et al 2012 obtained a rate of recapture per trap of 0 66 hernández et al 2011 0 62 0 67 mas et al 2013 0 83 1 83 torres vila et al 2015 0 67 which is very similar to the 0 69 mature beetles recaptured per trap within clusters in our experiment due to these very low levels of trap efficiency one would need a very high density of traps per hectare for capturing enough beetles to impede the reproduction success and thus durably reduce the population density of the insect vector even more problematic it took on average 18 days to recapture the released immature beetles while etxebeste et al 2016 indicated that recaptures occurred 7 14 days after their release this means that they would have had ample time to transmit most of their nematode load while feeding on shoot for sex maturation when considering the high density of traps needed that should be deployed on very large areas e g the pine forest at high risk of invasion in southwestern france covers ca 1 million hectares with the incapacity of trapping immature beetles that transmit pwn it clearly appears that mass trapping should not be recommended as control measure according to the simulated dispersal of m galloprovincialis a substantial proportion of daily flights 20 for mature beetles and 5 for immature beetles could reach at least 500 m which is the radius of the clear cut imposed by the european regulation in addition most of insects about 80 have already gone further than 500 m a few days after their emergence table 3 so far there is no evidence that the flight performance of m galloprovincialis carrying the pine wood nematode is different from those free from the nematode flight distance of 15 infested insect tested on flight mill was not significantly different from those not infested but further studies are needed david 2014 based on these results and the continuous spread of the pine wood nematode in the iberian peninsula despite the european regulation rodrigues et al 2015 it is legitimate to question the effectiveness of the clear cut measure however further research is needed to better assess this effectiveness accounting for the transmission of the pine wood nematode along the adult life span of m galloprovincialis here again a dispersal model would be relevant to simulate the effects of clear cuts on pwn dissemination and transmission assessing the potential dispersal capability is also useful to improve the layout of a network of pheromone traps as required by the european union for the surveillance of the pine wood nematode based on the spatial distribution of dispersal probabilities derived from the model and a given number of traps it is possible to optimize the trapping network so that 1 infested beetles have a good chance to be captured and thus the nematode to be detected as early as possible and 2 the origin of the infestation i e contaminated trees from which the insects emerged could be easily delimited by triangulation however for both objectives it will be necessary to improve the realism of the dispersal model by taking into account landscape compositional heterogeneity as m galloprovincialis might modify its dispersal behavior to cross or avoid non habitat patches like broadleaved forests or crop fields most of mathematical approaches related to population spread in heterogeneous environment have focused on periodic environments alternating very and less favorable areas for survival and dispersal shigesada and kawasaki 1997 berestycki et al 2005 these studies provide important insights into the role of periodic heterogeneity in spread dynamics but are not relevant to determine accurately the effects of real landscapes in addition they are mainly based on the reaction diffusion model fisher kpp which is analog of a gaussian dispersal kernel in our case we have shown that the negative exponential kernel fits better the dispersal of m galloprovincialis with higher proportion of individuals able to disperse at long distance rather we suggest collecting field data on insect dispersal behavior e g using mrr experiments in landscapes of different heterogeneities to test whether some particular configurations can significantly accelerate or impede individuals dispersal by adapting the model to those features we will provide a more effective tool to predict the dispersal capability of the insect vector of one of the most damaging forest pests in realistic

25067,an end to end model named osmose gol has been built for the gulf of lions the main french mediterranean fishing area this spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model eco3m s symphonie ltl low trophic level model to osmose htl high trophic level model it includes 15 compartments of living organisms five from the ltl model i e nanophytoplankton microphytoplankton nanozooplankton microzooplankton and mesozooplankton and ten from the htl model northern krill southern shortfin squid european pilchard european anchovy european sprat atlantic horse mackerel atlantic mackerel blue whiting european hake and atlantic bluefin tuna with the exception of northern krill and european sprat all htl species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure the modeled species represent more than 70 of annual catches in this area this paper presents the parameterization calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass landings diet and trophic level data for htl groups for most species the diets in output of osmose gol are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species however some differences were observed various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the htl predators were not modeled in osmose gol field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations while our data concern the period 2001 2004 and the entire modeled domain inter and intra annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences the model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the htl compartments these values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous ecopath model for the same area and period even though some improvements are still possible this model may already be of use to explore fishery or marine protected areas scenarios for socio ecosystem management issues keywords ecosystem modeling food web fisheries osmose eco3m 1 introduction end to end e2e models are particularly appropriate to disentangle the intricacy of interactions occurring between physical forcing and low and high trophic level communities in the context of a quantitative approach dedicated to ecosystem based management ebm e g travers et al 2007 rose 2012 they use multiple field data sets and are able to assess and simulate the dynamics of the main descriptors of the ecosystem rather than evaluating single resources and single threats shin et al 2010 christensen and walters 2011 collie et al 2016 similar approaches driven by modeling and information are used not just in ecology but in many other areas to improve and in some cases save our lifes helbing et al 2015 however the implementation of end to end modeling remains challenging mainly due to the major differences between the sub models of hydrodynamics and ltl organisms on the one hand and that of htl organisms on the other hand see review by rose et al 2010 the challenges are numerous and concern both concepts e g representation of the zooplankton key level differential scaling of processes behavioral movement of htl organisms etc and technical issues e g different programming languages and time steps one of the main challenges concerns the nature of link between sub models travers et al 2009 considered two possible types of links between ltl and htl models in the one way forcing mode ltl groups biomasses serve as prey fields to htl groups without any feedback on the ltl compartments in the two ways coupling mode the biomass of the ltl groups serve as prey field for htl groups and an explicit rate of htl induced predation is specifically applied as feedback on each of the ltl groups over the last decade e2e modeling studies applied to regions or to the whole basin of the mediterranean sea have flourished in the context of ebm coll and libralato 2012 this research trend has been mainly driven by the more and more numerous observations of increasing threats and impacts on the mediterranean marine ecosystems due to the exponential development of anthropogenic activities e g lotze et al 2011 coll et al 2012 most of these modeling studies have been based on the ecopath with ecosim ewe model see review of coll and libralato 2012 and only a few have used alternative models spatial and multispecies models such as the osmose size based model halouani et al 2016 or age structured models applied to single species e g santojanni et al 2005 furthermore while implementation of the ebm of the gulf of lions gol is particularly crucial owing to its major contribution to mediterranean fisheries catches sacchi 2008 demaneche et al 2009 this shelf area has been poorly investigated to date coll and libralato 2012 only the recent study by bănaru et al 2013 dealt with the fishing impact on the trophic structure of the marine ecosystem using an ewe approach however this study is not spatialized and is based on some crude assumptions concerning for example the plankton compartment prey for the planktivorous fish species for which the biomass level is determined from the literature and satellite imagery a major bias of this type of modeling approach is that it does not account for the close coupling between the physical and biological sensu largo processes yet these interactions occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the nw mediterranean sea and it has now been well demonstrated that they have a significant impact on the dynamics and the spatial distribution of marine organisms from plankton to top predators e g fromentin et al 2003 niewiadomska et al 2008 cotté et al 2011 campbell et al 2013 it is therefore necessary to represent the gulf of lions ecosystem more realistically in particular the environmental forcing the spatial dynamics of living organisms and their interactions to enable a finer analysis of the functioning of the ecosystems and in fine to plan its optimal management for the next decades the e2e approach developed in this study is based on a fully dynamic coupling i e two ways coupling of two pre existing sub models representing the dynamics of ltl organisms driven by hydrodynamics and climate processes on the one hand and the dynamics of htl organisms impacted by fishing activities on the other hand the first model component is the eco3m s symphonie model that has been successfully used in the north western mediterranean sea to advance our understanding of the influence of hydrodynamics and atmospheric drivers on the distribution of plankton at different spatial and temporal scales e g auger et al 2011 2014 campbell et al 2013 carlotti et al 2014 the second component model is the individual and size based model osmose shin and cury 2004 this htl model has been applied worldwide in order to achieve better understanding of the functioning of diverse marine ecosystems e g travers et al 2006 marzloff et al 2009 fu et al 2013 grüss et al 2015 2016 halouani et al 2016 the aim of the present paper is to document an e2e model developed for the gol the osmose gol model and based on dynamic feedback two ways coupling between two pre existing ltl and htl sub models numerous data sets available in this marine region have been used to calibrate and quantitatively evaluate both the ltl and the htl modules of the osmose gol model an application of this model that consists in an analysis of the impacts of the predation pressure exerted by htl planktivorous species on the spatial distributions the structure of the ltl community and food webs controls is presented in a companion paper diaz et al 2019 2 methods 2 1 the e2e modeling approach the approach developed in this study is based on the coupling of two existing sub models the first is the eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 that represents the dynamics of ltl organisms driven by hydrodynamics and climate processes the second is the individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2015 that simulates the dynamics of htl organisms both models have been fully described in previous works therefore only the main characteristics are given hereafter they are coupled in two distinct modes fig 1 in the one way forcing mode the biomass outputs of the ltl model are provided as inputs for the osmose model without any feedback on the ltl biomass in the two ways coupling mode there is a dynamic feedback between the two models through the predation process the biomass outputs of the ltl model are provided as inputs for the osmose model which provides in return an additional rate of predation by the htl planktivorous organisms 2 1 1 description of the ltl model the ltl model is composed of two coupled models the symphonie hydrodynamic model and the eco3m s biogeochemical model campbell et al 2013 the meteorological and hydrodynamic processes influencing the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients and plankton were simulated by the symphonie model marsaleix et al 2008 a 3 d primitive equation free surface model based on hydrostatic and boussinesq approximation this model has already been used to successfully represent certain physical processes in the northwestern mediterranean sea e g dufau julliand et al 2004 ulses et al 2008 kersalé et al 2013 the symphonie version used here has been developed by hu et al 2011a the modeled zone 711 km by 303 km extends over the nw mediterranean sea including the whole of the gulf of lions and parts of the ligurian and catalan seas fig 2 the grid used a square horizontal mesh with a spatial resolution of 3 km by 3 km sigma coordinates were used on the vertical dimension with a maximum of 40 levels the model was run from january 9 2001 to december 24 2004 all details on the initial and boundary conditions are given in the studies of hu et al 2011a and campbell et al 2013 the biogeochemical model eco3m s is embedded in the eco3m platform baklouti et al 2006a b and is a multi nutrient and plankton functional types pft model that simulates the dynamics of several biogeochemical decoupled cycles of biogenic elements carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica and non redfieldian plankton groups the eco3m s version has been recently used and validated in the studies of hu et al 2011a b and campbell et al 2013 for the biogeochemical components and the hydrodynamics features respectively the model structure encompasses seven compartments of living organisms two of the three pft of autotrophs of the model from the smallest to the largest were accounted for 1 nano phytoplankton nanophy 2 20 μm that dominate the biomass of phytoplankton assemblages for most of the year marty et al 2002 marty and chiavérini 2010 with a heterogeneous taxonomic composition e g autotrophic dinobionts and 2 the micro phytoplankton community microphy 20 200 μm largely dominated by phytoplankton silicifiers mainly diatoms that can for certain periods contribute to a significant part of primary production and biomass during spring bloom in the nw mediterranean sea marty et al 2002 marty and chiavérini 2010 three of the four pfts of heterotrophs of the model from the smallest to the largest were considered 1 nano zooplankton nanozoo 5 20 μm mainly bacterivorous dinobionts and small ciliates that consume the smallest phytoplankton groups 2 μm and bacteria 2 micro zooplankton microzoo 20 200 μm mainly most of ciliates groups and large dinobionts having characteristics growth ingestion rates close to nanozoo but with a wider prey spectrum especially with potential consumption of micro phytoplankton and 3 meso zooplankton mesozoo 200 μm mainly copepod groups but also including amphipods grazing on the largest categories of plankton 20 μm micro phytoplankton and micro zooplankton and producing fast sinking fecal pellets all the formulations of the biogeochemical processes as well as the whole set of parameters have been extensively described in campbell et al 2013 constant mortality rates were applied to some of phytoplankton and zooplankton groups table 1 representing either senescence or viral attacks or predation 2 1 2 description of the htl model the osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems shin and cury 2001 shin and cury 2004 model version osmose 3 2 www osmose model org downloads is a two dimensional spatially explicit individual based model ibm written in java www osmose model org and based on the main assumption of opportunistic and size based predation osmose is a multispecies model representing the whole life cycle of several interacting species from eggs and larvae to juveniles and adults at the first time step following the production of eggs the total number of eggs of each population is split into super individuals called schools spatially distributed according to the input distribution maps at each time step osmose simulates the biological and ecological processes at the super individual level growth predation and forage reproduction natural and starvation mortalities as well as fishing mortality fig 1 the different sources of mortality of schools fishing predation starvation and diverse mortality occur in a random order two types of movements are considered in the osmose gol model 1 ontogenetic and seasonal migrations taken into account through the use of distribution maps and 2 small scale random diffusion when the distribution maps of schools depending on fish age stage size and season year does not change from one time step to the next 2 1 3 technical details on the two ways coupling mode the two ways coupling between the osmose gol and eco3m s symphonie models was performed through the predation process outputs of plankton groups provided by the ltl model serve as prey fields for the htl organisms which return an additional predation mortality in the plankton groups to circumvent the different spatial dimensions 3d vs 2d and units mmol n or c m 3 vs tons wet weight of the two models plankton concentrations were vertically integrated and converted into biomass using conversion factors table 1 only a small portion of plankton biomass is available to fish and macroinvertebrates due to various processes affecting their vertical distribution turbulence migrations etc availability of plankton to htl species is not easy to assess in the field and literature on this point is non existent therefore the availability parameters a p p for a given plankton group p were estimated table 2 via the calibration of the model see hereafter the two ways coupling mode meant that the htl model returns a specific mortality rate for each plankton group over space and time and these rates were computed from the amount of prey ingested as described in travers et al 2009 in each cell x y of osmose gol and for each plankton group p the htl induced mortality rate at time t δt was computed as the total biomass of plankton eaten be δt during the time step δt 15 days over the mean total plankton biomass b at time t multiplied by δt eq 1 as the maximum biomass of plankton p eaten by htl organisms at time t δt is the available biomass a p b x y t p at time t the htl induced mortality rate can thus vary between 0 and a p δ t because this variable mortality was added to the natural mortality m p already considered in the eco3m s model table 1 the latter rate was reduced to m p a p 2 δ t with a p 2 δ t being the median of the variable mortality due to htl species it was not set to zero in order to account for other sources of mortality such as predation by non modeled organisms senescence and starvation mortality outside the common domain between the eco3m s symphonie and osmose gol models fig 2 the plankton mortality rate was set to m p 1 m x y z t δ t p b e δ t x y p δ t b x y t p m p a p 2 δ t according to eq 1 the plankton total mortality rate thus ranges between m p a p 2 δ t and m p a p 2 δ t this rate can be either lower or higher than the initial mortality rate m p depending on the predation pressure induced by htl organisms 2 1 4 design of the numerical experiment a first spin up period of 35 years was launched in the one way forcing mode to reach equilibrium of the htl model outputs this step was achieved using the numerical fields of plankton biomass in 2001 following this period of spin up the model was then run in the one way forcing mode years 36 39 using the plankton biomass in 2001 and then in the two ways coupling mode for four years 40 43 for the last four years 40 43 the htl model received the numerical fields of ltl biomass for the years 2001 to 2004 these years was chosen because the ltl model has been previously validated over this period campbell et al 2013 the coupling simulation started on january 10 2001 00h00 and it ended on december 20 2004 00h00 years 36 39 one way forcing as well as the period of two ways coupling mode years 40 43 were considered for analysis hereafter furthermore a set of 50 replicated simulations was run to account for the stochasticity of the osmose model 2 2 parameterization of the htl model 2 2 1 modeled domain and selected htl groups in this study the osmose gol model grid consists of 19 by 15 cells with a resolution of 12 km by 12 km covering the gol area north of a line running from 42 04 3 18 to 43 05 5 37 fig 2 a set of 25 schools released per time step per species 600 per year per species was chosen for this model as a compromise between the stochasticity of the model and numerical limitations in memory and calculation speed as simulations with osmose necessitate extensive

and reproduction processes in the osmose model predation is assumed to be an opportunistic process and occurs when there is both size adequacy and spatio temporal co occurrence between predator and prey within a cell of the grid a predator can feed on a co occurring prey if 1 the prey is of a suitable size that is within a range determined by the minimum and maximum predator prey size ratios and 2 the vertical distribution of the prey makes it accessible to the predator which is determined by the accessibility coefficients provided to osmose gol therefore the food web or diet matrix builds up as an emergent property of local trophic interactions travers et al 2009 minimum and maximum predator prey size ratios table 3 were parameterized differently for different size classes for each taxon

considered in the osmose gol model additional sources of natural mortality concerning other life stages have also been accounted for m s table 2 including mortality due to disease senescence and predation by organisms not represented in the osmose gol model e g birds mammals etc since it is usually very hard to quantify these types of mortality they have been assessed through the calibration of the model for each of the ten htl species 2 3 calibration for the htl model the osmose gol model has been calibrated using an optimization technique based on an evolutionary algorithm and a maximum likelihood based objective function so that the modeled biomass and landings of the ten htl species remained within realistic observed ranges the data sources used for the biomass are from the pelmed

project org package calibrar that has been specifically developed for calibrating complex ecological models and osmose2r http www osmose model org https cran r project org package osmose which includes a set of r functions for interfacing osmose with calibrar the calibration step aimed at providing estimates of the following parameters of the model i availability coefficients of plankton groups to htl species ii larval mortality rate for each species and iii fishing mortality rates for each species table 2 these parameters have been selected because they are highly model dependent i e their meaning depends on the model structure and assumptions and there are no reasonable initial estimates for plankton accessibility and larval mortality oliveros ramos et al 2015 the objective function minimized by the algorithm is built automatically by the r package by aggregating lognormal likelihood functions that quantify the fit between model outputs and field observations biomass and landings from year 2001 were given to the algorithm for every modeled species as the observed data and the osmose gol model was forced with the ltl biomass of the eco3m s symphonie model from the same year in this way a steady state calibration of the osmose gol model has been achieved for year 2001 that is the first year of the coupled simulation the calibration step enabled us to obtain a set of parameters so that biomass and landings of the considered htl species best range between the minima and maxima of the observed biomass in the gol this parameter set was then used in the coupled model 2 4 datasets for the evaluation of the e2e model 2 4 1 evaluating phytoplankton biomass of the ltl model using remote sensing satellite data ocean color data from the globcolour project www glocolour info were used in this study to evaluate the realism of the modeled surface chlorophyll a concentrations considered as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass the globcolour product takes advantage of gathering data sets derived from several ocean color sensors envisat modis meris and seawifs three sensors seawifs meris and modis showed a temporal overlap of functioning from april 2002 to december 2010 and it was possible to perform a quantitative comparison between satellite and modeled chlorophyll a values over most 990 days of the modeled period 1440 days the globcolour product provided a weighted mean c h l w and a weighted error ε c h l w the detailed computation of these parameters is given in the product user guide of globcolour available on the aforementioned web site in order to accurately compare the concentrations of the satellite derived chlorophyll a to those modeled the numerical concentrations of total chlorophyll sum of chlorophyll a concentrations of pico nano and microphytoplankton were averaged over the first optical layer sensu bricaud et al 2010 c h l o p t 1 the details of the computation are given in the recent study of campbell et al 2013 the model derived chlorophyll a values were re interpolated point by point at the size of each pixel 1 1 km of the satellite image on the modeled domain the period of assessment 990 days was characterized by more than a third 34 of cloudy days without useable pixels on the modeled area therefore the comparison was made on the remaining days corresponding to a total of 236 877 pixels a metric of model to data comparison c parameter was built and used hereafter this metric assessed the size of the discrepancies between the predicted and satellite values as follows c 0 if c h l o p t 1 c h l w ε c h l w

species obtained as output of the osmose gol model were compared with in situ field data obtained from stomach content analyses le bourg et al 2015 bănaru 2015 bănaru pers commun or literature data båmstedt and karlson 1998 sara and sara 2007 mellon duval et al 2017 for similar individual sizes estimated trophic levels tl from the osmose gol model were compared with tl values from the literature

of these comparisons was to check whether the parameterization and the processes of the model were able to reproduce trophic interactions close to those observed in field data 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibrated biomass and landings of the htl model against data the calibration of the model enabled us to estimate some parameters of the htl model such as the accessibility coefficients of the plankton and larval mortality of htl species and to refine the fishing mortality estimates the success of this calibration step lies in the ability of the model once run with this set of calibrated parameters to provide results remaining within realistic ranges for the biomass and landings of htl species the modeled median biomass fig 3 and landings fig 4 of the ten htl species and their corresponding envelopes delimiting 0 25 and 0 75 percentiles are presented for years 36 39 in the one way forcing configuration the modeled biomass and landings for years 40 43 resulting from the two ways coupling mode are presented and discussed in the companion paper diaz et al 2019 for the detailed comparison with one way forcing mode effects most of the modeled biomass of htl species showed seasonal patterns of change in median values within the ranges of the field observations fig 3 except for that of european hake which is slightly overestimated the biomass of certain species such as the european hake is known to be underestimated due mainly to the difficulty of catching large individuals during scientific surveys bigot pers commun the median simulated biomass of northern krill fig 3a showed a seasonal dynamic with the highest values occurring in winter and the lowest at the end of the spring the seasonal patterns of change of southern shortfin squid fig 3b showed median levels of biomass around 2 5 104 tons with maximum values at the end of summer and minimum values at the end of winter the stock of european pilchard fig 3c showed cyclical variations around 2 105 tons with maxima reached in spring and minima at the beginning of the winter the median biomass of european anchovy fig 3d showed cyclical seasonal variations centered on 106 tons and characterized by highest biomass from mid winter to the end of spring and the lowest during autumn the seasonal variation of the european sprat fig 3e biomass was very low the median levels were around 1 104 tons with a barely discernible peak at the end of summer the seasonal dynamics of atlantic horse mackerel fig 3f showed an increase in biomass at the end of autumn a very weak seasonal signal in the biomass of atlantic mackerel was simulated fig 3g with the highest biomass extending from winter to mid spring and a minimum occurring from mid summer to mid autumn the biomass of blue whiting fig 3h did not show any clear seasonal pattern and oscillated around 4 104 tons the temporal changes of european hake biomass fig 3i also showed a very weak seasonal signal with values around 1 4 104 tons by contrast the biomass of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 3j showed a marked seasonal cycle with a minimum of biomass during winter 5 103 to 5 5 103 tons followed by a sharp increase to reach a first seasonal maximum at the beginning of the spring 5 6 103 to 6 2 103 tons another biomass minimum occurred at the beginning of summer and then the annual peak around 7 103 tons is observed in autumn there were no seasonal biomass field data to use for comparison with model output as scientific surveys were only organized during summer on the whole for most of the htl species the whole or at least pro parte interannual dynamics of modeled median landings and the corresponding range of percentiles were within the ranges of observed data fig 4 however the median landings of southern shortfin squid fig 4b and of atlantic mackerel fig 4f were much higher than those observed by a factor of 16 800 tons and 2 5 500 tons with regard to observed landings respectively without any marked seasonal pattern a possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the underestimation of the landings of southern shortfin squid and atlantic mackerel in sih 2017 landings databases as for many other demersal and benthic species because fishermen often directly sell their fish at local markets crpmem paca 2016 landings of northern krill and european sprat fig 4a and e are not computed by the model as they are not landed by fishermen the simulated temporal dynamics of planktivorous fish such as european pilchard and european anchovy showed marked and steady seasonal cycles the median landings for european pilchard fig 4c were minimum 180 tons at the beginning of winter they rapidly increased during winter and reached a relative maximum 400 tons at the beginning of spring then they briefly fell below 400 tons and again increased up to their absolute maximum 750 tons at the beginning of summer they sharply decreased from the middle of summer to the end of the autumn down the absolute minimum maximum simulated values were higher than the maximum observed values during the first half of summer the simulated landings of european anchovy fig 4d also showed a minimum 100 tons at the beginning of winter but the catch then increased very rapidly up to a first peak of 180 tons and an absolute maximum 250 tons at the end of spring the summer season is marked by a sharp decrease in landings and a third peak of landings 200 220 tons in autumn the whole set of seasonal modeled values remained within the range of observed landings the seasonal changes in median landings for atlantic horse mackerel fig 4f were characterized by two maxima in spring and autumn the spring maximum comprised between 20 and 28 tons was generally higher than the autumn maximum 20 tons in parallel minima around 10 tons or lower were simulated during winter and summer only the maximum values of landings during spring and autumn fell within the range of observed landings the temporal patterns of change in simulated landings for blue whiting fig 4h showed a very marked seasonal trend median landings were close to zero from the beginning of summer to the end of autumn they sharply increased to reach 40 tons at the beginning of spring and then drastically dropped during spring the modeled landings were underestimated during the first half of the year the median landings of the european hake fig 4i remained around 100 tons from mid winter to the end of summer within the range of observed landings during this period of year they fell sharply during autumn to well below the lower limit of observed data with a minimum of 10 tons before increasing again at the beginning of winter modeled landings of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 4j were close to zero only over a short period of the year mainly from the end of autumn to the beginning of winter catches sharply increased up to 250 tons during spring before slightly declining to just below 200 tons at the beginning of summer summer was marked by an abrupt increase in the catches reaching 500 tons at the end of summer this seasonal cycle is characterized by simulated landings that were close to field data 3 2 comparing phytoplankton surface biomass of the ltl model with ocean color data the seasonal cycle of surface satellite derived chlorophyll a content averaged over the modeled area from april 2002 to december 2004 fig 5 is typical of those usually observed at oceanic mid latitudes e g siegel et al 2002 with average minima during summer months and maxima from winter to late spring the very low summer concentrations 10 1 mg m 3 or lower are considered as representative of the mediterranean sea bosc et al 2004 as expected the seasonal pattern found during the study period was close to the bloom trophic regime according to the classification of d ortenzio and ribera d alcalà 2009 for the mediterranean sea an interannual variability of the seasonal cycle could be detected with the year 2003 being characterized by a longer summer period of low chlorophyll a than 2002 and 2004 the year 2003 did not show any clear autumnal bloom while it was particularly marked in mid september 2002 and september and november 2004 the inter annual variability in the phytoplankton surface content in this area of the mediterranean sea is a common feature that has been already observed in some other remote sensing time series bosc et al 2004 auger et al 2014 and in situ data e g marty and chiavérini 2010 gernez et al 2011 beyond the seasonal dynamics the time series highlights the variability of mean values at very high frequency i e day to day whatever the season considered most of the time large error bars also suggest a strong spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton content in the nw mediterranean sea this variability at high frequency and the strong spatial heterogeneity are mainly due to the multiple physical forcing occurring in this marine area such as changing wind gusts that drive intricate sub mesoscale hydrodynamic processes e g eddies see hu et al 2011a b and upwellings millot 1999 river inputs discharging large amounts of nutrients throughout the year e g minas and minas 1989 and the large scale circulation of the northern current sometimes intruding on the shelf petrenko 2003 all the aforementioned physical processes interact together at different spatial and temporal scales and play a key role in setting ocean dynamics heat transport and biogeochemical budgets through intense upwelling of nutrients subduction of plankton and horizontal stirring see review of lévy 2008 the ltl model was able to reproduce the seasonal signal and the inter annual variability of phytoplankton surface concentrations the model also captured the daily variability however the modeled concentrations were most of the time underestimated compared to the satellite derived means concentrations especially during late spring and summer it is crucial to keep in mind that ocean color data in the mediterranean sea have to be considered with caution because the algorithms used to derive the chlorophyll a concentrations perform poorly in this regional sea gregg and casey 2004 volpe et al 2007 and references therein these low performances are generally attributed to the particular composition i e inorganic and organic matter of the water column causing an overestimation of chlorophyll a surface concentrations for low values especially of chlorophyll i e during summer and in oligotrophic waters this bias between in situ data and values derived from algorithms would be furthermore accentuated in the area of the rhone freshwater influence according to the study of ouillon and petrenko 2005 the c parameter assessing error between model output and data see section 2 4 2 was null during ca 23 of the comparison period this result means that the modeled chlorophyll value remained within the range of the error bars given by the globcolour algorithm during a quarter of the simulation period furthermore fig 6 shows the temporal changes in the globcolour errors on chlorophyll a concentrations and of the c parameter the globcolour errors and the c parameter were the lowest 1 25 10 1 mg m 3 during summer especially in 2003 and 2004 when they were the most variable and highest from autumn to mid spring the c parameter was lower than the satellite sensor errors during ca 71 of the comparison period which is a rather satisfactory result 3 3 comparing modeled and observed diet of the htl species fig 7 shows the modeled diet of every size class of the ten htl species in order to describe the diets emerging from the osmose gol model prey groups were classified into three categories according to their proportion in biomass in the predator s diet main prey 50 secondary prey from 10 to 50 accessory prey up to 10 according to the model the main prey of the northern krill is microphytoplankton 56 while the secondary prey is microzooplankton 35 mesozooplankton remains an accessory prey 8 this modeled diet composed of phyto and zooplankton in almost equal parts is consistent with the observations of båmstedt and karlson 1998 on krill of the northeast atlantic according to this field study northern krill may not survive on a diet only based on phytoplankton and needs to consume at least 40 of zooplankton the modeled southern shortfin squid mainly feeds on small teleosts 77 such as planktivorous european pilchard 36 and european anchovy 21 but also on juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel 9 and blue whiting 8 small squid i e cannibalism 11 are secondary prey while northern krill 8 and mesozooplankton 4 are accessory prey of southern shortfin squid this modeled diet is consistent with some in situ datasets bănaru 2015 showing a diet mainly composed by 80 of teleosts in the latter field study southern shortfin squid prey on certain other groups such as benthic decapods but these groups were not represented in the osmose gol model according to the model outputs european pilchard larvae 3 cm mainly feed on mesozooplankton 81 this trophic behavior for larvae are close to the results of borme et al 2009 in the mediterranean sea showing a diet almost exclusively 99 composed of copepods in the size range of mesozooplankton larger individuals significantly change their diet feeding on smaller prey with microzooplankton 51 of the diet of juveniles ranging between 3 and 12 5 cm and 52 for adults 12 5 cm as main prey and microphytoplankton as secondary prey 44 of the diet of juveniles and 43 for adults the latter results are not in line with some recent dietary field studies based on the analysis of stomach content in the gulf of lions according to the study of le bourg et al 2015 juveniles of european pilchard as well as adults may prey quasi exhaustively on mesozooplankton 98 and 100 respectively however this mismatch between model outputs and observations has to be moderated because the study of bode et al 2004 showed that the size of the prey generally decreases with increasing body length of european pilchard hence adults may consume a larger part of phytoplankton according to the latter study as phytoplankton prey are actually more easily digested they are therefore more difficult to identify in stomach contents which may explain the differences between the model and observations for this fish species moreover the study of pethybridge et al 2014 using analysis of fatty acids in adults of european pilchard confirms the assumption that its diet is mainly based on microplankton the modeled european anchovy including its larvae stage has a diet similar to those of the juveniles and adults of european pilchard all stages mainly feed on microzooplankton 55 of the diet for larvae 3 cm 49 for juveniles ranging between 3 and 12 5 cm and 44 for adults 12 5 cm their secondary prey is the microphytoplankton group 39 for larvae 40 for juveniles and 36 for adults mesozooplankton is only an accessory prey representing about 5 of the diet for larvae and juveniles and around 7 for adults the simulated diet of the larvae is close to observed data analyzing fatty acids content rossi et al 2006 showed that microzooplankton and microphytoplankton are the prey most consumed by anchovy larvae however the modeled diet for adult anchovy is rather different from those resulting from the analysis of stomach content borme et al 2009 le bourg et al 2015 in the observations as for the european pilchard the proportions of microzooplankton and microphytoplankton may be underestimated due to a rapid digestion of these types of prey the modeled diet of european sprat juveniles is similar to those of juveniles and adults of the european pilchard and of all size classes of the european anchovy the diet of the juveniles is composed of microzooplankton 48 of the diet and microphytoplankton 34 the proportion of consumed mesoozooplankton 14 is higher than in the diet of the juveniles of the european sardine and anchovy but is much lower than that observed in their stomach content 100 according to the study of le bourg et al 2015 the modeled diet of european sprat larvae 3 cm is mainly composed of mesozooplankton 81 which is consistent with previous observations dickmann 2005 mesozooplankton is furthermore the main prey for adults but in much higher proportions 68 than for the adults of european pilchard and anchovy 4 5 and 7 respectively adults also consume as secondary prey some european pilchard larvae 16 in the model the european sprat including larvae and adults thus appears to be more carnivorous than the european sardine and anchovy this modeled output is in line with the dataset of pethybridge et al 2014 based on the comparative analysis of the fatty acids content of these three pelagic species in the model pilchard eggs and larvae are another significant prey 16 for the adults of european sprat as also observed in their stomach content le bourg et al 2015 the diet of the juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel predicted by the model is composed of a dominant proportion of mesozooplankton 62 and a lesser proportion of fish larvae 25 while the study of le luherne 2012 based on the analysis of stomach content showed a dominant consumption of northern krill 71 in proportion and a lesser proportion 21 of benthic decapods not modeled these differences may result from opportunistic predation behavior making the diets highly variable between the sampling stations inside the gol domain as well as from some differences between the spatial domain of the model entire gol and the specific locations of the sampling stations used in the study of le luherne 2012 adults of atlantic horse mackerel 16 cm have a modeled diet which is quite different from that of juveniles they mainly feed on southern shortfin squid 37 and northern krill 28 some other prey such as juveniles of european sprat and hake and atlantic mackerel supplement their diet 17 the cumulated percentage of consumed fish is rather high 34 the modeled proportion of northern krill consumed is close to that resulting from the analysis of in situ stomach content 21 le luherne 2012 by contrast the latter empirical study did not show the presence of southern shortfin squid in the stomach of analyzed individuals differences between model outputs and observations may again result from differences in diet when estimated from the entire modeled domain rather than from some particular locations as in the study of le luherne 2012 differences in the diet of predators may also result from inter annual variations in the spatial distribution and density of prey furthermore a major bias in the modeling of the diet of atlantic horse mackerel adults is that a dominant proportion of consumed prey 54 of macrozooplankton in the form of pteropods and 21 of decapods le luherne 2012 is not represented as potential prey in the model in the model the juveniles of atlantic mackerel 20 cm mainly consume certain planktivorous fish a result which is consistent with observations le luherne 2012 however the modeled diet appears to be dominated by european pilchard 38 and european anchovy 22 while the analysis of stomach content data rather shows a high consumption of sprats 37 and to a lesser extent anchovies 16 accessory prey are diverse i e mesozooplankton northern krill southern shortfin squid atlantic horse mackerel blue whiting other prey each of them accounting for 6 7 of the modeled diet the differences in the consumed fish species between the model and observations may be attributable to differences in species composition between the modeled period 2001 2004 and the field studies that were carried out in 2011 2012 le luherne 2012 since 2008 the biomass of european pilchard has strongly declined in the gulf of lions while that of sprat has increased van beveren et al 2014 macrozooplankton and groups of benthic species that are not represented in the model account for significant proportions of the stomach content 27 19 respectively le luherne 2012 the model succeeded in predicting the functional group consumed i e planktivorous fish for the juveniles of atlantic mackerel adults of atlantic mackerel 20 cm are even more piscivorous than juveniles since their modeled diet is almost 90 composed of fish the most consumed fish are firstly european pilchard 46 and secondarily european anchovy 26 in the model comparatively the proportion of consumed teleosts observed in stomach content amounts to almost 90 in the study of le luherne 2012 but the teleost species could not be identified due to too advanced digestion of prey juveniles of blue whiting 15 cm have a rather diversified diet in the model they feed on certain plankton groups mesozooplankton at 19 and northern krill at 25 on southern shortfin squid 10 and on different species of fish 46 the most consumed fish species are european pilchard 27 atlantic horse mackerel 10 and blue whiting 6 this result is different from those obtained in the study of bourgogne 2013 who observed only decapods not represented in the model in the stomach content of analyzed juveniles in the model adults of blue whiting 15 cm mainly feed on fish 65 secondarily on northern krill 26 and southern shortfin squid 10 the most preyed species of fish are european pilchard 32 atlantic horse mackerel 11 blue whiting 12 and european anchovy 8 the study of bourgogne 2013 showed a proportion of northern krill 33 close to that provided by the model the main difference between model and observations is in the dominant prey the proportion of teleosts consumed amounts to 65 in the model while stomach content data show a lower proportion 35 bourgogne 2013 in parallel benthic decapods not modeled have been found in a significant proportion 32 in the stomach content of analyzed adults which may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet of adults and field data in the model the main prey of the european hake juveniles are teleosts 90 among these teleosts the most consumed species are firstly the european pilchard 42 secondly the european anchovy 24 and thirdly the blue whiting 13 in parallel a recent study of stomach content from the same area mellon duval et al 2017 revealed in situ diet mainly composed of teleosts 80 and to 100 in more detail the european pilchard was observed in the highest proportion 22 74 but the european anchovy and the blue whiting were also detected in lesser proportions 6 30 and 1 3 respectively the model results also match the observations of two other recent studies estimating at 92 the proportion of teleosts in the diet of juveniles merquiol 2016 bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 in the model adults as juveniles feed mostly on teleosts 93 the teleost prey are firstly european pilchard in a proportion of 43 and secondly blue whiting at 13 other fish species such as european sprat atlantic mackerel and european hake supplement their diet up to 16 mellon duval et al 2017 found from the analysis of stomach content a roughly similar proportion of european pilchard 38 and slightly higher proportion of blue whiting 26 30 the modeled diet of atlantic bluefin tuna is almost exclusively piscivorous 93 and composed of small teleosts european pilchard is the main prey 51 while european anchovy 23 and blue whiting 10 are the secondary prey southern shortfin squid is only an accessory prey 7 this preference for planktivorous teleosts mainly european anchovy has already been shown from the analysis of the stomach content of individuals caught in the gulf of lions imbert et al 2007 once again the minor mismatches observed between the modeled diet and that from the field data may result from a dataset based on sampling carried out outside the temporal window of the simulation period this fast swimming pelagic tuna species has been shown to have a high variability in its distribution at different spatial and temporal scales in the gol royer et al 2004 3 4 comparing tl in the e2e modeled food web with literature data the e2e modeled food web fig 8 is composed of 15 compartments organized into four trophic levels tl this food web length is rather common in natural ecosystems hastings and conrad 1979 five plankton groups represent the lowest tl 1 2 while ten invertebrates and teleost groups represent the highest tl 3 the highest flows of predation occur between the phyto and zooplankton groups 106 tons year 1 and sharply decrease with increasing tl which is a common feature observed in trophic pyramids odum 1959 primary producers such as nano and microphytoplankton representing the first tl are mainly consumed by nano tl 2 0 micro tl 2 0 and mesozooplankton tl 2 2 among these groups mesozooplankton has the highest tl as it consumes both phyto and zooplankton planktivorous species such as northern krill tl 2 5 european pilchard tl 2 7 european anchovy tl 2 8 and european sprat tl 2 9 mainly feed on micro and mesozooplankton the european pilchard has a more omnivorous diet with a consumption of microphytoplankton of the same order of magnitude as that of microzooplankton or even higher than that of mesozooplankton for these planktivorous species tl increases from the northern krill to the european sprat in agreement with literature data båmstedt and karlson 1998 stergiou and karpouzi 2002 le bourg et al 2015 among the meso predators the atlantic horse mackerel has the lowest tl tl 3 5 followed by those of atlantic mackerel tl 3 9 southern shortfin squid tl 4 0 blue whiting tl 4 0 atlantic bluefin tuna tl 4 0 and european hake tl 4 1 these tls are close to field data stergiou and karpouzi 2002 sara and sara 2007 bănaru 2015 bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 mellon duval et al 2017 some larvae of these teleosts are consumed by cannibalism and also by other species of similar lower and higher tl on the whole the modeled tls are in agreement with literature data and ecopath gol outputs for most of the 10 htl species fig 9 some interesting points can however be highlighted the modeled tls of southern shortfin squid are slightly higher than those in the literature bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 and from ecopath outputs bănaru et al 2013 the predator prey size ratios of the present model may be better adjusted in order to obtain a modeled tl for southern shortfin squid closer to field and literature data the modeled tls of juveniles and adults of european pilchard are close to the minimum values estimated from the analysis of the stomach content stergiou and karpouzi 2002 or using δ 15n stable isotope ratios bănaru 2015 while the corresponding larvae show their numerical tls close to the observed highest values in this case too the predator prey size ratios of the model may be better adjusted the tls of all species except pilchard and to a lesser extent blue whiting increase with increasing size of individuals in order to better account for ontogenetic changes in tl chassot et al 2008 reed et al 2017 it would be useful in the future to better refine field estimation of trophic levels by size it is interesting and encouraging to note that the tls computed from two very different approaches of e2e modeling i e osmose vs ecopath are very close for most of htl species except for european pilchard and blue whiting even if the represented periods in these models partly overlap 2001 2004 for osmose and 2000 2009 for ecopath and the modeled area is the same major differences in conception between these two models opportunistic size based diet in osmose and fixed diet in ecopath may explain these small differences in trophic level results osmose is an individual size based spatial and dynamic model while ecopath is a mass balanced model with no size groups non spatialized and offering a static snapshot of the system moreover ecopath includes more groups and species benthic groups marine mammals birds and others which are not represented in osmose data gaps concerning the diet of some species were highlighted by bănaru et al 2013 and new recent diet data were included in the osmose model parametrization 4 conclusion the gol is a highly exploited area for fisheries demaneche et al 2009 bănaru et al 2013 here as in other parts of the world fishing has reduced the biomass of top predators aldebert 1997 piroddi et al 2017 with potential cascading effects on the flows and biomass in the food web pauly et al 1998 cury et al 2003 bănaru et al 2010 ferretti et al 2010 climate variations impact the gol ecosystems through river inputs ludwig et al 2009 or hydrological processes hermann et al 2008 as shown in other areas the impact of fishing combined with climate changes induces sometimes unexpected effects in the ecosystems travers trolet et al 2014 auber et al 2015 the end to end modeling approach aims at understanding and anticipating some of these processes this paper presents the first spatialized dynamic coupled end to end ecosystem model for the gol the modeled groups and species represent more than 70 of annual catches in this area and they encompass the pelagic and demersal ecosystem trophic structure organized into four trophic levels the assessment of both ltl and htl groups and species of the e2e osmose gol model showed a satisfactory agreement with literature satellite and field local data in terms of biomass landings and diet the model has been parametrized with the best available local data following the calibration stage realistic ranges for the biomass and landings have been obtained for most species and groups biomass for the european hake and landings for the atlantic mackerel are however slightly overestimated at first sight it might be considered that these differences are acceptable owing to uncertainties existing in biomass estimations and landings data however some improvements of the model are obviously still possible predator prey size ratios may be refined to produce a better correspondence between model and field data sex ratio established by default at 0 5 may be refined with field data when available the distribution maps currently based on presence absence may be replaced with density based maps fishing mortality considered uniform for the entire domain may be also spatialized previous versions of the osmose model have already been applied in different ecosystems to address various questions regarding i the assessment of the ecosystem trophic structure marzloff et al 2009 grüss et al 2015 halouani et al 2016 fu et al 2017 ii the effect of marine protected areas yemane et al 2009 iii the combined effects of fishing and climate change travers et al 2009 fu et al 2013 2018 travers trolet et al 2014 iv the simulation of fishing scenarios shin et al 2004 travers et al 2010 smith et al 2011 grüss et al 2016 and v the testing of indicator performance travers et al 2006 shin et al 2018 however the present version of e2e osmose for the gol may go further in the analysis of the fine impact of the predation pressure exerted by htl planktivorous species on the spatial distributions and the structure size trophic shortcut etc of the plankton community it may also contribute to the understanding of complex processes of simultaneous bottom up and top down controls in this exploited ecosystem diaz et al 2019 moreover this type of e2e model may allow for the quantitative assessment of the combined effects of fishing and climate change scenarios on the ecosystem dynamics and for the computation of model based indicators used to assess whether an ecosystem and its services are used sustainably and then maintained coll et al 2016 the impact of existing or future marine protected areas gulf of lions fisheries restricted area etc and spatio temporal management measures on the structure and the functioning of the ecosystem may also be tested in future this coupled e2e model may be extended to the entire mediterranean sea and

25067,an end to end model named osmose gol has been built for the gulf of lions the main french mediterranean fishing area this spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model eco3m s symphonie ltl low trophic level model to osmose htl high trophic level model it includes 15 compartments of living organisms five from the ltl model i e nanophytoplankton microphytoplankton nanozooplankton microzooplankton and mesozooplankton and ten from the htl model northern krill southern shortfin squid european pilchard european anchovy european sprat atlantic horse mackerel atlantic mackerel blue whiting european hake and atlantic bluefin tuna with the exception of northern krill and european sprat all htl species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure the modeled species represent more than 70 of annual catches in this area this paper presents the parameterization calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass landings diet and trophic level data for htl groups for most species the diets in output of osmose gol are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species however some differences were observed various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the htl predators were not modeled in osmose gol field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations while our data concern the period 2001 2004 and the entire modeled domain inter and intra annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences the model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the htl compartments these values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous ecopath model for the same area and period even though some improvements are still possible this model may already be of use to explore fishery or marine protected areas scenarios for socio ecosystem management issues keywords ecosystem modeling food web fisheries osmose eco3m 1 introduction end to end e2e models are particularly appropriate to disentangle the intricacy of interactions occurring between physical forcing and low and high trophic level communities in the context of a quantitative approach dedicated to ecosystem based management ebm e g travers et al 2007 rose 2012 they use multiple field data sets and are able to assess and simulate the dynamics of the main descriptors of the ecosystem rather than evaluating single resources and single threats shin et al 2010 christensen and walters 2011 collie et al 2016 similar approaches driven by modeling and information are used not just in ecology but in many other areas to improve and in some cases save our lifes helbing et al 2015 however the implementation of end to end modeling remains challenging mainly due to the major differences between the sub models of hydrodynamics and ltl organisms on the one hand and that of htl organisms on the other hand see review by rose et al 2010 the challenges are numerous and concern both concepts e g representation of the zooplankton key level differential scaling of processes behavioral movement of htl organisms etc and technical issues e g different programming languages and time steps one of the main challenges concerns the nature of link between sub models travers et al 2009 considered two possible types of links between ltl and htl models in the one way forcing mode ltl groups biomasses serve as prey fields to htl groups without any feedback on the ltl compartments in the two ways coupling mode the biomass of the ltl groups serve as prey field for htl groups and an explicit rate of htl induced predation is specifically applied as feedback on each of the ltl groups over the last decade e2e modeling studies applied to regions or to the whole basin of the mediterranean sea have flourished in the context of ebm coll and libralato 2012 this research trend has been mainly driven by the more and more numerous observations of increasing threats and impacts on the mediterranean marine ecosystems due to the exponential development of anthropogenic activities e g lotze et al 2011 coll et al 2012 most of these modeling studies have been based on the ecopath with ecosim ewe model see review of coll and libralato 2012 and only a few have used alternative models spatial and multispecies models such as the osmose size based model halouani et al 2016 or age structured models applied to single species e g santojanni et al 2005 furthermore while implementation of the ebm of the gulf of lions gol is particularly crucial owing to its major contribution to mediterranean fisheries catches sacchi 2008 demaneche et al 2009 this shelf area has been poorly investigated to date coll and libralato 2012 only the recent study by bănaru et al 2013 dealt with the fishing impact on the trophic structure of the marine ecosystem using an ewe approach however this study is not spatialized and is based on some crude assumptions concerning for example the plankton compartment prey for the planktivorous fish species for which the biomass level is determined from the literature and satellite imagery a major bias of this type of modeling approach is that it does not account for the close coupling between the physical and biological sensu largo processes yet these interactions occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the nw mediterranean sea and it has now been well demonstrated that they have a significant impact on the dynamics and the spatial distribution of marine organisms from plankton to top predators e g fromentin et al 2003 niewiadomska et al 2008 cotté et al 2011 campbell et al 2013 it is therefore necessary to represent the gulf of lions ecosystem more realistically in particular the environmental forcing the spatial dynamics of living organisms and their interactions to enable a finer analysis of the functioning of the ecosystems and in fine to plan its optimal management for the next decades the e2e approach developed in this study is based on a fully dynamic coupling i e two ways coupling of two pre existing sub models representing the dynamics of ltl organisms driven by hydrodynamics and climate processes on the one hand and the dynamics of htl organisms impacted by fishing activities on the other hand the first model component is the eco3m s symphonie model that has been successfully used in the north western mediterranean sea to advance our understanding of the influence of hydrodynamics and atmospheric drivers on the distribution of plankton at different spatial and temporal scales e g auger et al 2011 2014 campbell et al 2013 carlotti et al 2014 the second component model is the individual and size based model osmose shin and cury 2004 this htl model has been applied worldwide in order to achieve better understanding of the functioning of diverse marine ecosystems e g travers et al 2006 marzloff et al 2009 fu et al 2013 grüss et al 2015 2016 halouani et al 2016 the aim of the present paper is to document an e2e model developed for the gol the osmose gol model and based on dynamic feedback two ways coupling between two pre existing ltl and htl sub models numerous data sets available in this marine region have been used to calibrate and quantitatively evaluate both the ltl and the htl modules of the osmose gol model an application of this model that consists in an analysis of the impacts of the predation pressure exerted by htl planktivorous species on the spatial distributions the structure of the ltl community and food webs controls is presented in a companion paper diaz et al 2019 2 methods 2 1 the e2e modeling approach the approach developed in this study is based on the coupling of two existing sub models the first is the eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 that represents the dynamics of ltl organisms driven by hydrodynamics and climate processes the second is the individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2015 that simulates the dynamics of htl organisms both models have been fully described in previous works therefore only the main characteristics are given hereafter they are coupled in two distinct modes fig 1 in the one way forcing mode the biomass outputs of the ltl model are provided as inputs for the osmose model without any feedback on the ltl biomass in the two ways coupling mode there is a dynamic feedback between the two models through the predation process the biomass outputs of the ltl model are provided as inputs for the osmose model which provides in return an additional rate of predation by the htl planktivorous organisms 2 1 1 description of the ltl model the ltl model is composed of two coupled models the symphonie hydrodynamic model and the eco3m s biogeochemical model campbell et al 2013 the meteorological and hydrodynamic processes influencing the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients and plankton were simulated by the symphonie model marsaleix et al 2008 a 3 d primitive equation free surface model based on hydrostatic and boussinesq approximation this model has already been used to successfully represent certain physical processes in the northwestern mediterranean sea e g dufau julliand et al 2004 ulses et al 2008 kersalé et al 2013 the symphonie version used here has been developed by hu et al 2011a the modeled zone 711 km by 303 km extends over the nw mediterranean sea including the whole of the gulf of lions and parts of the ligurian and catalan seas fig 2 the grid used a square horizontal mesh with a spatial resolution of 3 km by 3 km sigma coordinates were used on the vertical dimension with a maximum of 40 levels the model was run from january 9 2001 to december 24 2004 all details on the initial and boundary conditions are given in the studies of hu et al 2011a and campbell et al 2013 the biogeochemical model eco3m s is embedded in the eco3m platform baklouti et al 2006a b and is a multi nutrient and plankton functional types pft model that simulates the dynamics of several biogeochemical decoupled cycles of biogenic elements carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica and non redfieldian plankton groups the eco3m s version has been recently used and validated in the studies of hu et al 2011a b and campbell et al 2013 for the biogeochemical components and the hydrodynamics features respectively the model structure encompasses seven compartments of living organisms two of the three pft of autotrophs of the model from the smallest to the largest were accounted for 1 nano phytoplankton nanophy 2 20 μm that dominate the biomass of phytoplankton assemblages for most of the year marty et al 2002 marty and chiavérini 2010 with a heterogeneous taxonomic composition e g autotrophic dinobionts and 2 the micro phytoplankton community microphy 20 200 μm largely dominated by phytoplankton silicifiers mainly diatoms that can for certain periods contribute to a significant part of primary production and biomass during spring bloom in the nw mediterranean sea marty et al 2002 marty and chiavérini 2010 three of the four pfts of heterotrophs of the model from the smallest to the largest were considered 1 nano zooplankton nanozoo 5 20 μm mainly bacterivorous dinobionts and small ciliates that consume the smallest phytoplankton groups 2 μm and bacteria 2 micro zooplankton microzoo 20 200 μm mainly most of ciliates groups and large dinobionts having characteristics growth ingestion rates close to nanozoo but with a wider prey spectrum especially with potential consumption of micro phytoplankton and 3 meso zooplankton mesozoo 200 μm mainly copepod groups but also including amphipods grazing on the largest categories of plankton 20 μm micro phytoplankton and micro zooplankton and producing fast sinking fecal pellets all the formulations of the biogeochemical processes as well as the whole set of parameters have been extensively described in campbell et al 2013 constant mortality rates were applied to some of phytoplankton and zooplankton groups table 1 representing either senescence or viral attacks or predation 2 1 2 description of the htl model the osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems shin and cury 2001 shin and cury 2004 model version osmose 3 2 www osmose model org downloads is a two dimensional spatially explicit individual based model ibm written in java www osmose model org and based on the main assumption of opportunistic and size based predation osmose is a multispecies model representing the whole life cycle of several interacting species from eggs and larvae to juveniles and adults at the first time step following the production of eggs the total number of eggs of each population is split into super individuals called schools spatially distributed according to the input distribution maps at each time step osmose simulates the biological and ecological processes at the super individual level growth predation and forage reproduction natural and starvation mortalities as well as fishing mortality fig 1 the different sources of mortality of schools fishing predation starvation and diverse mortality occur in a random order two types of movements are considered in the osmose gol model 1 ontogenetic and seasonal migrations taken into account through the use of distribution maps and 2 small scale random diffusion when the distribution maps of schools depending on fish age stage size and season year does not change from one time step to the next 2 1 3 technical details on the two ways coupling mode the two ways coupling between the osmose gol and eco3m s symphonie models was performed through the predation process outputs of plankton groups provided by the ltl model serve as prey fields for the htl organisms which return an additional predation mortality in the plankton groups to circumvent the different spatial dimensions 3d vs 2d and units mmol n or c m 3 vs tons wet weight of the two models plankton concentrations were vertically integrated and converted into biomass using conversion factors table 1 only a small portion of plankton biomass is available to fish and macroinvertebrates due to various processes affecting their vertical distribution turbulence migrations etc availability of plankton to htl species is not easy to assess in the field and literature on this point is non existent therefore the availability parameters a p p for a given plankton group p were estimated table 2 via the calibration of the model see hereafter the two ways coupling mode meant that the htl model returns a specific mortality rate for each plankton group over space and time and these rates were computed from the amount of prey ingested as described in travers et al 2009 in each cell x y of osmose gol and for each plankton group p the htl induced mortality rate at time t δt was computed as the total biomass of plankton eaten be δt during the time step δt 15 days over the mean total plankton biomass b at time t multiplied by δt eq 1 as the maximum biomass of plankton p eaten by htl organisms at time t δt is the available biomass a p b x y t p at time t the htl induced mortality rate can thus vary between 0 and a p δ t because this variable mortality was added to the natural mortality m p already considered in the eco3m s model table 1 the latter rate was reduced to m p a p 2 δ t with a p 2 δ t being the median of the variable mortality due to htl species it was not set to zero in order to account for other sources of mortality such as predation by non modeled organisms senescence and starvation mortality outside the common domain between the eco3m s symphonie and osmose gol models fig 2 the plankton mortality rate was set to m p 1 m x y z t δ t p b e δ t x y p δ t b x y t p m p a p 2 δ t according to eq 1 the plankton total mortality rate thus ranges between m p a p 2 δ t and m p a p 2 δ t this rate can be either lower or higher than the initial mortality rate m p depending on the predation pressure induced by htl organisms 2 1 4 design of the numerical experiment a first spin up period of 35 years was launched in the one way forcing mode to reach equilibrium of the htl model outputs this step was achieved using the numerical fields of plankton biomass in 2001 following this period of spin up the model was then run in the one way forcing mode years 36 39 using the plankton biomass in 2001 and then in the two ways coupling mode for four years 40 43 for the last four years 40 43 the htl model received the numerical fields of ltl biomass for the years 2001 to 2004 these years was chosen because the ltl model has been previously validated over this period campbell et al 2013 the coupling simulation started on january 10 2001 00h00 and it ended on december 20 2004 00h00 years 36 39 one way forcing as well as the period of two ways coupling mode years 40 43 were considered for analysis hereafter furthermore a set of 50 replicated simulations was run to account for the stochasticity of the osmose model 2 2 parameterization of the htl model 2 2 1 modeled domain and selected htl groups in this study the osmose gol model grid consists of 19 by 15 cells with a resolution of 12 km by 12 km covering the gol area north of a line running from 42 04 3 18 to 43 05 5 37 fig 2 a set of 25 schools released per time step per species 600 per year per species was chosen for this model as a compromise between the stochasticity of the model and numerical limitations in memory and calculation speed as simulations with osmose necessitate extensive information on entire life cycles only 10 htl key species being the most representative of the pelagic and demersal food web were included in the configuration of osmose gol northern krill meganyctiphanes norvegica sars 1857 southern shortfin squid illex coindetii vérany 1837 and eight fish species from small pelagic fish to demersal fish european pilchard sardina pilchardus walbaum

hake atlantic bluefin tuna sih 2017 others for their importance as forage species such as northern krill european sprat and blue whiting bănaru et al 2013 all these species represent the most important ones in terms of structure and functioning of the food web in this area bănaru et al 2013 to parameterize the model various input information items were needed including 1 spatial distribution maps for different life stages and time steps appendix a these maps coded for presence vs absence for each species they have been obtained from geo referenced data of the pelmed and medits research surveys conducted since 1993 ifremer databases atlantic bluefin tuna is the sole highly migratory species with only a seasonal presence in the modeled area and not reproducing in the

and reproduction processes in the osmose model predation is assumed to be an opportunistic process and occurs when there is both size adequacy and spatio temporal co occurrence between predator and prey within a cell of the grid a predator can feed on a co occurring prey if 1 the prey is of a suitable size that is within a range determined by the minimum and maximum predator prey size ratios and 2 the vertical distribution of the prey makes it accessible to the predator which is determined by the accessibility coefficients provided to osmose gol therefore the food web or diet matrix builds up as an emergent property of local trophic interactions travers et al 2009 minimum and maximum predator prey size ratios table 3 were parameterized differently for different size classes for each taxon in order to account for ontogenetic changes in feeding behavior these size ratios were built from local data on diet predators and prey size labat and cuzin roudy 1996 båmstedt and karlson 1998 imbert et al 2007 le luherne 2012 bourgogne 2013 le bourg et al 2015 mellon duval et al 2017 the accessibility coefficients were set by default at 0 8 for htl groups for some species these coefficients were reduced to 0 6 in relation to their exclusive benthic location during early life stages northern krill 1 cm southern shortfin squid 2 cm and european hake 6 cm or to the very coastal area distribution patterns of individuals 5 cm and thus low accessibility to predation 0 6 for european pilchard and anchovy and 0 4 for european sprat labat and cuzin roudy 1996 mellon duval et al 2017 bănaru pers

bănaru et al 2013 however some of the considered species consume a non negligible part of benthic prey that was not considered in the osmose gol model in order to avoid artificially increasing predation on pelagic and demersal prey their mir were proportionally reduced by 35 for southern shortfin squid atlantic horse mackerel atlantic mackerel and european hake kaci 2012 le luherne 2012

number of fish per school when larger than the specified size of recruitment to fisheries legal size of catch s rec table 4 has been used as recruitment size in the osmose gol model initial estimates of annual fishing mortality rates have been estimated for each target species using the landings to biomass ratio obtained from stock assessments pelmed medits gcfm and from the fisheries database sih 2017 these mortality rates were subsequently refined through the calibration of the model see section 2 3 fishing mortalities are assumed to be spatially homogeneous but can vary seasonally as specified in input table 5 fishing seasonality was estimated using catch data by species sih 2017 in addition to explicit predation mortality modeled in osmose the mortality of the first life stages eggs and first feeding larvae m 0 table 2 is due to different natural causes e g non fertilisation of eggs starvation of first feeding larvae advection sinking as well as predation by organisms not considered in the osmose gol model additional sources of natural mortality concerning other life stages have also been accounted for m s table 2 including mortality due to disease senescence and predation by organisms not represented in the osmose gol model e g birds mammals etc since it is usually very hard to quantify these types of mortality they have been assessed through the calibration of the model for each of the ten htl species 2 3 calibration for the htl model the osmose gol model has been calibrated using an optimization technique based on an evolutionary algorithm and a maximum likelihood based objective function so that the modeled biomass and landings of the ten htl species remained within realistic observed ranges the data sources used for the biomass are from the pelmed and medits cruises performed every year in june and july from 2000 to 2013 and gfcm fao stock assessments for the gol jadaud pers commun bigot pers commun saraux pers commun vpa models for hake and tuna jadaud pers commun fromentin pers commun and sih 2017 for landings the calibration was performed with the calibrar package oliveros ramos et al 2015 oliveros ramos and shin 2016 https cran r project org package calibrar that has been specifically developed for calibrating complex ecological models and osmose2r http www osmose model org https cran r project org package osmose which includes a set of r functions for interfacing osmose with calibrar the calibration step aimed at providing estimates of the following parameters of the model i availability coefficients of plankton groups to htl species ii larval mortality rate for each species and iii fishing mortality rates for each species table 2 these parameters have been selected because they are highly model dependent i e their meaning depends on the model structure and assumptions and there are no reasonable initial estimates for plankton accessibility and larval mortality oliveros ramos et al 2015 the objective function minimized by the algorithm is built automatically by the r package by aggregating lognormal likelihood functions that quantify the fit between model outputs and field observations biomass and landings from year 2001 were given to the algorithm for every modeled species as the observed data and the osmose gol model was forced with the ltl biomass of the eco3m s symphonie model from the same year in this way a steady state calibration of the osmose gol model has been achieved for year 2001 that is the first year of the coupled simulation the calibration step enabled us to obtain a set of parameters so that biomass and landings of the considered htl species best range between the minima and maxima of the observed biomass in the gol this parameter set was then used in the coupled model 2 4 datasets for the evaluation of the e2e model 2 4 1 evaluating phytoplankton biomass of the ltl model using remote sensing satellite data ocean color data from the globcolour project www glocolour info were used in this study to evaluate the realism of the modeled surface chlorophyll a concentrations considered as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass the globcolour product takes advantage of gathering data sets derived from several ocean color sensors envisat modis meris and seawifs three sensors seawifs meris and modis showed a temporal overlap of functioning from april 2002 to december 2010 and it was possible to perform a quantitative comparison between satellite and modeled chlorophyll a values over most 990 days of the modeled period 1440 days the globcolour product provided a weighted mean c h l w and a weighted error ε c h l w the detailed computation of these parameters is given in the product user guide of globcolour available on the aforementioned web site in order to accurately compare the concentrations of the satellite derived chlorophyll a to those modeled the numerical concentrations of total chlorophyll sum of chlorophyll a concentrations of pico nano and microphytoplankton were averaged over the first optical layer sensu bricaud et al 2010 c h l o p t 1 the details of the computation are given in the recent study of campbell et al 2013 the model derived chlorophyll a values were re interpolated point by point at the size of each pixel 1 1 km of the satellite image on the modeled domain the period of assessment 990 days was characterized by more than a third 34 of cloudy days without useable pixels on the modeled area therefore the comparison was made on the remaining days corresponding to a total of 236 877 pixels a metric of model to data comparison c parameter was built and used hereafter this metric assessed the size of the discrepancies between the predicted and satellite values as follows c 0 if c h l o p t 1 c h l w ε c h l w

species obtained as output of the osmose gol model were compared with in situ field data obtained from stomach content analyses le bourg et al 2015 bănaru 2015 bănaru pers commun or literature data båmstedt and karlson 1998 sara and sara 2007 mellon duval et al 2017 for similar individual sizes estimated trophic levels tl from the osmose gol model were compared with tl values from the literature based on the stomach content båmstedt and karlson 1998 stergiou and karpouzi 2002 bănaru 2015 bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 and compared with those of a local ecopath model bănaru et al 2013 the aim of these comparisons was to check whether the parameterization and the processes of the model were able to reproduce trophic interactions close to those observed in field data 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibrated biomass and landings of the htl model against data the calibration of the model enabled us to estimate some parameters of the htl model such as the accessibility coefficients of the plankton and larval mortality of htl species and to refine the fishing mortality estimates the success of this calibration step lies in the ability of the model once run with this set of calibrated parameters to provide results remaining within realistic ranges for the biomass and landings of htl species the modeled median biomass fig 3 and landings fig 4 of the ten htl species and their corresponding envelopes delimiting 0 25 and 0 75 percentiles are presented for years 36 39 in the one way forcing configuration the modeled biomass and landings for years 40 43 resulting from the two ways coupling mode are presented and discussed in the companion paper diaz et al 2019 for the detailed comparison with one way forcing mode effects most of the modeled biomass of htl species showed seasonal patterns of change in median values within the ranges of the field observations fig 3 except for that of european hake which is slightly overestimated the biomass of certain species such as the european hake is known to be underestimated due mainly to the difficulty of catching large individuals during scientific surveys bigot pers commun the median simulated biomass of northern krill fig 3a showed a seasonal dynamic with the highest values occurring in winter and the lowest at the end of the spring the seasonal patterns of change of southern shortfin squid fig 3b showed median levels of biomass around 2 5 104 tons with maximum values at the end of summer and minimum values at the end of winter the stock of european pilchard fig 3c showed cyclical variations around 2 105 tons with maxima reached in spring and minima at the beginning of the winter the median biomass of european anchovy fig 3d showed cyclical seasonal variations centered on 106 tons and characterized by highest biomass from mid winter to the end of spring and the lowest during autumn the seasonal variation of the european sprat fig 3e biomass was very low the median levels were around 1 104 tons with a barely discernible peak at the end of summer the seasonal dynamics of atlantic horse mackerel fig 3f showed an increase in biomass at the end of autumn a very weak seasonal signal in the biomass of atlantic mackerel was simulated fig 3g with the highest biomass extending from winter to mid spring and a minimum occurring from mid summer to mid autumn the biomass of blue whiting fig 3h did not show any clear seasonal pattern and oscillated around 4 104 tons the temporal changes of european hake biomass fig 3i also showed a very weak seasonal signal with values around 1 4 104 tons by contrast the biomass of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 3j showed a marked seasonal cycle with a minimum of biomass during winter 5 103 to 5 5 103 tons followed by a sharp increase to reach a first seasonal maximum at the beginning of the spring 5 6 103 to 6 2 103 tons another biomass minimum occurred at the beginning of summer and then the annual peak around 7 103 tons is observed in autumn there were no seasonal biomass field data to use for comparison with model output as scientific surveys were only organized during summer on the whole for most of the htl species the whole or at least pro parte interannual dynamics of modeled median landings and the corresponding range of percentiles were within the ranges of observed data fig 4 however the median landings of southern shortfin squid fig 4b and of atlantic mackerel fig 4f were much higher than those observed by a factor of 16 800 tons and 2 5 500 tons with regard to observed landings respectively without any marked seasonal pattern a possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the underestimation of the landings of southern shortfin squid and atlantic mackerel in sih 2017 landings databases as for many other demersal and benthic species because fishermen often directly sell their fish at local markets crpmem paca 2016 landings of northern krill and european sprat fig 4a and e are not computed by the model as they are not landed by fishermen the simulated temporal dynamics of planktivorous fish such as european pilchard and european anchovy showed marked and steady seasonal cycles the median landings for european pilchard fig 4c were minimum 180 tons at the beginning of winter they rapidly increased during winter and reached a relative maximum 400 tons at the beginning of spring then they briefly fell below 400 tons and again increased up to their absolute maximum 750 tons at the beginning of summer they sharply decreased from the middle of summer to the end of the autumn down the absolute minimum maximum simulated values were higher than the maximum observed values during the first half of summer the simulated landings of european anchovy fig 4d also showed a minimum 100 tons at the beginning of winter but the catch then increased very rapidly up to a first peak of 180 tons and an absolute maximum 250 tons at the end of spring the summer season is marked by a sharp decrease in landings and a third peak of landings 200 220 tons in autumn the whole set of seasonal modeled values remained within the range of observed landings the seasonal changes in median landings for atlantic horse mackerel fig 4f were characterized by two maxima in spring and autumn the spring maximum comprised between 20 and 28 tons was generally higher than the autumn maximum 20 tons in parallel minima around 10 tons or lower were simulated during winter and summer only the maximum values of landings during spring and autumn fell within the range of observed landings the temporal patterns of change in simulated landings for blue whiting fig 4h showed a very marked seasonal trend median landings were close to zero from the beginning of summer to the end of autumn they sharply increased to reach 40 tons at the beginning of spring and then drastically dropped during spring the modeled landings were underestimated during the first half of the year the median landings of the european hake fig 4i remained around 100 tons from mid winter to the end of summer within the range of observed landings during this period of year they fell sharply during autumn to well below the lower limit of observed data with a minimum of 10 tons before increasing again at the beginning of winter modeled landings of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 4j were close to zero only over a short period of the year mainly from the end of autumn to the beginning of winter catches sharply increased up to 250 tons during spring before slightly declining to just below 200 tons at the beginning of summer summer was marked by an abrupt increase in the catches reaching 500 tons at the end of summer this seasonal cycle is characterized by simulated landings that were close to field data 3 2 comparing phytoplankton surface biomass of the ltl model with ocean color data the seasonal cycle of surface satellite derived chlorophyll a content averaged over the modeled area from april 2002 to december 2004 fig 5 is typical of those usually observed at oceanic mid latitudes e g siegel et al 2002 with average minima during summer months and maxima from winter to late spring the very low summer concentrations 10 1 mg m 3 or lower are considered as representative of the mediterranean sea bosc et al 2004 as expected the seasonal pattern found during the study period was close to the bloom trophic regime according to the classification of d ortenzio and ribera d alcalà 2009 for the mediterranean sea an interannual variability of the seasonal cycle could be detected with the year 2003 being characterized by a longer summer period of low chlorophyll a than 2002 and 2004 the year 2003 did not show any clear autumnal bloom while it was particularly marked in mid september 2002 and september and november 2004 the inter annual variability in the phytoplankton surface content in this area of the mediterranean sea is a common feature that has been already observed in some other remote sensing time series bosc et al 2004 auger et al 2014 and in situ data e g marty and chiavérini 2010 gernez et al 2011 beyond the seasonal dynamics the time series highlights the variability of mean values at very high frequency i e day to day whatever the season considered most of the time large error bars also suggest a strong spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton content in the nw mediterranean sea this variability at high frequency and the strong spatial heterogeneity are mainly due to the multiple physical forcing occurring in this marine area such as changing wind gusts that drive intricate sub mesoscale hydrodynamic processes e g eddies see hu et al 2011a b and upwellings millot 1999 river inputs discharging large amounts of nutrients throughout the year e g minas and minas 1989 and the large scale circulation of the northern current sometimes intruding on the shelf petrenko 2003 all the aforementioned physical processes interact together at different spatial and temporal scales and play a key role in setting ocean dynamics heat transport and biogeochemical budgets through intense upwelling of nutrients subduction of plankton and horizontal stirring see review of lévy 2008 the ltl model was able to reproduce the seasonal signal and the inter annual variability of phytoplankton surface concentrations the model also captured the daily variability however the modeled concentrations were most of the time underestimated compared to the satellite derived means concentrations especially during late spring and summer it is crucial to keep in mind that ocean color data in the mediterranean sea have to be considered with caution because the algorithms used to derive the chlorophyll a concentrations perform poorly in this regional sea gregg and casey 2004 volpe et al 2007 and references therein these low performances are generally attributed to the particular composition i e inorganic and organic matter of the water column causing an overestimation of chlorophyll a surface concentrations for low values especially of chlorophyll i e during summer and in oligotrophic waters this bias between in situ data and values derived from algorithms would be furthermore accentuated in the area of the rhone freshwater influence according to the study of ouillon and petrenko 2005 the c parameter assessing error between model output and data see section 2 4 2 was null during ca 23 of the comparison period this result means that the modeled chlorophyll value remained within the range of the error bars given by the globcolour algorithm during a quarter of the simulation period furthermore fig 6 shows the temporal changes in the globcolour errors on chlorophyll a concentrations and of the c parameter the globcolour errors and the c parameter were the lowest 1 25 10 1 mg m 3 during summer especially in 2003 and 2004 when they were the most variable and highest from autumn to mid spring the c parameter was lower than the satellite sensor errors during ca 71 of the comparison period which is a rather satisfactory result 3 3 comparing modeled and observed diet of the htl species fig 7 shows the modeled diet of every size class of the ten htl species in order to describe the diets emerging from the osmose gol model prey groups were classified into three categories according to their proportion in biomass in the predator s diet main prey 50 secondary prey from 10 to 50 accessory prey up to 10 according to the model the main prey of the northern krill is microphytoplankton 56 while the secondary prey is microzooplankton 35 mesozooplankton remains an accessory prey 8 this modeled diet composed of phyto and zooplankton in almost equal parts is consistent with the observations of båmstedt and karlson 1998 on krill of the northeast atlantic according to this field study northern krill may not survive on a diet only based on phytoplankton and needs to consume at least 40 of zooplankton the modeled southern shortfin squid mainly feeds on small teleosts 77 such as planktivorous european pilchard 36 and european anchovy 21 but also on juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel 9 and blue whiting 8 small squid i e cannibalism 11 are secondary prey while northern krill 8 and mesozooplankton 4 are accessory prey of southern shortfin squid this modeled diet is consistent with some in situ datasets bănaru 2015 showing a diet mainly composed by 80 of teleosts in the latter field study southern shortfin squid prey on certain other groups such as benthic decapods but these groups were not represented in the osmose gol model according to the model outputs european pilchard larvae 3 cm mainly feed on mesozooplankton 81 this trophic behavior for larvae are close to the results of borme et al 2009 in the mediterranean sea showing a diet almost exclusively 99 composed of copepods in the size range of mesozooplankton larger individuals significantly change their diet feeding on smaller prey with microzooplankton 51 of the diet of juveniles ranging between 3 and 12 5 cm and 52 for adults 12 5 cm as main prey and microphytoplankton as secondary prey 44 of the diet of juveniles and 43 for adults the latter results are not in line with some recent dietary field studies based on the analysis of stomach content in the gulf of lions according to the study of le bourg et al 2015 juveniles of european pilchard as well as adults may prey quasi exhaustively on mesozooplankton 98 and 100 respectively however this mismatch between model outputs and observations has to be moderated because the study of bode et al 2004 showed that the size of the prey generally decreases with increasing body length of european pilchard hence adults may consume a larger part of phytoplankton according to the latter study as phytoplankton prey are actually more easily digested they are therefore more difficult to identify in stomach contents which may explain the differences between the model and observations for this fish species moreover the study of pethybridge et al 2014 using analysis of fatty acids in adults of european pilchard confirms the assumption that its diet is mainly based on microplankton the modeled european anchovy including its larvae stage has a diet similar to those of the juveniles and adults of european pilchard all stages mainly feed on microzooplankton 55 of the diet for larvae 3 cm 49 for juveniles ranging between 3 and 12 5 cm and 44 for adults 12 5 cm their secondary prey is the microphytoplankton group 39 for larvae 40 for juveniles and 36 for adults mesozooplankton is only an accessory prey representing about 5 of the diet for larvae and juveniles and around 7 for adults the simulated diet of the larvae is close to observed data analyzing fatty acids content rossi et al 2006 showed that microzooplankton and microphytoplankton are the prey most consumed by anchovy larvae however the modeled diet for adult anchovy is rather different from those resulting from the analysis of stomach content borme et al 2009 le bourg et al 2015 in the observations as for the european pilchard the proportions of microzooplankton and microphytoplankton may be underestimated due to a rapid digestion of these types of prey the modeled diet of european sprat juveniles is similar to those of juveniles and adults of the european pilchard and of all size classes of the european anchovy the diet of the juveniles is composed of microzooplankton 48 of the diet and microphytoplankton 34 the proportion of consumed mesoozooplankton 14 is higher than in the diet of the juveniles of the european sardine and anchovy but is much lower than that observed in their stomach content 100 according to the study of le bourg et al 2015 the modeled diet of european sprat larvae 3 cm is mainly composed of mesozooplankton 81 which is consistent with previous observations dickmann 2005 mesozooplankton is furthermore the main prey for adults but in much higher proportions 68 than for the adults of european pilchard and anchovy 4 5 and 7 respectively adults also consume as secondary prey some european pilchard larvae 16 in the model the european sprat including larvae and adults thus appears to be more carnivorous than the european sardine and anchovy this modeled output is in line with the dataset of pethybridge et al 2014 based on the comparative analysis of the fatty acids content of these three pelagic species in the model pilchard eggs and larvae are another significant prey 16 for the adults of european sprat as also observed in their stomach content le bourg et al 2015 the diet of the juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel predicted by the model is composed of a dominant proportion of mesozooplankton 62 and a lesser proportion of fish larvae 25 while the study of le luherne 2012 based on the analysis of stomach content showed a dominant consumption of northern krill 71 in proportion and a lesser proportion 21 of benthic decapods not modeled these differences may result from opportunistic predation behavior making the diets highly variable between the sampling stations inside the gol domain as well as from some differences between the spatial domain of the model entire gol and the specific locations of the sampling stations used in the study of le luherne 2012 adults of atlantic horse mackerel 16 cm have a modeled diet which is quite different from that of juveniles they mainly feed on southern shortfin squid 37 and northern krill 28 some other prey such as juveniles of european sprat and hake and atlantic mackerel supplement their diet 17 the cumulated percentage of consumed fish is rather high 34 the modeled proportion of northern krill consumed is close to that resulting from the analysis of in situ stomach content 21 le luherne 2012 by contrast the latter empirical study did not show the presence of southern shortfin squid in the stomach of analyzed individuals differences between model outputs and observations may again result from differences in diet when estimated from the entire modeled domain rather than from some particular locations as in the study of le luherne 2012 differences in the diet of predators may also result from inter annual variations in the spatial distribution and density of prey furthermore a major bias in the modeling of the diet of atlantic horse mackerel adults is that a dominant proportion of consumed prey 54 of macrozooplankton in the form of pteropods and 21 of decapods le luherne 2012 is not represented as potential prey in the model in the model the juveniles of atlantic mackerel 20 cm mainly consume certain planktivorous fish a result which is consistent with observations le luherne 2012 however the modeled diet appears to be dominated by european pilchard 38 and european anchovy 22 while the analysis of stomach content data rather shows a high consumption of sprats 37 and to a lesser extent anchovies 16 accessory prey are diverse i e mesozooplankton northern krill southern shortfin squid atlantic horse mackerel blue whiting other prey each of them accounting for 6 7 of the modeled diet the differences in the consumed fish species between the model and observations may be attributable to differences in species composition between the modeled period 2001 2004 and the field studies that were carried out in 2011 2012 le luherne 2012 since 2008 the biomass of european pilchard has strongly declined in the gulf of lions while that of sprat has increased van beveren et al 2014 macrozooplankton and groups of benthic species that are not represented in the model account for significant proportions of the stomach content 27 19 respectively le luherne 2012 the model succeeded in predicting the functional group consumed i e planktivorous fish for the juveniles of atlantic mackerel adults of atlantic mackerel 20 cm are even more piscivorous than juveniles since their modeled diet is almost 90 composed of fish the most consumed fish are firstly european pilchard 46 and secondarily european anchovy 26 in the model comparatively the proportion of consumed teleosts observed in stomach content amounts to almost 90 in the study of le luherne 2012 but the teleost species could not be identified due to too advanced digestion of prey juveniles of blue whiting 15 cm have a rather diversified diet in the model they feed on certain plankton groups mesozooplankton at 19 and northern krill at 25 on southern shortfin squid 10 and on different species of fish 46 the most consumed fish species are european pilchard 27 atlantic horse mackerel 10 and blue whiting 6 this result is different from those obtained in the study of bourgogne 2013 who observed only decapods not represented in the model in the stomach content of analyzed juveniles in the model adults of blue whiting 15 cm mainly feed on fish 65 secondarily on northern krill 26 and southern shortfin squid 10 the most preyed species of fish are european pilchard 32 atlantic horse mackerel 11 blue whiting 12 and european anchovy 8 the study of bourgogne 2013 showed a proportion of northern krill 33 close to that provided by the model the main difference between model and observations is in the dominant prey the proportion of teleosts consumed amounts to 65 in the model while stomach content data show a lower proportion 35 bourgogne 2013 in parallel benthic decapods not modeled have been found in a significant proportion 32 in the stomach content of analyzed adults which may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet of adults and field data in the model the main prey of the european hake juveniles are teleosts 90 among these teleosts the most consumed species are firstly the european pilchard 42 secondly the european anchovy 24 and thirdly the blue whiting 13 in parallel a recent study of stomach content from the same area mellon duval et al 2017 revealed in situ diet mainly composed of teleosts 80 and to 100 in more detail the european pilchard was observed in the highest proportion 22 74 but the european anchovy and the blue whiting were also detected in lesser proportions 6 30 and 1 3 respectively the model results also match the observations of two other recent studies estimating at 92 the proportion of teleosts in the diet of juveniles merquiol 2016 bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 in the model adults as juveniles feed mostly on teleosts 93 the teleost prey are firstly european pilchard in a proportion of 43 and secondly blue whiting at 13 other fish species such as european sprat atlantic mackerel and european hake supplement their diet up to 16 mellon duval et al 2017 found from the analysis of stomach content a roughly similar proportion of european pilchard 38 and slightly higher proportion of blue whiting 26 30 the modeled diet of atlantic bluefin tuna is almost exclusively piscivorous 93 and composed of small teleosts european pilchard is the main prey 51 while european anchovy 23 and blue whiting 10 are the secondary prey southern shortfin squid is only an accessory prey 7 this preference for planktivorous teleosts mainly european anchovy has already been shown from the analysis of the stomach content of individuals caught in the gulf of lions imbert et al 2007 once again the minor mismatches observed between the modeled diet and that from the field data may result from a dataset based on sampling carried out outside the temporal window of the simulation period this fast swimming pelagic tuna species has been shown to have a high variability in its distribution at different spatial and temporal scales in the gol royer et al 2004 3 4 comparing tl in the e2e modeled food web with literature data the e2e modeled food web fig 8 is composed of 15 compartments organized into four trophic levels tl this food web length is rather common in natural ecosystems hastings and conrad 1979 five plankton groups represent the lowest tl 1 2 while ten invertebrates and teleost groups represent the highest tl 3 the highest flows of predation occur between the phyto and zooplankton groups 106 tons year 1 and sharply decrease with increasing tl which is a common feature observed in trophic pyramids odum 1959 primary producers such as nano and microphytoplankton representing the first tl are mainly consumed by nano tl 2 0 micro tl 2 0 and mesozooplankton tl 2 2 among these groups mesozooplankton has the highest tl as it consumes both phyto and zooplankton planktivorous species such as northern krill tl 2 5 european pilchard tl 2 7 european anchovy tl 2 8 and european sprat tl 2 9 mainly feed on micro and mesozooplankton the european pilchard has a more omnivorous diet with a consumption of microphytoplankton of the same order of magnitude as that of microzooplankton or even higher than that of mesozooplankton for these planktivorous species tl increases from the northern krill to the european sprat in agreement with literature data båmstedt and karlson 1998 stergiou and karpouzi 2002 le bourg et al 2015 among the meso predators the atlantic horse mackerel has the lowest tl tl 3 5 followed by those of atlantic mackerel tl 3 9 southern shortfin squid tl 4 0 blue whiting tl 4 0 atlantic bluefin tuna tl 4 0 and european hake tl 4 1 these tls are close to field data stergiou and karpouzi 2002 sara and sara 2007 bănaru 2015 bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 mellon duval et al 2017 some larvae of these teleosts are consumed by cannibalism and also by other species of similar lower and higher tl on the whole the modeled tls are in agreement with literature data and ecopath gol outputs for most of the 10 htl species fig 9 some interesting points can however be highlighted the modeled tls of southern shortfin squid are slightly higher than those in the literature bănaru and harmelin vivien 2017 and from ecopath outputs bănaru et al 2013 the predator prey size ratios of the present model may be better adjusted in order to obtain a modeled tl for southern shortfin squid closer to field and literature data the modeled tls of juveniles and adults of european pilchard are close to the minimum values estimated from the analysis of the stomach content stergiou and karpouzi 2002 or using δ 15n stable isotope ratios bănaru 2015 while the corresponding larvae show their numerical tls close to the observed highest values in this case too the predator prey size ratios of the model may be better adjusted the tls of all species except pilchard and to a lesser extent blue whiting increase with increasing size of individuals in order to better account for ontogenetic changes in tl chassot et al 2008 reed et al 2017 it would be useful in the future to better refine field estimation of trophic levels by size it is interesting and encouraging to note that the tls computed from two very different approaches of e2e modeling i e osmose vs ecopath are very close for most of htl species except for european pilchard and blue whiting even if the represented periods in these models partly overlap 2001 2004 for osmose and 2000 2009 for ecopath and the modeled area is the same major differences in conception between these two models opportunistic size based diet in osmose and fixed diet in ecopath may explain these small differences in trophic level results osmose is an individual size based spatial and dynamic model while ecopath is a mass balanced model with no size groups non spatialized and offering a static snapshot of the system moreover ecopath includes more groups and species benthic groups marine mammals birds and others which are not represented in osmose data gaps concerning the diet of some species were highlighted by bănaru et al 2013 and new recent diet data were included in the osmose model parametrization 4 conclusion the gol is a highly exploited area for fisheries demaneche et al 2009 bănaru et al 2013 here as in other parts of the world fishing has reduced the biomass of top predators aldebert 1997 piroddi et al 2017 with potential cascading effects

auber et al 2015 the end to end modeling approach aims at understanding and anticipating some of these processes this paper presents the first spatialized dynamic coupled end to end ecosystem model for the gol the modeled groups and species represent more than 70 of annual catches in this area and they encompass the pelagic and demersal ecosystem trophic structure organized into four trophic levels the assessment of both ltl and htl groups and species of the e2e osmose gol model showed a satisfactory agreement with literature satellite and field local data in terms of biomass landings and diet the model has been parametrized with the best available local data following the calibration stage realistic ranges for the biomass and landings have been obtained for most species and groups biomass for the european hake and landings for the atlantic mackerel are however slightly overestimated at first sight it might be considered that these differences are acceptable owing to uncertainties existing in biomass estimations and landings data however some improvements of the model are obviously still possible predator prey size ratios may be refined to produce a better correspondence between model and field data sex ratio established by default at 0 5 may be refined with field data when available the distribution maps currently based on presence absence may be

25068,energy is a critical driver of animal life history traits and darwinian fitness with direct implications for population dynamics in the arctic extreme seasonal climatic conditions dictate energy flow and physiology of resident species consequently vital rates of animal populations in the arctic are tightly linked to climatic factors influencing food availability and quality the muskox ovibos moschatus is a capital breeder and the largest herbivore in the arctic seasonal changes in energy intake influence body reserve dynamics of this species impacting inter annual and spatial variations in survival and recruitment yet little is known about the full lifecycle bioenergetics of this and other arctic species and the impact of extreme seasonal conditions on life history traits have never been quantified by integrating energetic and physiological processes throughout the full lifecycle of individuals we developed an individual based model using dynamic energy budget theory deb ibm of the muskox that covers all aspects of mammalian life history we parameterized a baseline muskox model using data from a well studied captive research herd and then explored its application to a wild population in the high arctic to assess the life history implications of seasonal food availability our baseline deb ibm which for the first time explicitly characterized fetal development using deb theory successfully predicted life history traits as well as patterns of growth body condition feeding metabolic rates and reproduction of captive muskoxen adaptation of the model to the wild population required re parameterization of only three variables that controlled seasonal food availability and upregulated assimilation the wild model successfully captured inter annual costs of reproduction such that lactating females were in poorer body condition than females without calves arctic seasonal food limitations reduced fecundity in wild muskoxen by 42 compared to annual reproduction in well fed captive individuals we have developed a mechanistic energy based framework to study life history processes of muskoxen but the model is broadly applicable also for other mammals in the arctic our study quantifies and highlights the strong interplay between energetics and individual fitness components opening the door to future applications of the model in assessments of population dynamics and climate change impacts keywords arctic mammals dynamic energy budget life history muskox physiological ecology seasonal environment 1 introduction energy acquisition and its allocation to physiological processes are critical determinants of animal fitness through their influence on growth and reproduction sousa et al 2010 food availability and uptake dictate the energy available for organisms to allocate to various functions often leading to trade offs between costly fitness components sheldon and verhulst 1996 the energy budget of an animal is thus key to understanding most aspects of individual life history which is tightly linked with population dynamics energy therefore can be considered as a critical driver of fitness across biological scales de roos et al 2009 klanjscek et al 2006 accordingly energy based modelling approaches are increasingly being used in ecology to understand species environment interactions boult et al 2018 galic et al 2017 nisbet et al 2000 though few studies focus on the arctic or on large vertebrates e g de roos et al 2009 klanjscek et al 2007 molnár et al 2010 arctic ecosystems undergo some of the most extreme seasonal fluctuations in climatic and environmental conditions in the world arctic species have developed distinct physiological and behavioral adaptations to the short summer growing seasons and harsh long winters blix 2005 nonetheless arctic populations are vulnerable to inter annual cycles of climatic variation as vital rates are tightly linked to winter and summer conditions forchhammer and boertmann 1993 schmidt et al 2015 and extreme climatic events hansen et al 2013 indeed climatic conditions can influence physical and biological components of the environment which can impact energy acquisition individual fitness and ultimately population abundance and distribution of arctic wildlife burek et al 2008 our ability to predict population dynamics of arctic species is challenged by rapid climate change which is putting northern ecosystems under new and severe pressure legagneux et al 2014 post et al 2009 furthermore details on seasonal physiology activity and behavior are often lacking in species living in remote regions such as the arctic large bodied herbivores including muskoxen ovibos moschatus and reindeer rangifer tarandus roaming the circumpolar arctic play important roles in the structuring and functioning of the tundra ecosystem falk et al 2015 mosbacher et al 2018 as year round residents in the arctic these species experience marked seasonal and inter annual variation in the availability and quality of their food base mosbacher et al 2016 with important consequences for survival and reproduction schmidt et al 2015 sustained conservation of large arctic mammals and better predictions of climate change impacts require a deeper understanding of species physiology and ecology particularly the metabolic processes governing important functional life history traits and population performance an understanding of reproductive costs is fundamental in life history theory the energetic costs of raising offspring varies depending on the type and stage of parental investment social dominance size and sex of the offspring clutton brock et al 1981 descamps et al 2009 unlike income breeders that concurrently feed during reproduction capital breeders like the muskox rely on stored energy reserves to cover reproductive costs the acquired energy over the short and productive arctic summer fall is therefore critical for the survival as well as gestation and lactation of offspring throughout food limited winter spring adamczewski et al 1997a white et al 1997 despite the importance of energy as a driver of darwinian fitness we have poor quantification of parental investment and other physiological processes in large free ranging mammals particularly for species adopting capital breeding strategies in extreme seasonal environments modelling approaches that can integrate energetics physiology and species specific ecology are invaluable tools for wildlife research and conservation an approach grounded on first principles e g mass energy conservation laws thoroughly documented and tested across a broad range of species is dynamic energy budget deb theory deb theory provides a generalized individual and process based framework that follows the acquisition and use of energy throughout the full lifetime of the animal kooijman 2010 deb models describe the physiological processes of feeding growth maintenance maturation and reproduction and are particularly useful in ecological applications because of the inherent mechanistic relationship between these metabolic processes and external forcing variables such as food availability or ambient temperature deb theory thus provides an ideal framework to integrate energetics physiology and environmental factors in predictive and process based models at the individual level when combined with individual based models ibm this framework can be used to predict population dynamics de roos et al 2009 goedegebuure et al 2018 here we develop an individual based model using deb theory to assess the full lifecycle energetics including reproduction costs and consequent life history traits of the largest herbivore species inhabiting the seasonally extreme arctic environment we first develop and parameterize a baseline deb model for female muskoxen using long term empirical time series data on muskox growth feeding and reproduction from a well fed captive research herd this includes for the first time a full deb theory based model for the developing fetus the model is then adapted and applied to a free ranging population of muskox in the high arctic to investigate the impacts of seasonal food availability on physiological ecology and functional traits across all life stages 2 material and methods 2 1 baseline model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for individual based models grimm et al 2006 here we provide a summary of the model description but the complete odd is available in the supplementary material appendix a we develop an energy budget model for female muskoxen fig 1 following the principals of deb theory kooijman 2010 muskoxen in this model have four life stages fetus nursling juvenile and adult individuals are characterized by the four primary state variables used in deb theory structure l o r v reserves e maturity e h and reproduction buffer e r reserves structure and the reproduction buffer contribute to body mass while maturity does not reserves is also reported as a ratio to structure r e s e r v e d e n s i t y e e v and scaled to a species specific maximum value scaled reserve density s c a l e d r e s e r v e d e n s i t y e e e m maturity is measured by the amount of dissipated energy e g heat and metabolites that has been used for maturation and represents the costs of increasing biological complexity and is therefore used to track maturation and trigger life stage transitions the model includes ageing via two additional state variables damage inducing compounds q and damage h which act together to increase the probability of mortality throughout the lifetime of the individual see section 2 2 6 for additional details model parameters are defined in table 1 and energy flux and state variable dynamics are provided in tables 2 and 3 structure represents the portion of body mass which requires maintenance and is tracked as a length or volume v l 3 the structural length is proportional to the observed physical length of the animal using the shape coefficient δ m the link between food availability and ingestion rate is through a scaled functional response f that follows a holling type ii relationship f x x k x where x is food density and x k the half saturation constant the scaled functional response is a condensed proxy for forage acquisition e g food availability searching handling etc and takes values between 0 starvation and 1 maximum feeding kooijman 2010 marn et al 2017 we use the term forage acquisition interchangeably with the scaled functional response throughout the text energy extracted from food is stored in reserves via assimilation p a the flow of energy out of the reserves the mobilization flux p c is used to fuel all other metabolic processes of the organism a fraction κ of the mobilization flux is first allocated to the somatic maintenance needs of the organism p s then growth of structural biomass p g the remaining 1 κ fraction is used first to pay maturity maintenance p j and then any remaining fraction of the mobilization flux is dedicated to maturation or reproduction p r depending on the life stage of the individual individuals are characterized by maturity thresholds for birth e h b weaning e h x and puberty e h p by which the cumulative energy in maturation e h dictates lifestage transitions once they become adults individuals divert the energy previously allocated to maturation into a reproduction buffer e r which fuels the costs of gestation and lactation 2 2 sub model specifications a number of sub models were developed and incorporated to describe the specific life history features of the muskox as well as deviations from standard allocation rules of deb theory to better reflect the seasonal and capital breeding strategy of a mammal living in harsh seasonal environments full description of these are provided in the odd appendix a here we provide a brief overview of the major processes 2 2 1 reproduction the rutting period for muskoxen begins in late summer thus our model implements a strict breeding season from julian day 252 282 aug sept females enter estrus if they pass a minimum breeding condition threshold based on their reproduction buffer density the value of which was based on observations of fat content and pregnancy probabilities in muskoxen adamczewski et al 1998 white et al 1997 2 2 2 fetal development calculations for fetal structural growth are based on kooijman 2010 but all other aspects of the fetal energy budget were further developed to fully characterize a deb theory based model for mammalian fetal development for the first time fig 1 table 3 a condensed fetus model was characterized for the right whale using only growth somatic maintenance and reserve accumulation klanjscek et al 2007 but we build on this to include reserve mobilization dynamics κ and energy allocation to maturity maintenance and maturation fetal development commences after an initial arrest period t 0 of 85 days determined during initial deb parameter estimation the fetus energy budget is demand driven governed by growth needs d d t l f and p g f in the κ branch of the energy budget energy fluxes to the 1 κ branch as well as all other upstream fluxes fig 1 are back calculated from the somatic maintenance and growth costs of the fetus unlike the standard deb model energy for metabolic processes in our model can come from two branches either reserve mobilization same as adults or a parallel demand flux p m f coming directly from the mother when fetal reserve mobilization is insufficient fetal reserve flux p e f and the scaled reserve density of the fetus e f are proportional to the reserve density of the mother table 3 the total daily costs of gestation g c o s t are subtracted from the reproduction buffer of the mother if insufficient buffer is available at any time during gestation the mother miscarries and pregnancy is terminated 2 2 3 lactation and calf development muskox calves rely entirely on milk during the first weeks or months after birth until the snow melts and the plant growing season begins parker et al 1990 following an initial phase 30 days of 100 milk calves gradually reduce the proportion of milk κ m i l k intake while consuming more forage over time table 3 the assimilation flux in nurslings is therefore the sum of milk p a m i l k and forage p a f o r a g e intake to account for the greater quality of milk compared to forage e g protein fat energy content parker et al 1990 we added a milk specific scaled functional response f m i l k to the milk assimilation flux to increase energy intake table 1 the total daily costs of lactation p l after accounting for overhead costs of producing milk κ r l and the digestion efficiency of the calf κ l are subtracted from the reproduction buffer of the mother if these costs are greater than the current energy in the reproduction buffer they are instead taken from the mother s reserves the full milk derived energy demands of the nursling p a m i l k continue to draw from the reserves of the mother until the maternal reserve density falls below e 0 8 after which maternal energy transfer stops and the nursling is forced to rely solely on forage p a f o r a g e 2 2 4 upregulated assimilation to cover the additional energetic needs of reproduction females typically increase their food intake kooijman 2010 unlike standard deb models we allowed upregulated assimilation throughout the full year rather than only during gestation and moreover implement seasonal changes associated with arctic forage dynamics upregulated assimilation p a was thus implemented continuously after individuals reach puberty via a scaled upregulation response factor s r applied to the assimilation flux this flux enters directly into the reproduction buffer in order to prevent additional structural growth in individuals as food intake increases monthly values of the upregulation factor were derived from captive feeding studies adamczewski et al 1994 and re calibrated in the deb ibm during model testing to fit the observed data on body weights and fecundity lastly another scaled response factor is introduced s e r to regulate the size of the reproduction buffer so that it does not increase indefinitely in cases where it is not depleted from year to year s e r ranges from 0 to 1 and is a function of minimum and maximum buffer density thresholds e r m i n e r m a x the effect is that upregulation continues unhindered while e r e r m i n and tends towards zero as e r approaches e r m a x 2 2 5 starvation we adopted the standard starvation rules from kooijman 2010 with some muskox specific modifications starvation occurs when the fraction of mobilized reserves going to somatic maintenance is insufficient to cover the costs thereof e g κ p c p s somatic maintenance takes priority over all other metabolic processes when this occurs the deviation in allocation rules is as follows first allocation to growth ceases p g 0 and somatic maintenance needs are paid by diverting energy from maturation for juveniles or the reproduction buffer for adults next if maturation or the reproduction buffer becomes unable to cover somatic maintenance the missing energy is diverted directly from the reserves this process continues until the individual is no longer starving or if the scaled reserve density falls below the death threshold e 0 4 which was determined through model testing to match observations of body weight of muskoxen in greenland that died of starvation n m schmidt personal observation 2 2 6 ageing the ageing process is tightly linked to individual energetics and can be related to cumulative stress and damage to structural tissue over the lifetime by free radicals and other reactive oxygen species kooijman 2010 ageing applies to all individuals from the day they are born and is implemented as damage to structure which accumulates over time and increases the probability of mortality through calculation of a hazard rate h sensu martin et al 2012 2 3 parameter estimation and model evaluation the software package debtool https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab debtool debtool m manual was used to estimate the parameters of the baseline deb model for captive muskoxen using the covariation method described in marques et al 2018 parameter estimation in debtool is done by minimizing the weighted sum of squared differences between observed data and estimates through regression doing so simultaneously for all parameters we further developed the deb model and implemented it within an ibm framework in the open source agent based modelling program netlogo version 6 0 2 august 4 2017 this combined deb ibm framework allowed us to follow energy budgets of individual females and their offspring throughout their full lifetime analysis of grouped individuals can provide population estimates of functional life history traits and overall population abundance over time martin et al 2012 many parameters were introduced in the deb ibm to specify time and species specific processes for the muskox that are not part of standard deb theory and debtool parameter values were determined from the literature where possible and if no prior information was available they were determined through pattern oriented modelling using parameter sweeping to assess a range of possible parameter values wiegand et al 2003 final parameter values were chosen so as to minimize the relative error between observed data averages and model predictions for the endpoints of interest e g table 4 see specific sub sections for details in each parameter we parameterized the baseline deb model for a captive research herd of muskoxen held at the large animal research station run by the university of alaska fairbanks average static life history trait data e g zero variate data for these muskoxen are displayed in table 4 and include age and weights at important points in the muskox lifecycle e g birth weaning puberty and adult as well as the maximum reproduction rate while we focus on weight as our measure of body size in this study because of data limitations we also included physical length at birth and adult maturity for model fitting in order to ensure the model also accurately predicted structural length time series data e g univariate data from lars was also available including lifetime growth curves for total body weight white et al 1989 desforges et al 2019 fetal growth curves pharr et al 1994 rombach et al 2003 milk production and intake rates parker et al 1990 white et al 1989 and feeding rates adamczewski et al 1994 barboza et al 2006 munn and barboza 2008 peltier et al 2003 life history and growth data were derived from 24 animals of different age followed between 2004 and 2018 desforges et al 2019 we use mean relative error and coefficients of determination r2 as estimates of goodness of fit of model predictions to observed data population average for life history traits and time series endpoints respectively goodness of fit was further assessed using linear regression analysis of observed vs predicted time series data with significant relationships determined when p values 0 05 2 4 sensitivity analyses we conducted a local sensitivity analysis single parameter variations to explore how the model responded to changes in the parameter set this process is useful to determine which parameters are most influential on model outputs and results can guide future research focus the deb ibm model outputs we followed were age and weight at birth weaning and puberty ultimate asymptotic body weight and the population abundance after a 10 year model run period parameter values were varied by 5 10 and 20 in both directions compared to their default value for parameters with a fixed upper limit such as κ and conversion efficiencies the 5 10 and 20 increases were not applied blindly with no regard for the upper limit the symmetry of the lower limit 0 and the upper limit was used so that the resulting values could make theoretical sense so for the case of κ with an upper limit of 1 the increases were performed as decreases of 5 10 and 20 on 1 κ and then calculated to give the new parameter value the outputs of each simulation were averaged across individuals and compared to the baseline output using a sensitivity index si as in pethybridge et al 2013 representing the relative error between baseline values and the new values for each output 2 5 model testing and scenario based simulations the sensitivity to forage acquisition on individual growth and life history traits was evaluated through scenario based simulations the baseline muskox model was used in the first two scenarios to investigate 1 the influence of the scaled functional response f over the lifetime of individuals and 2 starvation survival time in the former we reduce f incrementally in each simulation from 1 00 to 0 79 to represent environments with different constant food availability starvation simulations were run for different ages by following the time it would take to deplete reserves and die of starvation assuming only maintenance is paid with death occurring at the reserve density threshold previously determined we also investigated the influence of body condition on time to starvation by investigating reserve depletion times in mature adult females at maximum structural length with decreasing amounts of initial reserve densities 2 6 model development for wild muskoxen once the baseline muskox deb ibm model was calibrated and evaluated against available captive data the final parameter set of the model was tested against empirical data collected from a wild muskox population in the high arctic victoria island canada here single data points for body weight body composition body condition fat content and thickness and reproductive rates were measured in 289 hunted females between 1985 and 1991 adamczewski et al 1992 1994 1995 1997 1998 desforges et al 2019 hunted animals likely represent the healthiest animals in the population but we do not consider this an important bias as we wanted to capture the average pattern of the normal population our model is not intended to capture sickness or other abnormal processes we assumed the wild population differed from the captive herd mainly in terms of seasonal foraging success thus we focused the re parameterization process to the scaled functional response parameter f as it condenses several aspects of foraging effort and food availability into one general term kooijman 2010 marn et al 2017 using monthly mean body weights of adult female muskoxen as inputs we applied a dynamic reconstruction approach in debtool software to reverse model the expected functional response stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 since debtool used a simplified version of our deb model the resulting seasonally predicted f values were considered only as meaningful starting points and required further calibration to fit the more complex deb ibm re calibration was done in netlogo via pattern oriented analysis to match emergent body weights and fecundity in the model output with observed seasonal field data further model modifications were necessary to capture the seasonal growth dynamics of wild muskoxen and these were focused on the dynamics and values of upregulation including monthly values of the upregulated fraction of assimilation minimum and maximum reproduction buffer density thresholds for upregulation and how upregulated assimilation is used for the latter we updated the dynamics so that a fraction 1 e of upregulation is diverted to reserves while the remaining fraction e enters the reproduction buffer as before thus allowing intense summer foraging to replenish depleted winter reserves as well as fuel reproductive costs see appendix a for further details of these changes we employed scenario based simulations in the wild muskox deb ibm to further investigate the impact of changes in seasonal forage acquisition on muskox growth and reproduction we used the parameterized wild muskox model victoria island as a starting point and ran simulations that applied factor changes 2 5 5 10 and 20 evenly to all values of f throughout the year thus generating greater or lesser magnitude changes in the seasonality of forage acquisition 3 results 3 1 growth and life history traits the baseline muskox deb ibm based on captive muskox data accurately reproduced important life history traits as well as growth and developmental patterns the length of critical life history periods such as gestation lactation and puberty were well predicted by the model along with the body weights associated with each transition and for ultimate asymptotic size table 4 predictions regarding reproductive output also corresponded well to observations of annual calving rates in captive muskox table 4 modelled growth curves accurately matched observed body weights of captive muskoxen across all life stages capturing quantitative and qualitative weight development during fetal development fig 2 a lactation fig 2b and in juveniles and adults fig 2c 3 2 seasonal changes and body composition the seasonal cycle of body weight change in adult female muskoxen was well captured by the model which accurately predicted the timing and extent of weight loss in late spring may associated with birth and the onset of lactation fig 3 a the reproductive buffer was the energy storage compartment that best mimicked the overall pattern and general amplitude of seasonal changes in body fat of muskoxen measure of body condition though reserves and sum of reserves and reproduction buffer also followed the observed seasonal pattern fig 3b our model predicted a high ratio of reserves to structure throughout the full lifetime of the animal fig b 1 a depending on the life stage reserves on average accounted for 79 90 of the total body weight fig b 1b only adults accumulated energy into a reproduction buffer and it represented 7 5 of total body weight on average and peaked seasonally at 13 the reproduction buffer was completely exhausted and reserves depleted slightly during the reproductive period suggesting a seasonal body weight loss due to gestation and lactation of 30 50 kg fig b 1 a upregulated assimilation during productive summer months is used by females to replenish these lost reserves resulting in a predicted seasonal peak in upregulation of 7 5 mj d fig 4 a and a two fold increase in feed dry mass ingestion rates fig 3c this two fold increased ingestion in summer also provides an indication of the necessary forage intake required to rear offspring 3 3 quantitative energy dynamics across life stages the model predicted that the intake and allocation of energy for metabolic processes varies with ontogeny in the muskox fig 4 the growth flux was a much larger fraction of total metabolic costs for the fetus 39 1 and nursling 18 6 compared to juveniles 4 8 and adults 0 07 fig 4b assimilated energy increased with age and body size with the exception of a drop when calves transition to forage and no longer receive high energy milk from the mother fig 4a somatic maintenance represented the largest cost for muskoxen at all life stages and regulated ultimate body size by consuming all available energy in the κ flux leaving none for growth the model also provided quantitative estimates of maternal investment in reproduction fig 5 daily energy demands of the fetus increased with size until birth reaching a maximum daily cost just below 2 5 mj d fig 5a model predictions under predicted daily milk costs by almost half so to accurately capture the costs of lactation from the mothers perspective we adjusted the milk digestion efficiency of the nursling from 0 8 to 0 4 lactation was a much more energy demanding process than gestation with model predictions for daily milk energy intake ranging between 6 and 10 mj d fig 5b the total cumulative energy cost for the mother was approximately 125 mj for gestation and 1000 mj for lactation 3 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of predicted life history traits to changes in model parameter values is shown in fig b 2 age at puberty ultimate body weight and population abundance were the most sensitive to changes in input parameters and birth outcomes were the least sensitive for all traits the energy allocation parameter κ was the most influential causing a change of over 10 in model outputs with only a 5 variation from baseline values smaller κ values reduced predicted age and weight at birth weaning and puberty and increased ultimate body weight and population abundance most other parameters had little effects on life history traits except at large deviations 20 from baseline values and except for parameters that dictated milk energy transfer κ r l κ l and f m i l k which had marked impacts only on individuals that underwent lactation e g ultimate body size adults 3 5 scenario based simulations to demonstrate the model s predictive abilities we modelled the growth and life history impacts of various levels of forage acquisition fig 6 a fig b 3 full lifetime growth curves deviated considerably across the 20 range in functional response f 1 00 to 0 79 resulting in an over 150 kg difference at extreme conditions fig 6a age and weight at weaning and puberty were more influenced by forage acquisition than were birth outcomes food limitation increased age at weaning and puberty while decreasing weights resulting in older yet smaller animals at these life history transitions and later in ultimate adult size fig 6a fig b 3 fecundity was also greatly impacted by increased food limitation with reductions in fecundity for f 0 96 and complete reproductive failure below f 0 81 time to starvation is considered a valuable indicator of resilience to food stress modelled time to starvation in our baseline population peaked at 160 days in nurslings which continued to draw energy from milk as long as the starving mother could afford to provide it and stabilized around 75 days for juveniles and adults fig 7 a in adults time to starvation was inversely proportional to body condition such that survival time drops from 75 to 38 days for individuals of 200 and 150 kg e 44000 vs 30000 j cm3 respectively fig 7b 3 6 model adaptation to wild muskoxen compared to captive animals in the baseline model wild muskoxen experience more extreme seasonal changes in foraging success the reconstructed functional response values based on seasonal body weights were estimated for winter spring summer and fall to be 0 75 0 85 1 00 and 0 95 respectively for victoria island muskoxen model predictions using these values matched observed lifetime growth patterns fig b 4 a but failed to accurately capture the seasonally dynamic changes in body weight and condition fig b 4b c specifically the model could not replicate the rapid deposition of fat and thus rapid weight gain in the short summer foraging period several model modifications were considered to address this seasonal flexibility energy from upregulated assimilation in summer fall was used to replenish both reserves and reproduction buffer seasonal values of upregulation s r increased and forage acquisition f decreased and the lactation period was prolonged to durations typical of wild populations by increasing the maturity threshold at weaning see appendix a for details while this wild adapted model did not improve the general lifetime growth pattern as compared to the previous model it provided much better predictions of seasonal body weight and condition for wild victoria island muskoxen as shown by all measures of goodness of fit r2 and significant regression between observed and predicted data p 0 05 fig 8 vs fig b 4 the model captured the magnitude and timing of weight gain as fat in wild muskox fig 8b and 8c while maintaining a realistic food intake rate in the summer between 3 and 6 kg day comparing females with and without a calf at heel in a year the modified model predicted that lactating females enter the next year at a lower body weight than non lactating females fig 8b predicted fecundity of the wild population was 0 58 a drop of 42 compared to the captive herd we further tested the implications of seasonal food limitations via scenario based simulations using the updated model and found that wild muskoxen were highly sensitive to even slight changes in forage acquisition throughout the year the impact on growth was evident with an as little as 5 change in f and at 10 and 20 reductions in the scaled functional response reproduction ceased entirely as individuals suffer trade offs between survival and reproduction and eventually die of starvation in the 20 scenario fig 6b impacts were evident on all life history traits except for gestation time fig b 5 the smallest reduction in forage acquisition tested 2 5 resulted in changes between 5 and 10 in age and weights at weaning puberty and ultimate size a 5 drop in food caused a weight reduction of 17 kg 38 kg and 32 kg from the victoria island model at weaning puberty and ultimate size there was little impact on fecundity except for the scenario with the highest forage acquisition 20 where fecundity increased by 17 relative to the victoria island population fig b 5 4 discussion arctic mammals live in one of the most seasonally extreme environments in the world with important consequences for acquisition and allocation of energy across seasons and life stages forchhammer and boertmann 1993 schmidt et al 2015 our ability to understand their physiological ecology and to predict life history strategies and functional traits is challenged by uncertainties relating to a rapidly changing arctic and the lack of available mechanistic frameworks we have successfully developed such a process based framework using broadly applicable bioenergetics principles based on the well established deb theory and highlight the applicability of the model in a large circumpolar arctic herbivore the muskox our model allows the quantification of physiologically and ecologically important processes relevant for individual and population fitness assessments and provides a process based framework to explore and decipher interactions between physiological and environmental influences on animal life history we also present an extension of standard deb modelling by explicitly incorporating the dynamic energy budget of the developing fetus further integration of this energy budget framework into an ibm facilitates population based assessments and future spatial and bioenergetic developments 4 1 quantifying muskox energetics using a captive research herd as a capital breeding species muskoxen rely on their energy reserves accumulated in productive summer autumn months to fuel the costs of reproduction over the course of gestation and early lactation during food scarce winter spring months white et al 1989 since reproduction is known to drain energy stores with consequences on inter annual fitness in muskox adamczewski et al 1995 1992 understanding the energetic demands of reproductive processes is important our model predicted total cumulative costs of reproduction in muskoxen to be 1125 mj and lactation represented up to 89 of costs which is in line with lactation costs in other mammals gittleman and thompson 1988 to cover these considerable costs adult female muskoxen were predicted to have important contributions of reserves 70 and reproduction buffer 20 to total body weight highlighting a large capacity of energy storage for this capital breeder incorporating upregulation in the calculation of κ the allocation parameter for growth maintenance vs maturation reproduction results in a change from the original allocation to the reproductive branch of 5 κ 0 95 to a more relevant estimate of 37 κ 0 63 highlighting the important allocation of energy to reproductive processes in mammals energy associated with lactation is not only important in the energy budget of adult females it is of great consequence to the development of the nursing calves the strong impact of reduced environmental forage availability on nursling growth and maturation see fig 3 and fig b3 4 reflects the decreasing maternal transfer of energy through milk as the mother conserves her own reserves and in turn a calf diet increasingly dominated by forage nursling weight was predicted to drop by 30 kg at weaning with a 20 reduction in the functional response and growth and maturation effects were sustained throughout juvenile and adult life stages ultimately affecting fecundity and population recruitment in our model our model of lactation was only able to capture the high daily milk energy output reported in captive adult females by reducing the milk assimilation efficiency of the nursing calf to 40 thus requiring greater overall milk intake avoiding this caused too much assimilation in the calf resulting in unrealistic growth patterns during the first year of life unfortunately little data exists to better estimate the milk assimilation efficiency in muskoxen though the typical value used in deb models is 80 other ways of maintaining high energy outputs in the mother and realistic growth in the calf assuming high milk assimilation efficiency are to have lower lactation efficiency in the mother or different parameter values or energy dynamics in the calf calves have been shown to be much more active than juveniles and adults parker et al 1990 and in combination with higher heating costs due to poorer wool and fat insulation blix et al 1984 a nursing muskox may have greater energy demands than in other life stages without data to support additional model formulations e g movement costs or full re parameterization for life stage specific parameter values however it is more sensible at this point to apply our corrective approach in order to accurately capture the energy costs from the mother s perspective we assumed low assimilation efficiency of daily plant ingestion in order to have model predicted ingestion rates match observed ingestion rates from captive feeding studies of muskoxen adamczewski et al 1994 barboza et al 2006 munn and barboza 2008 peltier et al 2003 these feeding studies proposed digestion efficiencies between 50 and 80 and our model results suggested an assimilation efficiency value between 25 and 50 the difference is likely related to the difference between digestion and assimilation efficiency digestion efficiency in feeding studies assume energetic losses occur only between ingestion and egestion feces while assimilation efficiency in deb theory include these as well as additional losses from respiration production of co2 ch4 etc we thus consider previous estimates as upper boundaries for true digestion efficiency using this assimilation efficiency and assuming that metabolic rates are the sum of somatic maintenance maturity maintenance and efficiency losses during reproduction and assimilation our deb model estimated annual average field metabolic rates fmr of captive muskoxen from 0 51 mj d 0 038 mj kg d in newborns to 19 08 mj d 0 081 mj kg d in adult females predicted fmr varied seasonally following plant cycles and ingestion rates reaching 22 74 mj d 0 11 mj kg d in summer and 16 90 mj d 0 068 mj kg d in winter similar to observed seasonal patterns in captive metabolic studies nilssen et al 1994 parker et al 1990 the seasonal changes in our model occur due to higher food intake in summer thus higher heat increment of feeding nilssen et al 1994 though alternative physiological and behavioral adaptations to extreme climatic conditions throughout the year such as core temperature suppression or lowered activity levels e g schmidt et al 2016 may also be contributing to observed metabolic rate changes in these animals we lack the data to currently explore these hypotheses but highlight the importance of food intake when considering seasonal changes in metabolism 4 2 deb ibm in a free ranging muskox population in the high arctic the primary aim of this study was to develop an energy based framework to investigate life history strategies of large mammals in seasonally extreme environments like the arctic as a permanent resident of the arctic the muskox lifecycle is strongly shaped by climatic conditions and seasonal plant dynamics berger et al 2018 schmidt et al 2015 muskoxen rely on forage availability during the relatively short arctic summer growing season to accumulate energy for their own survival as well as that of their offspring adapting the baseline model for wild muskox involved only changes in assimilation fluxes through seasonal forage acquisition f and upregulation s r as well as parameters regulating the dynamics of upregulation applying our model to new populations is likely to be relatively straightforward as it would require fitting three parameters f s r and e r m i n to seasonal body weights of adult females our model framework should thus be generally applicable across mammalian species as it is built on common physiological processes that describe ecologically relevant life history traits in our wild model summer feeding was critical to not only fuel reproduction but also replenish the animals own depleted winter reserves our model reproduced the protracted consequence of lactation in mammals showing that reproductive females failed to recover body weight fat to the same extent as females without dependent offspring adamczewski et al 1997a 1997b pomeroy et al 1999 the lower body condition of females in years following successful calving has important consequences for future reproductive success parker et al 2009 indeed fat content in muskoxen has been identified as an important predictor of successful pregnancy with no pregnancies observed for fat contents below approximately 15 kg and a 50 probability of successful calving at 30 kg fat in the fall white et al 1997 using reproduction buffer density as condition thresholds for estrus and implantation our model accurately predicted fecundity in victoria island muskoxen which is typically between 60 and 80 across years adamczewski et al 1997a 1997b a similar range in reproductive success has been reported for a wild muskox population in northeast greenland schmidt et al 2015 while summer feeding is crucial to replenish reserves winter spring conditions are considered to be the major driver of survival and fecundity in arctic herbivores garrott et al 2003 kohler and aanes 2004 schmidt et al 2015 this interplay was evident in our wild muskox model in which adult body size condition and reproduction rates were much lower than for the captive model driven primarily by lower winter forage acquisition harsh winter conditions may lead to extended periods of starvation when individuals lose access to forage because of severe snow conditions or ice cover modelled reserve density in adult females was almost 20 lower at the end of winter than during summer resulting in average estimated time to starvations of 44 and 67 days respectively this suggests that the average victoria island muskox can survive on its own reserves limiting all energy only to maintenance for 44 days in winter while uncertainty in this estimate is likely it reveals the vulnerability of wild muskox to extended periods of limited food supply in winter simulations with the wild muskox model further supported the dramatic impacts of small changes in forage acquisition on almost all life history traits these results clearly highlight the sensitivity of free ranging muskox populations in the high arctic to climatic and other factors that influence the accessibility of plant resources 5 conclusions future developments the mechanistic model based on deb theory developed here can be used to understand life history processes of large mammals at the individual level and how they can be influenced by environmental factors such as seasonal food availability and acquisition this work is a critical step to understanding the bioenergetics of arctic mammals in general opening up several future applications and model developments as well as highlighting data deficient life history stages improvement of deb parameter value estimates and thus energetics requires additional experimental data for instance on food intake assimilation rates and efficiencies seasonal basal and field metabolic rates and lactation in wild animals linking the model more tightly to external forcing variables such as temperature and plant biomass will thereby further improve our understanding of what is driving population differences in observable life history traits such a framework is perfectly suited to extrapolate individual level processes to the population scale this was not done explicitly here so as to focus on the energetics moreover our deb ibm can be applied to different wild muskox populations or re parameterized to study bioenergetics of other arctic mammals lastly we believe there is a great need to integrate wildlife monitoring data such as satellite telemetry and various bio logging applications with ecological models such as ours novel high resolution bio logging devices enable direct measurements or indirect quantification of energetic expenditure in wild moving individuals across a wide range of environmental conditions coupling these energetic measures to deb models will make it possible to explore and test life history decision making through different scenarios indeed recent papers have presented exciting empirical and theoretical frameworks to incorporate habitat use movement and decision making within energy based ibms boult et al 2018 campos candela et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 pirotta et al 2018 we therefore anticipate that deb ibms such as the one presented here can be used to integrate energetics and movement ecology in order to include the vast information available from

25068,energy is a critical driver of animal life history traits and darwinian fitness with direct implications for population dynamics in the arctic extreme seasonal climatic conditions dictate energy flow and physiology of resident species consequently vital rates of animal populations in the arctic are tightly linked to climatic factors influencing food availability and quality the muskox ovibos moschatus is a capital breeder and the largest herbivore in the arctic seasonal changes in energy intake influence body reserve dynamics of this species impacting inter annual and spatial variations in survival and recruitment yet little is known about the full lifecycle bioenergetics of this and other arctic species and the impact of extreme seasonal conditions on life history traits have never been quantified by integrating energetic and physiological processes throughout the full lifecycle of individuals we developed an individual based model using dynamic energy budget theory deb ibm of the muskox that covers all aspects of mammalian life history we parameterized a baseline muskox model using data from a well studied captive research herd and then explored its application to a wild population in the high arctic to assess the life history implications of seasonal food availability our baseline deb ibm which for the first time explicitly characterized fetal development using deb theory successfully predicted life history traits as well as patterns of growth body condition feeding metabolic rates and reproduction of captive muskoxen adaptation of the model to the wild population required re parameterization of only three variables that controlled seasonal food availability and upregulated assimilation the wild model successfully captured inter annual costs of reproduction such that lactating females were in poorer body condition than females without calves arctic seasonal food limitations reduced fecundity in wild muskoxen by 42 compared to annual reproduction in well fed captive individuals we have developed a mechanistic energy based framework to study life history processes of muskoxen but the model is broadly applicable also for other mammals in the arctic our study quantifies and highlights the strong interplay between energetics and individual fitness components opening the door to future applications of the model in assessments of population dynamics and climate change impacts keywords arctic mammals dynamic energy budget life history muskox physiological ecology seasonal environment 1 introduction energy acquisition and its allocation to physiological processes are critical determinants of animal fitness through their influence on growth and reproduction sousa et al 2010 food availability and uptake dictate the energy available for organisms to allocate to various functions often leading to trade offs between costly fitness components sheldon and verhulst 1996 the energy budget of an animal is thus key to understanding most aspects of individual life history which is tightly linked with population dynamics energy therefore can be considered as a critical driver of fitness across biological scales de roos et al 2009 klanjscek et al 2006 accordingly energy based modelling approaches are increasingly being used in ecology to understand species environment interactions boult et al 2018 galic et al 2017 nisbet et al 2000 though few studies focus on the arctic or on large vertebrates e g de roos et al 2009 klanjscek et al 2007 molnár et al 2010 arctic ecosystems undergo some of the most extreme seasonal fluctuations in climatic and environmental conditions in the world arctic species have developed distinct physiological and behavioral adaptations to the short summer growing seasons and harsh long winters blix 2005 nonetheless arctic populations are vulnerable to inter annual cycles of climatic variation as vital rates are tightly linked to winter and summer conditions forchhammer and boertmann 1993 schmidt et al 2015 and extreme climatic events hansen et al 2013 indeed climatic conditions can influence physical and biological components of the environment which can impact energy acquisition individual fitness and ultimately population abundance and distribution of arctic wildlife burek et al 2008 our ability to predict population dynamics of arctic species is challenged by rapid climate change which is putting northern ecosystems under new and severe pressure legagneux et al 2014 post et al 2009 furthermore details on seasonal physiology activity and behavior are often lacking in species living in remote regions such as the arctic large bodied herbivores including muskoxen ovibos moschatus and reindeer rangifer tarandus roaming the circumpolar arctic play important roles in the structuring and functioning of the tundra ecosystem falk et al 2015 mosbacher et al 2018 as year round residents in the arctic these species experience marked seasonal and inter annual variation in the availability and quality of their food base mosbacher et al 2016 with important consequences for survival and reproduction schmidt et al 2015 sustained conservation of large arctic mammals and better predictions of climate change impacts require a deeper understanding of species physiology and ecology particularly the metabolic processes governing important functional life history traits and population performance an understanding of reproductive costs is fundamental in life history theory the energetic costs of raising offspring varies depending on the type and stage of parental investment social dominance size and sex of the offspring clutton brock et al 1981 descamps et al 2009 unlike income breeders that concurrently feed during reproduction capital breeders like the muskox rely on stored energy reserves to cover reproductive costs the acquired energy over the short and productive arctic summer fall is therefore critical for the survival as well as gestation and lactation of offspring throughout food limited winter spring adamczewski et al 1997a white et al 1997 despite the importance of energy as a driver of darwinian fitness we have poor quantification of parental investment and other physiological processes in large free ranging mammals particularly for species adopting capital breeding strategies in extreme seasonal environments modelling approaches that can integrate energetics physiology and species specific ecology are invaluable tools for wildlife research and conservation an approach grounded on first principles e g mass energy conservation laws thoroughly documented and tested across a broad range of species is dynamic energy budget deb theory deb theory provides a generalized individual and process based framework that follows the acquisition and use of energy throughout the full lifetime of the animal kooijman 2010 deb models describe the physiological processes of feeding growth maintenance maturation and reproduction and are particularly useful in ecological applications because of the inherent mechanistic relationship between these metabolic processes and external forcing variables such as food availability or ambient temperature deb theory thus provides an ideal framework to integrate energetics physiology and environmental factors in predictive and process based models at the individual level when combined with individual based models ibm this framework can be used to predict population dynamics de roos et al 2009 goedegebuure et al 2018 here we develop an individual based model using deb theory to assess the full lifecycle energetics including reproduction costs and consequent life history traits of the largest herbivore species inhabiting the seasonally extreme arctic environment we first develop and parameterize a baseline deb model for female muskoxen using long term empirical time series data on muskox growth feeding and reproduction from a well fed captive research herd this includes for the first time a full deb theory based model for the developing fetus the model is then adapted and applied to a free ranging population of muskox in the high arctic to investigate the impacts of seasonal food availability on physiological ecology and functional traits across all life stages 2 material and methods 2 1 baseline model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for individual based models grimm et al 2006 here we provide a summary of the model description but the complete odd is available in the supplementary material appendix a we develop an energy budget model for female muskoxen fig 1 following the principals of deb theory kooijman 2010 muskoxen in this model have four life stages fetus nursling juvenile and adult individuals are characterized by the four primary state variables used in deb theory structure l o r v reserves e maturity e h and reproduction buffer e r reserves structure and the reproduction buffer contribute to body mass while maturity does not reserves is also reported as a ratio to structure r e s e r v e d e n s i t y e e v and scaled to a species specific maximum value scaled reserve density s c a l e d r e s e r v e d e n s i t y e e e m maturity is measured by the amount of dissipated energy e g heat and metabolites that has been used for maturation and represents the costs of increasing biological complexity and is therefore used to track maturation and trigger life stage transitions the model includes ageing via two additional state variables damage inducing compounds q and damage h which act together to increase the probability of mortality throughout the lifetime of the individual see section 2 2 6 for additional details model parameters are defined in table 1 and energy flux and state variable dynamics are provided in tables 2 and 3 structure represents the portion of body mass which requires maintenance and is tracked as a length or volume v l 3 the structural length is proportional to the observed physical length of the animal using the shape coefficient δ m the link between food availability and ingestion rate is through a scaled functional response f that follows a holling type ii relationship f x x k x where x is food density and x k the half saturation constant the scaled functional response is a condensed proxy for forage acquisition e g food availability searching handling etc and takes values between 0 starvation and 1 maximum feeding kooijman 2010 marn et al 2017 we use the term forage acquisition interchangeably with the scaled functional response throughout the text energy extracted from food is stored in reserves via assimilation p a the flow of energy out of the reserves the mobilization flux p c is used to fuel all other metabolic processes of the organism a fraction κ of the mobilization flux is first allocated to the somatic maintenance needs of the organism p s then growth of structural biomass p g the remaining 1 κ fraction is used first to pay maturity maintenance p j and then any remaining fraction of the mobilization flux is dedicated to maturation or reproduction p r depending on the life stage of the individual individuals are characterized by maturity thresholds for birth e h b weaning e h x and puberty e h p by which the cumulative energy in maturation e h dictates lifestage transitions once they become adults individuals divert the energy previously allocated to maturation into a reproduction buffer e r which fuels the costs of gestation and lactation 2 2 sub model specifications a number of sub models were developed and incorporated to describe the specific life history features of the muskox as well as deviations from standard allocation rules of deb theory to better reflect the seasonal and capital breeding strategy of a mammal living in harsh seasonal environments full description of these are provided in the odd appendix a here we provide a brief overview of the major processes 2 2 1 reproduction the rutting period for muskoxen begins in late summer thus our model implements a strict breeding season from julian day 252 282 aug sept females enter estrus if they pass a minimum breeding condition threshold based on their reproduction buffer density the value of which was based on observations of fat content and pregnancy probabilities in muskoxen adamczewski et al 1998 white et al 1997 2 2 2 fetal development calculations for fetal structural growth are based on kooijman 2010 but all other aspects of the fetal energy budget were further developed to fully characterize a deb theory based model for mammalian fetal development for the first time fig 1 table 3 a condensed fetus model was characterized for the right whale using only growth somatic maintenance and reserve accumulation klanjscek et al 2007 but we build on this to include reserve mobilization dynamics κ and energy allocation to maturity maintenance and maturation fetal development commences after an initial arrest period t 0 of 85 days determined during initial deb parameter estimation the fetus energy budget is demand driven governed by growth needs d d t l f and p g f in the κ branch of the energy budget energy fluxes to the 1 κ branch as well as all other upstream fluxes fig 1 are back calculated from the somatic maintenance and growth costs of the fetus unlike the standard deb model energy for metabolic processes in our model can come from two branches either reserve mobilization same as adults or a parallel demand flux p m f coming directly from the mother when fetal reserve mobilization is insufficient fetal reserve flux p e f and the scaled reserve density of the fetus e f are proportional to the reserve density of the mother table 3 the total daily costs of gestation g c o s t are subtracted from the reproduction buffer of the mother if insufficient buffer is available at any time during gestation the mother miscarries and pregnancy is terminated 2 2 3 lactation and calf development muskox calves rely entirely on milk during the first weeks or months after birth until the snow melts and the plant growing season begins parker et al 1990 following an initial phase 30 days of 100 milk calves gradually reduce the proportion of milk κ m i l k intake while consuming more forage over time table 3 the assimilation flux in nurslings is therefore the sum of milk p a m i l k and forage p a f o r a g e intake to account for the greater quality of milk compared to forage e g protein fat energy content parker et al 1990 we added a milk specific scaled functional response f m i l k to the milk assimilation flux to increase energy intake table 1 the total daily costs of lactation p l after accounting for overhead costs of producing milk κ r l and the digestion efficiency of the calf κ l are subtracted from the reproduction buffer of the mother if these costs are greater than the current energy in the reproduction buffer they are instead taken from the mother s reserves the full milk derived energy demands of the nursling p a m i l k continue to draw from the reserves of the mother until the maternal reserve density falls below e 0 8 after which maternal energy transfer stops and the nursling is forced to rely solely on forage p a f o r a g e 2 2 4 upregulated assimilation to cover the additional energetic needs of reproduction females typically increase their food intake kooijman 2010 unlike standard deb models we allowed upregulated assimilation throughout the full year rather than only during gestation and moreover implement seasonal changes associated with arctic forage dynamics upregulated assimilation p a was thus implemented continuously after individuals reach puberty via a scaled upregulation response factor s r applied to the assimilation flux this flux enters directly into the reproduction buffer in order to prevent additional structural growth in individuals as food intake increases monthly values of the upregulation factor were derived from captive feeding studies adamczewski et al 1994 and re calibrated in the deb ibm during model testing to fit the observed data on body weights and fecundity lastly another scaled response factor is introduced s e r to regulate the size of the reproduction buffer so that it does not increase indefinitely in cases where it is not depleted from year to year s e r ranges from 0 to 1 and is a function of minimum and maximum buffer density thresholds e r m i n e r m a x the effect is that upregulation continues unhindered while e r e r m i n and tends towards zero as e r approaches e r m a x 2 2 5 starvation we adopted the standard starvation rules from kooijman 2010 with some muskox specific modifications starvation occurs when the fraction of mobilized reserves going to somatic maintenance is insufficient to cover the costs thereof e g κ p c p s somatic maintenance takes priority over all other metabolic processes when this occurs the deviation in allocation rules is as follows first allocation to growth ceases p g 0 and somatic maintenance needs are paid by diverting energy from maturation for juveniles or the reproduction buffer for adults next if maturation or the reproduction buffer becomes unable to cover somatic maintenance the missing energy is diverted directly from the reserves this process continues until the individual is no longer starving or if the scaled reserve density falls below the death threshold e 0 4 which was determined through model testing to match observations of body weight of muskoxen in greenland that died of starvation n m schmidt personal observation 2 2 6 ageing the ageing process is tightly linked to individual energetics and can be related to cumulative stress and damage to structural tissue over the lifetime by free radicals and other reactive oxygen species kooijman 2010 ageing applies to all individuals from the day they are born and is implemented as damage to structure which accumulates over time and increases the probability of mortality through calculation of a hazard rate h sensu martin et al 2012 2 3 parameter estimation and model evaluation the software package debtool https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab debtool debtool m manual was used to estimate the parameters of the baseline deb model for captive muskoxen using the covariation method described in marques et al 2018 parameter estimation in debtool is done by minimizing the weighted sum of squared differences between observed data and estimates through regression doing so simultaneously for all parameters we further developed the deb model and implemented it within an ibm framework in the open source agent based modelling program netlogo version 6 0 2 august 4 2017 this combined deb ibm framework allowed us to follow energy budgets of individual females and their offspring throughout their full lifetime analysis of grouped individuals can provide population estimates of functional life history traits and overall population abundance over time martin et al 2012 many parameters were introduced in the deb ibm to specify time and species specific processes for the muskox that are not part of standard deb theory and debtool parameter values were determined from the literature where possible and if no prior information was available they were determined through pattern oriented modelling using parameter sweeping to assess a range of possible parameter values wiegand et al 2003 final parameter values were chosen so as to minimize the relative error between observed data averages and model predictions for the endpoints of interest e g table 4 see specific sub sections for details in each parameter we parameterized the baseline deb model for a captive research herd of muskoxen held at the large animal research station run by the university of alaska fairbanks average static life history trait data e g zero variate data for these muskoxen are displayed in table 4 and include age and weights at important points in the muskox lifecycle e g birth weaning puberty and adult as well as the maximum reproduction rate while we focus on weight as our measure of body size in this study because of data limitations we also included physical length at birth and adult maturity for model fitting in order to ensure the model also accurately predicted structural length time series data e g univariate data from lars was also available including lifetime growth curves for total body weight white et al 1989 desforges et al 2019 fetal growth curves pharr et al 1994 rombach et al 2003 milk production and intake rates parker et al 1990 white et al 1989 and feeding rates adamczewski et al 1994 barboza et al 2006 munn and barboza 2008 peltier et al 2003 life history and growth data were derived from 24 animals of different age followed between 2004 and 2018 desforges et al 2019 we use mean relative error and coefficients of determination r2 as estimates of goodness of fit of model predictions to observed data population average for life history traits and time series endpoints respectively goodness of fit was further assessed using linear regression analysis of observed vs predicted time series data with significant relationships determined when p values 0 05 2 4 sensitivity analyses we conducted a local sensitivity analysis single parameter variations to explore how the model responded to changes in the parameter set this process is useful to determine which parameters are most influential on model outputs and results can guide future research focus the deb ibm model outputs we followed were age and weight at birth weaning and puberty ultimate asymptotic body weight and the population abundance after a 10 year model run period parameter values were varied by 5 10 and 20 in both directions compared to their default value for parameters with a fixed upper limit such as κ and conversion efficiencies the 5 10 and 20 increases were not applied blindly with no regard for the upper limit the symmetry of the lower limit 0 and the upper limit was used so that the resulting values could make theoretical sense so for the case of κ with an upper limit of 1 the increases were performed as decreases of 5 10 and 20 on 1 κ and then calculated to give the new parameter value the outputs of each simulation were averaged across individuals and compared to the baseline output using a sensitivity index si as in pethybridge et al 2013 representing the relative error between baseline values and the new values for each output 2 5 model testing and scenario based simulations the sensitivity to forage acquisition on individual growth and life history traits was evaluated through scenario based simulations the baseline muskox model was used in the first two scenarios to investigate 1 the influence of the scaled functional response f over the lifetime of individuals and 2 starvation survival time in the former we reduce f incrementally in each simulation from 1 00 to 0 79 to represent environments with different constant food availability starvation simulations were run for different ages by following the time it would take to deplete reserves and die of starvation assuming only maintenance is paid with death occurring at the reserve density threshold previously determined we also investigated the influence of body condition on time to starvation by investigating reserve depletion times in mature adult females at maximum structural length with decreasing amounts of initial reserve densities 2 6 model development for wild muskoxen once the baseline muskox deb ibm model was calibrated and evaluated against available captive data the final parameter set of the model was tested against empirical data collected from a wild muskox population in the high arctic victoria island canada here single data points for body weight body composition body condition fat content and thickness and reproductive rates were measured in 289 hunted females between 1985 and 1991 adamczewski et al 1992 1994 1995 1997 1998 desforges et al 2019 hunted animals likely represent the healthiest animals in the population but we do not consider this an important bias as we wanted to capture the average pattern of the normal population our model is not intended to capture sickness or other abnormal processes we assumed the wild population differed from the captive herd mainly in terms of seasonal foraging success thus we focused the re parameterization process to the scaled functional response parameter f as it condenses several aspects of foraging effort and food availability into one general term kooijman 2010 marn et al 2017 using monthly mean body weights of adult female muskoxen as inputs we applied a dynamic reconstruction approach in debtool software to reverse model the expected functional response stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 since debtool used a simplified version of our deb model the resulting seasonally predicted f values were considered only as meaningful starting points and required further calibration to fit the more complex deb ibm re calibration was done in netlogo via pattern oriented analysis to match emergent body weights and fecundity in the model output with observed seasonal field data further model modifications were necessary to capture the seasonal growth dynamics of wild muskoxen and these were focused on the dynamics and values of upregulation including monthly values of the upregulated fraction of assimilation minimum and maximum reproduction buffer density thresholds for upregulation and how upregulated assimilation is used for the latter we updated the dynamics so that a fraction 1 e of upregulation is diverted to reserves while the remaining fraction e enters the reproduction buffer as before thus allowing intense summer foraging to replenish depleted winter reserves as well as fuel reproductive costs see appendix a for further details of these changes we employed scenario based simulations in the wild muskox deb ibm to further investigate the impact of changes in seasonal forage acquisition on muskox growth and reproduction we used the parameterized wild muskox model victoria island as a starting point and ran simulations that applied factor changes 2 5 5 10 and 20 evenly to all values of f throughout the year thus generating greater or lesser magnitude changes in the seasonality of forage acquisition 3 results 3 1 growth and life history traits the baseline muskox deb ibm based on captive muskox data accurately reproduced important life history traits as well as growth and developmental patterns the length of critical life history periods such as gestation lactation and puberty were well predicted by the model along with the body weights associated with each transition and for ultimate asymptotic size table 4 predictions regarding reproductive output also corresponded well to observations of annual calving rates in captive muskox table 4 modelled growth curves accurately matched observed body weights of captive muskoxen across all life stages capturing quantitative and qualitative weight development during fetal development fig 2 a lactation fig 2b and in juveniles and adults fig 2c 3 2 seasonal changes and body composition the seasonal cycle of body weight change in adult female muskoxen was well captured by the model which accurately predicted the timing and extent of weight loss in late spring may associated with birth and the onset of lactation fig 3 a the reproductive buffer was the energy storage compartment that best mimicked the overall pattern and general amplitude of seasonal changes in body fat of muskoxen measure of body condition though reserves and sum of reserves and reproduction buffer also followed the observed seasonal pattern fig 3b our model predicted a high ratio of reserves to structure throughout the full lifetime of the animal fig b 1 a depending on the life stage reserves on average accounted for 79 90 of the total body weight fig b 1b only adults accumulated energy into a reproduction buffer and it represented 7 5 of total body weight on average and peaked seasonally at 13 the reproduction buffer was completely exhausted and reserves depleted slightly during the reproductive period suggesting a seasonal body weight loss due to gestation and lactation of 30 50 kg fig b 1 a upregulated assimilation during productive summer months is used by females to replenish these lost reserves resulting in a predicted seasonal peak in upregulation of 7 5 mj d fig 4 a and a two fold increase in feed dry mass ingestion rates fig 3c this two fold increased ingestion in summer also provides an indication of the necessary forage intake required to rear offspring 3 3 quantitative energy dynamics across life stages the model predicted that the intake and allocation of energy for metabolic processes varies with ontogeny in the muskox fig 4 the growth flux was a much larger fraction of total metabolic costs for the fetus 39 1 and nursling 18 6 compared to juveniles 4 8 and adults 0 07 fig 4b assimilated energy increased with age and body size with the exception of a drop when calves transition to forage and no longer receive high energy milk from the mother fig 4a somatic maintenance represented the largest cost for muskoxen at all life stages and regulated ultimate body size by consuming all available energy in the κ flux leaving none for growth the model also provided quantitative estimates of maternal investment in reproduction fig 5 daily energy demands of the fetus increased with size until birth reaching a maximum daily cost just below 2 5 mj d fig 5a model predictions under predicted daily milk costs by almost half so to accurately capture the costs of lactation from the mothers perspective we adjusted the milk digestion efficiency of the nursling from 0 8 to 0 4 lactation was a much more energy demanding process than gestation with model predictions for daily milk energy intake ranging between 6 and 10 mj d fig 5b the total cumulative energy cost for the mother was approximately 125 mj for gestation and 1000 mj for lactation 3 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of predicted life history traits to changes in model parameter values is shown in fig b 2 age at puberty ultimate body weight and population abundance were the most sensitive to changes in input parameters and birth outcomes were the least sensitive for all traits the energy allocation parameter κ was the most influential causing a change of over 10 in model outputs with only a 5 variation from baseline values smaller κ values reduced predicted age and weight at birth weaning and puberty and increased ultimate body weight and population abundance most other parameters had little effects on life history traits except at large deviations 20 from baseline values and except for parameters that dictated milk energy transfer κ r l κ l and f m i l k which had marked impacts only on individuals that underwent lactation e g ultimate body size adults 3 5 scenario based simulations to demonstrate the model s predictive abilities we modelled the growth and life history impacts of various levels of forage acquisition fig 6 a fig b 3 full lifetime growth curves deviated considerably across the 20 range in functional response f 1 00 to 0 79 resulting in an over 150 kg difference at extreme conditions fig 6a age and weight at weaning and puberty were more influenced by forage acquisition than were birth outcomes food limitation increased age at weaning and puberty while decreasing weights resulting in older yet smaller animals at these life history transitions and later in ultimate adult size fig 6a fig b 3 fecundity was also greatly impacted by increased food limitation with reductions in fecundity for f 0 96 and complete reproductive failure below f 0 81 time to starvation is considered a valuable indicator of resilience to food stress modelled time to starvation in our baseline population peaked at 160 days in nurslings which continued to draw energy from milk as long as the starving mother could afford to provide it and stabilized around 75 days for juveniles and adults fig 7 a in adults time to starvation was inversely proportional to body condition such that survival time drops from 75 to 38 days for individuals of 200 and 150 kg e 44000 vs 30000 j cm3 respectively fig 7b 3 6 model adaptation to wild muskoxen compared to captive animals in the baseline model wild muskoxen experience more extreme seasonal changes in foraging success the reconstructed functional response values based on seasonal body weights were estimated for winter spring summer and fall to be 0 75 0 85 1 00 and 0 95 respectively for victoria island muskoxen model predictions using these values matched observed lifetime growth patterns fig b 4 a but failed to accurately capture the seasonally dynamic changes in body weight and condition fig b 4b c specifically the model could not replicate the rapid deposition of fat and thus rapid weight gain in the short summer foraging period several model modifications were considered to address this seasonal flexibility energy from upregulated assimilation in summer fall was used to replenish both reserves and reproduction buffer seasonal values of upregulation s r increased and forage acquisition f decreased and the lactation period was prolonged to durations typical of wild populations by increasing the maturity threshold at weaning see appendix a for details while this wild adapted model did not improve the general lifetime growth pattern as compared to the previous model it provided much better predictions of seasonal body weight and condition for wild victoria island muskoxen as shown by all measures of goodness of fit r2 and significant regression between observed and predicted data p 0 05 fig 8 vs fig b 4 the model captured the magnitude and timing of weight gain as fat in wild muskox fig 8b and 8c while maintaining a realistic food intake rate in the summer between 3 and 6 kg day comparing females with and without a calf at heel in a year the modified model predicted that lactating females enter the next year at a lower body weight than non lactating females fig 8b predicted fecundity of the wild population was 0 58 a drop of 42 compared to the captive herd we further tested the implications of seasonal food limitations via scenario based simulations using the updated model and found that wild muskoxen were highly sensitive to even slight changes in forage acquisition throughout the year the impact on growth was evident with an as little as 5 change in f and at 10 and 20 reductions in the scaled functional response reproduction ceased entirely as individuals suffer trade offs between survival and reproduction and eventually die of starvation in the 20 scenario fig 6b impacts were evident on all life history traits except for gestation time fig b 5 the smallest reduction in forage acquisition tested 2 5 resulted in changes between 5 and 10 in age and weights at weaning puberty and ultimate size a 5 drop in food caused a weight reduction of 17 kg 38 kg and 32 kg from the victoria island model at weaning puberty and ultimate size there was little impact on fecundity except for the scenario with the highest forage acquisition 20 where fecundity increased by 17 relative to the victoria island population fig b 5 4 discussion arctic mammals live in one of the most seasonally extreme environments in the world with important consequences for acquisition and allocation of energy across seasons and life stages forchhammer and boertmann 1993 schmidt et al 2015 our ability to understand their physiological ecology and to predict life history strategies and functional traits is challenged by uncertainties relating to a rapidly changing arctic and the lack of available mechanistic frameworks we have successfully developed such a process based framework using broadly applicable bioenergetics principles based on the well established deb theory and highlight the applicability of the model in a large circumpolar arctic herbivore the muskox our model allows the quantification of physiologically and ecologically important processes relevant for individual and population fitness assessments and provides a process based framework to explore and decipher interactions between physiological and environmental influences on animal life history we also present an extension of standard deb modelling by explicitly incorporating the dynamic energy budget of the developing fetus further integration of this energy budget framework into an ibm facilitates population based assessments and future spatial and bioenergetic developments 4 1 quantifying muskox energetics using a captive research herd as a capital breeding species muskoxen rely on their energy reserves accumulated in productive summer autumn months to fuel the costs of reproduction over the course of gestation and early lactation during food scarce winter spring months white et al 1989 since reproduction is known to drain energy stores with consequences on inter annual fitness in muskox adamczewski et al 1995 1992 understanding the energetic demands of reproductive processes is important our model predicted total cumulative costs of reproduction in muskoxen to be 1125 mj and lactation represented up to 89 of costs which is in line with lactation costs in other mammals gittleman and thompson 1988 to cover these considerable costs adult female muskoxen were predicted to have important contributions of reserves 70 and reproduction buffer 20 to total body weight highlighting a large capacity of energy storage for this capital breeder incorporating upregulation in the calculation of κ the allocation parameter for growth maintenance vs maturation reproduction results in a change from the original allocation to the reproductive branch of 5 κ 0 95 to a more relevant estimate of 37 κ 0 63 highlighting the important allocation of energy to reproductive processes in mammals energy associated with lactation is not only important in the energy budget of adult females it is of great consequence to the development of the nursing calves the strong impact of reduced environmental forage availability on nursling growth and maturation see fig 3 and fig b3 4 reflects the decreasing maternal transfer of energy through milk as the mother conserves her own reserves and in turn a calf diet increasingly dominated by forage nursling weight was predicted to drop by 30 kg at weaning with a 20 reduction in the functional response and growth and maturation effects were sustained throughout juvenile and adult life stages ultimately affecting fecundity and population recruitment in our model our model of lactation was only able to capture the high daily milk energy output reported in captive adult females by reducing the milk assimilation efficiency of the nursing calf to 40 thus requiring greater overall milk intake avoiding this caused too much assimilation in the calf resulting in unrealistic growth patterns during the first year of life unfortunately little data exists to better estimate the milk assimilation efficiency in muskoxen though the typical value used in deb models is 80 other ways of maintaining high energy outputs in the mother and realistic growth in the calf assuming high milk assimilation efficiency are to have lower lactation efficiency in the mother or different parameter values or energy dynamics in the calf calves have been shown to be much more active than juveniles and adults parker et al 1990 and in combination with higher heating costs due to poorer wool and fat insulation blix et al 1984 a nursing muskox may have greater energy demands than in other life stages without data to support additional model formulations e g movement costs or full re parameterization for life stage specific parameter values however it is more sensible at this point to apply our corrective approach in order to accurately capture the energy costs from the mother s perspective we assumed low assimilation efficiency of daily plant ingestion in order to have model predicted ingestion rates match observed ingestion rates from captive feeding studies of muskoxen adamczewski et al 1994 barboza et al 2006 munn and barboza 2008 peltier et al 2003 these feeding studies proposed digestion efficiencies between 50 and 80 and our model results suggested an assimilation efficiency value between 25 and 50 the difference is likely related to the difference between digestion and assimilation efficiency digestion efficiency in feeding studies assume energetic losses occur only between ingestion and egestion feces while assimilation efficiency in deb theory include these as well as additional losses from respiration production of co2 ch4 etc we thus consider previous estimates as upper boundaries for true digestion efficiency using this assimilation efficiency and assuming that metabolic rates are the sum of somatic maintenance maturity maintenance and efficiency losses during reproduction and assimilation our deb model estimated annual average field metabolic rates fmr of captive muskoxen from 0 51 mj d 0 038 mj kg d in newborns to 19 08 mj d 0 081 mj kg d in adult females predicted fmr varied seasonally following plant cycles and ingestion rates reaching 22 74 mj d 0 11 mj kg d in summer and 16 90 mj d 0 068 mj kg d in winter similar to observed seasonal patterns in captive metabolic studies nilssen et al 1994 parker et al 1990 the seasonal changes in our model occur due to higher food intake in summer thus higher heat increment of feeding nilssen et al 1994 though alternative physiological and behavioral adaptations to extreme climatic conditions throughout the year such as core temperature suppression or lowered activity levels e g schmidt et al 2016 may also be contributing to observed metabolic rate changes in these animals we lack the data to currently explore these hypotheses but highlight the importance of food intake when considering seasonal changes in metabolism 4 2 deb ibm in a free ranging muskox population in the high arctic the primary aim of this study was to develop an energy based framework to investigate life history strategies of large mammals in seasonally extreme environments like the arctic as a permanent resident of the arctic the muskox lifecycle is strongly shaped by climatic conditions and seasonal plant dynamics berger et al 2018 schmidt et al 2015 muskoxen rely on forage availability during the relatively short arctic summer growing season to accumulate energy for their own survival as well as that of their offspring adapting the baseline model for wild muskox involved only changes in assimilation fluxes through seasonal forage acquisition f and upregulation s r as well as parameters regulating the dynamics of upregulation applying our model to new populations is likely to be relatively straightforward as it would require fitting three parameters f s r and e r m i n to seasonal body weights of adult females our model framework should thus be generally applicable across mammalian species as it is built on common physiological processes that describe ecologically relevant life history traits in our wild model summer feeding was critical to not only fuel reproduction but also replenish the animals own depleted winter reserves our model reproduced the protracted consequence of lactation in mammals showing that reproductive females failed to recover body weight fat to the same extent as females without dependent offspring adamczewski et al 1997a 1997b pomeroy et al 1999 the lower body condition of females in years following successful calving has important consequences for future reproductive success parker et al 2009 indeed fat content in muskoxen has been identified as an important predictor of successful pregnancy with no pregnancies observed for fat contents below approximately 15 kg and a 50 probability of successful calving at 30 kg fat in the fall white et al 1997 using reproduction buffer density as condition thresholds for estrus and implantation our model accurately predicted fecundity in victoria island muskoxen which is typically between 60 and 80 across years adamczewski et al 1997a 1997b a similar range in reproductive success has been reported for a wild muskox population in northeast greenland schmidt et al 2015 while summer feeding is crucial to replenish reserves winter spring conditions are considered to be the major driver of survival and fecundity in arctic herbivores garrott et al 2003 kohler and aanes 2004 schmidt et al 2015 this interplay was evident in our wild muskox model in which adult body size condition and reproduction rates were much lower than for the captive model driven primarily by lower winter forage acquisition harsh winter conditions may lead to extended periods of starvation when individuals lose access to forage because of severe snow conditions or ice cover modelled reserve density in adult females was almost 20 lower at the end of winter than during summer resulting in average estimated time to starvations of 44 and 67 days respectively this suggests that the average victoria island muskox can survive on its own reserves limiting all energy only to maintenance for 44 days in winter while uncertainty in this estimate is likely it reveals the vulnerability of wild muskox to extended periods of limited food supply in winter simulations with the wild muskox model further supported the dramatic impacts of small changes in forage acquisition on almost all life history traits these results clearly highlight the sensitivity of free ranging muskox populations in the high arctic to climatic and other factors that influence the accessibility of plant resources 5 conclusions future developments the mechanistic model based on deb theory developed here can be used to understand life history processes of large mammals at the individual level and how they can be influenced by environmental factors such as seasonal food availability and acquisition this work is a critical step to understanding the bioenergetics of arctic mammals in general opening up several future applications and model developments as well as highlighting data deficient life history stages improvement of deb parameter value estimates and thus energetics requires additional experimental data for instance on food intake assimilation rates and efficiencies seasonal basal and field metabolic rates and lactation in wild animals linking the model more tightly to external forcing variables such as temperature and plant biomass will thereby further improve our understanding of what is driving population differences in observable life history traits such a framework is perfectly suited to extrapolate individual level processes to the population scale this was not done explicitly here so as to focus on the energetics moreover our deb ibm can be applied to different wild muskox populations or re parameterized to study bioenergetics of other arctic mammals lastly we believe there is a great need to integrate wildlife monitoring data such as satellite telemetry and various bio logging applications with ecological models such as ours novel high resolution bio logging devices enable direct measurements or indirect quantification of energetic expenditure in wild moving individuals across a wide range of environmental conditions coupling these energetic measures to deb models will make it possible to explore and test life history decision making through different scenarios indeed recent papers have presented exciting empirical and theoretical frameworks to incorporate habitat use movement and decision making within energy based ibms boult et al 2018 campos candela et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 pirotta et al 2018 we therefore anticipate that deb ibms such as the one presented here can be used to integrate energetics and movement ecology in order to include the vast information available from

25069,spatially explicit individual based simulation models provide a valuable tool for exploring complex ecological and evolutionary processes that are not easily empirically measured here we present modifications of a spatially explicit individual based simulation model cdmetapop to accommodate a two species system and simulations involving interspecific hybridization we first describe how a hybrid h index is used to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species user defined thresholds provide flexibility in the degree of admixture tolerated for classifying pure individuals we then detail relationships further informed by the h index including individual growth temperature based fitness and selection and mate preference behavior empirically derived species and system specific information can be incorporated into these relationships for example to produce differential growth among hybrids and parental species lastly we demonstrate an application of this simulation framework by exploring the relative effects of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the rate and spatial extent of sympatric hybridization between two native riverine fish species bull trout salvelinus confluentus and dolly varden salvelinus malma in the upper skagit river system united states and canada results from this demonstration provide guidance for future empirical studies of bull trout a federally threatened species understanding factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of hybridization as well as the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon is of increasing importance given shifting species ranges due to large scale landscape modification and a changing global climate our framework can be used to study a wide range of hybridization dynamics in any terrestrial or aquatic system including comparisons of distinct environmental conditions or potential management responses keywords hybridization ibm simulation landscape riverscape eco evolutionary 1 introduction anthropogenically influenced hybridization between closely related native species or between native and introduced species can result in irreversible ecological and evolutionary eco evolutionary consequences that pose a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide rhymer and simberloff 1996 todesco et al 2016 these consequences range from genetic homogenization mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden et al 2004 to parental reinforcement servedio and noor 2003 mallet 2005 and in extreme cases local or global extinction of native species can occur levin et al 1996 todesco et al 2016 spatial distributions of species are increasingly altered by processes including large scale landscape modification and global climate change providing new opportunities for hybridization between previously isolated species effective mitigation of such hybridization threats requires a better understanding of factors influencing hybridization dynamics allendorf et al 2001 seehausen et al 2008 hoffmann and sgrò 2011 evolutionary processes demographic characteristics and landscape features collectively influence hybridization dynamics among species but the interactive effects of these factors on the initiation persistence and outcomes of hybridization are poorly understood identifying mechanisms underlying these processes and their relative influence will not only improve our understanding of the evolutionary role of hybridization e g barton 2001 but also provide practical guidance for mitigating negative impacts on native species wood et al 2015 samson et al 2017 boyd et al 2018 for example understanding the relative fitness of hybrids under distinct environmental conditions can provide insights into the expected rate and extent of adaptive introgression barrett and schluter 2008 hedrick 2013 and the likely spatiotemporal stability of a hybrid zone buggs 2007 taylor et al 2015 however empirical assessment of both the drivers and consequences of interspecific hybridization is often impracticable and in such instances complex eco evolutionary relationships may best be explored through simulation in recent years spatially explicit individual based models ibms have become valuable tools for simulating dynamic eco evolutionary relationships due to the increasing ability of these models to represent detailed demographic and genetic demogenetic processes deangelis and grimm 2014 ibms can account for inter individual variation i e age size maturity essential for understanding complex relationships across ecological scales deangelis and gross 1992 grimm 1999 deangelis and mooij 2005 simulations of interspecific hybridization under contemporary and future conditions can help improve our theoretical understanding of the drivers and consequences of hybridization mclane et al 2011 grimm et al 2017 additionally ibms can be parameterized to facilitate empirical evaluations that provide practical guidance for conservation and management recent studies have demonstrated eco evolutionary applications of ibms in terrestrial and aquatic systems frank et al 2011 munroe et al 2012 landguth et al 2014 2017a selkoe et al 2016 however the utility of these models in improving our understanding of mechanisms contributing to interspecific hybridization and in predicting the fate of evolutionary lineages remains largely unexplored in part due to the inability of ibms to incorporate multiple species specific parameterizations in heterogeneous landscapes but see della croce et al 2014 here we extend a previously existing spatially explicit demogenetic ibm cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b to provide a framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species we first describe the use of a hybrid h index campton and utter 1985 buerkle 2005 to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species we then detail relationships further informed by the h index including individual growth temperature based fitness and selection and mate preference behavior we also discuss how species and system specific information can be used to apply this framework to a broad range of taxa and ecological systems and the use of sensitivity analyses to guide future research in systems with high uncertainty finally we demonstrate an application of our framework by evaluating sympatric hybridization dynamics for two native riverine fish species bull trout salvelinus confluentus and dolly varden salvelinus malma in a portion of the skagit river extending through washington united states and lower british columbia canada the skagit river serves as one of a few population strongholds for bull trout united states fish and wildlife service 2015 a species listed as threatened in the united states and of special concern in canada cosewic 2010 united states fish and wildlife service 2015 sympatric hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden was recently genetically confirmed in some portions of the skagit river small et al 2015 therefore posing a concern for bull trout conservation in this region mechanisms facilitating hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden are presently unknown and simulations provide a valuable approach for guiding future empirical research efforts specific objectives of this study were to 1 implement an h index relationship in cdmetapop to facilitate the distinction of individuals representing two parental species and their hybrids 2 extend biological and demographic parameters in cdmetapop to accommodate species specific values and 3 demonstrate an application of the modified cdmetapop framework by exploring the relative influence of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the abundance and spatial distribution of bull trout dolly varden hybrids in the skagit river 2 methods 2 1 simulation model briefly cdmetapop is a landscape level individual based demogenetic model of meta population processes these processes are simulated as interactions among individuals located across a number of spatially explicit patches comprising meta populations each patch is designated as either a natal i e spawning or migratory i e over wintering non spawning patch individuals within a patch are assumed to share a common environment e g carrying capacity temperature within each patch a length and age based class structure is used to simulate complex stochastic demogenetic processes while movement of individuals i e migration straying among patches occurs as a function of spatially explicit landscape permeability surfaces appendices 1 2 and 3 at the patch level individuals undergo growth reproduction migration and mortality and resulting demographic and genetic processes are simulated over time at the individual level below we highlight novel relationships implemented in cdmetapop v1 10 as part of our framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics detailed descriptions of processes simulated by cdmetapop can be found in landguth et al 2017b the user manual https github com computationalecologylab cdmetapop and online appendices of this manuscript 2 2 modification of cdmetapop to evaluate hybridization dynamics modifications to the existing cdmetapop framework included implementation of an h index to represent individual based admixture modification of input file capabilities to allow the specification of biological parameters for two parental species and incorporation of biological relationships informed by h index the h index informed biological relationships are used to specify individual growth temperature based selection and fitness and mate preference behavior each of these relationships are described in detail below 2 2 1 identification of parental species and hybrids an h index was used to reflect the genetic composition of individuals and to distinguish individuals of either pure parental species from those of interspecific descent genotypes for the two parental species are assigned values at opposite ends of a bounded numerical spectrum such that the h index for all individuals range from zero to one within the model users can specify minimum and maximum admixture thresholds for distinguishing parental species some applications may prefer strict cutoffs of 0 h index 1 to distinguish hybrids from pure parental species though defining ecologically appropriate admixture thresholds for conservation purposes can be challenging and context specific allendorf et al 2001 we therefore implemented the h index relationship in a manner that allows users flexibility in the specification of admixture thresholds eggs are assigned an h index intermediate to the h indices of the parents parental h indices are also used to assign class characteristics e g age and size class migration and stray probabilities to offspring appendix 1 table s1 this assignment is based on a weighted random draw such that an individual with h index 0 50 is more likely to be assigned the class characteristics of parental species a and an individual with h index 0 50 is more likely to be assigned the class characteristics of parental species b individual h indices are then used to specify species specific demographic parameters such as growth fitness and mate preferences 2 2 2 individual growth individual growth in cdmetapop is divided between two user specified time steps spawning and non spawning we implemented a new module temperature and statistical fitting for growth with h index see cdmetapop user manual for controlling growth based on the h index and class characteristics of an individual this module uses spatially explicit temperature values at each patch to determine growth for each individual and requires three user specified elements von bertalanffy growth parameters von bertalanffy 1938 a temperature growth response curve and the number of days during which individuals are exposed to patch specific temperatures for growth see cdmetapop user manual we used a linear relationship eq 1 to modify the l parameter and incorporate the h index of an individual 1 l h index l b l a l a where l a and l b correspond with the l for individuals of parental species a lower h index and parental species b higher h index respectively 2 2 3 temperature based selection and fitness we modified the cdmetapop framework to enable temperature based selection through two processes 1 parental species thermal tolerances wherein we assumed that optimal fitness coincided with user specified species specific temperature optima and 2 hybrid fitness relative to either parental species we used the h index of a given individual to identify the optimal temperature for that individual we then implemented a linear relationship to associate individual h index with the mean of species specific gaussian distributions centered at the temperature optima specified for parental species a and b the degree of overlap in the range of fitness values for parental species a and b was controlled by the standard deviation parameter of the gaussian distribution where a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower fitness range and stronger selection a hybrid fitness parameter was used to control the fitness of hybrids relative to either parental species thus overall fitness was defined by a gaussian function of natal patch temperature and by the h index of an individual as described in eq 2 2 fitness p exp xj mintemp maxtemp mintemp h index 2 2 c 2 where p is the fitness of hybrids relative to parental species x is the temperature at patch j mintemp is the optimal temperature of the parental species associated with the lower temperature optimum maxtemp is the optimal temperature of the parental species associated with a higher temperature optimum and c is the standard deviation controlling the degree of overlap between parental species fitness values values for mintemp and maxtemp represent empirically determined temperatures corresponding with optimal body growth in each parental species 2 2 4 reproduction and mate preference behavior three distinct mate preference behaviors are now possible in the modified cdmetapop mate module which allows users to explore a wide range of dual species applications in all cases mate selection operates by females selecting a male within the spatial range specified by the mating cost distance matrix appendix 3 one mate preference behavior option implements random mating wherein there is no mate preference between species hereafter random mating a second option restricts mating to intraspecific pairs where mates must be of the same parental species in order to mate hereafter intraspecific mating this second option has a strict threshold as distinguished by individual h indices see section 2 2 1 that only allows mating to occur between pairs of the same species hybrids will therefore not occur and this scenario would only be useful for null models or other non hybridization based questions a third option facilitates mating such that individuals prefer but are not restricted to mates of the same species hereafter self preference mating in the third option the degree of mate preference ϕi j is determined using a linear model m gonigle and fitzjohn 2010 modified to incorporate the h indices of each potential mate pair as described in eq 3 3 ϕi j 1 1 abs female h index male h index assortative mate factor 1 fj where fj denotes the frequency of h indices binned at intervals of 0 10 in the patch of the female the assortative mate factor determines the strength of assortative mating and ranges from one to infinity where a larger value corresponds with stronger self preference under this linear preference assortative mating model mate selection occurs with a higher probability given greater similarity of h indices between a female and potential mate however hybridization is still possible with high assortative mate factor values if no optimal mate pair exists within a given patch see discussion this mate preference behavior option therefore does not restrict mating to intraspecific mate pairs importantly regardless of the mate preference behavior implemented in a simulation scenario mating is primarily restricted to individuals present within the female s patch at the onset of the mating module 2 3 demonstration of hybridization framework to demonstrate an application of the cdmetapop modifications described above we evaluated hybridization dynamics between two native salmonids bull trout bt and dolly varden dv in the upper skagit river specifically we used our simulation framework to explore the effects of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the spatiotemporal abundance and distribution of bt dv hybrids table 1 this application of our framework required the parameterization of several relationships to describe inter and intraspecific demogenetic processes these parameters are described in appendices 1 2 and 3 we expected our simulation framework to show greater spatial overlap between mature bt and dv in tributaries where water temperatures were intermediate to temperature optima for both species and in instances where temperature based selection was weak however spatial overlap does not necessarily result in interbreeding robbins et al 2014 and we also evaluated the effect of distinct mate preference behaviors we anticipated that reduced preference for mates of the same species would increase the rate of hybridization finally hybrid fitness is a strong determinant of short and long term impacts of hybridization including the fate of either parental species burke and arnold 2001 seehausen 2004 the relative fitness of bt dv hybrids has not been empirically studied so we used a range of values to evaluate model sensitivity to the fitness parameter table 1 we evaluated simulation scenarios with and without a hybrid fitness penalty and expected that reduced hybrid fitness would result in a decreased rate of hybridization and increased persistence of parental species though the anticipated outcomes of our hypotheses appear intuitive exploring contemporaneous interactions of these variables temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness in the context of a heterogeneous environment provides a worthwhile investigation of the relative effect of each factor on the dynamics of hybridizing species 2 3 1 study system and temperature model the spatial extent of our study system was constrained to a segment of the upper skagit river north of gorge dam and extending from washington united states to lower british columbia canada fig 1 this extent contained 286 patch locations spatially delineated based on stream segment catchment areas defined using archydro tools 10 2 esri redlands california three dammed reservoirs were included in the study system gorge lake diablo lake and ross lake fig 1 downstream migrations of bull trout through these dams are rarely observed e connor personal observation and dams were therefore considered complete barriers to movement for the purposes of this demonstration patches were designated as either natal n 275 mean area 4 11 ha 0 04 28 77 or non spawning n 11 mean area 743 66 ha 0 49 4734 82 habitats based on stream temperature and modified based on available biological information both bt and dv were allowed to spawn in each natal patch however the spatial distribution of both species was influenced by temperature based selection patch carrying capacity was determined by habitat area in each patch with a density of one individual per 100 m2 of stream surface area this density is consistent with that observed in surveys of tributaries in the upper skagit river e connor unpublished data and is also within the range of other values reported from the region mcphail and baxter 1996 stream surface area was calculated for each patch as the product of stream segment length and estimated bankfull width inferred using pacific northwest regional hydraulic geometry equations developed by castro and jackson 2001 given a lack of in situ temperature data for the full extent of our study system we predicted stream temperature from air temperature using the methodology described in arismendi et al 2014 air temperature is often used as a proxy for stream temperature when in situ temperature data are unavailable and prohibit the use of other methods stefan and preud homme 1993 mean monthly air temperature was calculated as the average of 30 arc second maximum and minimum air temperature data from worldclim bioclim hijmans et al 2005 detailed data required for the calculation of median monthly air temperature are not available through this database predicted stream temperature was averaged across the months included in the two time periods specified in our model spawning august 1 october 15 fig 1 and non spawning october 16 july 31 appendix 4 fig s2 2 3 2 species specific parameters we designated parental species a h index 0 0 0 1 as dv and parental species b h index 0 9 1 0 as bt we chose admixture thresholds 0 1 0 9 based on those commonly used to identify hybrids with genetic data vähä and primmer 2006 harbicht et al 2014 and values used to classify salmonid populations for conservation purposes e g shepard et al 2005 values for species specific parameters were based on empirically determined values appendix 1 table s1 but supplemented with information from local experts when empirical values were lacking briefly we initialized the model at time 0 with a random distribution of individuals characterized by an equal sex ratio and comprising eight age classes ages 0 7 for each parental species each age class was assigned a species specific mean length and standard deviation appendix 1 table s1 triton environmental consultants 2008 bowerman 2013 mims et al 2019 size linked parameters vary as individuals grow and enter subsequent size classes for both bt and dv the probability of migration increased with size with a maximum probability of 0 572 associated with the largest size classes appendix 1 table s1 mims et al 2019 due to unknown straying rates for bt and dv a stray probability of 0 01 was used for all size classes for both species relationships describing individual maturity and fecundity were informed by individual length and therefore differed between species appendices 1 and 2 we used an independent mortality of 60 to determine survival of eggs to fingerlings mims et al 2019 to inform temperature based relationships for growth fitness and selection we used optimal temperatures of 10 5 c and 8 5 c for bt and dv respectively appendix 1 table s1 appendix 5 fig s3 this optimal temperature value is lower than those reported in laboratory studies of bull trout 13 c selong et al 2001 16 c mesa et al 2013 but similar to those reported in an empirical study of bull trout in the upper skagit river 10 9 15 4 c eckmann et al 2016 furthermore dunham et al 2003 reported maximum densities of juvenile bull trout in streams with maximum temperatures of approximately 10 c the optimal temperatures specified for bt and dv in this study also fit the range of temperatures observed in our stream temperature model and reflect the colder waters preferred by dv relative to bt to inform the growth of bt and dv we used parameters from von bertalanffy bowerman 2013 and temperature growth selong et al 2001 relationships previously developed for bt except l was derived from empirical observations of bt and dv in the upper skagit river system e connor unpublished data in skagit river populations of bt and dv adult bt are considerably larger than adult dv and may reach lengths of 700 mm and 300 mm respectively with hybrid individuals reaching intermediate sizes e connor unpublished data for the growth model described in eq 1 differential sizes of bt dv and hybrid individuals were achieved by scaling l to an individual s h index while using the same temperature growth response curve for both parental species in reality the growth of an individual is likely influenced by the biologically inherent l of a species as well as ambient temperatures thus our skagit specific values of l used for bt and dv and the stream temperatures used in our study combine to achieve individual sizes that match empirical observations this strategy provides a direct mechanism for creating differential growth between our study species and is suitable for a modelling framework designed to explore interspecific hybridization in a variety of systems 2 3 3 simulation scenarios we performed model sensitivity analysis by conducting a factorial design simulation experiment to explore how variation in temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness affect the rate and spatial extent of hybridization and abundance of hybrid and parental individuals table 1 we evaluated two temperature based selection scenarios wherein selection strength was either low c 1 5 eq 2 or high c 1 0 we also evaluated three mate preference behaviors 1 random mating wherein no mate preference occurs 2 intraspecific mating wherein mating is only possible within species and 3 self preference wherein individuals strongly prefer but are not restricted to mates of the same species for scenarios with self preference mating behavior we set the assortative mate factor to 1010 to produce strong mate preference with this parameterization and given an even proportion of bt and dv in a patch the probability of a female selecting a mate of the same species was 99 9 finally we explored hybrid fitness relative to either parental species using three hybrid fitness levels 100 i e no fitness penalty 75 and 50 we assessed 17 distinct scenarios table 1 with ten independent monte carlo replicates for each scenario resulting in 170 total simulations the first scenario in table 1 represents the null model evaluated in this study wherein temperature based selection was not implemented and interspecific hybridization was not allowed this null model provided a baseline for comparison to all other scenarios in which different combinations of temperature based selection and various mate behaviors were implemented each simulation scenario was run for a total of 280 iterations hereafter referred to as years representing approximately 56 generations of bt and dv based on an average generation time of five years scott and crossman 1973 rieman and mcintyre 1993 rieman and allendorf 2001 cosewic 2010 the first 50 years of a simulation comprised a population dynamics burn in to stabilize age distributions the temperature based selection regime was implemented at year 50 following demographic stabilization and mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness regimes were implemented at year 80 when models again reached stabilization simulations then continued for an additional 200 years the timing and description of processes that occur within a single iteration of the model are shown in appendix 1 fig s1 all simulations were performed on a dell linux cluster with centos 6 3 operating system 16x quad core 2 5 ghz processors with 512 gb ram at the university of connecticut s computational biology core facility 2 3 4 analysis of simulation outputs several individual based and summary statistics can be output from cdmetapop including statistics that describe both demographic and genetic relationships see cdmetapop user manual we used two methods to analyze simulation results from individual based comma separated outputs first species counts were summed across all patches at ten year intervals over the duration of the simulation for simplification of output visualizations we only present counts of parental and hybrid individuals 0 1 h index 0 9 averaged over ten monte carlo replicates though individual h indices could also be used to evaluate the degree of admixture over the same population e g f1 hybrid vs f2 backcross second patches containing both species were summed in each year to determine the degree of spatial overlap between bt and dv across our scenarios for both analyses we determined statistical significance based on confidence intervals calculated using mean 1 96 standard error and plotted figures in r version 3 2 3 r development core team 2017 3 results 3 1 model development we successfully integrated novel relationships into the existing cdmetapop framework that now facilitate multi species parameterizations for the study of hybridization dynamics fig 2 the overall workflow of this new framework appendix 1 fig s1 proceeds similarly to the original implementation of cdmetapop however species specific relationships for individual growth environmental fitness and selection and mate preference are now possible based on the use of an h index to represent the degree of individual admixture fig 2 implementation of an h index allows hybridization to be spatiotemporally evaluated across a study system in our demonstration of these new capabilities varying species specific parameters resulted in unique demographic outcomes and spatial distributions at multiple time points illustrating that our framework can be used to assess the impact of evolutionary processes demographic characteristics and landscape features on hybridization dynamics 3 2 demonstration of hybridization framework 3 2 1 null model our null model was characterized by intraspecific mating and a lack of temperature based selection and resulted in a system with slightly higher abundance of dv relative to bt mean dv 31 150 28 185 34 115 individuals mean bt 23 240 22 329 24 152 individuals fig 3 a this outcome likely resulted from the smaller body size of dv and the size based patch packing algorithm implemented in cdmetapop see cdmetapop user manual both bt and dv were randomly distributed across the study system due to a lack of temperature based selection results not shown 3 2 2 temperature based selection temperature based selection affected the initial spatial distribution of bt and dv in which patches hybridization initially occurred and the rate at which hybrids dominated the system in scenarios with intraspecific mating the strength of temperature based selection high or low determined the extent of spatial overlap between bt and dv across simulation scenarios dv were primarily distributed in headwater tributaries of the study system and bt were primarily distributed in downstream river segments by the end of the simulated time period appendix 6 fig s4 an average of 58 50 patches se 9 22 20 56 of patches contained both species in the low selection scenario and an average of 9 9 patches se 2 79 3 46 of patches contained both species in the high selection scenario similarly temperature based selection influenced the initial spatial distribution of hybrids and parental species appendix 7 fig s5 in scenarios with high temperature based selection hybrids primarily initiated in headwaters of the system appendix 8 fig s6 in comparison hybrids initiated in patches throughout the system in scenarios with low temperature based selection temperature also influenced the rate at which hybrids appeared in the system for example in scenarios with random mating and intermediate hybrid fitness approximately three times more hybrids were present at year 150 in the low temperature based selection scenario mean 30 015 22 320 37 709 individuals relative to the high temperature based selection scenario mean 8 725 4 490 12 961 individuals fig 4 c and 4d 3 2 3 mate preference behavior with the exception of the intraspecific mating scenario mate preference behavior did not have a strong effect on the abundance of hybrids figs 3 5 scenarios with medium or high hybrid fitness and either random or self preference mating all resulted in systems dominated by hybrids at the end of the simulated time period at a similar rate fig 4 and 5 mate preference behavior also did not influence the initial locations or the final spatial distributions of hybrids results from scenarios with self preference mating were similar to those for scenarios with random mating 3 2 4 hybrid fitness of the three parameters evaluated in this demonstration hybrid fitness had the greatest influence on the abundance of hybrids present at the end of simulations reduced hybrid fitness resulted in an overall decreased abundance of hybrids and increased abundance of both parental species figs 4 and 5 this trend was consistent across scenarios incorporating varying degrees of temperature based selection and mate preference behaviors in simulation scenarios characterized by random mating and low temperature based selection the number of patches containing bt increased from 6 2 se 2 16 2 2 of patches to 58 7 se 16 52 20 5 of patches to 200 8 se 3 77 70 0 of patches and the number of patches containing dv changed from 0 4 se 0 4 0 1 of patches to 0 3 se 0 3 0 1 of patches to 11 4 se 5 64 4 0 of patches for scenarios with hybrid fitness equal to 100 75 or 50 of parental fitness respectively fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics we successfully extended a previously existing demogenetic simulation model cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b to provide a framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species specifically we added capabilities for 1 distinguishing parental and hybrid individuals based on degree of individual admixture 2 producing species specific and individual based growth 3 implementing species specific and individual based temperature related selection including the option for an individual based fitness penalty and 4 generating distinct mate preference behaviors species and system specific information can be incorporated into this framework to enable its application to any ecological system though other ibms have been developed for simulating hybridization dynamics to our knowledge our framework is the first to incorporate detailed i e more realistic landscape and demographic features early ibms for evaluating hybridization implemented one dimensional grid systems e g cain et al 1999 and were limited in their ability to represent complex spatial and demographic features sadedin and littlejohn 2003 developed an ibm for evaluating species reinforcement that allows users to vary characteristics such as hybrid disadvantage and mate preference behavior however this ibm comprises individuals dispersed across a simple two dimensional grid and does not account for spatial heterogeneity in landscape features and individual movement nor does it incorporate population or species specific demographic characteristics among other limitations these limitations also correspond with an ibm developed by thibert plante and hendry 2009 to assess hybridization dynamics in the context of ecological speciation more recently della croce et al 2014 developed an ibm to assess hybridization between riverine species however this model does not incorporate relationships for species specific biological characteristics and riverscape heterogeneity is restricted to variation in simple stream network topologies 4 2 bt dv hybridization in the skagit river in the demonstration of our hybridization framework we observed several relationships between bull trout and dolly varden that could help guide future empirical evaluations of these species in particular we found that temperature based selection greatly influenced the initiation of hybridization the distributional range of bull trout is largely parapatric with dolly varden salvelinus malma however a number of contact zones where these species occur in sympatry have been identified cavender 1978 haas and mcphail 1991 mcphail and taylor 1995 leary and allendorf 1997 taylor et al 2001 hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden in areas of sympatry has been genetically confirmed for a number of these contact zones baxter et al 1997 taylor et al 2001 though the rate of hybridization varies among watersheds taylor et al 2001 previous studies of species biology and ecology suggest that hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden may be more likely when size dependent differences in spawning behavior and habitat choice are less pronounced mcphail and taylor 1995 hagen 2000 dunham et al 2008 for example in regions where dolly varden and bull trout occur in sympatry dolly varden typically use spawning habitat characterized by cooler water temperatures relative to bull trout hagen and taylor 2001 however hybridization is possible in tributaries where the thermal regime facilitates the presence of both species our simulations also demonstrated that the number of hybrids present at the end of simulations was most strongly affected by hybrid fitness empirical studies of temperature based selection and the relative fitness of hybrids are currently lacking for bull trout and dolly varden but results from studies of other salmonids demonstrate the importance of hybrid fitness to the long term persistence of parental species ostberg et al 2004 observed that hybrids of sympatric coastal rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss irideus and coastal cutthroat trout o clarki clarki display reduced fitness in parental habitats facilitating the maintenance of parental species in comparison even low levels of admixture in westslope cutthroat trout o clarkia lewisi due to hybridization with invasive rainbow trout o mykiss correspond with marked reductions in reproductive success muhlfeld et al 2009 empirical studies of hybrid fitness and the stability of this relationship across environmental gradients would significantly improve our understanding of the impacts of sympatric hybridization on the evolutionary trajectories of bull trout and dolly varden in the skagit river such studies are essential given that the skagit river serves as one of a small number of population strongholds for bull trout united states fish and wildlife service 2015 and resulting information could directly inform management and conservation policies although we were able to draw from a moderate body of literature to populate our simulation model empirical data were not available for every parameter future users of cdmetapop may be faced with similar challenges when focusing on less studied species in our demonstration we showed how simulations can be used to evaluate relative sensitivity to model parameterizations in instances where empirical values are lacking however model validation can be challenging and often not feasible due to the large spatial scale and complexity of demographic and genetic processes hypothesis based comparisons of competing model scenarios may be possible in cases where extensive empirical data exist for example by using additional approaches to estimate parameters e g approximate bayesian computation abc beaumont et al 2002 in comparison to simulation outputs in the case of our application minimal empirical data were available for validating model outputs hybridization was only recently documented between bull trout and dolly varden in the skagit river system small et al 2015 and little biological information is known about the hybrid individuals however as demonstrated by our example application simulations can still be a useful tool for identifying patterns to guide future empirical studies and to assist resource managers in the prioritization of conservation goals 4 3 conservation applications our simulation framework can be easily adapted to explore hybridization dynamics in any heterogeneous ecological system in particular evaluating the relative importance of hybrid fitness across systems would provide additional insights into the broader biological significance of this relationship for example whether ecological segregation is a factor influencing hybridization dynamics for invasive rainbow trout and native westslope cutthroat trout has recently been the subject of considerable debate kovach et al 2017 young et al 2017 parameterization of our simulation framework with available species and system specific information would provide the opportunity to determine the relative effects of habitat preference physiological differences landscape variables and other factors influencing the complex interspecific hybridization dynamics in fish scribner et al 2001 or other taxonomic groups see mallet 2005 and references within the influence of climate change on hybridization dynamics is of particular concern for long term conservation purposes muhlfeld et al 2014 2017 the modelling framework presented here is useful for exploring the effects of altered environmental conditions such as increased average temperature as a result of global climate change on hybridization dynamics particularly for cold water lotic systems which are likely to experience heterogeneous responses to a changing climate due to spatially distributed groundwater fluxes snyder et al 2015 applications of ibm frameworks could help forecast future effects of climate change for sympatric bull trout and dolly varden such an investigation may initially result in increased spatial partitioning of species specific spawning habitat but an increase in temperature beyond the thermal tolerance of either species could have serious long term consequences for these cold water fishes similarly our modelling framework does not presently account for the capacity of parental species to adapt to such selective pressures studies on the possible evolutionary responses of salmonid species to climate change are challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between plastic and genetic based phenotypic traits and determining whether an observed phenotypic change is a direct adaptive response to climate change crozier et al 2008 merilä and hendry 2014 a small number of empirical studies suggest that salmonids have some potential to adapt to an altered thermal regime jensen et al 2008 modification of our simulation framework to evaluate adaptive capacity funk et al 2018 would provide a valuable means for exploring the potential effects of climate change on hybridization dynamics in freshwater systems other potential applications of our simulation framework center on predicting the effects of a broad range of management and conservation actions for example our demonstration identified spatial areas especially prone to the development of interspecific contact zones these zones could be targeted for monitoring to prevent interactions between parental species such applications are particularly useful for species that have a conservation emphasis such as the critically endangered red wolf canis rufus which is known to hybridize with coyotes c latrans bohling et al 2016 additionally our simulation framework could be used to predict the effect of barrier implementation or removal on dynamics between potentially or currently hybridizing species to inform targeted management decisions e g novinger and rahel 2003 the effects of local land use practices can also be simulated by varying environmental variables such as water flow or deforestation additionally our framework can be used to explore the consequences of genetic rescue in inbred populations frankham 2015 whiteley et al 2015 or to investigate the outcomes of recently debated actions such as intentional hybridization to promote climate adaptation hamilton and miller 2016 kovach et al 2016 4 4 model limitations a necessary future area of research is determining the biological relevance of the h index thresholds used in this study to distinguish hybrids from individuals of either parental species admixture thresholds appropriate for wild populations is a persistent and challenging issue further complicated by the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype vonholdt et al 2017 in this study we used admixture thresholds reported in genetic studies focused on distinguishing hybrids in wild populations shepard et al 2005 vähä and primmer 2006 harbicht et al 2014 however from a conservation perspective deciding the degree of admixture that influences management decisions is complex and context specific allendorf et al 2001 future studies that explore the biological significance of admixture thresholds would provide useful insights for investigations of hybridization dynamics using tools such as our modelling framework future simulation work is also necessary to assess the impact of the cdmetapop mate selection algorithm on simulation results in the demonstration of our simulation framework we observed high abundances of hybrids regardless of whether mating was random or with strong preference for mates of the same species for scenarios where self preference mating is implemented mate choice is based on female preference for males within the same natal patch and that have a similar h index this relationship assumes that mate pairs are more likely to comprise individuals of similar genotype e g h index and that genotype is an accurate reflection of phenotype the primary informant of mate preference in nature in our simulations we restricted mate selection to within patch mating and instances where only less suitable males are present i e h indices between female and male are very different still resulted in the formation of a mate pair in reality individuals are likely to make movements to find preferred mates but how individuals select mates along a spectrum of h indices and phenotypes is unknown future applications of our hybridization framework could permit the movement of individuals to neighboring natal patches in instances where mates with preferable h indices are not present in the current patch and could also explore the relative spawning success of such straying individuals 4 5 conclusions the primary goal of this study was to develop a simulation framework useful for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species in a heterogeneous system we accomplished this goal by modifying a previously existing ibm cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b and by demonstrating a system specific application of this framework such applications of spatially explicit ibms are increasingly important for forecasting the effects of large scale processes such as a changing global climate on species distributions and interactions additionally spatially explicit ibms are useful for predicting the effects of a broad range of potential management and conservation actions the adaptability of our framework to species and system specific characteristics makes it a valuable tool for simulation based explorations of hybridization dynamics and resulting eco evolutionary impacts

25069,spatially explicit individual based simulation models provide a valuable tool for exploring complex ecological and evolutionary processes that are not easily empirically measured here we present modifications of a spatially explicit individual based simulation model cdmetapop to accommodate a two species system and simulations involving interspecific hybridization we first describe how a hybrid h index is used to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species user defined thresholds provide flexibility in the degree of admixture tolerated for classifying pure individuals we then detail relationships further informed by the h index including individual growth temperature based fitness and selection and mate preference behavior empirically derived species and system specific information can be incorporated into these relationships for example to produce differential growth among hybrids and parental species lastly we demonstrate an application of this simulation framework by exploring the relative effects of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the rate and spatial extent of sympatric hybridization between two native riverine fish species bull trout salvelinus confluentus and dolly varden salvelinus malma in the upper skagit river system united states and canada results from this demonstration provide guidance for future empirical studies of bull trout a federally threatened species understanding factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of hybridization as well as the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon is of increasing importance given shifting species ranges due to large scale landscape modification and a changing global climate our framework can be used to study a wide range of hybridization dynamics in any terrestrial or aquatic system including comparisons of distinct environmental conditions or potential management responses keywords hybridization ibm simulation landscape riverscape eco evolutionary 1 introduction anthropogenically influenced hybridization between closely related native species or between native and introduced species can result in irreversible ecological and evolutionary eco evolutionary consequences that pose a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide rhymer and simberloff 1996 todesco et al 2016 these consequences range from genetic homogenization mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden et al 2004 to parental reinforcement servedio and noor 2003 mallet 2005 and in extreme cases local or global extinction of native species can occur levin et al 1996 todesco et al 2016 spatial distributions of species are increasingly altered by processes including large scale landscape modification and global climate change providing new opportunities for hybridization between previously isolated species effective mitigation of such hybridization threats requires a better understanding of factors influencing hybridization dynamics allendorf et al 2001 seehausen et al 2008 hoffmann and sgrò 2011 evolutionary processes demographic characteristics and landscape features collectively influence hybridization dynamics among species but the interactive effects of these factors on the initiation persistence and outcomes of hybridization are poorly understood identifying mechanisms underlying these processes and their relative influence will not only improve our understanding of the evolutionary role of hybridization e g barton 2001 but also provide practical guidance for mitigating negative impacts on native species wood et al 2015 samson et al 2017 boyd et al 2018 for example understanding the relative fitness of hybrids under distinct environmental conditions can provide insights into the expected rate and extent of adaptive introgression barrett and schluter 2008 hedrick 2013 and the likely spatiotemporal stability of a hybrid zone buggs 2007 taylor et al 2015 however empirical assessment of both the drivers and consequences of interspecific hybridization is often impracticable and in such instances complex eco evolutionary relationships may best be explored through simulation in recent years spatially explicit individual based models ibms have become valuable tools for simulating dynamic eco evolutionary relationships due to the increasing ability of these models to represent detailed demographic and genetic demogenetic processes deangelis and grimm 2014 ibms can account for inter individual variation i e age size maturity essential for understanding complex relationships across ecological scales deangelis and gross 1992 grimm 1999 deangelis and mooij 2005 simulations of interspecific hybridization under contemporary and future conditions can help improve our theoretical understanding of the drivers and consequences of hybridization mclane et al 2011 grimm et al 2017 additionally ibms can be parameterized to facilitate empirical evaluations that provide practical guidance for conservation and management recent studies have demonstrated eco evolutionary applications of ibms in terrestrial and aquatic systems frank et al 2011 munroe et al 2012 landguth et al 2014 2017a selkoe et al 2016 however the utility of these models in improving our understanding of mechanisms contributing to interspecific hybridization and in predicting the fate of evolutionary lineages remains largely unexplored in part due to the inability of ibms to incorporate multiple species specific parameterizations in heterogeneous landscapes but see della croce et al 2014 here we extend a previously existing spatially explicit demogenetic ibm cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b to provide a framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species we first describe the use of a hybrid h index campton and utter 1985 buerkle 2005 to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species we then detail relationships further informed by the h index including individual growth temperature based fitness and selection and mate preference behavior we also discuss how species and system specific information can be used to apply this framework to a broad range of taxa and ecological systems and the use of sensitivity analyses to guide future research in systems with high uncertainty finally we demonstrate an application of our framework by evaluating sympatric hybridization dynamics for two native riverine fish species bull trout salvelinus confluentus and dolly varden salvelinus malma in a portion of the skagit river extending through washington united states and lower british columbia canada the skagit river serves as one of a few population strongholds for bull trout united states fish and wildlife service 2015 a species listed as threatened in the united states and of special concern in canada cosewic 2010 united states fish and wildlife service 2015 sympatric hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden was recently genetically confirmed in some portions of the skagit river small et al 2015 therefore posing a concern for bull trout conservation in this region mechanisms facilitating hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden are presently unknown and simulations provide a valuable approach for guiding future empirical research efforts specific objectives of this study were to 1 implement an h index relationship in cdmetapop to facilitate the distinction of individuals representing two parental species and their hybrids 2 extend biological and demographic parameters in cdmetapop to accommodate species specific values and 3 demonstrate an application of the modified cdmetapop framework by exploring the relative influence of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the abundance and spatial distribution of bull trout dolly varden hybrids in the skagit river 2 methods 2 1 simulation model briefly cdmetapop is a landscape level individual based demogenetic model of meta population processes these processes are simulated as interactions among individuals located across a number of spatially explicit patches comprising meta populations each patch is designated as either a natal i e spawning or migratory i e over wintering non spawning patch individuals within a patch are assumed to share a common environment e g carrying capacity temperature within each patch a length and age based class structure is used to simulate complex stochastic demogenetic processes while movement of individuals i e migration straying among patches occurs as a function of spatially explicit landscape permeability surfaces appendices 1 2 and 3 at the patch level individuals undergo growth reproduction migration and mortality and resulting demographic and genetic processes are simulated over time at the individual level below we highlight novel relationships implemented in cdmetapop v1 10 as part of our framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics detailed descriptions of processes simulated by cdmetapop can be found in landguth et al 2017b the user manual https github com computationalecologylab cdmetapop and online appendices of this manuscript 2 2 modification of cdmetapop to evaluate hybridization dynamics modifications to the existing cdmetapop framework included implementation of an h index to represent individual based admixture modification of input file capabilities to allow the specification of biological parameters for two parental species and incorporation of biological relationships informed by h index the h index informed biological relationships are used to specify individual growth temperature based selection and fitness and mate preference behavior each of these relationships are described in detail below 2 2 1 identification of parental species and hybrids an h index was used to reflect the genetic composition of individuals and to distinguish individuals of either pure parental species from those of interspecific descent genotypes for the two parental species are assigned values at opposite ends of a bounded numerical spectrum such that the h index for all individuals range from zero to one within the model users can specify minimum and maximum admixture thresholds for distinguishing parental species some applications may prefer strict cutoffs of 0 h index 1 to distinguish hybrids from pure parental species though defining ecologically appropriate admixture thresholds for conservation purposes can be challenging and context specific allendorf et al 2001 we therefore implemented the h index relationship in a manner that allows users flexibility in the specification of admixture thresholds eggs are assigned an h index intermediate to the h indices of the parents parental h indices are also used to assign class characteristics e g age and size class migration and stray probabilities to offspring appendix 1 table s1 this assignment is based on a weighted random draw such that an individual with h index 0 50 is more likely to be assigned the class characteristics of parental species a and an individual with h index 0 50 is more likely to be assigned the class characteristics of parental species b individual h indices are then used to specify species specific demographic parameters such as growth fitness and mate preferences 2 2 2 individual growth individual growth in cdmetapop is divided between two user specified time steps spawning and non spawning we implemented a new module temperature and statistical fitting for growth with h index see cdmetapop user manual for controlling growth based on the h index and class characteristics of an individual this module uses spatially explicit temperature values at each patch to determine growth for each individual and requires three user specified elements von bertalanffy growth parameters von bertalanffy 1938 a temperature growth response curve and the number of days during which individuals are exposed to patch specific temperatures for growth see cdmetapop user manual we used a linear relationship eq 1 to modify the l parameter and incorporate the h index of an individual 1 l h index l b l a l a where l a and l b correspond with the l for individuals of parental species a lower h index and parental species b higher h index respectively 2 2 3 temperature based selection and fitness we modified the cdmetapop framework to enable temperature based selection through two processes 1 parental species thermal tolerances wherein we assumed that optimal fitness coincided with user specified species specific temperature optima and 2 hybrid fitness relative to either parental species we used the h index of a given individual to identify the optimal temperature for that individual we then implemented a linear relationship to associate individual h index with the mean of species specific gaussian distributions centered at the temperature optima specified for parental species a and b the degree of overlap in the range of fitness values for parental species a and b was controlled by the standard deviation parameter of the gaussian distribution where a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower fitness range and stronger selection a hybrid fitness parameter was used to control the fitness of hybrids relative to either parental species thus overall fitness was defined by a gaussian function of natal patch temperature and by the h index of an individual as described in eq 2 2 fitness p exp xj mintemp maxtemp mintemp h index 2 2 c 2 where p is the fitness of hybrids relative to parental species x is the temperature at patch j mintemp is the optimal temperature of the parental species associated with the lower temperature optimum maxtemp is the optimal temperature of the parental species associated with a higher temperature optimum and c is the standard deviation controlling the degree of overlap between parental species fitness values values for mintemp and maxtemp represent empirically determined temperatures corresponding with optimal body growth in each parental species 2 2 4 reproduction and mate preference behavior three distinct mate preference behaviors are now possible in the modified cdmetapop mate module which allows users to explore a wide range of dual species applications in all cases mate selection operates by females selecting a male within the spatial range specified by the mating cost distance matrix appendix 3 one mate preference behavior option implements random mating wherein there is no mate preference between species hereafter random mating a second option restricts mating to intraspecific pairs where mates must be of the same parental species in order to mate hereafter intraspecific mating this second option has a strict threshold as distinguished by individual h indices see section 2 2 1 that only allows mating to occur between pairs of the same species hybrids will therefore not occur and this scenario would only be useful for null models or other non hybridization based questions a third option facilitates mating such that individuals prefer but are not restricted to mates of the same species hereafter self preference mating in the third option the degree of mate preference ϕi j is determined using a linear model m gonigle and fitzjohn 2010 modified to incorporate the h indices of each potential mate pair as described in eq 3 3 ϕi j 1 1 abs female h index male h index assortative mate factor 1 fj where fj denotes the frequency of h indices binned at intervals of 0 10 in the patch of the female the assortative mate factor determines the strength of assortative mating and ranges from one to infinity where a larger value corresponds with stronger self preference under this linear preference assortative mating model mate selection occurs with a higher probability given greater similarity of h indices between a female and potential mate however hybridization is still possible with high assortative mate factor values if no optimal mate pair exists within a given patch see discussion this mate preference behavior option therefore does not restrict mating to intraspecific mate pairs importantly regardless of the mate preference behavior implemented in a simulation scenario mating is primarily restricted to individuals present within the female s patch at the onset of the mating module 2 3 demonstration of hybridization framework to demonstrate an application of the cdmetapop modifications described above we evaluated hybridization dynamics between two native salmonids bull trout bt and dolly varden dv in the upper skagit river specifically we used our simulation framework to explore the effects of temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness on the spatiotemporal abundance and distribution of bt dv hybrids table 1 this application of our framework required the parameterization of several relationships to describe inter and intraspecific demogenetic processes these parameters are described in appendices 1 2 and 3 we expected our simulation framework to show greater spatial overlap between mature bt and dv in tributaries where water temperatures were intermediate to temperature optima for both species and in instances where temperature based selection was weak however spatial overlap does not necessarily result in interbreeding robbins et al 2014 and we also evaluated the effect of distinct mate preference behaviors we anticipated that reduced preference for mates of the same species would increase the rate of hybridization finally hybrid fitness is a strong determinant of short and long term impacts of hybridization including the fate of either parental species burke and arnold 2001 seehausen 2004 the relative fitness of bt dv hybrids has not been empirically studied so we used a range of values to evaluate model sensitivity to the fitness parameter table 1 we evaluated simulation scenarios with and without a hybrid fitness penalty and expected that reduced hybrid fitness would result in a decreased rate of hybridization and increased persistence of parental species though the anticipated outcomes of our hypotheses appear intuitive exploring contemporaneous interactions of these variables temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness in the context of a heterogeneous environment provides a worthwhile investigation of the relative effect of each factor on the dynamics of hybridizing species 2 3 1 study system and temperature model the spatial extent of our study system was constrained to a segment of the upper skagit river north of gorge dam and extending from washington united states to lower british columbia canada fig 1 this extent contained 286 patch locations spatially delineated based on stream segment catchment areas defined using archydro tools 10 2 esri redlands california three dammed reservoirs were included in the study system gorge lake diablo lake and ross lake fig 1 downstream migrations of bull trout through these dams are rarely observed e connor personal observation and dams were therefore considered complete barriers to movement for the purposes of this demonstration patches were designated as either natal n 275 mean area 4 11 ha 0 04 28 77 or non spawning n 11 mean area 743 66 ha 0 49 4734 82 habitats based on stream temperature and modified based on available biological information both bt and dv were allowed to spawn in each natal patch however the spatial distribution of both species was influenced by temperature based selection patch carrying capacity was determined by habitat area in each patch with a density of one individual per 100 m2 of stream surface area this density is consistent with that observed in surveys of tributaries in the upper skagit river e connor unpublished data and is also within the range of other values reported from the region mcphail and baxter 1996 stream surface area was calculated for each patch as the product of stream segment length and estimated bankfull width inferred using pacific northwest regional hydraulic geometry equations developed by castro and jackson 2001 given a lack of in situ temperature data for the full extent of our study system we predicted stream temperature from air temperature using the methodology described in arismendi et al 2014 air temperature is often used as a proxy for stream temperature when in situ temperature data are unavailable and prohibit the use of other methods stefan and preud homme 1993 mean monthly air temperature was calculated as the average of 30 arc second maximum and minimum air temperature data from worldclim bioclim hijmans et al 2005 detailed data required for the calculation of median monthly air temperature are not available through this database predicted stream temperature was averaged across the months included in the two time periods specified in our model spawning august 1 october 15 fig 1 and non spawning october 16 july 31 appendix 4 fig s2 2 3 2 species specific parameters we designated parental species a h index 0 0 0 1 as dv and parental species b h index 0 9 1 0 as bt we chose admixture thresholds 0 1 0 9 based on those commonly used to identify hybrids with genetic data vähä and primmer 2006 harbicht et al 2014 and values used to classify salmonid populations for conservation purposes e g shepard et al 2005 values for species specific parameters were based on empirically determined values appendix 1 table s1 but supplemented with information from local experts when empirical values were lacking briefly we initialized the model at time 0 with a random distribution of individuals characterized by an equal sex ratio and comprising eight age classes ages 0 7 for each parental species each age class was assigned a species specific mean length and standard deviation appendix 1 table s1 triton environmental consultants 2008 bowerman 2013 mims et al 2019 size linked parameters vary as individuals grow and enter subsequent size classes for both bt and dv the probability of migration increased with size with a maximum probability of 0 572 associated with the largest size classes appendix 1 table s1 mims et al 2019 due to unknown straying rates for bt and dv a stray probability of 0 01 was used for all size classes for both species relationships describing individual maturity and fecundity were informed by individual length and therefore differed between species appendices 1 and 2 we used an independent mortality of 60 to determine survival of eggs to fingerlings mims et al 2019 to inform temperature based relationships for growth fitness and selection we used optimal temperatures of 10 5 c and 8 5 c for bt and dv respectively appendix 1 table s1 appendix 5 fig s3 this optimal temperature value is lower than those reported in laboratory studies of bull trout 13 c selong et al 2001 16 c mesa et al 2013 but similar to those reported in an empirical study of bull trout in the upper skagit river 10 9 15 4 c eckmann et al 2016 furthermore dunham et al 2003 reported maximum densities of juvenile bull trout in streams with maximum temperatures of approximately 10 c the optimal temperatures specified for bt and dv in this study also fit the range of temperatures observed in our stream temperature model and reflect the colder waters preferred by dv relative to bt to inform the growth of bt and dv we used parameters from von bertalanffy bowerman 2013 and temperature growth selong et al 2001 relationships previously developed for bt except l was derived from empirical observations of bt and dv in the upper skagit river system e connor unpublished data in skagit river populations of bt and dv adult bt are considerably larger than adult dv and may reach lengths of 700 mm and 300 mm respectively with hybrid individuals reaching intermediate sizes e connor unpublished data for the growth model described in eq 1 differential sizes of bt dv and hybrid individuals were achieved by scaling l to an individual s h index while using the same temperature growth response curve for both parental species in reality the growth of an individual is likely influenced by the biologically inherent l of a species as well as ambient temperatures thus our skagit specific values of l used for bt and dv and the stream temperatures used in our study combine to achieve individual sizes that match empirical observations this strategy provides a direct mechanism for creating differential growth between our study species and is suitable for a modelling framework designed to explore interspecific hybridization in a variety of systems 2 3 3 simulation scenarios we performed model sensitivity analysis by conducting a factorial design simulation experiment to explore how variation in temperature based selection mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness affect the rate and spatial extent of hybridization and abundance of hybrid and parental individuals table 1 we evaluated two temperature based selection scenarios wherein selection strength was either low c 1 5 eq 2 or high c 1 0 we also evaluated three mate preference behaviors 1 random mating wherein no mate preference occurs 2 intraspecific mating wherein mating is only possible within species and 3 self preference wherein individuals strongly prefer but are not restricted to mates of the same species for scenarios with self preference mating behavior we set the assortative mate factor to 1010 to produce strong mate preference with this parameterization and given an even proportion of bt and dv in a patch the probability of a female selecting a mate of the same species was 99 9 finally we explored hybrid fitness relative to either parental species using three hybrid fitness levels 100 i e no fitness penalty 75 and 50 we assessed 17 distinct scenarios table 1 with ten independent monte carlo replicates for each scenario resulting in 170 total simulations the first scenario in table 1 represents the null model evaluated in this study wherein temperature based selection was not implemented and interspecific hybridization was not allowed this null model provided a baseline for comparison to all other scenarios in which different combinations of temperature based selection and various mate behaviors were implemented each simulation scenario was run for a total of 280 iterations hereafter referred to as years representing approximately 56 generations of bt and dv based on an average generation time of five years scott and crossman 1973 rieman and mcintyre 1993 rieman and allendorf 2001 cosewic 2010 the first 50 years of a simulation comprised a population dynamics burn in to stabilize age distributions the temperature based selection regime was implemented at year 50 following demographic stabilization and mate preference behavior and hybrid fitness regimes were implemented at year 80 when models again reached stabilization simulations then continued for an additional 200 years the timing and description of processes that occur within a single iteration of the model are shown in appendix 1 fig s1 all simulations were performed on a dell linux cluster with centos 6 3 operating system 16x quad core 2 5 ghz processors with 512 gb ram at the university of connecticut s computational biology core facility 2 3 4 analysis of simulation outputs several individual based and summary statistics can be output from cdmetapop including statistics that describe both demographic and genetic relationships see cdmetapop user manual we used two methods to analyze simulation results from individual based comma separated outputs first species counts were summed across all patches at ten year intervals over the duration of the simulation for simplification of output visualizations we only present counts of parental and hybrid individuals 0 1 h index 0 9 averaged over ten monte carlo replicates though individual h indices could also be used to evaluate the degree of admixture over the same population e g f1 hybrid vs f2 backcross second patches containing both species were summed in each year to determine the degree of spatial overlap between bt and dv across our scenarios for both analyses we determined statistical significance based on confidence intervals calculated using mean 1 96 standard error and plotted figures in r version 3 2 3 r development core team 2017 3 results 3 1 model development we successfully integrated novel relationships into the existing cdmetapop framework that now facilitate multi species parameterizations for the study of hybridization dynamics fig 2 the overall workflow of this new framework appendix 1 fig s1 proceeds similarly to the original implementation of cdmetapop however species specific relationships for individual growth environmental fitness and selection and mate preference are now possible based on the use of an h index to represent the degree of individual admixture fig 2 implementation of an h index allows hybridization to be spatiotemporally evaluated across a study system in our demonstration of these new capabilities varying species specific parameters resulted in unique demographic outcomes and spatial distributions at multiple time points illustrating that our framework can be used to assess the impact of evolutionary processes demographic characteristics and landscape features on hybridization dynamics 3 2 demonstration of hybridization framework 3 2 1 null model our null model was characterized by intraspecific mating and a lack of temperature based selection and resulted in a system with slightly higher abundance of dv relative to bt mean dv 31 150 28 185 34 115 individuals mean bt 23 240 22 329 24 152 individuals fig 3 a this outcome likely resulted from the smaller body size of dv and the size based patch packing algorithm implemented in cdmetapop see cdmetapop user manual both bt and dv were randomly distributed across the study system due to a lack of temperature based selection results not shown 3 2 2 temperature based selection temperature based selection affected the initial spatial distribution of bt and dv in which patches hybridization initially occurred and the rate at which hybrids dominated the system in scenarios with intraspecific mating the strength of temperature based selection high or low determined the extent of spatial overlap between bt and dv across simulation scenarios dv were primarily distributed in headwater tributaries of the study system and bt were primarily distributed in downstream river segments by the end of the simulated time period appendix 6 fig s4 an average of 58 50 patches se 9 22 20 56 of patches contained both species in the low selection scenario and an average of 9 9 patches se 2 79 3 46 of patches contained both species in the high selection scenario similarly temperature based selection influenced the initial spatial distribution of hybrids and parental species appendix 7 fig s5 in scenarios with high temperature based selection hybrids primarily initiated in headwaters of the system appendix 8 fig s6 in comparison hybrids initiated in patches throughout the system in scenarios with low temperature based selection temperature also influenced the rate at which hybrids appeared in the system for example in scenarios with random mating and intermediate hybrid fitness approximately three times more hybrids were present at year 150 in the low temperature based selection scenario mean 30 015 22 320 37 709 individuals relative to the high temperature based selection scenario mean 8 725 4 490 12 961 individuals fig 4 c and 4d 3 2 3 mate preference behavior with the exception of the intraspecific mating scenario mate preference behavior did not have a strong effect on the abundance of hybrids figs 3 5 scenarios with medium or high hybrid fitness and either random or self preference mating all resulted in systems dominated by hybrids at the end of the simulated time period at a similar rate fig 4 and 5 mate preference behavior also did not influence the initial locations or the final spatial distributions of hybrids results from scenarios with self preference mating were similar to those for scenarios with random mating 3 2 4 hybrid fitness of the three parameters evaluated in this demonstration hybrid fitness had the greatest influence on the abundance of hybrids present at the end of simulations reduced hybrid fitness resulted in an overall decreased abundance of hybrids and increased abundance of both parental species figs 4 and 5 this trend was consistent across scenarios incorporating varying degrees of temperature based selection and mate preference behaviors in simulation scenarios characterized by random mating and low temperature based selection the number of patches containing bt increased from 6 2 se 2 16 2 2 of patches to 58 7 se 16 52 20 5 of patches to 200 8 se 3 77 70 0 of patches and the number of patches containing dv changed from 0 4 se 0 4 0 1 of patches to 0 3 se 0 3 0 1 of patches to 11 4 se 5 64 4 0 of patches for scenarios with hybrid fitness equal to 100 75 or 50 of parental fitness respectively fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics we successfully extended a previously existing demogenetic simulation model cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b to provide a framework for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species specifically we added capabilities for 1 distinguishing parental and hybrid individuals based on degree of individual admixture 2 producing species specific and individual based growth 3 implementing species specific and individual based temperature related selection including the option for an individual based fitness penalty and 4 generating distinct mate preference behaviors species and system specific information can be incorporated into this framework to enable its application to any ecological system though other ibms have been developed for simulating hybridization dynamics to our knowledge our framework is the first to incorporate detailed i e more realistic landscape and demographic features early ibms for evaluating hybridization implemented one dimensional grid systems e g cain et al 1999 and were limited in their ability to represent complex spatial and demographic features sadedin and littlejohn 2003 developed an ibm for evaluating species reinforcement that allows users to vary characteristics such as hybrid disadvantage and mate preference behavior however this ibm comprises individuals dispersed across a simple two dimensional grid and does not account for spatial heterogeneity in landscape features and individual movement nor does it incorporate population or species specific demographic characteristics among other limitations these limitations also correspond with an ibm developed by thibert plante and hendry 2009 to assess hybridization dynamics in the context of ecological speciation more recently della croce et al 2014 developed an ibm to assess hybridization between riverine species however this model does not incorporate relationships for species specific biological characteristics and riverscape heterogeneity is restricted to variation in simple stream network topologies 4 2 bt dv hybridization in the skagit river in the demonstration of our hybridization framework we observed several relationships between bull trout and dolly varden that could help guide future empirical evaluations of these species in particular we found that temperature based selection greatly influenced the initiation of hybridization the distributional range of bull trout is largely parapatric with dolly varden salvelinus malma however a number of contact zones where these species occur in sympatry have been identified cavender 1978 haas and mcphail 1991 mcphail and taylor 1995 leary and allendorf 1997 taylor et al 2001 hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden in areas of sympatry has been genetically confirmed for a number of these contact zones baxter et al 1997 taylor et al 2001 though the rate of hybridization varies among watersheds taylor et al 2001 previous studies of species biology and ecology suggest that hybridization between bull trout and dolly varden may be more likely when size dependent differences in spawning behavior and habitat choice are less pronounced mcphail and taylor 1995 hagen 2000 dunham et al 2008 for example in regions where dolly varden and bull trout occur in sympatry dolly varden typically use spawning habitat characterized by cooler water temperatures relative to bull trout hagen and taylor 2001 however hybridization is possible in tributaries where the thermal regime facilitates the presence of both species our simulations also demonstrated that the number of hybrids present at the end of simulations was most strongly affected by hybrid fitness empirical studies of temperature based selection and the relative fitness of hybrids are currently lacking for bull trout and dolly varden but results from studies of other salmonids demonstrate the importance of hybrid fitness to the long term persistence of parental species ostberg et al 2004 observed that hybrids of sympatric coastal rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss irideus and coastal cutthroat trout o clarki clarki display reduced fitness in parental habitats facilitating the maintenance of parental species in comparison even low levels of admixture in westslope cutthroat trout o clarkia lewisi due to hybridization with invasive rainbow trout o mykiss correspond with marked reductions in reproductive success muhlfeld et al 2009 empirical studies of hybrid fitness and the stability of this relationship across environmental gradients would significantly improve our understanding of the impacts of sympatric hybridization on the evolutionary trajectories of bull trout and dolly varden in the skagit river such studies are essential given that the skagit river serves as one of a small number of population strongholds for bull trout united states fish and wildlife service 2015 and resulting information could directly inform management and conservation policies although we were able to draw from a moderate body of literature to populate our simulation model empirical data were not available for every parameter future users of cdmetapop may be faced with similar challenges when focusing on less studied species in our demonstration we showed how simulations can be used to evaluate relative sensitivity to model parameterizations in instances where empirical values are lacking however model validation can be challenging and often not feasible due to the large spatial scale and complexity of demographic and genetic processes hypothesis based comparisons of competing model scenarios may be possible in cases where extensive empirical data exist for example by using additional approaches to estimate parameters e g approximate bayesian computation abc beaumont et al 2002 in comparison to simulation outputs in the case of our application minimal empirical data were available for validating model outputs hybridization was only recently documented between bull trout and dolly varden in the skagit river system small et al 2015 and little biological information is known about the hybrid individuals however as demonstrated by our example application simulations can still be a useful tool for identifying patterns to guide future empirical studies and to assist resource managers in the prioritization of conservation goals 4 3 conservation applications our simulation framework can be easily adapted to explore hybridization dynamics in any heterogeneous ecological system in particular evaluating the relative importance of hybrid fitness across systems would provide additional insights into the broader biological significance of this relationship for example whether ecological segregation is a factor influencing hybridization dynamics for invasive rainbow trout and native westslope cutthroat trout has recently been the subject of considerable debate kovach et al 2017 young et al 2017 parameterization of our simulation framework with available species and system specific information would provide the opportunity to determine the relative effects of habitat preference physiological differences landscape variables and other factors influencing the complex interspecific hybridization dynamics in fish scribner et al 2001 or other taxonomic groups see mallet 2005 and references within the influence of climate change on hybridization dynamics is of particular concern for long term conservation purposes muhlfeld et al 2014 2017 the modelling framework presented here is useful for exploring the effects of altered environmental conditions such as increased average temperature as a result of global climate change on hybridization dynamics particularly for cold water lotic systems which are likely to experience heterogeneous responses to a changing climate due to spatially distributed groundwater fluxes snyder et al 2015 applications of ibm frameworks could help forecast future effects of climate change for sympatric bull trout and dolly varden such an investigation may initially result in increased spatial partitioning of species specific spawning habitat but an increase in temperature beyond the thermal tolerance of either species could have serious long term consequences for these cold water fishes similarly our modelling framework does not presently account for the capacity of parental species to adapt to such selective pressures studies on the possible evolutionary responses of salmonid species to climate change are challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between plastic and genetic based phenotypic traits and determining whether an observed phenotypic change is a direct adaptive response to climate change crozier et al 2008 merilä and hendry 2014 a small number of empirical studies suggest that salmonids have some potential to adapt to an altered thermal regime jensen et al 2008 modification of our simulation framework to evaluate adaptive capacity funk et al 2018 would provide a valuable means for exploring the potential effects of climate change on hybridization dynamics in freshwater systems other potential applications of our simulation framework center on predicting the effects of a broad range of management and conservation actions for example our demonstration identified spatial areas especially prone to the development of interspecific contact zones these zones could be targeted for monitoring to prevent interactions between parental species such applications are particularly useful for species that have a conservation emphasis such as the critically endangered red wolf canis rufus which is known to hybridize with coyotes c latrans bohling et al 2016 additionally our simulation framework could be used to predict the effect of barrier implementation or removal on dynamics between potentially or currently hybridizing species to inform targeted management decisions e g novinger and rahel 2003 the effects of local land use practices can also be simulated by varying environmental variables such as water flow or deforestation additionally our framework can be used to explore the consequences of genetic rescue in inbred populations frankham 2015 whiteley et al 2015 or to investigate the outcomes of recently debated actions such as intentional hybridization to promote climate adaptation hamilton and miller 2016 kovach et al 2016 4 4 model limitations a necessary future area of research is determining the biological relevance of the h index thresholds used in this study to distinguish hybrids from individuals of either parental species admixture thresholds appropriate for wild populations is a persistent and challenging issue further complicated by the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype vonholdt et al 2017 in this study we used admixture thresholds reported in genetic studies focused on distinguishing hybrids in wild populations shepard et al 2005 vähä and primmer 2006 harbicht et al 2014 however from a conservation perspective deciding the degree of admixture that influences management decisions is complex and context specific allendorf et al 2001 future studies that explore the biological significance of admixture thresholds would provide useful insights for investigations of hybridization dynamics using tools such as our modelling framework future simulation work is also necessary to assess the impact of the cdmetapop mate selection algorithm on simulation results in the demonstration of our simulation framework we observed high abundances of hybrids regardless of whether mating was random or with strong preference for mates of the same species for scenarios where self preference mating is implemented mate choice is based on female preference for males within the same natal patch and that have a similar h index this relationship assumes that mate pairs are more likely to comprise individuals of similar genotype e g h index and that genotype is an accurate reflection of phenotype the primary informant of mate preference in nature in our simulations we restricted mate selection to within patch mating and instances where only less suitable males are present i e h indices between female and male are very different still resulted in the formation of a mate pair in reality individuals are likely to make movements to find preferred mates but how individuals select mates along a spectrum of h indices and phenotypes is unknown future applications of our hybridization framework could permit the movement of individuals to neighboring natal patches in instances where mates with preferable h indices are not present in the current patch and could also explore the relative spawning success of such straying individuals 4 5 conclusions the primary goal of this study was to develop a simulation framework useful for evaluating hybridization dynamics between two species in a heterogeneous system we accomplished this goal by modifying a previously existing ibm cdmetapop landguth et al 2017b and by demonstrating a system specific application of this framework such applications of spatially explicit ibms are increasingly important for forecasting the effects of large scale processes such as a changing global climate on species distributions and interactions additionally spatially explicit ibms are useful for predicting the effects of a broad range of potential management and conservation actions the adaptability of our framework to species and system specific characteristics makes it a valuable tool for simulation based explorations of hybridization dynamics and resulting eco evolutionary impacts
