1480,groundwater salinization is currently a very serious and challenging issue in many parts of the world with an increasing demographic pressure and remarkable changes of water and land uses over the last decades the multilayer coastal aquifer system of jiangsu province east china was affected by increasing salinization in this study we investigate the groundwater salinization process and the salinity sources of the aquifer system in nantong area southern part of the jiangsu coastal plain using a multi isotope δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr and δ11b approach the results show that the tds total dissolved solids values in most deep groundwater samples are generally lower than those of the shallow groundwater samples the tds of both shallow and deep groundwater increase from western nantong inland to the eastern coastal region of the yellow sea the chemical types transform from ca mg hco3 or mg ca hco3 to nacl the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes signatures of the groundwater samples indicate that local precipitation likely acts as the main recharge source of both the shallow and deep confined groundwater systems the deep groundwater shows more depleted isotopes suggesting recharging by the precipitation under a cold climate before the holocene period the shallow groundwater features heavier water isotopes indicating recharging source from recent precipitation under a warm climate the variations in δ11b and 87sr 86sr of groundwater samples can be explained by the changes of solute sources in the inland region western nantong shallow groundwater with higher tds is mainly caused by evaporation induced concentration whereas in coastal areas seawater intrusion exerts a major influence on the chemical composition of the shallow groundwater our results show that that seawater intrusion mainly occurs in eastern and southeastern nantong area we also find that hydraulic connection between shallow and deep groundwater is strengthened by continuous overexploitation and deep groundwater is mixed with shallow groundwater at some points the mixing between upper saline water and deep freshwater together with water rock interactions likely explain the observed low salinity in deep groundwater in coastal areas overall with growing observations of salty seawater intrusion in the estuary region of the yangtze river future efforts are needed to prevent further seawater intrusion as sea level rises and groundwater table declines in this context our findings provide key information for groundwater management in other coastal aquifers east china keywords coastal area hydro chemistry strontium isotope boron isotope seawater intrusion 1 introduction seawater intrusion has been recognized as a serious threat to groundwater quality in coastal aquifers for a long time jørgensen et al 2008 langman and ellis 2010 garing et al 2013 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 tamez meléndez et al 2016 najib et al 2017 manivannan and elango 2019 in addition over extraction of groundwater in many coastal aquifers has caused kilometer scale intrusions of seawater and alteration of groundwater quality sanchez martos et al 1999 vengosh et al 1999 2002 fakir et al 2002 ranjan et al 2009 rajaveni et al 2016 with the warming climate and rising sea level seawater intrusion to coastal groundwater aquifers is expected to be more severe in the near future oude essink et al 2010 blanco et al 2013 cary et al 2015 to better understand how seawater intrusion affects groundwater systems two important questions need to be addressed 1 how to identify signals of early stage seawater intrusion especially in fresh groundwater systems with rising total dissolved solutes tds 2 how to track the trajectory of seawater intrusion and unravel the formation of saline groundwater during seawater intrusion the answers to these two questions provide fundamental knowledge for human society to predict mitigate and manage seawater intrusion and its cascading hazards including influences on groundwater aquifers the coastal areas in east china provide a unique setting to study seawater intrusion and its interaction with groundwater systems over the past few decades those areas have become major areas under rapid economic development with an increasing demand for water resources to sustain living consumption e g drinking and agricultural and industrial activities nantong area fig 1 located in eastern jiangsu province and adjacent to the yellow sea is a major seaport and industrial city in costal china accommodating a population of over 7 31 million people in 2018 in 2009 the jiangsu governmental coastal development strategy brought into effect making nantong among the most important ports for ongoing investment and development lv and wang 2018 however such rapid development has led to a range of pressing environmental problems notably the overexploitation of groundwater resources for different uses and its salinization are among the most serious and challenging issues in the jiangsu coast besides the warming climate is expected to modify groundwater recharge and to induce sea level variation in this context tds of the shallow and deep groundwater in several places in the nantong area appears to increase and even become saline xu 2002 shan and xing 2008 local governments and residents have been concerning that those changes are linked to possible seawater intrusion which would threaten their normal water usage shan and xing 2008 however except for some hydrological observations limited studies were conducted systematically to explore the formation and evolution of groundwater chemistry in the jiangsu coast and its potential linkage with seawater intrusion ha and zhao 1990 used environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o and14c to trace the origins and processes of groundwater in the nantong coastal aquifers specifically xu 2002 and shan and xing 2008 reported an increasing trend of groundwater tds in many places around nantong based on temporal variation of water chemical data and provided tentative explanations for the origin of groundwater salinity but there was short of confidential evidence xu et al 2018 investigated the origin and evolving process of deep groundwater of the coastal aquifers in part of nantong area although xu et al 2018 did not reach a complete mechanistic understanding of groundwater salinization they concluded that the origin and process of groundwater salinization in the jiangsu coast areas require further studies xu et al 2018 understanding the increasing tds of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal region is complicated by several factors not only seawater intrusion and mixing other geochemical processes can also enhance groundwater tds for example evapo concentration water rock interaction and soil salt dissolution are known to change groundwater chemistry as well mollema et al 2013 petelet giraud et al 2016 traditionally chloride concentration tds and some other trace elements are often used to distinguish the above processes from seawater intrusion and mixing blanco et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 but in fact these general geochemical tracers remains difficult to discriminate seawater mixing from salts dissolution or evapo concentration processes those tracers also lack the capacity to determine the influence of anthropogenic inputs and water rock interaction on groundwater composition given the limitations a combined multi isotope approach has been proposed to trace the origin of groundwater salinization petelet giraud et al 2016 in this study we focus on a combined isotope system that includes hydrogen oxygen strontium and boron isotopes in coastal water bodies it is well known that different water sources e g precipitation and seawater have distinct hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions making the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o effective tracers of the groundwater circulation routing system including recharge runoff and discharge craig 1961 clayton 1966 clarke and fritz 1997 tan et al 2012 tamez meléndez et al 2016 besides boron and strontium isotopes are two emerging geochemical tools in hydrological studies barth 1998 vengosh et al 1999 2002 2005 woods et al 2000 frost and toner 2004 negrel et al 2005 jørgensen et al 2008 strontium concentrations and the isotope ratio of radiogenic 87sr and stable 86sr 87sr 86sr have been used to identify chemical weathering inputs from water rock interaction and to constrain other water sources peterman and stuckless 1992 johnson and depaolo 1994 bullen et al 1996 mcnutt 2000 frost et al 2002 horst et al 2007 boron b isotopes have been proved to be useful for investigating the origin and reaction kinetics of dissolved boron species in natural waters cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 modern seawater shows stagnant b and sr isotopic compositions with an average δ11b value of 39 5 spivack and edmond 1987 and an average 87sr 86sr of 0 7092 negrel et al 2005 jørgensen et al 2008 the major sources of groundwater in coastal areas have unique elemental and isotopic bsr compositions making the δ11b 87sr 86sr pair sensitive tracers of groundwater sources specifically seawater and the leachate from water rock interactions end members both have high concentrations of b whereas the sr concentration is high in seawater but low in leachate and freshwater langman and ellis 2010 mahlknecht et al 2017 besides seawater has more positive δ11b value and lower 87sr 86sr ratio compared to the leachate coastal precipitation freshwater has low b and sr concentration but relatively high δ11b value dotsika et al 2010 and medium 87sr 86sr ratio around 0 709 and 0 7106 négrel et al 2001 thus the δ11b 87sr 86sr b sr system can be used to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of salinization and identify different hydro chemical processes that drive tds changes in groundwater as well as the locality of seawater leachate freshwater mixing with the above recognitions this study aims at better understanding the origin of groundwater salinity in a coastal aquifer that is affected by seawater intrusion for this purpose we adopt the multi isotope δ2h δ18o δ11b 87sr 86sr approach to resolve the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the nantong area in coastal china with this study we seek to 1 unravel the recharge source of shallow and deep confined groundwater based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the nantong aquifer system and 2 understand the mechanism of the water chemical evolution through water chemistry and strontium and boron isotopes in particular to identify the different causes such as water rock interaction evaporation salt dissolution and seawater intrusion 2 methods 2 1 study area the nantong coastal region covering an area of about 8000 km2 lies in the southern part of jiangsu province being adjacent to the yellow sea to the east and the yangtze river to the west and the south fig 1 the regional topography is generally flat with elevation decreasing gradually from west to east the surface is covered by unconsolidated sediments from holocene and the structure of basement is characterized by ew and ne trending faults the regional climate is controlled by humid subtropical monsoon with heavy rainfall occurring during the wet season june october and annual precipitation from 1030 mm to 1100 mm groundwater has been the primary source of freshwater in this region with a reported annual groundwater exploitation reaching approximately 1 1 107 m3 122 mm the demographic and economic growth of nantong lead to high consumption of groundwater and consequently sharp declines of the groundwater table in the region to mitigate the over exploitation of groundwater the yangtze river water has been piped to the region to provide freshwater resources 2 2 groundwater system groundwater in the region is mainly pore water contained in unconsolidated sediments it widely exists in multi aquifers it is characterized by wide distribution multi aquifers and rich water quantity based on formation history accommodation rock and burial depth of groundwater the groundwater system can be divided into shallow middle and deep aquifer subsystems with the geologic periods spanning from since the pliocene to quaternary ha and zhao 1990 fig 2 i shallow aquifer subsystem the shallow aquifer consists of postglacial holocene estuarine littoral facies of silt and clayey silt and belongs to neritic littoral and estuarine delta deposits the bottom depth is about 30 m from the surface and is separated by a silt clay layer from the middle aquifer subsystem from the west to east the groundwater gradually transfers from phreatic water to slightly confined water the shallow groundwater system can be easily recharged by the active hydrologic cycle and the rich precipitation in the region evaporation near the surface and artesian spring or artificial pumping are the major patterns of groundwater discharge ii middle aquifer subsystem the middle aquifer system consists of confined aquifers i and ii aquifer i is mainly consists of the late pleistocene alluvial silty sands or sands and belonged to facies of fluvial estuarine and littoral deposits the buried depth of groundwater is about 30 40 m in the central area and 60 70 m in the southeastern and northwestern area from the surface and the aquifer thickness is about around 60 130 m aquifer ii is mainly consists of medium pleistocene alluvial and estuarine silty sands and gravel deposit facies the burial depth is around 140 m from the surface and the aquifer thickness of is 20 60 m the aquiclude between the confined aquiferiand ii is a silt clay layer with a thickness less than 15 m due to the absence of aquicludes in many places aquiferiand ii have a tight hydraulic connection the study area has experienced many marine transgressions since the holocene ha and zhao 1990 the quality of the groundwater in the middle aquifer subsystem changes from slightly saline water in the western area to saline water in the eastern area the aquifer system also receives lateral groundwater recharge and a small precipitation recharge in some local areas iii deep aquifer subsystem this system is composed of iii and ivconfined aquifers the aquifer iii has been the basic water resources for agriculture industries municipalities and rural living utilization through artificial pumping from the wells since 1960s because of its excellent water quality the sedimentary facies of aquifer iii is dominated by early pleistocene alluvial lake sands the burial depth is about 180 270 m from the surface and 20 50 m in thickness the environment of the aquifer is so closed that modern precipitation or upper water is difficult to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater but near the coastal region shallow groundwater may possibly infiltrate into the group aquifer iii and increase the tds of local deep water due to thinner aquiclude hence the ancient precipitation may be main recharge source and human exploration is the solely discharge group aquifer iv is buried more than 400 m deep from the surface consisting of pliocene fluvial facies of sands due to the thick aquiclude layer of clay 30 50 m in thickness there seems to be no hydraulic connection between aquifers iii and iv at present the group aquifer iv maintains its natural state and is not developed by human 2 3 sampling and analysis at present the groundwater in subsurface unconfined aquifer generally less than 30 m in depth from surface and deep confined aquifer mainly for iii aquifers are the main water resources for local exploration thirty eight water samples were collected from the wells for industrial public domestic utilization in western and northern area area 1 the suburban area of nantong city and southern area area 2 southeastern area area 3 and eastern coastal area area 4 in october 2010 fig 1 table 1 the well depths varied between 3 and 360 m in order to compare with each other local annual precipitation 8 samples in different seasons a number of river water samples from the estuary region and seawater samples in the seaside of the yellow sea table 1 salinity ph and temperature were measured in situ using a multiparameter analyzer mettler toledo sg23 table 1 each sample was collected using two 500 ml bottles for cation and anion analysis respectively the samples for major cations trace elements and for sr isotope analyses were acidified with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 the bottles were then sealed and sent to the laboratory for isotopic and elemental measurements ca2 mg2 cl hco3 were analyzed by the titration method and so4 2 was measured by gravimetric method through precipitation of barium sulfate k na sr2 were determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry aas br and b3 were measured using a spectrophotometer vis7200 charge imbalance was less than 5 difference between cations and anions for all water samples the precision for major cations and anions is better than 2 and the br and b3 is within 1 and sr2 is 5 the δ2h δ18o analyses were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios were measured on a thermo fisher mat253 mass spectrometer and the results were reported relative to smow with a standard deviation of 1 to 2 and 0 20 to 0 30 respectively for the determination of 87sr 86sr ratios a sufficient amount of solution was loaded in a cation exchange column resin dowex 50 produced by dow chemical company us to separate sr from other cations particularly from rb the sr isotope analyses were performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims triton at the state key laboratory of ore deposit geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the sr standard nbs 987 yielded average value of 0 710245 5 2σ for 8 analyses all results of the mass fractionation corrections for sr isotopic ratios were based on 86sr 88sr 0 1194 the detailed analytical method of sr isotope is described by pu et al 2005 and dai et al 2008 to determine of 11b 10b ratios the water samples were passed through a 0 8 ml amberlite 120 to 200 meshes resin column using low boron water and 2 mol l nh4oh to remove the cations 12 ml of 0 1 mol l hcl was then used to elute the boron from the resin the eluant was then evaporated to dryness at 65 c by adding an equal amount of mannitol to suppress boron volatilization the residue was dissolved in low boron water and passed through a 0 15 ml amberlite resin column 120 to 200 meshes to further purify the sample after adding more mannitol the eluant was again evaporated to dryness at 60 c for mass spectrometry analysis the boron isotopic measurement procedure is the same as that described by xiao et al 1988 xiao 1992 the single ta filaments were first outgassed at 3 0 a for one hour 3 ml of graphite slurry was spread across the top of the filament then about 2 μg of boron was loaded with equimolar of mannitol and cesium cs2co3 and evaporated to dryness at 50 c the measurement for this work was performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims triton in the institute of salt lakes cas china the 11b 10b ratio of nbs srm 951 was determined repeatedly to be 4 05001 0 00105 2σ with a relative external reproducibility of 0 26 n 10 the isotopic composition of boron in the samples is expressed as a permil deviation relative to the nbs srm 951 boric acid standard table 2 3 results 3 1 the tds ph and water chemical types the collected subsurface and deep groundwater from wells show a wide range of total dissolved solids tds varying from 329 8 to 9544 mg l table 1 the tds value of the shallow groundwater samples is generally higher than that of most deep groundwater samples for the two types of groundwater the tds value shows an increaseing trend from western nantong to the eastern coastal region of the yellow sea in the southeast area of yinyang donghai and xiangyang town the shallow and deep groundwater samples have tds greater than 1500 mg l ranging from 1622 to 2298 mg l and become slightly saline the ph value of groundwater shows a narrow range from 7 03 to 8 09 varying across different depths or areas and generally neutral or slightly alkaline the water chemistry data are listed in table 1 table 2 and fig 3 for all samples including various shallow and deep groundwater precipitation water 8 samples over different seasons estuary mixture water and yellow sea water the major chemical compositions of the groundwater shows wide ranges over different depths or different areas three major water chemical types of group p1 p2 and p3 can be identified in the piper diagram fig 3 group p1 is mainly dominated by type ca mg hco3 or types mg ca hco3 which include shallow groundwater samples and a few deep groundwater samples from the central and western nantong area and precipitation samples those water samples with higher tds values are from near the coast which are mainly dominated by a nacl water type and plotted in group p2 including one shallow water sample s8 in haiyan town a few shallow s1 s2 and deep water samples d1 d2 in the southeastern corner of yinyang town some estuary water samples and the yellow sea water samples the confined deep groundwater samples collected from yuelai d6 and shigang town d9 are also plotted in the realm of group p2 the group p3 mainly contains the groundwater samples with median tds values about 1000 mg l between those in group p1 and group p2 and the water chemical type can be classified to na hco3 fig 3 notably group p2 have a significantly higher salinity than groups p1 and p3 3 2 composition of typical trace elements generally chlorine and bromine are ideal elements for identifying the origin of solutes mixing or dilution of different source water stueber and walter 1991 the cl concentrations of the deep confined groundwater vary between 32 05 mg l and 1006 mg l table 2 most deep confined groundwater samples have moderate to low chloride concentrations 350 mg l except for the samples from yinyang d1 and donghai d2 town 500 mg l the cl concentrations of shallow groundwater samples display large variations between 27 28 and 4770 mg l most of the shallow groundwater samples have relatively low cl concentrations 250 mg l although three samples in the eastern study area of yinyang s1 xiangyang s2 and haiyan s8 town show high values 1000 mg l table 2 and fig 1 the br concentration of the deep confined groundwater varies from 0 222 mg l to 2 857 mg l in the southeastern part of the nantong area and was higher compared to the rest of the br levels that is below the detection limit 0 01 mg l in the central and western areas samples table 2 br levels in shallow groundwater ranged from 0 201 mg l to 12 7 mg l across the nantong area and yinyang haiyan and yangkou town are characterized by higher br concentrations reaching up to 12 7 mg l sr2 concentrations of groundwater samples show a narrow range from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l except for two samples from the deep confined groundwater in yinyang town d1 and d2 and shallow groundwater in haiyan s8 and wanghao town s10 whose concentrations are greater than 1 0 mg l except for shallow groundwater samples of xiangyang s2 and haiyan town s9 all groundwater samples are characterized by low b3 contents 1 0 mg l table 2 3 3 h and o isotope the shallow groundwater particularly in adjacent to the coastal zone are enriched in δ18o and δ2h compared to the deep confined groundwater the shallow groundwater samples show are featured by relatively heavier δ18o from 6 92 to 3 32 and δ2h from 30 6 to 50 3 values compared to the deep confined groundwater showing that the δ18o values change from 7 54 to 5 28 and δ2h values from 56 6 to 38 7 respectively table 2 due to limited precipitation samples collected in nantong area precipitation data monitored by the international atomic energy agency iaea in the adjacent nanjing station fig 1 are used to represent the local meteoric water line lmwl in order to constrain the original recharge information those groundwater samples with high tds 1000 mg l and cl concentration 250 mg l which are generally assumed to be contaminated by seawater intrusion or human effects are excluded in the following analysis next fig 4 displays in δ2h δ18o space the precipitation water samples as well as shallow and deep groundwater samples in this diagram both deep and shallow groundwaters plot on the right side of the lmwl and are located on the evapo concentration line relative to the shallow groundwater samples most of deep groundwater samples lie in the lower right areas of the lmwl 3 4 boron and strontium isotopes both the boron δ11b and strontium 87sr 86sr isotopic compositions of the shallow or deep groundwater show broad variations from 35 88 to 29 83 for δ11b and from 0 709198 to 0 711233 for 87sr 86sr table 2 based on δ11b 87sr 86sr 1 sr 87sr 86sr and 1 b δ11b diagrams fig 5a b c three groundwater groups can be identified group 1 including shallow groundwater samples in yinyang town s1 and s2 haiyan town s9 and estuary water hks1 and also seawater sw group 2 including deep confined groundwater samples in yinyang town d1 and d2 dongyuan town d4 dongzaogang town d5 and group 3 containing shallow groundwater samples in the suburb area of nantong city 2 samples s22 and s24 the δ11b values of shallow group 1 and deep groundwater group 2 in the eastern area near the coastal region are very high and vary between 20 86 and 34 04 by contrast the two samples s22 and s24 from the suburb of nantong show much more negative δ11b values than those of the eastern area with 35 88 and 29 00 respectively the 87sr 86sr ratios of all the deep confined groundwater group 2 are greater than 0 710 ranging from 0 71094 to 0 71123 the shallow groundwater of group 1 is smaller than 0 710 and with a range between 0 70920 and 0 70974 close to the value of modern sea water 0 70907 table 2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of group 3 range from 0 710281 to 0 710291 and are intervenient between the group 1 and group 2 data points 4 discussion 4 1 recharge of groundwater here we use the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of water samples to track the groundwater circulation routing system and to constrain recharge runoff and discharge craig 1961 clayton 1966 clarke and fritz 1997 tan et al 2012 the local meteoric water line lmwl is represented by the line δ2h 8 5 δ18o 17 7 which closes to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 2 0 07 δ18o 11 27 0 65 defined by rozanski et al 1993 fig 4 by contrast most of the deep groundwater samples show lower δ18o and δ2h values than those of the shallow groundwater samples and the regression trend lines of the shallow groundwater and deep groundwater data intersect with the lmwl at points a with δ2h 50 3 and δ18o 8 00 and b δ2h 63 6 and δ18o 9 56 respectively fig 4 generally the δ18o and δ2h values of the intersecting points of a and b denote the average values of source water that recharges groundwater without evapo concentration fig 4 cary et al 2015 rao et al 2018 the isotopic compositions of point a are close to the weighted annual average precipitation values of 7 57 in δ18o and 46 9 in δ2h this suggests that the source of shallow groundwater likely originated from the local annual precipitation recharge and then experienced evaporation a few of shallow aquifer samples s14 s27 s26 show notable 2h and 18o depletion which may reveal mixing with the deep groundwater fig 4 ha and zhao 1990 the source of deep confined groundwater is expected to be recharged by water with much more depleted isotopes than that of the source of shallow groundwater the recharge source for deep groundwater with depleted isotopes precipitation from higher altitude or under cold climate can cause depleted isotopic compositions clarke and fritz 1997 given a general increase in δ2h and δ18o values of 5 6 and 0 7 respectively with a 1 c increase in temperature dansgaard 1964 however the study area is featured by a wide plain with limited vertical relief which excludes the possibility that the depleted isotope values are related to the altitude effect fig 2 hence the depleted isotopic data of deep groundwater indicates that the groundwater was recharged under a cold climatic condition radiocarbon dating studies show that the deep confined aquifer iii has a 14c age of around 13 000 18000a zhao et al 1993 or 7410 26140a xu et al 2018 indicating timing before the holocene during this period the temperature of the atmosphere is obviously lower than that of the holocene time and the precipitation probably shows a lower mean δ18o and δ2h composition in all cases across the world e g zhu 2000 chen et al 2003 horst et al 2007 darling 2010 there is a shift in stable isotope composition between holocene and older groundwater pleistocene holocene transition the magnitude of the shifts is usually positively correlated with temperature xu et al 2018 sampled wells from the deep deposit in the yoco port area on the northern branch of this study area fig 1 they indicated that deep groundwater originated from precipitation under colder climate conditions and the formation period is the early pleistocene and neogene xu et al 2018 overall these studies support our explanation that the recharging of groundwater during the pre holocene period caused the depleted water oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions in contrast the shallow groundwater formed since holocene period displaying different water isotope signals from deep groundwater during this period the humid monsoon climate drives intense precipitation with modern day annual precipitation ranging from 1030 to 1100 mm in nantong in addition to the heavy precipitation and the flat plain relief the accommodation rocks of the aquifer system are dominated by alluvial estuarine soft sands fig 2 with high permeability allowing precipitation to effectively recharge the shallow groundwater in summary the water isotopes support that the deep groundwater in the nantong area is likely recharged by the precipitation under cold climate before the holocene period whereas modern precipitation under the warmer climate may recharge the shallow groundwater 4 2 evolution of water chemical compositions in this section we discuss possible evolution processes of groundwater chemistry although the shallow and deep groundwater originate from local precipitation their chemical compositions are different from each other the tds of the groundwater is hundreds to thousands times higher than the mean value of the precipitation suggesting that the groundwater has undergone a complex evolution pathway the groundwater evolution in the nantong region can be roughly divided into five possible processes evapo concentration modern seawater intrusion and mixing with fresh water salt dissolution water rock interaction and pollution from human activities groundwater in different areas experiences different processes of water chemical evolution the following sections discuss their water chemical evolutions fig 1 focusing on four areas the western northern area the southeastern coastal area the eastern coastal area and the nantong suburb southern area 4 2 1 western and northern nantong areas area 1 the samples from the western and northern nantong mainly lie in group p1 in fig 3 the hydrochemical characteristics of group p1 are close to natural or slightly evapo concentrated water and the local precipitation belonging to water types na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 in the sample plot of cl versus na fig 6a the area 1 samples are close to the end member of precipitation and weak water rock interaction increasing the concentration of na and making the plots data points slightly move above the evaporation line without the seawater effect the br concentration of the groundwater is low and the data points locate above the seawater dilution line in ratio cl br vs cl diagram fig 6b moreover in the plot of molar cl versus molar mg ca ratio fig 6c most samples show medium cl concentrations suggesting that local precipitation with low cl concentration can evolve into groundwater with medium cl concentration under weak evapo concentration or water rock interaction hence most shallow groundwater with higher tds is likely resulted from evapo concentration those deep confined groundwater and shallow groundwater with low tds are mainly included in the natural water type except for slight water rock interaction to make na increase in the western and northern nantong area 4 2 2 suburb of nantong city and southern areas area 2 both the shallow and deep groundwaters in these areas show lower tds and most sample points belong to group p1 except for a few which are included in group p2 fig 3 the clna and cl br mg ca plots fig 6a b c suggest that the chemical evolution of groundwater was not affected by seawater intrusion or salt dissolution in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 the two sample points of the shallow groundwater are classified as group 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios fall within the range of general natural water whereas the boron isotopes are depleted the previous discussion concluded that recharge source of the groundwater is local precipitation generally the boron isotope of precipitation near the coastal area shows a higher δ11b value uptake of dissolved b into clay minerals proceeds by adsorption of tetrahedrally coordinated b oh 4 onto the mineral surface and as this species is enriched in 10b causing increases in the abundance of 11b relative to 10b remains in water palmer et al 1987 1992 similarly the 11b will preferentially enter solutes during the water rock interaction pennisi et al 2006 hence adsorption water rock interaction and precipitation should not be the dominating factors that cause the depleted boron isotopes in the groundwater diagrams of 87sr 86sr versus 1 sr and δ11b versus 1 b fig 5b c indicate possible influence from anthropogenic pollution for reference low δ11b values about from 30 to 10 are generally related to contamination from combustion of coal and sewage pennisi et al 2013 mao et al 2019 filter leachate has a higher b concentration but much more depleted b isotope 0 34 00 while the sr concentration is too low to change the sr isotope of the groundwater pennisi et al 2006 in addition the groundwater sample collected from shallow wells with depth less than 10 m in suburb of nantong city which will be inevitably affected by urban human activities e g industrial and urban effluents combustion of coal bulletin of environmental nantong city 2010 therefore the groundwater chemical evolution mainly shows a natural process in most areas of southern nantong except for some shallow groundwater aquifers around nantong city where human activities may possibly affect water quality of the groundwater 4 2 3 southeastern coastal area area 3 yingyang and donghai town are included in the southeastern coastal area of nantong both the shallow and deep groundwaters all show high concentrations of cl and tds and are similar to the estuary water or sea water which can be classified as group p1 in the piper diagram fig 3 in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 the sample points of shallow and deep groundwater samples belong to groups 1 and 2 respectively the river estuary hks 1 and sea water samples are also included in group 1 fig 5 the same as the shallow groundwater this indicates that the shallow groundwater chemical evolution is related to seawater intrusion and mixing processes in contrast the δ11b of deep groundwater is very close to the shallow groundwater but the 87sr 86sr ratio is obviously higher than that of the seawater or shallow groundwater in the same area with respect to the shallow groundwater the concentration of cl br tds cl br and mg ca ratio of the deep groundwater of yinyang town sample d1 and donghai town sample d2 are close to those of the shallow groundwater moreover the data points of the deep groundwater samples are located near the end member of the seawater dilution line in either nacl or cl br cl diagrams fig 6a b close to the shallow groundwater samples s1 and s2 in the plot of molar cl versus molar mg ca ratio fig 6c it can be seen that the groundwater with medium cl concentration can evolve into slight saline or saline water due to the addition of saline shallow groundwater or seawater however even the deep groundwater samples show higher δ11b values but they are obviously lower than the seawater value and 87sr 86sr ratios also deviate from the value of seawater jørgensen et al 2008 all of these characteristics suggest that the increase in tds in the deep groundwater is related to the saline shallow groundwater which infiltrates downwards and mixes with deep groundwater in addition the deep groundwater shows higher 87sr 86sr ratio and sr concentration but lower b concentration compared to shallow groundwater which indicates that the water rock interaction may also have some effects on its water chemical evolution fig 5b c it is likely that the shallow groundwater firstly mixes with seawater and then experienced the water rock interaction during the water rock interaction the deep groundwater would show higher δ11b value but lower b concentration because when b is adsorbed onto clay minerals the lighter 10b would be adsorbed preferentially leaving the groundwater enriched in 11b cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 conversely the process of the water rock interaction can dissolve sr with higher 87sr 86sr ratio from rocks and introduce it into groundwater which can increase both sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in the deep groundwater in summary in the southeastern coastal nantong area the salinization of shallow groundwater is mainly caused by seawater intrusion some regional changes of deep groundwater chemical composition are mainly attributed to cross formational flow from the upper shallow aquifers of saline water as well as to water rock interactions generally it is uneasy for upper shallow groundwater to percolate aquiclude to recharge deep confined groundwater however exceptions occur when the deep groundwater table falls greatly e g due to excess exploitation and the primary balance of an aquifer system is broken in this case deep and shallow aquifers can have hydraulic connection to a certain extent making the upper slight saline or saline groundwater recharge and mix with fresh deep groundwater through cross formational flow xu et al 2018 whatever said it must be strictly limited or forbidden to mine deep groundwater in this type of coastal areas where the saline shallow groundwater is inclined to be intruded by seawater in addition the increasing saltwater intrusion found in the yangtze river estuary may have been a consequence of either the accelerated sea level rise or human activities e g the construction of the three gorge dam or both combined chen et al 2016 therefore careful planning and management of aquifer systems are needed in southeastern coastal area to mitigate the salinization process 4 2 4 eastern coastal area area 4 the deep groundwater samples in this area show much lower concentrations of cl br and tds than those from southeastern coastal area most sample points locate above the salt dissolution or seawater dilution lines in fig 6 and are included in group p3 in the piper diagram fig 3 thus it can be concluded that the precipitation group p1 in the piper diagram fig 3 experienced some degree of water rock interactions particularly cation exchange ca 2 2na ca 2na where 1 mol ca2 of the groundwater exchanges with 2 mol na of the rocks and makes much na dissolved into groundwater and finally evolves into the deep groundwater group p3 in the piper diagram fig 3 moreover b and sr isotope distributions are similar with those of other deep groundwater samples and are included in the group 2 in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 hence the chemical evolution of the deep groundwater in this area is dominated by water rock interactions and is not affected by shallow saline water or seawater intrusion by contrast the shallow groundwater with lower tds and cl concentration in this area is included in groups p1 and p2 in the piper diagram fig 3 which the water chemical evolution should be similar with the deep groundwater however for the shallow groundwater samples with higher tds and cl concentrations mainly from haiyan town their molar cl br ratios are very close to the value of seawater or estuary water and plots locate on the seawater dilution line fig 6 particularly their ma ca ratios as well as 87sr 86sr ratio are close to the seawater value and the δ11b value is also high table 2 figs 5 and 6c all of these characteristics correspondingly prove that the regional seawater intrusion imposes great effects on water chemical evolution of the shallow groundwater with higher tds around haiyan town this is a special area where cautions are needed to prevent large scale seawater intrusion from occurring in the face of ongoing sea level rising 5 conclusions in this research an integrated approach coupling hydrochemical data and isotope isotopic analyses δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr and δ11b is adopted to investigate groundwater chemistry and seawater intrusion in the jiangsu coast adjacent the southwestern yellow sea our results show that groundwater salinity hydrochemistry and isotopes exhibit significant variations from inland to shore we reach three conclusions 1 local precipitation may be the main recharge source of both the shallow and deep confined groundwater the deep groundwater was likely recharged by the precipitation before the holocene period under cold climate but shallow groundwater was likely recharged by modern precipitation under a warm climate groundwater samples with different tds concentrations have distinct δ11b and 87sr 86sr values that can be related to solute sources providing insights to distinguish different impacts of water rock interaction evapo concentration modern seawater intrusion salt dissolution and human activities to groundwater chemical evolution 2 in far from coastal areas most shallow groundwater with higher tds are resulted from evapo concentration processes and the deep confined groundwater and low tds shallow groundwater are grouped as natural water type except for a few samples with slight water rock interaction however in coastal or near coastal areas the regional seawater intrusion imposes great effects on water chemical evolution of the shallow groundwater with higher tds this study suggests that in southeastern coastal area of nantong the low salinity deep groundwater is mainly caused by the combined effects of water rock interactions and the mixing between the cross formational flow from upper saline aquifers and deep fresh water 3 information presented in this study represents a solid foundation for future hydrogeological work specifically a seawater intrusion is dominant in the coastal fringe and b the shallow groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by modern seawater intrusion and water rock interactions for water resources management most adjacent coastal areas to the southeastern yellow sea should be ranked as a serious seawater intrusion area that needs continuous long term monitoring and requires prevention of the large scale seawater intrusion from occurring in the face of sea level rising with changing climate author statement changping mao and

1480,groundwater salinization is currently a very serious and challenging issue in many parts of the world with an increasing demographic pressure and remarkable changes of water and land uses over the last decades the multilayer coastal aquifer system of jiangsu province east china was affected by increasing salinization in this study we investigate the groundwater salinization process and the salinity sources of the aquifer system in nantong area southern part of the jiangsu coastal plain using a multi isotope δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr and δ11b approach the results show that the tds total dissolved solids values in most deep groundwater samples are generally lower than those of the shallow groundwater samples the tds of both shallow and deep groundwater increase from western nantong inland to the eastern coastal region of the yellow sea the chemical types transform from ca mg hco3 or mg ca hco3 to nacl the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes signatures of the groundwater samples indicate that local precipitation likely acts as the main recharge source of both the shallow and deep confined groundwater systems the deep groundwater shows more depleted isotopes suggesting recharging by the precipitation under a cold climate before the holocene period the shallow groundwater features heavier water isotopes indicating recharging source from recent precipitation under a warm climate the variations in δ11b and 87sr 86sr of groundwater samples can be explained by the changes of solute sources in the inland region western nantong shallow groundwater with higher tds is mainly caused by evaporation induced concentration whereas in coastal areas seawater intrusion exerts a major influence on the chemical composition of the shallow groundwater our results show that that seawater intrusion mainly occurs in eastern and southeastern nantong area we also find that hydraulic connection between shallow and deep groundwater is strengthened by continuous overexploitation and deep groundwater is mixed with shallow groundwater at some points the mixing between upper saline water and deep freshwater together with water rock interactions likely explain the observed low salinity in deep groundwater in coastal areas overall with growing observations of salty seawater intrusion in the estuary region of the yangtze river future efforts are needed to prevent further seawater intrusion as sea level rises and groundwater table declines in this context our findings provide key information for groundwater management in other coastal aquifers east china keywords coastal area hydro chemistry strontium isotope boron isotope seawater intrusion 1 introduction seawater intrusion has been recognized as a serious threat to groundwater quality in coastal aquifers for a long time jørgensen et al 2008 langman and ellis 2010 garing et al 2013 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 tamez meléndez et al 2016 najib et al 2017 manivannan and elango 2019 in addition over extraction of groundwater in many coastal aquifers has caused kilometer scale intrusions of seawater and alteration of groundwater quality sanchez martos et al 1999 vengosh et al 1999 2002 fakir et al 2002 ranjan et al 2009 rajaveni et al 2016 with the warming climate and rising sea level seawater intrusion to coastal groundwater aquifers is expected to be more severe in the near future oude essink et al 2010 blanco et al 2013 cary et al 2015 to better understand how seawater intrusion affects groundwater systems two important questions need to be addressed 1 how to identify signals of early stage seawater intrusion especially in fresh groundwater systems with rising total dissolved solutes tds 2 how to track the trajectory of seawater intrusion and unravel the formation of saline groundwater during seawater intrusion the answers to these two questions provide fundamental knowledge for human society to predict mitigate and manage seawater intrusion and its cascading hazards including influences on groundwater aquifers the coastal areas in east china provide a unique setting to study seawater intrusion and its interaction with groundwater systems over the past few decades those areas have become major areas under rapid economic development with an increasing demand for water resources to sustain living consumption e g drinking and agricultural and industrial activities nantong area fig 1 located in eastern jiangsu province and adjacent to the yellow sea is a major seaport and industrial city in costal china accommodating a population of over 7 31 million people in 2018 in 2009 the jiangsu governmental coastal development strategy brought into effect making nantong among the most important ports for ongoing investment and development lv and wang 2018 however such rapid development has led to a range of pressing environmental problems notably the overexploitation of groundwater resources for different uses and its salinization are among the most serious and challenging issues in the jiangsu coast besides the warming climate is expected to modify groundwater recharge and to induce sea level variation in this context tds of the shallow and deep groundwater in several places in the nantong area appears to increase and even become saline xu 2002 shan and xing 2008 local governments and residents have been concerning that those changes are linked to possible seawater intrusion which would threaten their normal water usage shan and xing 2008 however except for some hydrological observations limited studies were conducted systematically to explore the formation and evolution of groundwater chemistry in the jiangsu coast and its potential linkage with seawater intrusion ha and zhao 1990 used environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o and14c to trace the origins and processes of groundwater in the nantong coastal aquifers specifically xu 2002 and shan and xing 2008 reported an increasing trend of groundwater tds in many places around nantong based on temporal variation of water chemical data and provided tentative explanations for the origin of groundwater salinity but there was short of confidential evidence xu et al 2018 investigated the origin and evolving process of deep groundwater of the coastal aquifers in part of nantong area although xu et al 2018 did not reach a complete mechanistic understanding of groundwater salinization they concluded that the origin and process of groundwater salinization in the jiangsu coast areas require further studies xu et al 2018 understanding the increasing tds of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal region is complicated by several factors not only seawater intrusion and mixing other geochemical processes can also enhance groundwater tds for example evapo concentration water rock interaction and soil salt dissolution are known to change groundwater chemistry as well mollema et al 2013 petelet giraud et al 2016 traditionally chloride concentration tds and some other trace elements are often used to distinguish the above processes from seawater intrusion and mixing blanco et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 but in fact these general geochemical tracers remains difficult to discriminate seawater mixing from salts dissolution or evapo concentration processes those tracers also lack the capacity to determine the influence of anthropogenic inputs and water rock interaction on groundwater composition given the limitations a combined multi isotope approach has been proposed to trace the origin of groundwater salinization petelet giraud et al 2016 in this study we focus on a combined isotope system that includes hydrogen oxygen strontium and boron isotopes in coastal water bodies it is well known that different water sources e g precipitation and seawater have distinct hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions making the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o effective tracers of the groundwater circulation routing system including recharge runoff and discharge craig 1961 clayton 1966 clarke and fritz 1997 tan et al 2012 tamez meléndez et al 2016 besides boron and strontium isotopes are two emerging geochemical tools in hydrological studies barth 1998 vengosh et al 1999 2002 2005 woods et al 2000 frost and toner 2004 negrel et al 2005 jørgensen et al 2008 strontium concentrations and the isotope ratio of radiogenic 87sr and stable 86sr 87sr 86sr have been used to identify chemical weathering inputs from water rock interaction and to constrain other water sources peterman and stuckless 1992 johnson and depaolo 1994 bullen et al 1996 mcnutt 2000 frost et al 2002 horst et al 2007 boron b isotopes have been proved to be useful for investigating the origin and reaction kinetics of dissolved boron species in natural waters cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 modern seawater shows stagnant b and sr isotopic compositions with an average δ11b value of 39 5 spivack and edmond 1987 and an average 87sr 86sr of 0 7092 negrel et al 2005 jørgensen et al 2008 the major sources of groundwater in coastal areas have unique elemental and isotopic bsr compositions making the δ11b 87sr 86sr pair sensitive tracers of groundwater sources specifically seawater and the leachate from water rock interactions end members both have high concentrations of b whereas the sr concentration is high in seawater but low in leachate and freshwater langman and ellis 2010 mahlknecht et al 2017 besides seawater has more positive δ11b value and lower 87sr 86sr ratio compared to the leachate coastal precipitation freshwater has low b and sr concentration but relatively high δ11b value dotsika et al 2010 and medium 87sr 86sr ratio around 0 709 and 0 7106 négrel et al 2001 thus the δ11b 87sr 86sr b sr system can be used to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of salinization and identify different hydro chemical processes that drive tds changes in groundwater as well as the locality of seawater leachate freshwater mixing with the above recognitions this study aims at better understanding the origin of groundwater salinity in a coastal aquifer that is affected by seawater intrusion for this purpose we adopt the multi isotope δ2h δ18o δ11b 87sr 86sr approach to resolve the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the nantong area in coastal china with this study we seek to 1 unravel the recharge source of shallow and deep confined groundwater based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the nantong aquifer system and 2 understand the mechanism of the water chemical evolution through water chemistry and strontium and boron isotopes in particular to identify the different causes such as water rock interaction evaporation salt dissolution and seawater intrusion 2 methods 2 1 study area the nantong coastal region covering an area of about 8000 km2 lies in the southern part of jiangsu province being adjacent to the yellow sea to the east and the yangtze river to the west and the south fig 1 the regional topography is generally flat with elevation decreasing gradually from west to east the surface is covered by unconsolidated sediments from holocene and the structure of basement is characterized by ew and ne trending faults the regional climate is controlled by humid subtropical monsoon with heavy rainfall occurring during the wet season june october and annual precipitation from 1030 mm to 1100 mm groundwater has been the primary source of freshwater in this region with a reported annual groundwater exploitation reaching approximately 1 1 107 m3 122 mm the demographic and economic growth of nantong lead to high consumption of groundwater and consequently sharp declines of the groundwater table in the region to mitigate the over exploitation of groundwater the yangtze river water has been piped to the region to provide freshwater resources 2 2 groundwater system groundwater in the region is mainly pore water contained in unconsolidated sediments it widely exists in multi aquifers it is characterized by wide distribution multi aquifers and rich water quantity based on formation history accommodation rock and burial depth of groundwater the groundwater system can be divided into shallow middle and deep aquifer subsystems with the geologic periods spanning from since the pliocene to quaternary ha and zhao 1990 fig 2 i shallow aquifer subsystem the shallow aquifer consists of postglacial holocene estuarine littoral facies of silt and clayey silt and belongs to neritic littoral and estuarine delta deposits the bottom depth is about 30 m from the surface and is separated by a silt clay layer from the middle aquifer subsystem from the west to east the groundwater gradually transfers from phreatic water to slightly confined water the shallow groundwater system can be easily recharged by the active hydrologic cycle and the rich precipitation in the region evaporation near the surface and artesian spring or artificial pumping are the major patterns of groundwater discharge ii middle aquifer subsystem the middle aquifer system consists of confined aquifers i and ii aquifer i is mainly consists of the late pleistocene alluvial silty sands or sands and belonged to facies of fluvial estuarine and littoral deposits the buried depth of groundwater is about 30 40 m in the central area and 60 70 m in the southeastern and northwestern area from the surface and the aquifer thickness is about around 60 130 m aquifer ii is mainly consists of medium pleistocene alluvial and estuarine silty sands and gravel deposit facies the burial depth is around 140 m from the surface and the aquifer thickness of is 20 60 m the aquiclude between the confined aquiferiand ii is a silt clay layer with a thickness less than 15 m due to the absence of aquicludes in many places aquiferiand ii have a tight hydraulic connection the study area has experienced many marine transgressions since the holocene ha and zhao 1990 the quality of the groundwater in the middle aquifer subsystem changes from slightly saline water in the western area to saline water in the eastern area the aquifer system also receives lateral groundwater recharge and a small precipitation recharge in some local areas iii deep aquifer subsystem this system is composed of iii and ivconfined aquifers the aquifer iii has been the basic water resources for agriculture industries municipalities and rural living utilization through artificial pumping from the wells since 1960s because of its excellent water quality the sedimentary facies of aquifer iii is dominated by early pleistocene alluvial lake sands the burial depth is about 180 270 m from the surface and 20 50 m in thickness the environment of the aquifer is so closed that modern precipitation or upper water is difficult to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater but near the coastal region shallow groundwater may possibly infiltrate into the group aquifer iii and increase the tds of local deep water due to thinner aquiclude hence the ancient precipitation may be main recharge source and human exploration is the solely discharge group aquifer iv is buried more than 400 m deep from the surface consisting of pliocene fluvial facies of sands due to the thick aquiclude layer of clay 30 50 m in thickness there seems to be no hydraulic connection between aquifers iii and iv at present the group aquifer iv maintains its natural state and is not developed by human 2 3 sampling and analysis at present the groundwater in subsurface unconfined aquifer generally less than 30 m in depth from surface and deep confined aquifer mainly for iii aquifers are the main water resources for local exploration thirty eight water samples were collected from the wells for industrial public domestic utilization in western and northern area area 1 the suburban area of nantong city and southern area area 2 southeastern area area 3 and eastern coastal area area 4 in october 2010 fig 1 table 1 the well depths varied between 3 and 360 m in order to compare with each other local annual precipitation 8 samples in different seasons a number of river water samples from the estuary region and seawater samples in the seaside of the yellow sea table 1 salinity ph and temperature were measured in situ using a multiparameter analyzer mettler toledo sg23 table 1 each sample was collected using two 500 ml bottles for cation and anion analysis respectively the samples for major cations trace elements and for sr isotope analyses were acidified with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 the bottles were then sealed and sent to the laboratory for isotopic and elemental measurements ca2 mg2 cl hco3 were analyzed by the titration method and so4 2 was measured by gravimetric method through precipitation of barium sulfate k na sr2 were determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry aas br and b3 were measured using a spectrophotometer vis7200 charge imbalance was less than 5 difference between cations and anions for all water samples the precision for major cations and anions is better than 2 and the br and b3 is within 1 and sr2 is 5 the δ2h δ18o analyses were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios were measured on a thermo fisher mat253 mass spectrometer and the results were reported relative to smow with a standard deviation of 1 to 2 and 0 20 to 0 30 respectively for the determination of 87sr 86sr ratios a sufficient amount of solution was loaded in a cation exchange column resin dowex 50 produced by dow chemical company us to separate sr from other cations particularly from rb the sr isotope analyses were performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims triton at the state key laboratory of ore deposit geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the sr standard nbs 987 yielded average value of 0 710245 5 2σ for 8 analyses all results of the mass fractionation corrections for sr isotopic ratios were based on 86sr 88sr 0 1194 the detailed analytical method of sr isotope is described by pu et al 2005 and dai et al 2008 to determine of 11b 10b ratios the water samples were passed through a 0 8 ml amberlite 120 to 200 meshes resin column using low boron water and 2 mol l nh4oh to remove the cations 12 ml of 0 1 mol l hcl was then used to elute the boron from the resin the eluant was then evaporated to dryness at 65 c by adding an equal amount of mannitol to suppress boron volatilization the residue was dissolved in low boron water and passed through a 0 15 ml amberlite resin column 120 to 200 meshes to further purify the sample after adding more mannitol the eluant was again evaporated to dryness at 60 c for mass spectrometry analysis the boron isotopic measurement procedure is the same as that described by xiao et al 1988 xiao 1992 the single ta filaments were first outgassed at 3 0 a for one hour 3 ml of graphite slurry was spread across the top of the filament then about 2 μg of boron was loaded with equimolar of mannitol and cesium cs2co3 and evaporated to dryness at 50 c the measurement for this work was performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims triton in the institute of salt lakes cas china the 11b 10b ratio of nbs srm 951 was determined repeatedly to be 4 05001 0 00105 2σ with a relative external reproducibility of 0 26 n 10 the isotopic composition of boron in the samples is expressed as a permil deviation relative to the nbs srm 951 boric acid standard table 2 3 results 3 1 the tds ph and water chemical types the collected subsurface and deep groundwater from wells show a wide range of total dissolved solids tds varying from 329 8 to 9544 mg l table 1 the tds value of the shallow groundwater samples is generally higher than that of most deep groundwater samples for the two types of groundwater the tds value shows an increaseing trend from western nantong to the eastern coastal region of the yellow sea in the southeast area of yinyang donghai and xiangyang town the shallow and deep groundwater samples have tds greater than 1500 mg l ranging from 1622 to 2298 mg l and become slightly saline the ph value of groundwater shows a narrow range from 7 03 to 8 09 varying across different depths or areas and generally neutral or slightly alkaline the water chemistry data are listed in table 1 table 2 and fig 3 for all samples including various shallow and deep groundwater precipitation water 8 samples over different seasons estuary mixture water and yellow sea water the major chemical compositions of the groundwater shows wide ranges over different depths or different areas three major water chemical types of group p1 p2 and p3 can be identified in the piper diagram fig 3 group p1 is mainly dominated by type ca mg hco3 or types mg ca hco3 which include shallow groundwater samples and a few deep groundwater samples from the central and western nantong area and precipitation samples those water samples with higher tds values are from near the coast which are mainly dominated by a nacl water type and plotted in group p2 including one shallow water sample s8 in haiyan town a few shallow s1 s2 and deep water samples d1 d2 in the southeastern corner of yinyang town some estuary water samples and the yellow sea water samples the confined deep groundwater samples collected from yuelai d6 and shigang town d9 are also plotted in the realm of group p2 the group p3 mainly contains the groundwater samples with median tds values about 1000 mg l between those in group p1 and group p2 and the water chemical type can be classified to na hco3 fig 3 notably group p2 have a significantly higher salinity than groups p1 and p3 3 2 composition of typical trace elements generally chlorine and bromine are ideal elements for identifying the origin of solutes mixing or dilution of different source water stueber and walter 1991 the cl concentrations of the deep confined groundwater vary between 32 05 mg l and 1006 mg l table 2 most deep confined groundwater samples have moderate to low chloride concentrations 350 mg l except for the samples from yinyang d1 and donghai d2 town 500 mg l the cl concentrations of shallow groundwater samples display large variations between 27 28 and 4770 mg l most of the shallow groundwater samples have relatively low cl concentrations 250 mg l although three samples in the eastern study area of yinyang s1 xiangyang s2 and haiyan s8 town show high values 1000 mg l table 2 and fig 1 the br concentration of the deep confined groundwater varies from 0 222 mg l to 2 857 mg l in the southeastern part of the nantong area and was higher compared to the rest of the br levels that is below the detection limit 0 01 mg l in the central and western areas samples table 2 br levels in shallow groundwater ranged from 0 201 mg l to 12 7 mg l across the nantong area and yinyang haiyan and yangkou town are characterized by higher br concentrations reaching up to 12 7 mg l sr2 concentrations of groundwater samples show a narrow range from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l except for two samples from the deep confined groundwater in yinyang town d1 and d2 and shallow groundwater in haiyan s8 and wanghao town s10 whose concentrations are greater than 1 0 mg l except for shallow groundwater samples of xiangyang s2 and haiyan town s9 all groundwater samples are characterized by low b3 contents 1 0 mg l table 2 3 3 h and o isotope the shallow groundwater particularly in adjacent to the coastal zone are enriched in δ18o and δ2h compared to the deep confined groundwater the shallow groundwater samples show are featured by relatively heavier δ18o from 6 92 to 3 32 and δ2h from 30 6 to 50 3 values compared to the deep confined groundwater showing that the δ18o values change from 7 54 to 5 28 and δ2h values from 56 6 to 38 7 respectively table 2 due to limited precipitation samples collected in nantong area precipitation data monitored by the international atomic energy agency iaea in the adjacent nanjing station fig 1 are used to represent the local meteoric water line lmwl in order to constrain the original recharge information those groundwater samples with high tds 1000 mg l and cl concentration 250 mg l which are generally assumed to be contaminated by seawater intrusion or human effects are excluded in the following analysis next fig 4 displays in δ2h δ18o space the precipitation water samples as well as shallow and deep groundwater samples in this diagram both deep and shallow groundwaters plot on the right side of the lmwl and are located on the evapo concentration line relative to the shallow groundwater samples most of deep groundwater samples lie in the lower right areas of the lmwl 3 4 boron and strontium isotopes both the boron δ11b and strontium 87sr 86sr isotopic compositions of the shallow or deep groundwater show broad variations from 35 88 to 29 83 for δ11b and from 0 709198 to 0 711233 for 87sr 86sr table 2 based on δ11b 87sr 86sr 1 sr 87sr 86sr and 1 b δ11b diagrams fig 5a b c three groundwater groups can be identified group 1 including shallow groundwater samples in yinyang town s1 and s2 haiyan town s9 and estuary water hks1 and also seawater sw group 2 including deep confined groundwater samples in yinyang town d1 and d2 dongyuan town d4 dongzaogang town d5 and group 3 containing shallow groundwater samples in the suburb area of nantong city 2 samples s22 and s24 the δ11b values of shallow group 1 and deep groundwater group 2 in the eastern area near the coastal region are very high and vary between 20 86 and 34 04 by contrast the two samples s22 and s24 from the suburb of nantong show much more negative δ11b values than those of the eastern area with 35 88 and 29 00 respectively the 87sr 86sr ratios of all the deep confined groundwater group 2 are greater than 0 710 ranging from 0 71094 to 0 71123 the shallow groundwater of group 1 is smaller than 0 710 and with a range between 0 70920 and 0 70974 close to the value of modern sea water 0 70907 table 2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of group 3 range from 0 710281 to 0 710291 and are intervenient between the group 1 and group 2 data points 4 discussion 4 1 recharge of groundwater here we use the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of water samples to track the groundwater circulation routing system and to constrain recharge runoff and discharge craig 1961 clayton 1966 clarke and fritz 1997 tan et al 2012 the local meteoric water line lmwl is represented by the line δ2h 8 5 δ18o 17 7 which closes to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 2 0 07 δ18o 11 27 0 65 defined by rozanski et al 1993 fig 4 by contrast most of the deep groundwater samples show lower δ18o and δ2h values than those of the shallow groundwater samples and the regression trend lines of the shallow groundwater and deep groundwater data intersect with the lmwl at points a with δ2h 50 3 and δ18o 8 00 and b δ2h 63 6 and δ18o 9 56 respectively fig 4 generally the δ18o and δ2h values of the intersecting points of a and b denote the average values of source water that recharges groundwater without evapo concentration fig 4 cary et al 2015 rao et al 2018 the isotopic compositions of point a are close to the weighted annual average precipitation values of 7 57 in δ18o and 46 9 in δ2h this suggests that the source of shallow groundwater likely originated from the local annual precipitation recharge and then experienced evaporation a few of shallow aquifer samples s14 s27 s26 show notable 2h and 18o depletion which may reveal mixing with the deep groundwater fig 4 ha and zhao 1990 the source of deep confined groundwater is expected to be recharged by water with much more depleted isotopes than that of the source of shallow groundwater the recharge source for deep groundwater with depleted isotopes precipitation from higher altitude or under cold climate can cause depleted isotopic compositions clarke and fritz 1997 given a general increase in δ2h and δ18o values of 5 6 and 0 7 respectively with a 1 c increase in temperature dansgaard 1964 however the study area is featured by a wide plain with limited vertical relief which excludes the possibility that the depleted isotope values are related to the altitude effect fig 2 hence the depleted isotopic data of deep groundwater indicates that the groundwater was recharged under a cold climatic condition radiocarbon dating studies show that the deep confined aquifer iii has a 14c age of around 13 000 18000a zhao et al 1993 or 7410 26140a xu et al 2018 indicating timing before the holocene during this period the temperature of the atmosphere is obviously lower than that of the holocene time and the precipitation probably shows a lower mean δ18o and δ2h composition in all cases across the world e g zhu 2000 chen et al 2003 horst et al 2007 darling 2010 there is a shift in stable isotope composition between holocene and older groundwater pleistocene holocene transition the magnitude of the shifts is usually positively correlated with temperature xu et al 2018 sampled wells from the deep deposit in the yoco port area on the northern branch of this study area fig 1 they indicated that deep groundwater originated from precipitation under colder climate conditions and the formation period is the early pleistocene and neogene xu et al 2018 overall these studies support our explanation that the recharging of groundwater during the pre holocene period caused the depleted water oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions in contrast the shallow groundwater formed since holocene period displaying different water isotope signals from deep groundwater during this period the humid monsoon climate drives intense precipitation with modern day annual precipitation ranging from 1030 to 1100 mm in nantong in addition to the heavy precipitation and the flat plain relief the accommodation rocks of the aquifer system are dominated by alluvial estuarine soft sands fig 2 with high permeability allowing precipitation to effectively recharge the shallow groundwater in summary the water isotopes support that the deep groundwater in the nantong area is likely recharged by the precipitation under cold climate before the holocene period whereas modern precipitation under the warmer climate may recharge the shallow groundwater 4 2 evolution of water chemical compositions in this section we discuss possible evolution processes of groundwater chemistry although the shallow and deep groundwater originate from local precipitation their chemical compositions are different from each other the tds of the groundwater is hundreds to thousands times higher than the mean value of the precipitation suggesting that the groundwater has undergone a complex evolution pathway the groundwater evolution in the nantong region can be roughly divided into five possible processes evapo concentration modern seawater intrusion and mixing with fresh water salt dissolution water rock interaction and pollution from human activities groundwater in different areas experiences different processes of water chemical evolution the following sections discuss their water chemical evolutions fig 1 focusing on four areas the western northern area the southeastern coastal area the eastern coastal area and the nantong suburb southern area 4 2 1 western and northern nantong areas area 1 the samples from the western and northern nantong mainly lie in group p1 in fig 3 the hydrochemical characteristics of group p1 are close to natural or slightly evapo concentrated water and the local precipitation belonging to water types na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 in the sample plot of cl versus na fig 6a the area 1 samples are close to the end member of precipitation and weak water rock interaction increasing the concentration of na and making the plots data points slightly move above the evaporation line without the seawater effect the br concentration of the groundwater is low and the data points locate above the seawater dilution line in ratio cl br vs cl diagram fig 6b moreover in the plot of molar cl versus molar mg ca ratio fig 6c most samples show medium cl concentrations suggesting that local precipitation with low cl concentration can evolve into groundwater with medium cl concentration under weak evapo concentration or water rock interaction hence most shallow groundwater with higher tds is likely resulted from evapo concentration those deep confined groundwater and shallow groundwater with low tds are mainly included in the natural water type except for slight water rock interaction to make na increase in the western and northern nantong area 4 2 2 suburb of nantong city and southern areas area 2 both the shallow and deep groundwaters in these areas show lower tds and most sample points belong to group p1 except for a few which are included in group p2 fig 3 the clna and cl br mg ca plots fig 6a b c suggest that the chemical evolution of groundwater was not affected by seawater intrusion or salt dissolution in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 the two sample points of the shallow groundwater are classified as group 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios fall within the range of general natural water whereas the boron isotopes are depleted the previous discussion concluded that recharge source of the groundwater is local precipitation generally the boron isotope of precipitation near the coastal area shows a higher δ11b value uptake of dissolved b into clay minerals proceeds by adsorption of tetrahedrally coordinated b oh 4 onto the mineral surface and as this species is enriched in 10b causing increases in the abundance of 11b relative to 10b remains in water palmer et al 1987 1992 similarly the 11b will preferentially enter solutes during the water rock interaction pennisi et al 2006 hence adsorption water rock interaction and precipitation should not be the dominating factors that cause the depleted boron isotopes in the groundwater diagrams of 87sr 86sr versus 1 sr and δ11b versus 1 b fig 5b c indicate possible influence from anthropogenic pollution for reference low δ11b values about from 30 to 10 are generally related to contamination from combustion of coal and sewage pennisi et al 2013 mao et al 2019 filter leachate has a higher b concentration but much more depleted b isotope 0 34 00 while the sr concentration is too low to change the sr isotope of the groundwater pennisi et al 2006 in addition the groundwater sample collected from shallow wells with depth less than 10 m in suburb of nantong city which will be inevitably affected by urban human activities e g industrial and urban effluents combustion of coal bulletin of environmental nantong city 2010 therefore the groundwater chemical evolution mainly shows a natural process in most areas of southern nantong except for some shallow groundwater aquifers around nantong city where human activities may possibly affect water quality of the groundwater 4 2 3 southeastern coastal area area 3 yingyang and donghai town are included in the southeastern coastal area of nantong both the shallow and deep groundwaters all show high concentrations of cl and tds and are similar to the estuary water or sea water which can be classified as group p1 in the piper diagram fig 3 in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 the sample points of shallow and deep groundwater samples belong to groups 1 and 2 respectively the river estuary hks 1 and sea water samples are also included in group 1 fig 5 the same as the shallow groundwater this indicates that the shallow groundwater chemical evolution is related to seawater intrusion and mixing processes in contrast the δ11b of deep groundwater is very close to the shallow groundwater but the 87sr 86sr ratio is obviously higher than that of the seawater or shallow groundwater in the same area with respect to the shallow groundwater the concentration of cl br tds cl br and mg ca ratio of the deep groundwater of yinyang town sample d1 and donghai town sample d2 are close to those of the shallow groundwater moreover the data points of the deep groundwater samples are located near the end member of the seawater dilution line in either nacl or cl br cl diagrams fig 6a b close to the shallow groundwater samples s1 and s2 in the plot of molar cl versus molar mg ca ratio fig 6c it can be seen that the groundwater with medium cl concentration can evolve into slight saline or saline water due to the addition of saline shallow groundwater or seawater however even the deep groundwater samples show higher δ11b values but they are obviously lower than the seawater value and 87sr 86sr ratios also deviate from the value of seawater jørgensen et al 2008 all of these characteristics suggest that the increase in tds in the deep groundwater is related to the saline shallow groundwater which infiltrates downwards and mixes with deep groundwater in addition the deep groundwater shows higher 87sr 86sr ratio and sr concentration but lower b concentration compared to shallow groundwater which indicates that the water rock interaction may also have some effects on its water chemical evolution fig 5b c it is likely that the shallow groundwater firstly mixes with seawater and then experienced the water rock interaction during the water rock interaction the deep groundwater would show higher δ11b value but lower b concentration because when b is adsorbed onto clay minerals the lighter 10b would be adsorbed preferentially leaving the groundwater enriched in 11b cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 conversely the process of the water rock interaction can dissolve sr with higher 87sr 86sr ratio from rocks and introduce it into groundwater which can increase both sr concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in the deep groundwater in summary in the southeastern coastal nantong area the salinization of shallow groundwater is mainly caused by seawater intrusion some regional changes of deep groundwater chemical composition are mainly attributed to cross formational flow from the upper shallow aquifers of saline water as well as to water rock interactions generally it is uneasy for upper shallow groundwater to percolate aquiclude to recharge deep confined groundwater however exceptions occur when the deep groundwater table falls greatly e g due to excess exploitation and the primary balance of an aquifer system is broken in this case deep and shallow aquifers can have hydraulic connection to a certain extent making the upper slight saline or saline groundwater recharge and mix with fresh deep groundwater through cross formational flow xu et al 2018 whatever said it must be strictly limited or forbidden to mine deep groundwater in this type of coastal areas where the saline shallow groundwater is inclined to be intruded by seawater in addition the increasing saltwater intrusion found in the yangtze river estuary may have been a consequence of either the accelerated sea level rise or human activities e g the construction of the three gorge dam or both combined chen et al 2016 therefore careful planning and management of aquifer systems are needed in southeastern coastal area to mitigate the salinization process 4 2 4 eastern coastal area area 4 the deep groundwater samples in this area show much lower concentrations of cl br and tds than those from southeastern coastal area most sample points locate above the salt dissolution or seawater dilution lines in fig 6 and are included in group p3 in the piper diagram fig 3 thus it can be concluded that the precipitation group p1 in the piper diagram fig 3 experienced some degree of water rock interactions particularly cation exchange ca 2 2na ca 2na where 1 mol ca2 of the groundwater exchanges with 2 mol na of the rocks and makes much na dissolved into groundwater and finally evolves into the deep groundwater group p3 in the piper diagram fig 3 moreover b and sr isotope distributions are similar with those of other deep groundwater samples and are included in the group 2 in the δ11b 87sr 86sr diagram fig 5 hence the chemical evolution of the deep groundwater in this area is dominated by water rock interactions and is not affected by shallow saline water or seawater intrusion by contrast the shallow groundwater with lower tds and cl concentration in this area is included in groups p1 and p2 in the piper diagram fig 3 which the water chemical evolution should be similar with the deep groundwater however for the shallow groundwater samples with higher tds and cl concentrations mainly from haiyan town their molar cl br ratios are very close to the value of seawater or estuary water and plots locate on the seawater dilution line fig 6 particularly their ma ca ratios as well as 87sr 86sr ratio are close to the seawater value and the δ11b value is also high table 2 figs 5 and 6c all of these characteristics correspondingly prove that the regional seawater intrusion imposes great effects on water chemical evolution of the shallow groundwater with higher tds around haiyan town this is a special area where cautions are needed to prevent large scale seawater intrusion from occurring in the face of ongoing sea level rising 5 conclusions in this research an integrated approach coupling hydrochemical data and isotope isotopic analyses δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr and δ11b is adopted to investigate groundwater chemistry and seawater intrusion in the jiangsu coast adjacent the southwestern yellow sea our results show that groundwater salinity hydrochemistry and isotopes exhibit significant variations from inland to shore we reach three conclusions 1 local precipitation may be the main recharge source of both the shallow and deep confined groundwater the deep groundwater was likely recharged by the precipitation before the holocene period under cold climate but shallow groundwater was likely recharged by modern precipitation under a warm climate groundwater samples with different tds concentrations have distinct δ11b and 87sr 86sr values that can be related to solute sources providing insights to distinguish different impacts of water rock interaction evapo concentration modern seawater intrusion salt dissolution and human activities to groundwater chemical evolution 2 in far from coastal areas most shallow groundwater with higher tds are resulted from evapo concentration processes and the deep confined groundwater and low tds shallow groundwater are grouped as natural water type except for a few samples with slight water rock interaction however in coastal or near coastal areas the regional seawater intrusion imposes great effects on water chemical evolution of the shallow groundwater with higher tds this study suggests that in southeastern coastal area of nantong the low salinity deep groundwater is mainly caused by the combined effects of water rock interactions and the mixing between the cross formational flow from upper saline aquifers and deep fresh water 3 information presented in this study represents a solid foundation for future hydrogeological work specifically a seawater intrusion is dominant in the coastal fringe and b the shallow groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by modern seawater intrusion and water rock interactions for water resources management most adjacent coastal areas to the southeastern yellow sea should be ranked as a serious seawater intrusion area that needs continuous long term monitoring and requires prevention of the large scale seawater intrusion from occurring in the face of sea level rising with changing climate author statement changping mao and

1481,to better understand the combined effects of flow rate and no3 concentration on denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency in the low permeability media a set of column experiments with different flow rates and injected no3 concentrations were conducted denitrification processes under these different conditions were simulated using the phreeqc code that couples the biogeochemical reactions and hydrological transport processes in these reactive transport models monod kinetics were applied to describe the denitrification process it was found that among the experiments conducted in this study the low flow rate 0 023 m d resulted in the low denitrification rate but high no3 removal efficiency meanwhile no3 removal efficiency was the highest 85 under moderate no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l although denitrification rate increased in response to the increase of no3 concentration the model results also indicated that no3 removal efficiency of 97 can be achieved with relatively low flow rate and high influent no3 concentration the results in this study provide insights into no3 remediation and the temporal and spatial flow rate as well as no3 concentration distribution should be pre evaluated for the effective removal strategies keywords denitrification nitrate concentration flow rate column experiments reactive transport modeling 1 introduction nitrate pollution in groundwater has become an environmental issue globally which has mainly been ascribed to the use of nitrogen in fertilizers particularly manure jahangir et al 2012 khan and spalding 2004 murgulet and tick 2009 nitrate contamination in groundwater raises the severe risks to the human health and ecosystem which has drawn the extensive attention to nitrate removal and remediation smith et al 2019 luo et al 2014 liao et al 2012 gu et al 2008 wolfe and patz 2002 physical reverse osmosis and electrodialysis chemical and biological methods have been used widely for nitrate remediation among which denitrification has been recognized as one of the most significant processes for nitrate removal haugen et al 2002 libhaber and soares 1988 robertson and cherry 1995 schipper 1998 schipper et al 2004 field observations have indicated that denitrification is affected by groundwater flow rates and hydraulic residence time as well as the no3 concentration distributions longer hydraulic residence time could promote denitrification and accelerate the reduction of no3 concentrations e g gutierrez and baran 2009 panno et al 2008 kunjikutty et al 2007 akhavan et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2011 the hydraulic permeability of the soil sediments is one of major factors impacting solute transport and reaction as reported in previous studies e g gutierrez and baran 2009 guo and brusseau 2017a guo et al 2019 medici et al 2019 it has been found that the decreasing flow rate and lower permeability of soil medium at a deeper depth of aquifer can result in lower no3 concentrations e g gutierrez and baran 2009 medici et al 2019 the seasonal changes of no3 concentrations were also observed in agricultural areas due to the variation of the residence time caused by the irrigation recharge e g hoffmann et al 2006 panno et al 2008 the impacts of no3 concentration on denitrification have also been reported in previous studies e g korom 1992 smith and harris jr 2007 rivett et al 2008 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 blackmer and bremner 1978 concluded that excessive no3 concentration affected denitrification by inhibiting the formation of n2 0 but forming n2o instead which caused the termination of the denitrification process the ratio of n2o to n2 was also affected by low no3 concentration and the reduction of no3 by denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was determined by the ratio of organic carbon to no3 fazzolari et al 1998 rütting et al 2011 therefore the different no3 concentrations at field sites resulted in different denitrification rates affecting the removal process of no3 hoffmann et al 2006 evaluated the impacts of both flow rates and no3 concentration and the results showed that no3 removal efficiency decreased because of the low no3 concentration at the site despite the long residence time groundwater flow rates and no3 concentrations vary temporally and spatially in the aquifer and watersheds composed of different sediment types which results in different denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiencies e g huwe and totsche 1995 kunjikutty et al 2007 panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 nizzoli et al 2010 sgouridis et al 2011 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 column experiments which can be easily designed are usually considered as simplified alternatives to the complex hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions at the field site and have been widely used to evaluate the impacts of the flow rates and no3 concentration on denitrification e g gu et al 2007 misiti et al 2011 boisson et al 2014 grathwohl 2014 liu et al 2017 the column experiments under various flow rates of gu et al 2007 indicated that a lower effluent no3 concentration was obtained as the flow rate decreased moreover similar experiments were conducted in columns packed with different porous media such as gravel sand silt and clay to investigate both the effects of hydraulic resident time and no3 concentration on denitrification e g misiti et al 2011 liu et al 2017 the results from above column experiments are consistent with the field observations that more no3 mass is reduced by denitrification with longer residence time e g liu et al 2017 whereas misiti et al 2011 found no effect of influent no3 concentration on its removal when the electron donors i e organic matters were sufficient which confronts the field findings that denitrification is inhabited by low no3 concentration e g hoffmann et al 2006 the reactive transport models have been widely used to reproduce the no3 reaction and transport process the single species reactive models such as the first order kinetics or first order decay models were applied to simulate the denitrification process e g molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 zhang et al 2006 krause et al 2009 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 some of which were coupled with the groundwater flow for field investigations e g molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 krause et al 2009 however the single species reactive transport models neglect the transformation between different valence nitrogen and the geochemical interactions that would affect nitrogen elements occurring between the aqueous compositions and porous media a multicomponent reactive model that integrates the denitrification and geochemical interactions was developed which has successfully represented the n involved reaction and other simultaneously occurring reactions e g rodríguez escales et al 2014 the monod equation has been normally included in the multicomponent model to reproduce the no3 degradation and associated microbial growth e g delay et al 2013 misiti et al 2011 schäfer et al 1998 consumption of organic matter by no3 reducing bacteria and other oxidation reduction reactions could be handled by the monod equation essaid et al 1995 macquarrie et al 2001 rodríguez escales et al 2016 used the multicomponent reactive transport model to simulate the enhanced denitrification processes by injecting ethanol as the external electron donor at the field despite existed studies on the effects of the flow rate and no3 concentration on denitrification based on the field tests and column experiments few of them investigated no3 reaction and transport process by integrated analysis of the biogeochemical geochemical and groundwater flow processes with the coupled flow and multicomponent reactive transport model in this paper multicomponent reactive numerical models were developed and calibrated by the experimental data then used for further qualitative analysis to achieve the following objectives 1 to unravel the mechanism how the combinations of different hydrological conditions and no3 concentrations affect the denitrification processes 2 to determine the optimal range of flow rate and no3 concentration in order to achieve the maximum no3 removal efficiency in the low permeability media 2 methods 2 1 description of the experiments the experimental system includes a 5 l inflow reservoir a 45 cm long and 15 cm diameter pvc column a peristaltic pump and a scale plate used to measure the pressure head as illustrated in fig 1 below these parts are connected by silicone tubes the column was equipped with 1 inflow port 4 pressure head monitoring ports that were established across the column at 9 cm intervals 1 sample port that is 27 cm apart from the bottom of the sediments and 1 outflow port established at the top of the column it is also equipped with an influent chamber with a height of 5 cm at the bottom of the column the influent solution was forced to flow from the bottom to the top sediments were collected from the shallow part of an aquifer with a depth of 0 5 m below ground in the tongzhou test site in beijing china wu et al 2018 the detailed information for sediments is listed in table 1 the sediments contained 7 03 g kg organic matter the cation exchange capacity cec of the sediments was 281 mmol kg which indicates that metal cations are likely to be adsorbed and ion exchange reactions may occur mineralogically the sediments were composed primarily of quartz sio2 41 albite na ca al si al 3o8 19 and calcite caco3 16 with small amounts of clinochlore mg al fe 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 9 domolite camg co3 2 5 k feldspar kalsi3o8 4 mica kal2si3alo10 oh 2 4 and pyrite fes2 2 more details about the physicochemical composition of the sediments were described in wu et al 2018 the sediments were stored in cloth bags and brought to the laboratory of basin hydrology and wetland eco restoration wuhan in the laboratory the sediments were spread thin to air dry at room temperature then griddled and passed through a 2 mm sieve before packing the sediments however quartz sand and a 150 μm nitex mesh were placed above the influent chamber to create uniform flow the air dried sediments were packed into 27 increments and each increment had the same mass of sediments to ensure the homogeneity in the columns the resulting density of the sediments in the column was approximately 1 65 g cm3 through the entire packing process each increment was tightly packed before the next one was placed on top until the columns were completely filled subsequently it was necessary to put the 150 μm nitex mesh and quartz sand on the sediments to avoid material loss at the beginning of the experiment the column was saturated with artificial groundwater agw that has the same chemical composition as that of groundwater from the tongzhou test site but is specially set without no3 the total porosity of the sediments was measured during the saturation subsequently agw was persistently pumped into the column until the pressure head remained constant and the internal flow rate reached steady state no3 and no2 in the effluent were below the detection limit as well during the equilibration period the flow rate and hydraulic conductivity were measured after that the 2 l influent solution with no3 was injected through a peristaltic pump continuously conservative tracer 1 25 mmol l br was contained in the influent solution to reflect the physical transport behavior at last agw was pumped into the column with the same flow rate until the end of the experiment bromine was monitored via a br ion selective electrode during the experiment the experiment was ended when the concentration of br was below the detection limit five column experiments were conducted simultaneously to explore no3 removal by denitrification under different operational conditions table 2 1 crslow was eluted with high no3 concentration water hnw at a constant flow rate of 0 023 m d 2 crmid cchigh was eluted with hnw at a constant flow rate of 0

oxygen the specific flow rates in the columns ranged from 0 023 0 070 m d in crslow crmid and crfast the flow rates were different whereas no3 concentration was constant of 3 23 mmol l however cchigh ccmid and cclow were conducted under the same flow rate with different no3 concentrations varying from 0 24 mmol l to 3 23 mmol l samples were collected at intervals values for ph eh dissolved oxygen

oi u s a no2 and nh4 were analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach u s a with a detection limit of 0 0002 mmol l and 0 002 mmol l respectively after completing the experiments the sediments in the columns from crslow ccmid and cclow were sectioned and sampled along the length of the column at an interval of 3 cm each sediment section was mixed homogeneously then subsamples were taken and kept moist subsamples in triplicate were used to measure nh4 which was analyzed by using 1 mol l kcl extraction and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach u s a the sediments in the columns from crmid and crhigh cchigh were not sampled timely so that nh4 in sediments were not measured 2 2 the numerical model 2 2 1 the flow and non reactive transport model first one dimensional saturated and steady state flow models were developed with modflow code for the five column experiments harbaugh et al 2000 then the conservative tracer br transport was performed with mt3dms code zheng 2010 zheng and wang 1999 to reflect the physical transport behavior of the column assuming saturated and steady state flow conditions the advection dispersion equation without considering the chemical reactions can be written as 1 c t x d c x x cv q s n e c s 2 c x 0 c 0 x x 0 l where c ml 3 is the concentration of the conservative tracer d l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d α l v in which α l l is the longitudinal dispersivity c 0 ml 3 is the initial concentration of the conservative tracer v lt 1 is the pore water velocity q s t 1 is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing fluid sources or sinks c s ml 3 is the concentration of the source or sink flux n e is the effective porosity l l is the length of the sediments in the column the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity were estimated by fitting the simulated values to the measurements the initial concentration was assigned to 0 mg l throughout the model domain the inlet of the solution was modeled as a point source and the bottom of the model domain was treated as the flux boundary since the outlet water continuously flowed out the columns 2 2 2 reactive transport model for denitrification in the monod kinetics the aerobic respiration was considered besides the denitrification process which represented the oxygen saturated condition introduced by the influent solutions without forced deoxygenation in the column experiments thermodynamically do was preferentially used as the electron acceptor until the concentration of do decreased to the level where the respiration was limited then the denitrification initiated with no3 as the main electron acceptor e g korom 1992 smith and harris jr 2007 rivett et al 2008 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 ch2o was used as the indicator of doc that represents the organic matter which has been widely applied in the previous work e g macquarrie et al 2001 brun et al 2002 brun and engesgaard 2002 lee et al 2006 miller et al

respectively γ ox and γ nitr ml 3 t 1 are the maximum rate constants for aerobic respiration and denitrification respectively k deg doc k ox and k nitr ml 3 are half saturation concentrations the substrate concentrations when the rate of growth is half of the maximum rate constants the model considered a one step reduction from no3 to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation due to the low concentration of no2 below 0 2 mmol l commonly detected in our experiments similarly reported in grau martãnez et al 2017 the accumulated no2 was reduced and negligible later in the experiment though high no2 concentrations were observed as a result of the transient accumulation during the denitrification process thus the potential accumulation of no2 as well as no and n2o were neglected in the model according to the stoichiometric relationship between no3 and organic carbon ch2o the reduction of 1 mol no3 needs 1 25 mol ch2o the organic matter sorbed in the sediments was 7 03 g kg indicating the equivalent amount of ch2o in the range of 0 1 mol l which was assumed to be sufficient labile organic matter using as the electron donor in the redox reactions complete denitrification considered as the one step reduction from no3 to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation can be expected under the condition with enough labile organic carbon e g rivett et al 2008 tallec et al 2008 rodríguez escales et al 2016 the geochemical modeling code phreeqc 2 parkhust and appelo 1999 was used to simulate the multicomponent reactive transport process in the column experiments five 1d models were built to represent different operational conditions based on the biogeochemical processes in the column experiments the composition data that included major anions no3 cl so4 2 hco3 and br major cations ca2 mg2 na and k nh4 doc ph pe and do were considered during the reactive transport simulations the monod kinetics were applied to simulate the associated redox reactions denitrification and aerobic respiration in addition water rock interactions were also considered the precipitation and dissolution of calcite and dolomite were modeled as thermodynamics equilibrium reactions the high cec in the column sediments implied the capability of the sediments for adsorbing the metal cations and thus ion exchange reactions that affect major cation concentrations were simulated simultaneously in the models the number of the cation exchange sites was assigned with the measured value the estimated effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity in the mt3dms models were used to simulate the solute transport process in the phreeqc models the initial kinetic parameters were determined based on previous studies greskowiak et al 2005 greskowiak et al 2006 prommer et al 2006 table 4 and subsequently calibrated aqueous speciation reactions were treated as equilibrium reactions and the aqueous activity coefficients were calculated from the davies equation the chemical compositions for initial solutions within the columns and for the influent solutions hnw mnw lnw are listed in table 3 2 3 model calibration five numerical models were calibrated individually in two steps firstly mt3dms models were calibrated by adjusting effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to fit the simulated breakthrough curves btcs with measured br concentrations secondly the reactive transport models were calibrated to obtain the kinetic parameters γ nitr and γ ox by matching the measured effluent multiple ions concentrations sensitivity analysis of the maximum rate constant for denitrification γ nitr and doc content are discussed in supplementary materials to better understand the nitrate transformation 2 4 models for evaluation of optimal range of flow rate and no3 concentration to further investigate the range of the no3 removal efficiency resulted by the different flow rates and no3 concentrations in low permeability sediments a series of simulations with flow rates of 0 023 0 096 m d and influent no3 concentrations of 0 65 mmol l 40 mg l to 3 23 mmol l 200 mg l were simulated the upper and lower limits of flow rates and the range of the concentrations tested in the models were determined based on the extensive observations at many contaminated sites panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 knabe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 bekele et al 2019 since reactive parameters are different in calibrated models under different flow rates the parameters in the model that had the closest flow rate were chosen for evaluation models three groups of simulations were conducted using the parameters from calibrated models where the parameters in the models with flow rate of 0 023 0 033 m d were taken from calibrated model with crslow those in the models with 0 034 0 044 m d from ccmid model and those in the models with 0 052 0 096 m d from crfast model 3 results 3 1 conservative tracer br transport in experiments and its model results the effluent peak concentration of br approximately approached the injected concentration the breakthrough times for crslow crmid and crfast were 140 h 69 h and 48 h respectively the experiments with lower flow rate had later breakthrough times the breakthrough times for cchigh ccmid and cclow were equally 69 h with the same flow rate the non reactive transport model was used to simulate the conservative tracer transport behavior by adjusting the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to fit the observed values the calibration flow and transport parameters are shown in table 5 and fig 2 of this work the modeled values for five experiments were generally in good agreement with the observed values however the classic advection dispersion model failed to capture the late heavy tail in breakthrough curves which may be caused by the non fickian transport behavior since the fit of the long tail by the model is not the focus of this study and improving the fit would take a significant amount of work the non fickian transport models such as multi rate mass transfer and fractional advection dispersion equation models have not been used to further calibrate the tail 3 2 experiment results of nitrate reactive transport 3 2 1 no3 transport behavior under different flow rates for all three experiments crslow crmid and crfast with different flow rates effluent no3 concentrations were all lower than the injected concentrations as shown in no3 btcs in fig 3a the peak effluent no3 concentrations were higher in the experiments with higher flow rates the effluent no3 concentrations approached the peak concentration of 0 12 mmol l at 140 h in crslow 1 52 mmol l at 69 h in crmid and 1 90 mmol l at 48 h in crfast respectively the behaviors of effluent peak concentrations for no2 were consistent with the peak effluent no3 concentrations that declined along with the decrease in the flow rate among different experiments the effluent nh4 concentrations fluctuated within a narrow range between 0 10 mmol l and 0 16 mmol l as shown in fig 3b at the end of the experiments slightly decreases observed in nh4 concentrations 3 2 2 no3 transport behaviors in columns with different influent no3 concentrations the peak effluent no3 concentrations decreased in the experiments with the lower injected no3 as shown in fig 4a the peak concentrations for effluent no3 were 1 52 mmol l at 69 h in cchigh with injected no3 concentration of 3 23 mmol l and 0 25 mmol l at 69 h in ccmid with injected no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l in cclow the effluent no3 concentrations had a fluctuation at 50 100 h and the highest no3 concentration was below 0 1 mmol l the peak effluent no2 concentrations were also observed when the effluent peak concentrations of no3 arrived however the concentrations were quite low which in cclow were below the detection limit results are not presented effluent nh4 concentrations changed between 0 11 0 16 mmol l in cchigh between 0 07 0 11 mmol l in ccmid and between 0 04 0 07 mmol l in cclow respectively fig 4b overall the changes in effluent nh4 were within narrow ranges 3 2 3 nh4 adsorption in sediments given that effluent nh4 concentrations fluctuated within certain concentration ranges without obvious correlations to no3 and no2 concentrations the adsorbed nh4 in sediments were measured to better identify the controlling process for no3 reactions fig 5 although the adsorbed nh4 concentrations varied with column depths the adsorbed nh4 concentrations in columns with a higher injected no3 concentration and a lower flow rate were higher compared to that with lower injected no3 concentration however the difference among the effluent nh4 concentrations for these experiments was minor nh4 concentrations changed within 1 2 2 mmol kg in crslow 0 6 1 2 mmol kg in ccmid and between 0 5 0 9 mmol kg in cclow the adsorbed nh4 concentrations in the sediments from the same batch but not used for the column experiments were 0 67 0 77 mmol kg which were similar to that in ccmid and cclow 3 3 reactive transport modeling results in the phreeqc models the kinetic parameters the maximum rate constant for denitrification γ nitr and aerobic respiration γ ox were mainly estimated γ ox was estimated similarly as 1 57 10 7 mol l s for all simulations the estimated maximum rate constants for denitrification γ nitr hereinafter referred to as denitrification rate in different models are shown in table 6 3 3 1 the comparison between simulated and observed major ions and nh4 concentrations the simulated concentrations for major ions and nh4 concentrations were compared to the observed data fig 6 shows the overall reasonable agreement between the observed and simulated values especially the trend of the ions concentrations change with time indicating the reliability of the established reactive transport models nh4 was originally adsorbed in the experimentally used sediments which may occur during the pre saturation of the column sediments the model results further confirmed that nh4 concentrations were affected by adsorption instead of redox reaction which was consistent with the previous studies e g charbeneau 1981 dontsova et al 2005 chen et al 2017 the impacts of ion exchange reactions controlled by the concentrations of the competing ions as well as cec on nh4 adsorption have been reported previously e g charbeneau 1981 benjelloun et al 2001 dontsova et al 2005 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 however the competing ions ca2 na had a negative effect on the nh4 adsorption chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 thus nh4 concentrations from the effluent in our experiments exhibited no opposite relationship between ca2 and na concentrations 3 3 2 modeling results of no3 under different flow rates the evolution of effluent no3 concentrations was replicated reasonably well by the models fig 7 except for the long tail in crmid fig 3a gaseous nitrogen n2 was not measured but calculated by the reactive transport models the arrival time of its peak concentration was consistent with that of no3 concentration the calculated peak concentrations for gaseous nitrogen n2 in crslow crmid and crfast were 1 42 mmol l 0 88 mmol l and 0 63 mmol l respectively which decreased with the increase in flow rate within the columns fig 3c the removed n mass no3 removal efficiency accounted for 97 53 and 43 of total injected n mass in crslow crmid and crfast respectively while the gaseous nitrogen n2 consisted of 97 53 and 42 of the total injected n in crslow crmid and crfast respectively the no3 removal efficiency increased with a decrease in flow rate the calculated denitrification rates γ nitr of crslow crmid and crfast were 1 8 10 8 mol l s 1 9 10 8 mol l s and 2 0 10 8 mol l s respectively the denitrification rate increased with an increase in flow rate 3 3 3 modeling results of no3 under different injected no3 concentrations the models captured the general trend of effluent no3 concentration changes in cchigh ccmid and cclow fig 4a and fig 7 the general trend of calculated gaseous nitrogen n2 concentrations was consistent with that of no3 concentrations the calculated peak concentrations for gaseous nitrogen n2 in cchigh ccmid and cclow were 0 88 mmol l 0 48 mmol l and 0 09 mmol l respectively fig 4c the removed n mass no3 removal efficiency accounted for 53 85 and 77 of total injected n mass in cchigh ccmid and cclow respectively while the gaseous nitrogen n2 consisted of 53 85 and 77 of the total injected n in cchigh ccmid and cclow respectively although the removal efficiency of no3 was the highest in ccmid when the injected no3 concentration was 1 29 mmol l the denitrified no3 mass was the highest in cchigh due to the highest injected concentration the calculated denitrification rates γ nitr of cchigh ccmid and cclow were 1 9 10 8 mol l s 1 29 10 8 mol l s and 4 5 10 9 mol l s respectively the denitrification rate increased along with the increase of injected no3 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 controlling processes for nitrate reduction for all experiments effluent no3 concentrations were lower than the injected concentrations accompanying the accumulation of no2 and the leaching of nh4 for all columns assimilatory nitrate reduction is less likely to occur because no2 and nh4 were not produced simultaneously for dissimilatory nitrate reduction the final product is gaseous nitrogen n2 for denitrification and nh4 for dnra korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 lansdown et al 2012 during the experiments the occurrence and increase of no2 was synchronous with the breakthrough of no3 whereas the effluent nh4 concentration did not increase significantly in comparison with the initial values no2 as the byproduct of denitrification accumulated with the reduction of no3 this suggested that denitrification was the predominant geochemical reaction controlling no3 transportation within the columns assuming that nh4 was derived from dnra the proportion of n that participated in dnra accounted for less than 20 of the injected n in crslow crmid cchigh and crfast but reached 34 in ccmid surprisingly therefore the proportion of n that participated in dnra was much lower compared to the proportion that was reduced by denitrification furthermore in cclow the leachate n of effluent nh4 was more than the injected n and the model results further validated that effluent nh4 was derived from the desorption from above analysis it can also be concluded that the reduction of no3 is dominated by denitrification within the column kunjikutty et al 2007 discovered that anoxic conditions that favor denitrification are more likely to be formed when the soil profile was completely saturated in the saturated water condition clay is more favorable to denitrification than sand mainly due to the fact that low permeability media is more conducive to strengthening denitrification akhavan et al 2013 the sediments used in this study were silty clay which was low permeability media and thus favorable to promote denitrification this is consistent with the conclusion that the denitrification was the primary reaction for no3 reduction in tongzhou site proposed by wu et al 2018 4 2 effects of flow rates and no3 concentrations on denitrification rate as no3 was reduced by denitrification the effluent no3 concentrations were lower than the injected concentrations for all of the experiments the experimental results showed the accumulation of minor no2 during denitrification however the fluctuation of effluent no3 concentration and the effluent concentration of no2 below the detection limit in cclow suggested that no3 was denitrified without no2 accumulation this was different from the results of the other experimental columns likely due to the fact that denitrification would be inhibited by a low concentration of no3 e g schipper et al 2004 as the influent solution was oxygenated water do would compete with no3 to become the electron acceptor in addition when the influent no3 concentration was low the competition process is particularly noticeable the denitrification rate was much lower in cclow which ascribed to the lowest concentration of no3 during the study the decreases of the peak concentrations of no3 and higher removal efficiencies were observed in experiments with lower flow rates but the same injected no3 concentration which was consistent with the observation in gu et al 2007 this was because the lower flow rate would cause longer residence time of water containing no3 and lead to a sufficient reaction time for denitrification as a result the final no3 concentration in effluent solution decreased and more no3 was removed by the reactions however the longer residence time in the column with a lower flow rate may lead to a more significant decline of doc substrate which is possible to further inhibit the denitrification process and result in the decrease in denitrification rate as discussed in zarnetske et al 2011 the organic carbon sorbed in the sediments was used as the electron donor in redox reactions in this study when less doc remained in the columns under the lower flow rate due to the longer time leaching out fig 8 the inhibition of the denitrification process may occur a damkohler number d a which is a dimensionless number describing the ratio of the reactive time to the residence time was used as another indicator to analyze the denitrification rate relative to the residence time for simulations with different flow rates it can be described by the following equation gu et al 2007 lari and moeini 2015 guo and brusseau 2017b 5 d a v n l v where v n γ nit c n is the unit maximum rate under denitrification c n was defined as the amount of the no3 provided for denitrification and equal as the input concentration as reported in previous studies e g guo and brusseau 2017b when d a is in the range of 0 01 and 100 it is the sensitive zone wherein a change of residence time dependent on discharge rate could exert a significant impact on the concentration change d a of 1 63 0 84 and 0 60 in crslow crmid and crfast respectively located in the range wherein apparent no3 concentration changes can be caused by different flow rates as discussed in section 3 3 2 low d a 1 in crmid and crfast indicated slow reaction compared to the advection which resulted in the decrease of no3 removal efficiencies the shorter reaction time and the less no3 removal due to denitrification lead to the decreased no3 removal efficiencies to further investigate the effects of no3 concentrations on denitrification under the same flow rate cchigh ccmid and cclow were conducted with the increase of the injected no3 concentrationfrom cclow ccmid and cchigh under the same flow rate peak concentrations of no3 and no2 in the effluent increased accordingly which was consistent with the results from laboratory research from liu et al 2017 in the same flow rate more no3 mass was reduced by denitrification with an increase of the injected no3 concentration it was demonstrated that the mass of no3 removed by denitrification increased per unit of time when more no3 was injected denitrification rate increased with the increase of the injected no3 concentration which may be caused by more electron acceptors provided by influent no3 mass thus the available denitrified no3 mass also increased when the solutions with higher no3 concentration were injected under the same flow rate which increased the denitrification rate and led to more no3 mass to be reduced by denitrification per unit of time also when the sufficient no3 was carried into column with the flow having higher rate no3 removal efficiency decreased but the denitrification rate increased this may ascribe to the sufficient no3 eluted by the fast flow that could participate in denitrification and provide more electron acceptors leading to the higher denitrification rate however this only occurs when enough no3 mass can support the reaction under the fast flow otherwise the denitrification rate may be inhibited by the available no3 mass even having the same flow rate the lower concentration of no3 resulted in lower denitrification rate because the low no3 concentration containing solution provided less electron acceptors the higher flow rate caused shorter residence time and led to inadequate time for reaction thus no3 removal efficiency decreased with the higher flow rate 4 3 evaluation of no3 removal efficiencies in the low permeability media at different conditions in reality groundwater flow rates varied noticeably in the different aquifers and catchments e g kunjikutty et al 2007 gutierrez and baran 2009 liu et al 2017 knabe et al 2018 medici et al 2019 simulations with flow rates in the range of 0 023 0 096 m d that observed at contaminated sites were conducted to explore the no3 removal efficiency in low permeability sediments results showed that removal efficiencies decreased with the increase of the flow rate fig 9a indicating that more no3 mass can be removed with sufficient reaction time resulting from longer residence time no3 removal efficiency was up to 90 when the flow rate was below 0 026 m d and the residence time was more than 3 days in the low permeability model domain due to the strong spatial variation of no3 concentration from 0 24 mmol l to 3 23 mmol l observed in many contaminated sites e g panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 wu et al 2018 more simulations with no3 concentrations varying from 0 65 mmol l 40 mg l to 3 23 mmol l 200 mg l were conducted the modeling results in fig 9b showed that the removal efficiency reached the highest 85 with no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l but declined with either higher or lower no3 the simulations were conducted at the moderate flow rate of 0 044 m d lower removal efficiencies for simulations with high no3 concentrations may be ascribed to the insufficient time for reaction on the other side the decrease of removal efficiencies was due to the less electron accepters and decreased denitrification rates because of low no3 concentrations no3 removal efficiency was constrained by the large flow rate and high no3 concentration in contrast it has been demonstrated that sufficient doc as the electron donor can promote the denitrification e g devlin et al 2000 cortez et al 2011 misiti et al 2011 ray et al 2014 rodríguez escales et al 2014 therefore providing adequate organic matter could be a possible way to maximize the no3 removal efficiency for conditions with high no3 concentration or high flow rate 5 conclusion column experiments were conducted with a focus on understanding how the flow rates and no3 concentrations affect the denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiencies in the column experiments with low permeability media the effluent no3 concentrations were reduced by denitrification with minor no2 accumulation and nh4 leaching the monod equation was used to simulate the denitrification process and no3 was considered to be reduced directly to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation the nitrate transportation was sensitive to denitrification rate as well as doc content according to the simulation results denitrification rates increased with higher injected no3 concentration under a higher flow rate higher no3 removal efficiency was achieved with longer residence time resulting from a lower flow rate however no3 removal efficiencies did not have a positive correlation with no3 concentration no3 removal efficiency was the highest at a moderate concentration of 1 29 mmol l therefore when exploring the no3 reactive transport process in field sites it is necessary to characterize the temporal and spatial flow rate as well as no3 concentration distribution considering the variation of flow rate and no3 concentration in different field sites a further analysis was carried out for a set of simulations with varied flow rates and no3 concentrations that determined based on the observations in fields with low permeability sediments it was concluded that in the low permeability sediments no3 removal efficiency could reach 90 when the flow rate was less than 0 026 m d moreover the maximum removal efficiency 85 can be achieved under the moderate no3 concentration 1 29 mmol l at the flow rate of 0 044 m d the lower no3 concentration led to the decrease of the removal efficiency which accounted for less electron acceptor and lower denitrification rate above all when it comes to the remediation of no3 pollution high no3 removal efficiency can be achieved with longer residence time at a lower flow rate furthermore the excessively high or much low concentration of no3 can result in low no3 removal efficiency to maximize the no3 removal efficiency and optimize the remediation strategies with high no3 concentration pollution the effect of doc on denitrification should be further investigated declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was financially funded by national

1481,to better understand the combined effects of flow rate and no3 concentration on denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency in the low permeability media a set of column experiments with different flow rates and injected no3 concentrations were conducted denitrification processes under these different conditions were simulated using the phreeqc code that couples the biogeochemical reactions and hydrological transport processes in these reactive transport models monod kinetics were applied to describe the denitrification process it was found that among the experiments conducted in this study the low flow rate 0 023 m d resulted in the low denitrification rate but high no3 removal efficiency meanwhile no3 removal efficiency was the highest 85 under moderate no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l although denitrification rate increased in response to the increase of no3 concentration the model results also indicated that no3 removal efficiency of 97 can be achieved with relatively low flow rate and high influent no3 concentration the results in this study provide insights into no3 remediation and the temporal and spatial flow rate as well as no3 concentration distribution should be pre evaluated for the effective removal strategies keywords denitrification nitrate concentration flow rate column experiments reactive transport modeling 1 introduction nitrate pollution in groundwater has become an environmental issue globally which has mainly been ascribed to the use of nitrogen in fertilizers particularly manure jahangir et al 2012 khan and spalding 2004

among which denitrification has been recognized as one of the most significant processes for nitrate removal haugen et al 2002 libhaber and soares 1988 robertson and cherry 1995 schipper 1998 schipper et al 2004 field observations have indicated that denitrification is affected by groundwater flow rates and hydraulic residence time as well as the no3 concentration distributions longer hydraulic residence time could promote denitrification and accelerate the reduction of no3 concentrations e g gutierrez and baran 2009 panno et al 2008 kunjikutty et al 2007 akhavan et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2011 the hydraulic permeability of the soil sediments is one of major factors impacting solute transport and reaction as reported in previous studies e g gutierrez and baran 2009 guo and brusseau 2017a guo et al 2019 medici et al 2019 it has been found that the decreasing flow rate and lower permeability of soil medium at a deeper depth of aquifer can result in lower no3 concentrations e g gutierrez and baran 2009 medici et al 2019 the seasonal changes of no3 concentrations were also observed in agricultural areas due to the variation of the residence time caused by the irrigation recharge e g hoffmann et al 2006 panno et al 2008 the impacts of no3 concentration on denitrification have also been reported in previous studies e g korom 1992 smith and harris jr 2007 rivett et al 2008 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 blackmer and bremner 1978 concluded that excessive no3 concentration affected denitrification by inhibiting the formation of n2 0 but forming n2o instead which caused the termination of the denitrification process the ratio of n2o to n2 was also affected by low no3 concentration and the reduction of no3 by denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was determined by the ratio of organic carbon to no3 fazzolari et al 1998 rütting et al 2011 therefore the different no3 concentrations at field sites resulted in different denitrification rates affecting the removal process of no3 hoffmann et al 2006 evaluated the impacts of both flow rates and no3 concentration and the results showed that no3 removal efficiency decreased because of the low no3 concentration at the site despite the long residence time groundwater flow rates and no3 concentrations vary temporally and spatially in the aquifer and watersheds composed of different sediment types which results in different denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiencies e g huwe and totsche 1995 kunjikutty et al 2007 panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 nizzoli et al 2010 sgouridis et al 2011 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 column experiments which can be easily designed are usually considered as simplified alternatives to the complex hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions at the field site and have been widely used to evaluate the impacts of the flow rates and no3 concentration on denitrification e g gu et al 2007 misiti et al 2011 boisson et al 2014 grathwohl 2014 liu et al 2017 the column experiments under various flow rates of gu et al 2007 indicated that a lower effluent no3 concentration was obtained as the flow rate decreased moreover similar experiments were conducted in columns packed with different porous media such as gravel sand silt and clay to investigate both the effects of hydraulic resident time and no3 concentration on denitrification e g misiti et al 2011 liu et al 2017 the results from above column experiments are consistent with the field observations that more no3 mass is reduced by denitrification with longer residence time e g liu et al 2017 whereas misiti et al 2011 found no effect of influent no3 concentration on its removal when the electron donors i e organic matters were sufficient which confronts the field findings that denitrification is inhabited by low no3 concentration e g hoffmann et al 2006 the reactive transport models have been widely used to reproduce the no3 reaction and transport process the single species reactive models such as the first order kinetics or first order decay models were applied to simulate the denitrification process e g molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 zhang et al 2006 krause et al 2009 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 some of which were coupled with the groundwater flow for field investigations e g molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 krause et al 2009 however the single species reactive transport models neglect the transformation between different valence nitrogen and the geochemical interactions that would affect nitrogen elements occurring between the aqueous compositions and porous media a multicomponent reactive model that integrates the denitrification and geochemical interactions was developed which has successfully represented the n involved reaction and other simultaneously occurring reactions e g rodríguez escales et al 2014 the monod equation has

multicomponent reactive transport model to simulate the enhanced denitrification processes by injecting ethanol as the external electron donor at the field despite existed studies on the effects of the flow rate and no3 concentration on denitrification based on the field tests and column experiments few of them investigated no3 reaction and transport process by integrated analysis of the biogeochemical geochemical and groundwater flow processes with the coupled flow and multicomponent reactive transport model in this paper multicomponent reactive numerical models were developed and calibrated by the experimental data then used for further qualitative analysis to achieve the following objectives 1 to unravel the mechanism how the combinations of different hydrological conditions and no3 concentrations affect the denitrification processes 2 to determine the optimal range of flow rate and no3 concentration in order to achieve the maximum no3 removal efficiency in the low permeability media 2 methods 2 1 description of the experiments the experimental system includes a 5 l inflow reservoir a 45 cm long and 15 cm diameter pvc column a peristaltic pump and a scale plate used to measure the pressure head as illustrated in fig 1 below these parts are connected by silicone tubes the column was equipped with 1 inflow port 4 pressure head monitoring ports that were established across the column at 9 cm intervals 1 sample port that is 27 cm apart from the bottom of the sediments and 1 outflow port established at the top of the column it is also equipped with an influent chamber with a height of 5 cm at the bottom of the column the influent solution was forced to flow from the bottom to the top sediments were collected from the shallow part of an aquifer with a depth of 0 5 m below ground in the tongzhou test site in beijing china wu et al 2018 the detailed information for sediments is listed in table 1 the sediments contained 7 03 g kg organic matter the cation exchange capacity cec of the sediments was 281 mmol kg which indicates that metal cations are likely to be adsorbed and ion exchange reactions may occur mineralogically the sediments were composed primarily of quartz sio2 41 albite na ca al si al 3o8 19 and calcite caco3 16 with small amounts of clinochlore mg al fe 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 9 domolite camg co3 2 5 k feldspar kalsi3o8 4 mica kal2si3alo10 oh 2 4 and pyrite fes2 2 more details about the physicochemical composition of the sediments were described in wu et al 2018 the sediments were stored in cloth bags and brought to the laboratory of basin hydrology and wetland eco restoration wuhan in the laboratory the sediments were spread thin to air dry at room temperature then griddled and passed through a 2 mm sieve before packing the sediments however quartz sand and a 150 μm nitex mesh were placed above the influent chamber to create uniform flow the air dried sediments were packed into 27 increments and each increment had the same mass of sediments to ensure the homogeneity in the columns the resulting density of the sediments in the column was approximately 1 65 g cm3 through the entire packing process each increment was tightly packed before the next one was placed on top until the columns were completely filled subsequently it was necessary to put the 150 μm nitex mesh and quartz sand on the sediments to avoid material loss at the beginning of the experiment the column was saturated with artificial groundwater agw that has the same chemical composition as that of groundwater from the tongzhou test site but is specially set without no3 the total porosity of the sediments was measured during the saturation subsequently agw was persistently pumped into the column until the pressure head remained constant and the internal flow rate reached steady state no3 and no2 in the effluent were below the detection limit as well during the equilibration period the flow rate and hydraulic conductivity were measured after that the 2 l influent solution with no3 was injected through a peristaltic pump continuously conservative tracer 1 25 mmol l br was contained in the influent solution to reflect the physical transport behavior at last agw was pumped into the column with the same flow rate until the end of the experiment bromine was monitored via a br ion selective electrode during the experiment the experiment was ended when the concentration of br was below the detection limit five column experiments were conducted simultaneously to explore no3 removal by denitrification under different operational conditions table 2 1 crslow was eluted with high no3 concentration water hnw at a constant flow rate of 0 023 m d 2 crmid cchigh was eluted with hnw at a constant flow rate of 0

oi u s a no2 and nh4 were analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach u s a with a detection limit of 0 0002 mmol l and 0 002 mmol l respectively after completing the experiments the sediments in the columns from crslow ccmid and cclow were sectioned and sampled along the length of the column at an interval of 3 cm each sediment section was mixed homogeneously then subsamples were taken and kept moist subsamples in triplicate were used to measure nh4 which was analyzed by using 1 mol l kcl extraction and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach u s a the sediments in the columns from crmid and crhigh cchigh were not sampled timely so that nh4 in sediments were not measured 2 2 the numerical model 2 2 1 the flow and non reactive transport model first one dimensional saturated and steady state flow models were developed with modflow code for the five column experiments harbaugh et al 2000 then the conservative tracer br transport was performed with mt3dms code zheng 2010 zheng and wang 1999 to reflect the physical transport behavior of the column assuming saturated and steady state flow conditions the advection dispersion equation without considering the chemical reactions can be written as 1 c t x d c x x cv q s n e c s 2 c x 0 c 0 x x 0 l where c ml 3 is the concentration of the conservative tracer d l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d α l v in which α l l is the longitudinal dispersivity c 0 ml 3 is the initial concentration of the conservative tracer v lt 1 is the pore water velocity q s t 1 is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing fluid sources or sinks c s ml 3 is the concentration of the source or sink flux n e is the effective porosity l l is the length of the sediments in the column the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity were estimated by fitting the simulated values to the measurements the initial concentration was assigned to 0 mg l throughout the model domain the inlet of the solution was modeled as a point source and the bottom of the model domain was treated as the flux boundary since the outlet water continuously flowed out the columns 2 2 2 reactive transport model for denitrification in the monod kinetics the aerobic respiration was considered besides the denitrification process which represented the oxygen saturated condition introduced by the influent solutions without forced deoxygenation in the column experiments thermodynamically do was preferentially used as the electron acceptor until the concentration of do decreased to the level where the respiration was limited then the denitrification initiated with no3 as the main electron acceptor e g korom 1992 smith and harris jr 2007 rivett et al 2008 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 ch2o was used as the indicator of doc that represents the organic matter which has been widely applied in the previous work e g macquarrie et al 2001 brun et al 2002 brun and engesgaard 2002 lee et al 2006 miller et al

respectively γ ox and γ nitr ml 3 t 1 are the maximum rate constants for aerobic respiration and denitrification respectively k deg doc k ox and k nitr ml 3 are half saturation concentrations the substrate concentrations when the rate of growth is half of the maximum rate constants the model considered a one step reduction from no3 to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation due to the low concentration of no2 below 0 2 mmol l commonly detected in our experiments similarly reported in grau martãnez et al 2017 the accumulated no2 was reduced and negligible later in the experiment though high no2 concentrations were observed as a result of the transient accumulation during the denitrification process thus the potential accumulation of no2 as well as no and n2o were neglected in the model according to the stoichiometric relationship between no3 and organic carbon ch2o the reduction of 1 mol no3 needs 1 25 mol ch2o the organic matter sorbed in the sediments was 7 03 g kg indicating the equivalent amount of ch2o in the range of 0 1 mol l which was assumed to be sufficient labile organic matter using as the electron donor in the redox reactions complete denitrification considered as the one step reduction from no3 to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation can be expected under the condition with enough labile organic carbon e g rivett et al 2008 tallec et al 2008 rodríguez escales et al 2016 the geochemical modeling code phreeqc 2 parkhust and appelo 1999 was used to simulate the multicomponent reactive transport process in the column experiments five 1d models were built to represent different operational conditions based on the biogeochemical processes in the column experiments the composition data that included major anions no3 cl so4 2 hco3 and br major cations ca2 mg2 na and k nh4 doc ph pe and do were considered during the reactive transport simulations the monod kinetics were applied to simulate the associated redox reactions denitrification and aerobic respiration in addition water rock interactions were also considered the precipitation and dissolution of calcite and dolomite were modeled as thermodynamics equilibrium reactions the high cec in the column sediments implied the capability of the sediments for adsorbing the metal cations and thus ion exchange reactions that affect major cation concentrations were simulated simultaneously in the models the number of the cation exchange sites was assigned with the measured value the estimated effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity in the mt3dms models were used to simulate the solute transport process in the phreeqc models the initial kinetic parameters were determined based on previous studies greskowiak et al 2005 greskowiak et al 2006 prommer et al 2006 table 4 and subsequently calibrated aqueous speciation reactions were treated as equilibrium reactions and the aqueous activity coefficients were calculated from the davies equation the chemical compositions for initial solutions within the columns and for the influent solutions hnw mnw lnw are listed in table 3 2 3 model calibration five numerical models were calibrated individually in two steps firstly mt3dms models were calibrated by adjusting effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to fit the simulated breakthrough curves btcs with measured br concentrations secondly the reactive transport models were calibrated to obtain the kinetic parameters γ nitr and γ ox by matching the measured effluent multiple ions concentrations sensitivity analysis of the maximum rate constant for denitrification γ nitr and doc content are discussed in supplementary materials to better understand the nitrate transformation 2 4 models for evaluation of optimal range of flow rate and no3 concentration to further investigate the range of the no3 removal efficiency resulted by the different flow rates and no3 concentrations in low permeability sediments a series of simulations with flow rates of 0 023 0 096 m d and influent no3 concentrations of 0 65 mmol l 40 mg l to 3 23 mmol l 200 mg l were simulated the upper and lower limits of flow rates and the range of the concentrations tested in the models were determined based on the extensive observations at many contaminated sites panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 knabe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 bekele et al 2019 since reactive parameters are different in calibrated models under different flow rates the parameters in the model that had the closest flow rate were chosen for evaluation models three groups of simulations were conducted using the parameters from calibrated models where the parameters in the models with flow rate of 0 023 0 033 m d were taken from calibrated model with crslow those in the models with 0 034 0 044 m d from ccmid model and those in the models with 0 052 0 096 m d from crfast model 3 results 3 1 conservative tracer br transport in experiments and its model results the effluent peak concentration of br approximately approached the injected concentration the breakthrough times for crslow crmid and crfast were 140 h 69 h and 48 h respectively the experiments with lower flow rate had later breakthrough times the breakthrough times for cchigh ccmid and cclow were equally 69 h with the same flow rate the non reactive transport model was used to simulate the conservative tracer transport behavior by adjusting the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to fit the observed values the calibration flow and transport parameters are shown in table 5 and fig 2 of this work the modeled values for five experiments were generally in good agreement with the observed values however the classic advection dispersion model failed to capture the late heavy tail in breakthrough curves which may be caused by the non fickian transport behavior since the fit of the long tail by the model is not the focus of this study and improving the fit would take a significant amount of work the non fickian transport models such as multi rate mass transfer and fractional advection dispersion equation models have not been used to further calibrate the tail 3 2 experiment results of nitrate reactive transport 3 2 1 no3 transport behavior under different flow rates for all three experiments crslow crmid and crfast with different flow rates effluent no3 concentrations were all lower than the injected concentrations as shown in no3 btcs in fig 3a the peak effluent no3 concentrations were higher in the experiments with higher flow rates the effluent no3 concentrations approached the peak concentration of 0 12 mmol l at 140 h in crslow 1 52 mmol l at 69 h in crmid and 1 90 mmol l at 48 h in crfast respectively the behaviors of effluent peak concentrations for no2 were consistent with the peak effluent no3 concentrations that declined along with the decrease in the flow rate among different experiments the effluent nh4 concentrations fluctuated within a narrow range between 0 10 mmol l and 0 16 mmol l as shown in fig 3b at the end of the experiments slightly decreases observed in nh4 concentrations 3 2 2 no3 transport behaviors in columns with different influent no3 concentrations the peak effluent no3 concentrations decreased in the experiments with the lower injected no3 as shown in fig 4a the peak concentrations for effluent no3 were 1 52 mmol l at 69 h in cchigh with injected no3 concentration of 3 23 mmol l and 0 25 mmol l at 69 h in ccmid with injected no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l in cclow the effluent no3 concentrations had a fluctuation at 50 100 h and the highest no3 concentration was below 0 1 mmol l the peak effluent no2 concentrations were also observed when the effluent peak concentrations of no3 arrived however the concentrations were quite low which in cclow were below the detection limit results are not presented effluent nh4 concentrations changed between 0 11 0 16 mmol l in cchigh between 0 07 0 11 mmol l in ccmid and between 0 04 0 07 mmol l in cclow respectively fig 4b overall the changes in effluent nh4 were within narrow ranges 3 2 3 nh4 adsorption in sediments given that effluent nh4 concentrations fluctuated within certain concentration ranges without obvious correlations to no3 and no2 concentrations the adsorbed nh4 in sediments were measured to better identify the controlling process for no3 reactions fig 5 although the adsorbed nh4 concentrations varied with column depths the adsorbed nh4 concentrations in columns with a higher injected no3 concentration and a lower flow rate were higher compared to that with lower injected no3 concentration however the difference among the effluent nh4 concentrations for these experiments was minor nh4 concentrations changed within 1 2 2 mmol kg in crslow 0 6 1 2 mmol kg in ccmid and between 0 5 0 9 mmol kg in cclow the adsorbed nh4 concentrations in the sediments from the same batch but not used for the column experiments were 0 67 0 77 mmol kg which were similar to that in ccmid and cclow 3 3 reactive transport modeling results in the phreeqc models the kinetic parameters the maximum rate constant for denitrification γ nitr and aerobic respiration γ ox were mainly estimated γ ox was estimated similarly as 1 57 10 7 mol l s for all simulations the estimated maximum rate constants for denitrification γ nitr hereinafter referred to as denitrification rate in different models are shown in table 6 3 3 1 the comparison between simulated and observed major ions and nh4 concentrations the simulated concentrations for major ions and nh4 concentrations were compared to the observed data fig 6 shows the overall reasonable agreement between the observed and simulated values especially the trend of the ions concentrations change with time indicating the reliability of the established reactive transport models nh4 was originally adsorbed in the experimentally used sediments which may occur during the pre saturation of the column sediments the model results further confirmed that nh4 concentrations were affected by adsorption instead of redox reaction which was consistent with the previous studies e g charbeneau 1981 dontsova et al 2005 chen et al 2017 the impacts of ion exchange reactions controlled by the concentrations of the competing ions as well as cec on nh4 adsorption have been reported previously e g charbeneau 1981 benjelloun et al 2001 dontsova et al 2005 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 however the competing ions ca2 na had a negative effect on the nh4 adsorption chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 thus nh4 concentrations from the effluent in our experiments exhibited no opposite relationship between ca2 and na concentrations 3 3 2 modeling results of no3 under different flow rates the evolution of effluent no3 concentrations was replicated reasonably well by the models fig 7 except for the long tail in crmid fig 3a gaseous nitrogen n2 was not measured but calculated by the reactive transport models the arrival time of its peak concentration was consistent with that of no3 concentration the calculated peak concentrations for gaseous nitrogen n2 in crslow crmid and crfast were 1 42 mmol l 0 88 mmol l and 0 63 mmol l respectively which decreased with the increase in flow rate within the columns fig 3c the removed n mass no3 removal efficiency accounted for 97 53 and 43 of total injected n mass in crslow crmid and crfast respectively while the gaseous nitrogen n2 consisted of 97 53 and 42 of the total injected n in crslow crmid and crfast respectively the no3 removal efficiency increased with a decrease in flow rate the calculated denitrification rates γ nitr of crslow crmid and crfast were 1 8 10 8 mol l s 1 9 10 8 mol l s and 2 0 10 8 mol l s respectively the denitrification rate increased with an increase in flow rate 3 3 3 modeling results of no3 under different injected no3 concentrations the models captured the general trend of effluent no3 concentration changes in cchigh ccmid and cclow fig 4a and fig 7 the general trend of calculated gaseous nitrogen n2 concentrations was consistent with that of no3 concentrations the calculated peak concentrations for gaseous nitrogen n2 in cchigh ccmid and cclow were 0 88 mmol l 0 48 mmol l and 0 09 mmol l respectively fig 4c the removed n mass no3 removal efficiency accounted for 53 85 and 77 of total injected n mass in cchigh ccmid and cclow respectively while the gaseous nitrogen n2 consisted of 53 85 and 77 of the total injected n in cchigh ccmid and cclow respectively although the removal efficiency of no3 was the highest in ccmid when the injected no3 concentration was 1 29 mmol l the denitrified no3 mass was the highest in cchigh due to the highest injected concentration the calculated denitrification rates γ nitr of cchigh ccmid and cclow were 1 9 10 8 mol l s 1 29 10 8 mol l s and 4 5 10 9 mol l s respectively the denitrification rate increased along with the increase of injected no3 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 controlling processes for nitrate reduction for all experiments effluent no3 concentrations were lower than the injected concentrations accompanying the accumulation of no2 and the leaching of nh4 for all columns assimilatory nitrate reduction is less likely to occur because no2 and nh4 were not produced simultaneously for dissimilatory nitrate reduction the final product is gaseous nitrogen n2 for denitrification and nh4 for dnra korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 lansdown et al 2012 during the experiments the occurrence and increase of no2 was synchronous with the breakthrough of no3 whereas the effluent nh4 concentration did not increase significantly in comparison with the initial values no2 as the byproduct of denitrification accumulated with the reduction of no3 this suggested that denitrification was the predominant geochemical reaction controlling no3 transportation within the columns assuming that nh4 was derived from dnra the proportion of n that participated in dnra accounted for less than 20 of the injected n in crslow crmid cchigh and crfast but reached 34 in ccmid surprisingly therefore the proportion of n that participated in dnra was much lower compared to the proportion that was reduced by denitrification furthermore in cclow the leachate n of effluent nh4 was more than the injected n and the model results further validated that effluent nh4 was derived from the desorption from above analysis it can also be concluded that the reduction of no3 is dominated by denitrification within the column kunjikutty et al 2007 discovered that anoxic conditions that favor denitrification are more likely to be formed when the soil profile was completely saturated in the saturated water condition clay is more favorable to denitrification than sand mainly due to the fact that low permeability media is more conducive to strengthening denitrification akhavan et al 2013 the sediments used in this study were silty clay which was low permeability media and thus favorable to promote denitrification this is consistent with the conclusion that the denitrification was the primary reaction for no3 reduction in tongzhou site proposed by wu et al 2018 4 2 effects of flow rates and no3 concentrations on denitrification rate as no3 was reduced by denitrification the effluent no3 concentrations were lower than the injected concentrations for all of the experiments the experimental results showed the accumulation of minor no2 during denitrification however the fluctuation of effluent no3 concentration and the effluent concentration of no2 below the detection limit in cclow suggested that no3 was denitrified without no2 accumulation this was different from the results of the other experimental columns likely due to the fact that denitrification would be inhibited by a low concentration of no3 e g schipper et al 2004 as the influent solution was oxygenated water do would compete with no3 to become the electron acceptor in addition when the influent no3 concentration was low the competition process is particularly noticeable the denitrification rate was much lower in cclow which ascribed to the lowest concentration of no3 during the study the decreases of the peak concentrations of no3 and higher removal efficiencies were observed in experiments with lower flow rates but the same injected no3 concentration which was consistent with the observation in gu et al 2007 this was because the lower flow rate would cause longer residence time of water containing no3 and lead to a sufficient reaction time for denitrification as a result the final no3 concentration in effluent solution decreased and more no3 was removed by the reactions however the longer residence time in the column with a lower flow rate may lead to a more significant decline of doc substrate which is possible to further inhibit the denitrification process and result in the decrease in denitrification rate as discussed in zarnetske et al 2011 the organic carbon sorbed in the sediments was used as the electron donor in redox reactions in this study when less doc remained in the columns under the lower flow rate due to the longer time leaching out fig 8 the inhibition of the denitrification process may occur a damkohler number d a which is a dimensionless number describing the ratio of the reactive time to the residence time was used as another indicator to analyze the denitrification rate relative to the residence time for simulations with different flow rates it can be described by the following equation gu et al 2007 lari and moeini 2015 guo and brusseau 2017b 5 d a v n l v where v n γ nit c n is the unit maximum rate under denitrification c n was defined as the amount of the no3 provided for denitrification and equal as the input concentration as reported in previous studies e g guo and brusseau 2017b when d a is in the range of 0 01 and 100 it is the sensitive zone wherein a change of residence time dependent on discharge rate could exert a significant impact on the concentration change d a of 1 63 0 84 and 0 60 in crslow crmid and crfast respectively located in the range wherein apparent no3 concentration changes can be caused by different flow rates as discussed in section 3 3 2 low d a 1 in crmid and crfast indicated slow reaction compared to the advection which resulted in the decrease of no3 removal efficiencies the shorter reaction time and the less no3 removal due to denitrification lead to the decreased no3 removal efficiencies to further investigate the effects of no3 concentrations on denitrification under the same flow rate cchigh ccmid and cclow were conducted with the increase of the injected no3 concentrationfrom cclow ccmid and cchigh under the same flow rate peak concentrations of no3 and no2 in the effluent increased accordingly which was consistent with the results from laboratory research from liu et al 2017 in the same flow rate more no3 mass was reduced by denitrification with an increase of the injected no3 concentration it was demonstrated that the mass of no3 removed by denitrification increased per unit of time when more no3 was injected denitrification rate increased with the increase of the injected no3 concentration which may be caused by more electron acceptors provided by influent no3 mass thus the available denitrified no3 mass also increased when the solutions with higher no3 concentration were injected under the same flow rate which increased the denitrification rate and led to more no3 mass to be reduced by denitrification per unit of time also when the sufficient no3 was carried into column with the flow having higher rate no3 removal efficiency decreased but the denitrification rate increased this may ascribe to the sufficient no3 eluted by the fast flow that could participate in denitrification and provide more electron acceptors leading to the higher denitrification rate however this only occurs when enough no3 mass can support the reaction under the fast flow otherwise the denitrification rate may be inhibited by the available no3 mass even having the same flow rate the lower concentration of no3 resulted in lower denitrification rate because the low no3 concentration containing solution provided less electron acceptors the higher flow rate caused shorter residence time and led to inadequate time for reaction thus no3 removal efficiency decreased with the higher flow rate 4 3 evaluation of no3 removal efficiencies in the low permeability media at different conditions in reality groundwater flow rates varied noticeably in the different aquifers and catchments e g kunjikutty et al 2007 gutierrez and baran 2009 liu et al 2017 knabe et al 2018 medici et al 2019 simulations with flow rates in the range of 0 023 0 096 m d that observed at contaminated sites were conducted to explore the no3 removal efficiency in low permeability sediments results showed that removal efficiencies decreased with the increase of the flow rate fig 9a indicating that more no3 mass can be removed with sufficient reaction time resulting from longer residence time no3 removal efficiency was up to 90 when the flow rate was below 0 026 m d and the residence time was more than 3 days in the low permeability model domain due to the strong spatial variation of no3 concentration from 0 24 mmol l to 3 23 mmol l observed in many contaminated sites e g panno et al 2008 gutierrez and baran 2009 wu et al 2018 more simulations with no3 concentrations varying from 0 65 mmol l 40 mg l to 3 23 mmol l 200 mg l were conducted the modeling results in fig 9b showed that the removal efficiency reached the highest 85 with no3 concentration of 1 29 mmol l but declined with either higher or lower no3 the simulations were conducted at the moderate flow rate of 0 044 m d lower removal efficiencies for simulations with high no3 concentrations may be ascribed to the insufficient time for reaction on the other side the decrease of removal efficiencies was due to the less electron accepters and decreased denitrification rates because of low no3 concentrations no3 removal efficiency was constrained by the large flow rate and high no3 concentration in contrast it has been demonstrated that sufficient doc as the electron donor can promote the denitrification e g devlin et al 2000 cortez et al 2011 misiti et al 2011 ray et al 2014 rodríguez escales et al 2014 therefore providing adequate organic matter could be a possible way to maximize the no3 removal efficiency for conditions with high no3 concentration or high flow rate 5 conclusion column experiments were conducted with a focus on understanding how the flow rates and no3 concentrations affect the denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiencies in the column experiments with low permeability media the effluent no3 concentrations were reduced by denitrification with minor no2 accumulation and nh4 leaching the monod equation was used to simulate the denitrification process and no3 was considered to be reduced directly to gaseous nitrogen n2 without no2 accumulation the nitrate transportation was sensitive to denitrification rate as well as doc content according to the simulation results denitrification rates increased with higher injected no3 concentration under a higher flow rate higher no3 removal efficiency was achieved with longer residence time resulting from a lower flow rate however no3 removal efficiencies did not have a positive correlation with no3 concentration no3 removal efficiency was the highest at a moderate concentration of 1 29 mmol l therefore when exploring the no3 reactive transport process in field sites it is necessary to characterize the temporal and spatial flow rate as well as no3 concentration distribution considering the variation of flow rate and no3 concentration in different field sites a further analysis was carried out for a set of simulations with varied flow rates and no3 concentrations that determined based on the observations in fields with low permeability sediments it was concluded that in the low permeability sediments no3 removal efficiency could reach 90 when the flow rate was less than 0 026 m d moreover the maximum removal efficiency 85 can be achieved under the moderate no3 concentration 1 29 mmol l at the flow rate of 0 044 m d the lower no3 concentration led to the decrease of the removal efficiency which accounted for less electron acceptor and lower denitrification rate above all when it comes to the remediation of no3 pollution high no3 removal efficiency can be achieved with longer residence time at a lower flow rate furthermore the excessively high or much low concentration of no3 can result in low no3 removal efficiency to maximize the no3 removal efficiency and optimize the remediation strategies with high no3 concentration pollution the effect of doc on denitrification should be further investigated declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was financially funded by national

1482,to better understand the origin of the saline groundwater in the pearl river delta prd china water samples were collected from local aquifers rainfall regions and rivers for isotopic and hydrochemical analysis the hydraulic connections between the aquifers in the study area were tested by analyzing a series of water samples from different months in one hydrological year january 2017 january 2018 the total dissolved solids tds results show that the highly saline groundwater only occurs in the granites which indicates that the tds distribution depends on the permeability of the aquifer material variations in the tds and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o respectively of the water samples from different months reflect a dynamic balance among evaporation and precipitation in a hydrological year additionally the very old radiocarbon 14c ages and undetectable amounts of tritium 3h in most of the groundwater samples suggest that the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer is high in general the saline groundwater tds 5 g l in the area mainly originated primarily from seawater intrusion in the past meanwhile the water contents of saline groundwater were affected by evaporation and long term geochemical processes such as water rock sulfate reduction methanogenesis and ion exchange the fresh groundwater in the area is from modern

pipelines in underground construction such as tunnels subway stations and building basements luo et al 2015 in addition coastal fresh groundwater is a vulnerable water resource since excessive groundwater pumping may result in deterioration through seawater intrusion bear et al 1999 barlow and reichard 2010 currently seawater intrusion is considered to be a major threat to coastal aquifers

water rock interaction evaporation and anthropogenic factors edmunds and wright 1979 carreira et al 2014 borrok et al 2018 abu al naeem et al 2019 in the long term interactions between seawater and groundwater the evolution of the groundwater quality depends on the salinity origins and hydraulic connections with other water bodies however in some cases the hydraulic connections are relatively weak in coastal aquifers due to low permeability buffers guangzhou city is located on a coastal plain that is part of the pearl river delta prd in south china fig 1 recently due to serious pollution occurring in surface water the demand for groundwater has increased with the rapid development of guangzhou city however groundwater in some areas is also not suitable for water supply due to its high salinity with total dissolved solids tds exceeding 10 20 g l ght guangdong hydrogeological team 1981 wang and jiao 2012 zhi et al 2015 it has been suggested that groundwater salinity may result from connate marine water during the holocene transgression period in the prd wang and jiao 2012 while the evolution of groundwater is still unclear thus it is necessary to clarify the origins and hydraulic connections of the aquifers for estimating the groundwater quality in this study we present time series of hydrochemical stable and radioactive isotope data from water samples collected from

in the southern part of guangzhou city where high salinity groundwater has been detected the composition of a seawater sample collected from south china sea is used in this study song and li 1994 zhang et al 2015 samples were collected from groundwater rainfall and various rivers including the shizi ocean river jiaomen waterway hongqili waterway and pearl river estuary fig 1 in january and march the dry season lasts from december to march may and september the rainy season lasts from april to september of 2017 and january of 2018 there were 31 boreholes diameter 108 168 mm in the study area for groundwater sample collection and detection the depths of the boreholes range from 21 to 92 m with a mean depth of 49 m among these boreholes 15 boreholes were screened at the bedrock only while the other boreholes were screened at both the quaternary sediment and bedrock layers table s1 all river samples were collected using a 2 l size plexiglass water sampler the sampler consists of a plexiglass barrel and a galvanized iron ring rinse the container in stream water three times before the water was collected for most river samples we collected water standing on the bridge and kept the sampler at least 30 cm down into the water surface if there is no bridge over the river we stand at the bank of the river using a long stick to collect the water away from the bank for the groundwater in the wells sampling was carried out after a 40 min pumping period to flush the sampling system the water sampling system and bottles were rinsed three times with the water to be sampled before collection the samples were stored in 500 ml wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe sampling bottles for determining the inorganic radiocarbon 14c in 2 l narrow mouth polypropylene bottles for major ion analysis in 10 ml head space glass bottles for δd and δ18o determination and in 2 l wide mouth polypropylene bottles for tritium 3h analysis the groundwater was filtrated by passing the water through 0 45 μm filter paper except the water for the δd and δ18o tests to avoid excessive evaporation during filtration each bottle was carefully sealed to prevent the occurrence of bubbles within the water sample six groundwater samples and two river samples were analyzed for the radiocarbon contents of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and tritium 3h each groundwater sample for 14c analysis was dosed with a drop 50 μl of saturated hgcl2 to sterilize the samples to inhibit microbial activity before the bottle was sealed the sampling locations for 14c and 3h were designed based on the location from north to south and the tds level was also considered there are eight rainfall samples collected in january march may june storm and september 2017 in the area the water was collected instantly using headspace vials and laboratory film to prevent evaporation in this study we collected the rain water samples in the way of event based sampling so the limited number of rainfalls may not enough to build a convincing lmwl therefore we use these samples combined with data from the guangzhou international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea gnip

stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with the water gas equilibration method in the stable isotope laboratory at florida state university the stable isotope results are reported in the standard δ

std is the corresponding isotope ratio of the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for hydrogen and oxygen or vpdb for carbon the δ2h and δ18o values are normalized to the

regarded as modern water the dic 14c ages of the groundwater samples are older than 1000 yrs 1 kyr b p 4 results 4 1 distribution of groundwater salinity the data from the 31 boreholes fig 1 were used to generate a classified tds map january 2017 with the topography geospatial data cloud 2020 of the study area fig 2 because of the low elevation lower than the china sea level datum of some areas in southern guangzhou the elevation of the water level ranges from 6 0 to 25 7 m table s1 in general the water level gradually decreases from north to south except for the two small rocky hills in nansha district although the differences in water level in the boreholes between january and may are small the water levels are on average 0 1 m higher in may than in january 2017 the water levels of different river sites are higher than the well water levels near the river in january table s1 therefore groundwater is recharged by river water in this area the tds results from the 31 wells show that the tds is low in the north and high in the middle and south of the study area tds ranged from 0 1 19 5 g l with a mean value of 4 1 g l in january and 0 1 18 6 g l with a mean value of 4 0 g l in may 2017 based on the salinity level the local groundwater is classified into 4 categories freshwater tds 1 g l brackish water 1 g l tds 5 g l saline water 5 g l tds 10 g l and highly saline water tds 10 g l it is worth noting that the salinity of highly saline water is only approximately 30 seawater in this study fresh groundwater is found in the north of the panyu haizhu and tianhe districts and high salinity groundwater is concentrated in the south of the study area fig 2 the salinity distribution is discontinuous in the area and the highly saline groundwater only occurs in the granite wells which is most likely due to the relatively low permeability of the granite material average k is 0 5 m d the river water in the estuaries of the pearl river also varies from north to south however there are salinity control dams along the river to prevent seawater from moving inland along the river channels therefore river water generally has a low salinity 4 2 hydrochemical properties of the waters the ion ca2 mg2 na k2 cl so4 2 hco3 fe2 and fe3 concentrations and the water quality parameters ph ec temperature and tds of the 18 well samples and 2 river samples r10 and r20 collected in january 2018 are listed in table 1 the tds values of the groundwater range from 0 1 19 6 g l in january 2018 which is consistent with the tds values in january 2017 the tds of groundwater from january 2017 to january 2018 are listed in table s1 as shown in table 1 the relatively high concentrations of fe2 than fe3 and the strongly negative orp values infer a redox state from almost all of the wells the piper diagrams fig 3 show that the major cations are na and ca2 which vary with salinity and the red arrow indicates cation exchange as a result of seawater intrusion the water type of the highly saline groundwater samples is cl na the two river samples however are two distinctively different water types according to the piper diagram the samples taken from the northern rivers are the hco3 ca type and the water type of the southern samples is clna which shows the effect of seawater intrusion along the river channel the relationships of the major ions and tds versus cl combining the mixing line of a theoretical seawater sample and the rainwater are drawn in fig 4 the tds of the groundwater is strongly correlated with the cl concentration in a nonlinear trend and follows the mixing line in the fig 4 a which suggests that seawater is the main source of the high tds in the groundwater at this location the concentrations of major cations such as mg2 and na show a trend similar to that of tds vs cl fig 4b c the concentrations of ca2 k and so4 2 are weakly related to cl the concentrations of k and so4 2 in the groundwater samples are below the mixing line fig 8d e however the water concentrations of ca2 fall above the mixing line in fig 8 f the water concentrations are as high as the contents of 70 of the seawater 4 3 isotopic compositions of the waters the stable isotope results of the groundwater and river samples are summarized in table s1 the stable isotopic contents of the groundwater samples collected in january range from 7 6 to 2 4 for δ18o and from 49 to 17 for δ2h the water samples collected in may have compositions varying from 7 3 to 1 9 for δ18o and from 50 to 13 for δ2h the average δ18o and δd values of the local rainwater are 2 1 and 3 in january respectively the summer rain samples have much lower δ18o and δd values of 7 5 and 49 respectively due to the amount effect dansgaard 1964 johnson and ingram 2004 the storm water sample that we collected during the heavy rains associated with typhoon hato yielded δ18o and δd values of 11 6 and 85 respectively which are much lower than those of normal rainwater fig 5a the trend line of the rainfall samples is established as the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 7δ18o 15 0 it compares well with the previously calculated lmwl of guangzhou δd 8 7δ18o 10 1 by using the method of precipitation amount weighted least squares regression pwlsr iaea wmo 1986 1989 the weighted annual average δd and δ18o values of the precipitation in the area are 41 and 5 9 respectively iaea wmo 1986 1989 the weighted averages δd and δ18o values of precipitation for the summer april to september are 42 and 6 0 respectively while those for the winter december to march are 24 and 3 7 the trend line of stable isotope contents of groundwater samples from 2017 was established as the evaporation line el in this study fig 5b considering that isotopes of highly saline groundwater are affected by seawater this el was established using groundwater samples with tds lower than 10 g l the radiocarbon activities of the groundwater samples and the two river samples are reported as percent modern carbon pmc the pmc values of the groundwater range from 15 5 to 80 9 and the δ13c values range from 17 8 to 0 6 table 2 the lowest and highest radiocarbon activities are found in wells located in the north of the study area q138 and q124 respectively which infers a poor hydraulic connection of aquifers in this area the pmc values of the river samples exceed 90 r19 and r20 in table 2 indicating that the major composition of the river water is modern water the apparent ages are not correlated with the hco3 contents of the water samples the tritium activities in most of the groundwater and river samples are too low to be detected except for one river sample r19 1 6 0 2 tu 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of the groundwater the hydraulic connection between other water bodies and groundwater in aquifers in the prd is the key to the groundwater salinity evolution previous studies have proposed that the study area used to be submerged by seawater in the mid holocene zong 2004 meng et al 2017 when the climate was much warmer than today in this paper we examine the origins of groundwater and salinity based on measurements of stable and radioactive isotopes combined with the hydrochemical properties of water samples the isotopic composition of the river water samples did not change significantly along the rivers from the north of the study area towards the south china sea this finding suggests that the upward flow of seawater is insignificant in january and may which is reasonable given the salinity control dams built along the rivers the river samples are enriched in heavy isotopes in may compared to those collected in january while the stable isotopic compositions of the local rainfall display the opposite variation pattern this phenomenon indicates that the river water is mainly composed of the upstream flow from the bei river and the dong river with little contribution from direct runoff of local rainfall in addition the tds levels of the river water samples are higher in january average 907 mg l than in may average 175 mg l table s1 due to water evaporation and the interaction with minerals in rocks and soils groundwater typically has a higher tds than rainwater the river water in the dry season mainly originates from upper stream groundwater and receives a greatly reduced contribution from meteoric precipitation compared with that of the wet season therefore the higher tds of the river water in winter is the result of the increasing proportion of groundwater and decreasing proportion of rainwater most groundwater and river water samples have δd and δ18o values that plot on or close to the lmwl while some of the groundwater samples trend towards the standard mean ocean water i e vsmow δ18o 0 and δ2h 0 fig 5a the intercept of lmwl is higher than that of lmwl gnip although the slopes of the trends are basically the same this phenomenon is reasonable since the gnip data were collected approximately 30 yrs ago and the climate has changed in recent years the lmwl established by our data is more appropriate to explain the behavior of isotopes from precipitation in recent years some other groundwater samples with low isotope concentrations are over the lmwl which are far away from the lmwl gnip but close to a summer rain sample in this study in gray dashed circle in the fig 5a in addition the isotopes of groundwater with tds lower than 10 g l show a trend of evaporation and the crossing point of lmwl and el is quite close to the summer rain sample which infers that modern summer rainfall should be a water source of the groundwater 5 2 the origin and seasonal variation of salinity the variation of tds and δ18o in time series of multiple wells indicate the different hydraulic activity of groundwater the tds levels in the groundwater samples from six wells i e q124 q129 q138 q141 q143 and s47 are quite stable in the different months fig 6a however the tds levels in the water samples from some wells i e q134 q140 q145 q150 and s50 located in the panyu and nansha districts varied considerably over time suggesting that the aquifers are connected with other water sources such as seawater and rainfall to a certain extent the δ18o data show increasing trends from january to september which is a trend of evaporation along with the increasing temperature in the area the δ18o values of the local rainwater are higher in the winter and lower in the summer due to the amount effect dansgaard 1964 fig 5a hence the increasing δ18o value of the groundwater fig 6b is not a reflection of the increasing local rainwater recharge in the corresponding month despite the high rain amount in summer seawater intrusion increases the tds and δ18o levels in the aquifer however in most wells the tds variation from january 2017 to september 2017 shows poor correlation with δ18o this indicates that seawater intrusion is not the only influencing factor for these wells for example the higher δ18o values except q145 observed in the groundwater in september compared to january 2017 imply that the groundwater was affected by strong evaporation because of high temperatures in the summer fig 5b combining the results of the tds and δ18o values we can speculate that seawater intrusion is insignificant in this area the large increase in tds and δ18o in well q145 is considered to be a result of uncommon modern seawater intrusion in september likely caused by storm surge associated with strong storms such as typhoon hato in 2017 yu et al 2015 otherwise it could be contaminated by artificial activities generally there is only one of the wells showing this evidence so further study is needed to determine what happened to this well since seawater has high chloride and δ18o values compared to freshwater we used these two proxies to test the effect of seawater intrusion on the groundwater salinity the positive relationship between the chloride and δ18o values supports that the groundwater salinity is influenced by seawater in fig 7 the composition of seawater was assumed to be 19 4 g l for cl 35 g l for tds and 1 8 0 for δ18o zhang et al 2015 in this study the other end member appears to have low chloride contents and is depleted in 18o i e δ18o 7 0 the samples shown in the fig 7 are enriched in δ18o and low cl is a result of evaporation a mixing line was drawn to obtain a better idea of the degree of seawater intrusion fig 7 the mixing ratios of δ18o versus cl composition are as high as 70 seawater the seawater ratio of highly saline groundwater 10 g l tds 19 5 g l in this study ranges from 30 to 70 the calculated mixing ratio is consistent with the hydrochemistry results in fig 4 assuming that the age of the local rainwater is zero the apparent age versus δ18o and tds of the six groundwater samples and the two river samples collected in september and the six rainwater samples collected in january march and may are shown in fig 8 in addition the six samples fall into three clusters in both plots of age vs δ18o fig 8a and age vs tds fig 8b the dic in the seawater in the study area is older than the modern day dic 500 yr b p mitsuguchi et al 2007 based on the dic age 2 9 kyr b p of s50 70 of seawater we can conjecture that the age of the end member seawater is approximately 3 4 kyr b p a period when the climate was much warmer than today and the seawater covered the study area zong et al 2009a a comparison of the ages of the river water samples shows that the groundwater is relatively old as shown in fig 8 three groundwater samples with relatively high δ18o are characterized by very old dic 14c ages and high salinity 5 g l tds 10 g l values which corresponds to past rainwater recharge which accompanied by geochemical processes that increased the groundwater salinity and water evaporation by combining the isotope results with the hydrochemical data of the water bodies the following two end members of the groundwater in the prd are identified precipitation and seawater it is important to emphasize that the apparent 14c ages of the water samples are not regarded as the true mean residence times of the groundwater in this study unfortunately the ages calculated using the tamers tamers 1975 and revised fontes and garnier han and plummer 2013 methods by netpathxl 1 5 parkhurst and charlton 2008 are not showing reasonable results to support a clear insight of the residence time of groundwater the 14c ages of the dic in the groundwater and surface water samples are confounded by various processes including dic sources e g dissolution of 14c dead carbonates and other geochemical processes such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis clark and fritz 1997 regardless of the true ages the groundwater samples are all older than 100 yrs as indicated by the barely detectable tritium in all the water samples table 2 in general we can conclude that saline groundwater is most likely ancient seawater trapped in the ground after marine regression for two reasons first according to the tds and isotope results the highly saline groundwater is of medium age and enriched in 18o relative to modern precipitation which refers to the intrusion of seawater second the tds and stable isotopes do not change significantly with time for most of the wells indicating that the modern seawater intrusion is insignificant 5 3 hydrochemical processes of the groundwater geochemical processes have been active for a long time as the apparent ages of the dic in the groundwater samples are older than 2 kyr b p table 2 moreover the results of the major ion contents indicate that the groundwater interacts with the rock or soil in the aquifers for a long time fig 4 there is no carbonate aquifer in the study area however it prevails the north of the guangzhou city which is upstream of groundwater calcium which is one of the dominant cations of the groundwater with tds from 5 g l to 10 g l which is consistent with the results of the calculation of saturation index si the calcite in more than half of the groundwater samples are over saturated 24 out of 42 groundwater samples and the si values are from 1 4 0 9 table s1 in addition the si values of dolomite are from 3 2 9 which infers the dolomite of some water samples are also over saturated table s1 the deceasing potassium and sulfate reduction are among the processes by which bacteria obtain energy for metabolism from the oxidation of relatively simple organic compounds fig 4 d e which is deduced by the strongly reducing environment of the groundwater table 1 in addition there are samples with low sodium concentrations in fig 4 c which indicates that the sodium in the water could be exchanged with calcium in the aquifer solids such as clay minerals due to the high sodium of seawater mixing the sodium adsorption ratio sar values of the groundwater samples range 0 1 meq l to 44 3 meq l table s1 which confirms the cation exchange of na and ca2 6 summary and conclusions the isotopic and hydrochemical analyses of the water samples from natural water bodies including groundwater rainfall storms and rivers collected in different months provide new insights into the groundwater salinity origins in the prd based on the study results the following conclusions are made 1 in general the groundwater salinity is high in the south panyu and nansha districts and low in the north tianhe district in the prd the highly saline groundwater is discontinuously distributed in the southern study area especially in the granite aquifers this could be the result of the weak groundwater dynamics because of the low permeability of the granite material there is no evidence of modern seawater intrusion in the area 2 the tds of groundwater shows a slight decrease in summer and isotopic concentrations are enriched in most wells which reveals that the groundwater is getting charged in summer to some extent temporal variations in the stable isotopic concentrations of the groundwater reflect the dynamic balance of precipitation and evaporation 3 there are two end member water sources for groundwater in southern guangzhou seawater and meteoric precipitation the ancient seawater mainly contributes to the saline groundwater tds 5 g l the proportion of seawater in high salinity groundwater is approximately 0 3 0 7 10 g l tds 19 5 g l in the study area in addition the water contents of saline groundwater 5 g l tds 10 g l could be affected by evaporation and long term geochemical processes such as water rock interactions sulfate reduction methanogenesis and ion exchange the fresh groundwater in the area is derived from modern meteoric precipitation generally modern day seawater intrusion is insignificant due to strict government

1482,to better understand the origin of the saline groundwater in the pearl river delta prd china water samples were collected from local aquifers rainfall regions and rivers for isotopic and hydrochemical analysis the hydraulic connections between the aquifers in the study area were tested by analyzing a series of water samples from different months in one hydrological year january 2017 january 2018 the total dissolved solids tds results show that the highly saline groundwater only occurs in the granites which indicates that the tds distribution depends on the permeability of the aquifer material variations in the tds and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o respectively of the water samples from different months reflect a dynamic balance among evaporation and precipitation in a hydrological year additionally the very old radiocarbon 14c ages and undetectable amounts of tritium 3h in most of the groundwater samples suggest that the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer is high in general the saline groundwater tds 5 g l in the area mainly originated primarily from seawater intrusion in the past meanwhile the water contents of saline groundwater were affected by evaporation and long term geochemical processes such as water rock sulfate reduction methanogenesis and ion exchange the fresh groundwater in the area is from modern

pipelines in underground construction such as tunnels subway stations and building basements luo et al 2015 in addition coastal fresh groundwater is a vulnerable water resource since excessive groundwater pumping may result in deterioration through seawater intrusion bear et al 1999 barlow and reichard 2010 currently seawater intrusion is considered to be a major threat to coastal aquifers globally sridharan and senthil nathan 2017 moreover there are some other processes that change groundwater chemical contents in a coastal aquifer such as the mixing of ancient seawater ion exchange water rock interaction evaporation and anthropogenic factors edmunds and wright 1979 carreira et al 2014 borrok et al 2018 abu al naeem et al 2019 in the long term interactions between seawater and groundwater the evolution of the groundwater quality depends on the salinity origins and hydraulic connections with other water bodies however in some cases the hydraulic connections are relatively weak in coastal aquifers due to low permeability buffers guangzhou city is located on a coastal plain that is part of the pearl river delta prd in south china fig 1 recently due to serious pollution occurring in surface water the demand for groundwater has increased with the rapid development of guangzhou city however groundwater in some areas is also not suitable for water supply due to its high salinity with total dissolved solids tds exceeding 10 20 g l ght guangdong hydrogeological team 1981 wang and jiao 2012 zhi et al 2015 it has been suggested that groundwater salinity may result from connate marine water during the holocene transgression period in the prd wang and jiao 2012 while the evolution of groundwater is still unclear thus it is necessary to clarify the origins and hydraulic connections of the aquifers for estimating the groundwater quality in this study we present time series of hydrochemical stable and radioactive isotope data from water samples collected from local aquifers rivers rainfalls and storm events in one hydrological year january 2017 january 2018 we aim to better understand the evolution of the groundwater quality in the prd and identify the groundwater salinity origins by analyzing isotopic and hydrochemical processes in the coastal aquifer 2 study area the study area is located in the south of guangzhou city northern part of the prd

zhang et al 2015 samples were collected from groundwater rainfall and various rivers including the shizi ocean river jiaomen waterway hongqili waterway and pearl river estuary fig 1 in january and march the dry season lasts from december to march may and september the rainy season lasts from april to september of 2017 and january of 2018 there were 31 boreholes diameter 108 168 mm in the study area for groundwater sample collection and detection the depths of the boreholes range from 21 to 92 m with a mean depth of 49 m among these boreholes 15 boreholes were screened at the bedrock only while the other boreholes were screened at both the quaternary sediment and bedrock layers table s1 all river samples were collected using a 2 l size plexiglass water sampler the sampler consists of a plexiglass barrel and a galvanized iron ring rinse the container in stream water three times before the water was collected for most river samples we collected water standing on the bridge and kept the sampler at least 30 cm down into the water surface if there is no bridge over the river we stand at the bank of the river using a long stick to collect the water away from the bank for the groundwater in the wells sampling was carried out after a 40 min pumping period to flush the sampling system the water sampling system and bottles were rinsed three times with the water to be sampled before collection the samples were stored in 500 ml wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe sampling bottles for determining the inorganic radiocarbon 14c in 2 l narrow mouth polypropylene bottles for major ion analysis in 10 ml head space glass bottles for δd and δ18o determination and in 2 l wide mouth polypropylene bottles for tritium 3h analysis the groundwater was filtrated by passing the water through 0 45 μm filter paper except the water for the δd and δ18o tests to avoid excessive evaporation during filtration each bottle was carefully sealed to prevent the occurrence of bubbles within the water sample six groundwater samples and two river samples were analyzed for the radiocarbon contents of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and tritium 3h each groundwater sample for 14c analysis was dosed with a drop 50 μl of saturated hgcl2 to sterilize the samples to inhibit microbial activity before the bottle was sealed the sampling locations for 14c and 3h were designed based on the location from north to south and the tds level was also considered there are eight rainfall samples collected in january march may june storm and september 2017 in the area the water was collected instantly using headspace vials and laboratory film to prevent evaporation in this study we collected the rain water samples in the way of event based sampling so the limited number of rainfalls may not enough to build a convincing lmwl therefore we use these samples combined with data from the guangzhou international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea gnip station iaea wmo 1986 1989 to approximately represent the isotopic composition of the local precipitation in the prd 3 2 laboratory method before groundwater sampling a multi parameter ph ion

oxidation reduction potential orp temperature and tds of the groundwater the major cation ca2 mg2 na and k concentrations of the river and groundwater samples collected in 2017 were analyzed with an icap 7600 icp oes analyzer and the anions cl so4 2 no3 were determined with an ion chromatograph model 883 basic ic plus metrohm while the hco3 concentrations of the water samples were measured by a

spectrometer the samples collected in 2018 were measured by guangdong province research center for geoanalysis the water contents of na k and fe3 were measured using a haiguang ggx 600 atomic absorption spectrophotometer and the titration methods were used to measure the concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 the concentrations of fe2 and so4 2 were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1700 pharmaspec shimadzu japan the 13c 12c ratios were measured relative to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb standard for radiocarbon age correction radiocarbon dating was performed by the keck carbon cycle ams laboratory university of california irvine the radiocarbon age represents the measured radiocarbon age of dic corrected by isotopic fractionation using δ13c the tritium concentrations of the water samples were measured using a low background liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 003 in the analytical laboratory of the beijing research institute of uranium geology the detection limit for tritium is 1 3 tu the stable isotope samples were analyzed using a finnigan gas bench ii auto carbonate water device interfaced to a finnigan mat delta plus xp stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with the water gas equilibration method in the stable isotope laboratory at florida state university the stable isotope results are reported in the standard δ notation as δd δ18o and δ13c values 1 δ r sa r std 1 1000 where δ is the isotopic concentration of the sample r sa is the heavy to light isotope ratio in the sample i e d h 18o 16o or 13c 12c and r std is the corresponding isotope ratio of the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for hydrogen and oxygen or vpdb for carbon the δ2h and δ18o values are normalized to the vsmow standard light antarctic precipitation slap scale with reproducibilities of approximately 2 and 0 2 respectively the δ13c precision is 0 15 to better understand the groundwater origin the residence time of the groundwater is estimated using the radiogenic 3h and 14c isotopes in the water gonfiantini 1986 clark and fritz 1997 radiocarbon concentrations are given as fractions of the modern standard δ14c and conventional radiocarbon age following the conventions of stuiver and polach 1977 the 14c ages of dic in the two river samples are relatively young 500 yr b p which is regarded as modern water the dic 14c ages of the groundwater samples are older than 1000 yrs 1 kyr b p 4 results 4 1 distribution of groundwater salinity the data from the 31 boreholes fig 1 were used to generate a classified tds map january 2017 with the topography geospatial data cloud 2020 of the study area fig 2 because of the low elevation lower than the china sea level datum of some areas in southern guangzhou the elevation of the water level ranges from 6 0 to 25 7 m table s1 in general the water level gradually decreases from north to south except for the two small rocky hills in nansha district although the differences in water level in the boreholes between january and may are small the water levels are on average 0 1 m higher in may than in january 2017 the water levels of different river sites are higher than the well water levels near the river in january table s1 therefore groundwater is recharged by river water in this area the tds results from the 31 wells show that the tds is low in the north and high in the middle and south of the study area tds ranged from 0 1 19 5 g l with a mean value of 4 1 g l in january and 0 1 18 6 g l with a mean value of 4 0 g l in may 2017 based on the salinity level the local groundwater is classified into 4 categories freshwater tds 1 g l brackish water 1 g l tds 5 g l saline water 5 g l tds 10 g l and highly saline water tds 10 g l it is worth noting that the salinity of highly saline water is only approximately 30 seawater in this study fresh groundwater is found in the north of the panyu haizhu and tianhe districts and high salinity groundwater is concentrated in the south of the study area fig 2 the salinity distribution is discontinuous in the area and the highly saline groundwater only occurs in the granite wells which is most likely due to the relatively low permeability of the granite material average k is 0 5 m d the river water in the estuaries of the pearl river also varies from north to south however there are salinity control dams along the river to prevent seawater from moving inland along the river channels therefore river water generally has a low salinity 4 2 hydrochemical properties of the waters the ion ca2 mg2 na k2 cl so4 2 hco3 fe2 and fe3 concentrations and the water quality parameters ph ec temperature and tds of the 18 well samples and 2 river samples r10 and r20 collected in january 2018 are listed in table 1 the tds values of the groundwater range from 0 1 19 6 g l in january 2018 which is consistent with the tds values in january 2017 the tds of groundwater from january 2017 to january 2018 are listed in table s1 as shown in table 1 the relatively high concentrations of fe2 than fe3 and the strongly negative orp values infer a redox state from almost all of the wells the piper diagrams fig 3 show that the major cations are na and ca2 which vary with salinity and the red arrow indicates cation exchange as a result of seawater intrusion the water type of the highly saline groundwater samples is cl na the two river samples however are two distinctively different water types according to the piper diagram the samples taken from the northern rivers are the hco3 ca type and the water type of the southern samples is clna which shows the effect of seawater intrusion along the river channel the relationships of the major ions and tds versus cl combining the mixing line of a theoretical seawater sample and the rainwater are drawn in fig 4 the tds of the groundwater is strongly correlated with the cl concentration in a nonlinear trend and follows the mixing line in the fig 4 a which suggests that seawater is the main source of the high tds in the groundwater at this location the concentrations of major cations such as mg2 and na show a trend similar to that of tds vs cl fig 4b c the concentrations of ca2 k and so4 2 are weakly related to cl the concentrations of k and so4 2 in the groundwater samples are below the mixing line fig 8d e however the water concentrations of ca2 fall above the mixing line in fig 8 f the water concentrations are as high as the contents of 70 of the seawater 4 3 isotopic compositions of the waters the stable isotope results of the groundwater and river samples are summarized in table s1 the stable isotopic contents of the groundwater samples collected in january range from 7 6 to 2 4 for δ18o and from 49 to 17 for δ2h the water samples collected in may have compositions varying from 7 3 to 1 9 for δ18o and from 50 to 13 for δ2h the average δ18o and δd values of the local rainwater are 2 1 and 3 in january respectively the summer rain samples have much lower δ18o and δd values of 7 5 and 49 respectively due to the amount effect dansgaard 1964 johnson and ingram 2004 the storm water sample that we collected during the heavy rains associated with typhoon hato yielded δ18o and δd values of 11 6 and 85 respectively which are much lower than those of normal rainwater fig 5a the trend line of the rainfall samples is established as the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 7δ18o 15 0 it compares well with the previously calculated lmwl of guangzhou δd 8 7δ18o 10 1 by using the method of precipitation amount weighted least squares regression pwlsr iaea wmo 1986 1989 the weighted annual average δd and δ18o values of the precipitation in the area are 41 and 5 9 respectively iaea wmo 1986 1989 the weighted averages δd and δ18o values of precipitation for the summer april to september are 42 and 6 0 respectively while those for the winter december to march are 24 and 3 7 the trend line of stable isotope contents of groundwater samples from 2017 was established as the evaporation line el in this study fig 5b considering that isotopes of highly saline groundwater are affected by seawater this el was established using groundwater samples with tds lower than 10 g l the radiocarbon activities of the groundwater samples and the two river samples are reported as percent modern carbon pmc the pmc values of the groundwater range from 15 5 to 80 9 and the δ13c values range from 17 8 to 0 6 table 2 the lowest and highest radiocarbon activities are found in wells located in the north of the study area q138 and q124 respectively which infers a poor hydraulic connection of aquifers in this area the pmc values of the river samples exceed 90 r19 and r20 in table 2 indicating that the major composition of the river water is modern water the apparent ages are not correlated with the hco3 contents of the water samples the tritium activities in most of the groundwater and river samples are too low to be detected except for one river sample r19 1 6 0 2 tu 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of the groundwater the hydraulic connection between other water bodies and groundwater in aquifers in the prd is the key to the groundwater salinity evolution previous studies have proposed that the study area used to be submerged by seawater in the mid holocene zong 2004 meng et al 2017 when the climate was much warmer than today in this paper we examine the origins of groundwater and salinity based on measurements of stable and radioactive isotopes combined with the hydrochemical properties of water samples the isotopic composition of the river water samples did not change significantly along the rivers from the north of the study area towards the south china sea this finding suggests that the upward flow of seawater is insignificant in january and may which is reasonable given the salinity control dams built along the rivers the river samples are enriched in heavy isotopes in may compared to those collected in january while the stable isotopic compositions of the local rainfall display the opposite variation pattern this phenomenon indicates that the river water is mainly composed of the upstream flow from the bei river and the dong river with little contribution from direct runoff of local rainfall in addition the tds levels of the river water samples are higher in january average 907 mg l than in may average 175 mg l table s1 due to water evaporation and the interaction with minerals in rocks and soils groundwater typically has a higher tds than rainwater the river water in the dry season mainly originates from upper stream groundwater and receives a greatly reduced contribution from meteoric precipitation compared with that of the wet season therefore the higher tds of the river water in winter is the result of the increasing proportion of groundwater and decreasing proportion of rainwater most groundwater and river water samples have δd and δ18o values that plot on or close to the lmwl while some of the groundwater samples trend towards the standard mean ocean water i e vsmow δ18o 0 and δ2h 0 fig 5a the intercept of lmwl is higher than that of lmwl gnip although the slopes of the trends are basically the same this phenomenon is reasonable since the gnip data were collected approximately 30 yrs ago and the climate has changed in recent years the lmwl established by our data is more appropriate to explain the behavior of isotopes from precipitation in recent years some other groundwater samples with low isotope concentrations are over the lmwl which are far away from the lmwl gnip but close to a summer rain sample in this study in gray dashed circle in the fig 5a in addition the isotopes of groundwater with tds lower than 10 g l show a trend of evaporation and the crossing point of lmwl and el is quite close to the summer rain sample which infers that modern summer rainfall should be a water source of the groundwater 5 2 the origin and seasonal variation of salinity the variation of tds and δ18o in time series of multiple wells indicate the different hydraulic activity of groundwater the tds levels in the groundwater samples from six wells i e q124 q129 q138 q141 q143 and s47 are quite stable in the different months fig 6a however the tds levels in the water samples from some wells i e q134 q140 q145 q150 and s50 located in the panyu and nansha districts varied considerably over time suggesting that the aquifers are connected with other water sources such as seawater and rainfall to a certain extent the δ18o data show increasing trends from january to september which is a trend of evaporation along with the increasing temperature in the area the δ18o values of the local rainwater are higher in the winter and lower in the summer due to the amount effect dansgaard 1964 fig 5a hence the increasing δ18o value of the groundwater fig 6b is not a reflection of the increasing local rainwater recharge in the corresponding month despite the high rain amount in summer seawater intrusion increases the tds and δ18o levels in the aquifer however in most wells the tds variation from january 2017 to september 2017 shows poor correlation with δ18o this indicates that seawater intrusion is not the only influencing factor for these wells for example the higher δ18o values except q145 observed in the groundwater in september compared to january 2017 imply that the groundwater was affected by strong evaporation because of high temperatures in the summer fig 5b combining the results of the tds and δ18o values we can speculate that seawater intrusion is insignificant in this area the large increase in tds and δ18o in well q145 is considered to be a result of uncommon modern seawater intrusion in september likely caused by storm surge associated with strong storms such as typhoon hato in 2017 yu et al 2015 otherwise it could be contaminated by artificial activities generally there is only one of the wells showing this evidence so further study is needed to determine what happened to this well since seawater has high chloride and δ18o values compared to freshwater we used these two proxies to test the effect of seawater intrusion on the groundwater salinity the positive relationship between the chloride and δ18o values supports that the groundwater salinity is influenced by seawater in fig 7 the composition of seawater was assumed to be 19 4 g l for cl 35 g l for tds and 1 8 0 for δ18o zhang et al 2015 in this study the other end member appears to have low chloride contents and is depleted in 18o i e δ18o 7 0 the samples shown in the fig 7 are enriched in δ18o and low cl is a result of evaporation a mixing line was drawn to obtain a better idea of the degree of seawater intrusion fig 7 the mixing ratios of δ18o versus cl composition are as high as 70 seawater the seawater ratio of highly saline groundwater 10 g l tds 19 5 g l in this study ranges from 30 to 70 the calculated mixing ratio is consistent with the hydrochemistry results in fig 4 assuming that the age of the local rainwater is zero the apparent age versus δ18o and tds of the six groundwater samples and the two river samples collected in september and the six rainwater samples collected in january march and may are shown in fig 8 in addition the six samples fall into three clusters in both plots of age vs δ18o fig 8a and age vs tds fig 8b the dic in the seawater in the study area is older than the modern day dic 500 yr b p mitsuguchi et al 2007 based on the dic age 2 9 kyr b p of s50 70 of seawater we can conjecture that the age of the end member seawater is approximately 3 4 kyr b p a period when the climate was much warmer than today and the seawater covered the study area zong et al 2009a a comparison of the ages of the river water samples shows that the groundwater is relatively old as shown in fig 8 three groundwater samples with relatively high δ18o are characterized by very old dic 14c ages and high salinity 5 g l tds 10 g l values which corresponds to past rainwater recharge which accompanied by geochemical processes that increased the groundwater salinity and water evaporation by combining the isotope results with the hydrochemical data of the water bodies the following two end members of the groundwater in the prd are identified precipitation and seawater it is important to emphasize that the apparent 14c ages of the water samples are not regarded as the true mean residence times of the groundwater in this study unfortunately the ages calculated using the tamers tamers 1975 and revised fontes and garnier han and plummer 2013 methods by netpathxl 1 5 parkhurst and charlton 2008 are not showing reasonable results to support a clear insight of the residence time of groundwater the 14c ages of the dic in the groundwater and surface water samples are confounded by various processes including dic sources e g dissolution of 14c dead carbonates and other geochemical processes such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis clark and fritz 1997 regardless of the true ages the groundwater samples are all older than 100 yrs as indicated by the barely detectable tritium in all the water samples table 2 in general we can conclude that saline groundwater is most likely ancient seawater trapped in the ground after marine regression for two reasons first according to the tds and isotope results the highly saline groundwater is of medium age and enriched in 18o relative to modern precipitation which refers to the intrusion of seawater second the tds and stable isotopes do not change significantly with time for most of the wells indicating that the modern seawater intrusion is insignificant 5 3 hydrochemical processes of the groundwater geochemical processes have been active for a long time as the apparent ages of the dic in the groundwater samples are older than 2 kyr b p table 2 moreover the results of the major ion contents indicate that the groundwater interacts with the rock or soil in the aquifers for a long time fig 4 there is no carbonate aquifer in the study area however it prevails the north of the guangzhou city which is upstream of groundwater calcium which is one of the dominant cations of the groundwater with tds from 5 g l to 10 g l which is consistent with the results of the calculation of saturation index si the calcite in more than half of the groundwater samples are over saturated 24 out of 42 groundwater samples and the si values are from 1 4 0 9 table s1 in addition the si values of dolomite are from 3 2 9 which infers the dolomite of some water samples are also over saturated table s1 the deceasing potassium and sulfate reduction are among the processes by which bacteria obtain energy for metabolism from the oxidation of relatively simple organic compounds fig 4 d e which is deduced by the strongly reducing environment of the groundwater table 1 in addition there are samples with low sodium concentrations in fig 4 c which indicates that the sodium in the water could be exchanged with calcium in the aquifer solids such as clay minerals due to the high sodium of seawater mixing the sodium adsorption ratio sar values of the groundwater samples range 0 1 meq l to 44 3 meq l table s1 which confirms the cation exchange of na and ca2 6 summary and conclusions the isotopic and hydrochemical analyses of the water samples from natural water bodies including groundwater rainfall storms and rivers collected in different months provide new insights into the groundwater salinity origins in the prd based on the study results the following conclusions are made 1 in general the groundwater salinity is high in the south panyu and nansha districts and low in the north tianhe district in the prd the highly saline groundwater is discontinuously distributed in the southern study area especially in the granite aquifers this could be the result of the weak groundwater dynamics because of the low permeability of the granite material there is no evidence of modern seawater intrusion in the area 2 the tds of groundwater shows a slight decrease in summer and isotopic concentrations are enriched in most wells which reveals that the groundwater is getting charged in summer to some extent temporal variations in the stable isotopic concentrations of the groundwater reflect the dynamic balance of precipitation and evaporation 3 there are two end member water sources for groundwater in southern guangzhou seawater and meteoric precipitation the ancient seawater mainly contributes to the saline groundwater tds 5 g l the proportion of seawater in high salinity groundwater is approximately 0 3 0 7 10 g l tds 19 5 g l in the study area in addition the water contents of saline groundwater 5 g l tds 10 g l could be affected by evaporation and long term geochemical processes such as water rock interactions sulfate reduction methanogenesis and ion exchange the fresh groundwater in the area is derived from modern meteoric precipitation generally modern day seawater intrusion is insignificant due to strict government

1483,a complex mixture of dissolved organic contaminants emanating from a many decades old residual dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source migrates through unconfined moderately heterogeneous glacial derived sediments and sedimentary rock in a residential area of dane county wisconsin usa a portion of this contaminant plume intersects a large man made pond roughly 400 m downgradient of the source zone depth discrete multilevel groundwater sampling detailed sedimentological logs and hydraulic head profiles were used to delineate the spatial distribution of hydraulic geologic organic contaminant and redox hydrochemical conditions within the established plume along two transects immediately upgradient of the pond twenty one contaminants were detected and classified into four major contaminant groups chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes aromatics btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene and aliphatic ketones within the glacial sediments and shallow bedrock zones of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes were juxtaposed with zones of btex and ketone degradation spatial heterogeneity in the concentration and distribution of contaminant groups and redox conditions was observed over lateral distances of tens of meters and vertical distances of tens of centimeters along the two transects although the site was situated in a complex glacial depositional environment lithologic and hydraulic heterogeneity surprisingly only had a modest influence on the spatial distribution of plume contaminants depth discrete sampling along paired closely spaced transects 20 m apart was essential to assess internal plume composition concentration evolution along flow paths with strong attenuation over short migration distances this study shows how paired highly resolved transects can enhance understanding of transverse and longitudinal variability in areas where contaminant induced redox conditions control reaction zones and strong plume attenuation keywords plume heterogeneity aged contaminant plume chlorinated solvents ketones btex biodegradation and redox variability multilevel monitoring transects 1 introduction organic contaminants are among the most ubiquitous and persistent subsurface contaminants worldwide often released as non aqueous phase liquids napls these contaminants readily migrate into the subsurface and can reach groundwater systems the spatial distribution of a napl in the subsurface can be complex due to the makeup and character of the contaminant s as well as local pore scale heterogeneities e g capillary barriers hydraulic conductivity contrasts variable porosity and mineralogy e g kueper et al 1989 1993 brewster et al 1995 in addition the pore space saturation of napls in the subsurface evolves variably through time and increases the heterogeneity of aged source zones pankow and cherry 1996 parker et al 2003 guilbeault et al 2005 hwang et al 2008 once distributed in the subsurface napls can serve as long term sources of dissolved contaminant plumes the transport of mobile contaminant plumes can vary due to temporal and spatial differences in the rates of physical processes such as dissolution by advection diffusion volatilization and sorption in the 1960s to 1970s contaminants in the subsurface were thought to form relatively uniform plumes an assumption stemming from relatively few field studies that relied on coarse sampling with long screened wells with plumes shown in plan view as concentric concentration contours e g pelmutter et al 1964 pinder 1973 kimmel and braids 1974 us epa

25 to 40 year old tce source zone in a sand and gravel aquifer concentration variations become even more pronounced if the napl source is composed of a complex mixture of organic contaminants as this further complicates the assessment of plume fate wanner et al 2018 in addition to physical processes organic contaminants are often subject to abiotic and biotic degradation that contributes to attenuation of the contaminant plume during its migration due to weak mixing processes in groundwater organic contaminant degradation e g chlorinated ethenes or btex can occur locally and create heterogeneity in contaminant distribution that overlaps with the heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties and physical processes this can lead to increasing plume complexity even for a well understood multi component source zone for example an investigation of contaminant concentrations and organic compound specific isotopic compositions in a clayey aquitard underlying a 15 year old mixed chlorinated solvent tce pce chloroform plume showed preferential degradation occurs in the low permeability aquitard wanner et al 2016 that study highlighted the importance of high resolution

strong zonation of redox conditions and biodegradation pathways within a petroleum hydrocarbon plume comprised of btex methyl tert butyl ether mtbe compounds and tert amyl methyl ether tame local scale properties and processes influencing contaminant reactions and transport are not easily observed in conventional long screened monitoring well data because water samples are typically blended across multiple flow zones e g reilly et al 1989 church and granato 1996 furthermore spatial heterogeneity in contaminant concentrations and their co occurrence with geologic hydrogeologic and hydrochemical variability may be under sampled or missed entirely potentially resulting in incomplete assessments of contaminant degradation mcmillan et al 2018 cozzarelli et al 2001 and bekins et al 2001 used detailed vertical sampling along a transect to assess contaminant concentration composition and redox conditions within a hydrocarbon plume they show how appropriately scaled multilevel

show degradation reactions near the groundwater surface water interface can substantially reduce mass discharge to surface water but occur in a strongly heterogeneous manner thought to be primarily controlled by physical property distributions recently rønde et al 2017 demonstrated the importance of multilevel sampling in a streambed combined with seepage velocity measurements using point velocity probes to obtain more accurate estimates of pce discharge to surface water although their study considered the role of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity they focused on conditions proximal to the stream bed in a complementary manner to previous work this study evaluates the overlapping physical and chemical heterogeneities controlling the spatial distribution of

detailed assessment of the impact of geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity on plume architecture and spatial evolution in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively physical and hydrochemical conditions along the transects are analyzed for their influence on the migration distribution and attenuation of 21 individual contaminants grouped into total chlorinated ethenes total chlorinated ethanes total btex and total ketones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area located in dane county wi usa is situated near an ice marginal environment shaped by multiple advances and retreats of the green bay lobe of the southern laurentide ice sheet locally the area is covered by till plains and glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits the quaternary sequence below the study area is dominated by sand gravelly sand and sandy diamict with thin layers of silt clay silty sand or gravel harvey et al 2019 an unconformity separates the glacial sediments from a sequence of upper cambrian through middle ordovician fractured sandstone siltstone and dolostone meyer et al 2016 steelman et al 2017 the study site encompasses an industrial property adjacent to a residential area in the direction of groundwater flow fig 1 a pond was constructed in 1994 as part of the residential development to provide stormwater retention the pond was excavated into glacial outwash sand and has since accumulated approximately 1 m of fine sand and silt along the pond bed bathymetry data describing the pond unpublished indicate its deepest point is approximately 4 5 m the pond lies 375 to 450 m east southeast of the chemical processing facility fig 1 surface water enters the pond through a stormwater drain located in its northwest corner and exits via a weir positioned at its southwest corner the weir controls water surface elevations in the pond at around 262 4 masl a man made drainage ditch extends south beyond the weir connecting the pond to a network of agricultural drainage ditches that carry water approximately 1 5 km to koshkonong creek estimates of flow from the northern culvert are usually less than the outflow at the southern weir which indicates a net groundwater gain to the pond swanson et al 2005 from 1950 to 1970 a chemical distributor and recycler handled various organic compounds including chlorinated solvents pce tce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca btex ketones acetone methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone and chloromethanes although the exact contaminant release history remains unclear normal onsite operations are believed to have led to multiple releases of chemical mixtures resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of pooled and residual dnapls and light napls lnapls in the quaternary deposits and bedrock characterization of source zone conditions began in the 1990s at least 20 years after the releases took place and have continued due to difficulties related to characterizing aged dnapl source zones in heterogeneous geologic materials the high concentration source zone in the unconsolidated sediments was delineated through a combination of soil measurements using a photoionization detector pid and interface probe lnapl measurements in shallow wells hsi geotrans 1998 fig 1 the dnapl source zone was delineated during an investigation and dnapl recovery program conducted through the late 1990s and early 2000s which retrieved approximately 34 m3 of dnapl from the subsurface hsi geotrans 1999 geotrans inc 2003a most of the free product dnapl was encountered in the upper portion of the tunnel city group sandstones located 45 to 56 m below ground surface geotrans inc 2003a and roughly 75 m south of the high concentration lnapl source zone in the unconsolidated sediments fig 1 dnapl recovered from wells in the upper tunnel city group bedrock had a nearly constant composition austin 2005 however residual phase dnapl distribution in the quaternary deposits and shallow bedrock has not been directly observed more recent investigations using depth discrete samples of sediment rock core and groundwater arranged along a transect 75 m downgradient of the dnapl source zone reveal a highly heterogeneous distribution of dissolved phase contaminant mass and compositions within the unconsolidated sediments and shallow bedrock units perhaps due to differential rates of napl dissolution buckley 2017 harvey 2017 groundwater flow through the geologically and chemically complex source zone at the site has created multiple variably scaled dissolved phase plumes spanning the shallow quaternary deposits and deeper sedimentary bedrock meyer et al 2008 2016 the shallowest plume was delineated using data from conventional well samples and surface water samples taken from the pond drainage ditches and koshkonong creek geotrans inc 2003b geotrans inc 2003c these investigations revealed declining total volatile organic compound tvoc concentrations between the wells near the source zone e g 223 520 μg l and the pond e g 404 7 μg l and small to non detect e g 2 7 μg l concentrations immediately downgradient of the pond between 2005 and 2018 tvoc concentrations in the pond ranged from 19 1 to 693 9 μg l tetra tech 2018 2 2 depth discrete multilevel samplers two modified waterloo mlss solinst canada ltd georgetown on canada were installed near the source zone mp 9 and downgradient of the pond mp 10 along the lateral component of groundwater flow forming a a a longsect fig 1 four additional mlss were installed along the west bank of the pond forming a b b transect fig 1 parker et al 2006 these depth discrete monitoring wells mp 11 mp 12 mp 13r and mp 14 were installed 45 to 60 m apart perpendicular to the general groundwater flow direction mlss were installed using a rotosonic drill rig fitted with a 6 5 in core barrel using a dual casing approach an outer steel casing was driven into the subsurface while a smaller core barrel was advanced into the formation to retrieve continuous core allowing the outer casing to stay in place to keep the borehole open and reduce cross connection parker et al 2006 borehole depths ranged from 18 to 38 m and were finished in the upper 3 to 4 5 m of bedrock the geology was logged in detail with a focus on visible changes in sediment texture with depth harvey et al 2019 reinterpreted these logs to construct a quaternary lithofacies model of the study area with the stratigraphic layers and nomenclature described therein adopted in this paper to characterize contaminant migration toward the pond each borehole was instrumented with a waterloo mls containing 14 to 15 depth discrete sampling ports spanning the quaternary unconsolidated sediments and upper few meters of the paleozoic sedimentary bedrock the ports were spaced 0 75 to 2 5 m apart with depths based on lithologic details noted during core logging groundwater samples from the waterloo mls wells were collected in august 2004 using a peristaltic pump in line with a stainless steel sampling manifold connected to 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa sample vials water samples were collected from each port after purging stagnant water volumes before sampling subsequent ports the manifold was washed with 50 ml of methanol followed by 500 ml of distilled water and then flushed with purge water purge volumes were between 1 4 and 7 8 l with an average of 4 9 l 1 2 l volumes depended on the tubing and sandpack volumes port depths screen interval and water column samples were packed in ice and sent overnight to the organic chemistry laboratory at the university of waterloo waterloo on canada a total of 91 groundwater samples were collected from the waterloo mls ports during the sampling event samples for hydrochemical analysis were collected immediately after purging and voc sampling at each port a 500 ml bottle was filled for anion analysis a 250 ml sample with a sulfuric acid preservative was collected for total dissolved solids dissolved organic carbon doc and ammonia analyses and a 125 ml sample of filtered 0 45 μm groundwater with a nitric acid preservative was collected for cation and trace metal analyses samples were packed in ice and shipped overnight to a private laboratory for analysis psc analytical mississauga on canada 2 3 direct push groundwater sampling procedure from august to september 2004 a second transect c c was completed by sampling groundwater from sediment beneath the western edge of the pond from the northwest corner to the pond outlet located at the southwest corner using a waterloo profiler pitkin et al 1999 fig 1 this transect was positioned approximately 20 m downgradient from the b b mls transect the waterloo profiler is a direct push device used to collect depth discrete groundwater samples in moderate to high permeability unconsolidated deposits it facilitates rapid collection of samples at multiple depths at the same surface position without retrieving decontaminating and re driving to target depths between samples the device includes a 44 mm diameter stainless steel drive point with open ports fixed with stainless steel screens the ports connect to 3 mm o d stainless steel sample tubes that run inside conventional drill rods to the ground surface samples were collected by advancing the profiler tip to the desired depth using an electric jackhammer while a peristaltic pump was used to pump contaminant free distilled water down the sample tube and out into the formation to mitigate sediment clogging of the port screen at the desired sampling depth the pump was reversed and distilled water followed by groundwater from the targeted depth were drawn up to surface where water samples were collected in the same type of manifold system as described for the mls sampling procedure samples were typically collected after purging 200 ml of water in excess of the tubing volume to ensure full removal of distilled water from the sampling line after sample collection the profiler tip was advanced to the next depth while distilled water was pumped down the line to the stainless steel tip further details on the sampling procedure can be found in guilbeault et al 2005 a vertical profile was collected at 22 locations spaced approximately 5 to 10 m apart with groundwater samples collected every 0 30 m to a depth of 4 5 m below the base of the pond grab samples of surface water were collected in the pond at every third sampling location surface water samples were obtained within 0 1 m above the pond bed in 40 ml voa vials the caps were removed and reattached at the submerged point the sample was taken to minimize vertical mixing and air exposure once collected the surface water and direct push samples were placed in ice and sent to the university of waterloo waterloo on canada for analyses a total of 170 samples were collected along the pond transect during the direct push sampling campaign 2 4 geochemical data processing voc concentrations were qualified against laboratory blanks and control samples as well as field blanks using a standardized process us epa 1999 resulting in four data quality categories 1 quantifiable results above the limit of quantification 2 detected but not quantifiable 3 flagged due to detections in the associated field blanks and 4 not detected the analysis included 21 organic compounds representing 97 of all contaminants detected at the site nineteen of the 21 compounds included in the analysis were detected in the groundwater samples to evaluate the spatial distribution of broad suites of contaminants across the mls and direct push transects the high quality detectable results i e excluding field blank flagged detections were classified into chlorinated ethene chlorinated ethane btex and ketone groups total concentrations for each contaminant group were calculated from a summation of the individual analyte concentrations within a sample according to their respective contaminant classification total ethenes consisted of 1 1 dichloroethene cis 1 2 dichloroethene tetrachloroethene trans 1 2 dichloroethene trichloroethene and vinyl chloride total ethanes consisted of 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 dichloroethane 1 2 dichloroethane and chloroethane total btex consisted of benzene ethylbenzene m p xylenes o xylene and toluene and total ketones consisted of 2 butanone 4 methyl 2 pentanone and acetone analyte concentrations below their detection limit within a sample were designated as non detects nd and the reported concentrations were excluded from the summation tvoc was calculated using the sum of the concentrations of all analytes within a sample also excluding those below their detection limit a summary of the concentrations of organic contaminant groups and inorganic contaminants chloride dissolved organic carbon nitrate manganese ferrous iron and sulfate is provided in the si organic and inorganic contaminant concentrations were gridded using the triangulation and linear interpolation algorithm available in surfer v 13 6 golden software golden co usa this interpolation scheme was selected because of its greater consistency between the gridded regions and individual data point values this interpolation method also provided a more realistic representation of the depth discrete data where vertical sampling intervals are 1 2 orders of magnitude finer in the vertical direction than the horizontal direction 3 results and discussion 3 1 resolving geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity continuous cores revealed variability in quaternary lithofacies distribution fig 2 the sediments consist of clay rich fines sandy diamicts and sands and gravels of varying thickness 0 5 m to 15 20 m thick and lateral extent 10s to 1000 s of meters parker et al 2006 harvey et al 2019 grain size analysis and permeameter measurements on repacked soil samples collected across the study area provide a wide range of hydraulic conductivity k values with k for diamicts ranging from 3 10 8 to 6 10 6 m s muddy sands ranging from 2 10 8 to 2 10 7 m s and sands and gravels ranging from 2 10 5 to 2 10 3 m s harvey et al 2019 slug tests from conventional monitoring wells in the study area indicate horizontal hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 10 6 to 2 10 4 m s within the unconsolidated sediments hsi geotrans 1998 and 8 10 9 to 1 10 3 m s within the bedrock parker et al 2015 vertical hydraulic head profiles collected in august to september 2004 from the waterloo mlss fig 2 head log show three main features 1 no to minimal change in hydraulic head with depth throughout the undifferentiated bedrock combined with lowermost quaternary sediments 2 a large change in hydraulic head with depth across a 1 m section of the upper portion of stratigraphic unit 1 su1 creating an upward vertical component of the hydraulic gradient at mls wells mp 14 mp 13r mp 12 and mp 11 and 3 no to minimal change in hydraulic head with depth throughout the uppermost quaternary sediments sections of head profiles with no to minimal head change with depth are common in areas with minimal heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dominated by lateral flow meyer et al 2014 2016 and do not indicate leakage between the depth discrete monitoring intervals of the mlss harvey et al 2019 evaluated head profiles collected multiple times per year between 2004 and 2017 from these locations and found they were highly repeatable fig 2 2016 provided as an example the persistent upward hydraulic gradients associated with the upper part of su1 and or the contact between su1 and su2 indicate some degree of restriction to vertical flow within the quaternary sediment sequence harvey et al 2019 consequently harvey et al 2019 proposed three hydrogeologic units hgus within the quaternary sediments and top of rock contact hgu1 the undifferentiated bedrock combined with the lower most quaternary sediments hgu2 the upper part of su1 and hgu3 the uppermost quaternary sediments this simple hgu model is somewhat counterintuitive because of the complex stratigraphy in this ice marginal depositional setting figs 2 and 3 the lack of hydrogeologic heterogeneity substantiated by the head profiles is attributed to the insensitivity of the head profiles in this setting to all but the largest changes in hydraulic conductivity combined with the sandy nature of the diamicts 48 89 sand in the matrix producing only small contrasts in hydraulic conductivity and no strong aquitards within the sequence harvey et al 2019 hydraulic head data collected in august and september 2004 from the mlss and in june 2004 from the conventional monitoring wells p and mw labelled wells fig 3a were contoured by hand along a vertical cross section roughly parallel to flow between the source zone and downgradient of the pond the hydraulic head distribution indicates groundwater flow is predominantly horizontal to downward toward the east between the source zone and the drumlin feature west of the pond thereafter groundwater flow shifts upward from the bedrock and lowermost quaternary deposits su1 where it enters the overlying upper quaternary deposits su2 and su4 along the west bank of the pond these data also suggest the pinching out of the su3 diamtics and facies shift of the su4 diamicts k 3 0 10 8 to 6 10 6 m s to the su4 gravelly sands k 1 7 10 5 to 2 1 10 3 m s near the western bank of the pond may further facilitate upward flow and discharge into the pond which is acting as a local groundwater drain harvey 2017 harvey et al 2019 the hydraulic head data collected in august and september 2004 from the mlss were also contoured along the mls transect perpendicular to the dominant direction of flow to further evaluate the vertical component of hydraulic gradient just upgradient of the discharge point fig 3b these head contours accentuate the strong upward component of hydraulic gradient associated with hgu2 the sandy diamict in su1 and or the contact between su1 and su2 but do not provide direct evidence of flow directions given the orientation of the section with respect to the dominant flow direction based on the head data from conventional wells and the high resolution mlss together with pond inflow and outflow data the groundwater surface water interaction can be characterized as a flow through system with groundwater predominantly discharging to the pond along the north and west side with surface water recharging toward the east and southeast 3 2 organic contaminant distribution and redox zonation tvoc profiles collected parallel fig 3a and perpendicular fig 3b to groundwater flow show concentrations can vary by five orders of magnitude with steep concentration gradients between adjacent ports data provided in table s1 maximum tvoc concentrations 10 to 500 mg l occur near the quaternary bedrock interface as the contaminants approach the west edge of the pond hydraulic gradients shift upward and direct the contaminants across the quaternary bedrock interface through the interbedded diamict of su1 and eventually through the overlying sand and gravel layers that intersect the pond su2 and su4 fig 3a these data indicate that although the upper part of su1 or the su1 su2 contact provides some resistance to flow the su1 sediments do not act as a high integrity aquitard with respect to the dissolved phase plume tvoc concentrations were further assessed by comparing the spatial distribution of organic contaminant group concentrations data provided in table s1 across the pond transect b b in fig 1 as shown in fig 4 ketones were the most concentrated across the transect up to 50 mg l followed by chlorinated ethenes up to 20 mg l and then btex and ethanes up to 5 mg l the transect reveals differences in the spatial distribution of the contaminant groups the chlorinated ethenes were mainly detected at the southern edge of the transect mp 14 in the shallowest ports of mp 13r and in the middle ports of mp 12 while btex ketones and chlorinated ethanes tended to occur in areas where chlorinated ethene concentrations were low i e middle ports of mp 13r and deep ports of mp 12 the heterogeneity observed in the contaminant distributions on the b b transect does not appear to be related to the distribution of lithostratigraphic or hydrogeologic units this lack of relationship indicates mechanisms other than differences in flow paths control contaminant distributions as the plume enters the pond the waterloo profiler results along the pond transect c c in fig 1 data provided in table s2 reveal a similar spatial distribution of ethenes ethanes and btex fig 5 as observed along the upgradient b b transect however maximum concentrations observed in the waterloo profiling results were 90 lower than the maximum concentrations observed along the transect 20 m upgradient in addition ketones were only detected in low concentrations at one sample point near the southeastern end of the pond fig 5 in the shallow portion of the pond bed concentrations of chlorinated ethanes and btex were non detect or very low across all but the northern most portion of the transect chlorinated ethenes were more concentrated across the middle of the transect fig 5 4 771 490 4 771 630 m northing surface water measurements collected from the northwest corner of the pond and from water discharging underneath the culvert confirmed higher concentrations of chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes and btex discharging to surface water data provided in table s3 chlorinated ethenes and to some extent chlorinated ethanes were also detected 50 500 μg l in surface water samples along the drainage ditch south of mp 14 fig 6 these surface water concentrations are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than those observed along the c c profiler transect the reduction of voc mass as groundwater flows through the pond bed and back out provides a partial explanation for the non detect contaminant concentrations on the downgradient side of the pond at mp 10 samples obtained from the b b transect c c transect and the pond indicate substantial contaminant concentration variability over relatively short 20 m distances chapman et al 2007 also observed marked attenuation of a tce and 1 2 cis dichloroethene cis dce plume as it intersected several minor surface water features a small pond and two streams prior to discharging into a river however their study concluded that while degradation played a role in local groundwater plume attenuation most of the observed attenuation in groundwater was due to discharge into the minor surface water features with appreciable concentrations measured in surface water samples and subsequent dilution and volatilization the attenuation of chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes btex and ketones at this study site appears to be strongly dependent on redox conditions figs 7 and 8 fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of chloride cl doc and redox sensitive species no3 mn2 fe2 and so4 2 along the a a longitudinal profile data provided in table s4 the high doc 100 mg l accumulation of mn2 2 mg l and low so4 2 50 mg l concentrations 190 m downgradient of the source zone at mp 9 directly above the quaternary bedrock interface indicate the presence of strongly reducing conditions furthermore elevated cl concentrations 13 to 280 mg l may be indicative of reductive dechlorination of the chlorinated contaminants moving 160 m downgradient to mp 12 cl and mn2 concentrations decrease to 5 to 107 mg l and 0 4 to 1 5 mg l respectively indicating weaker reducing conditions and thus lower potential for reductive dechlorination hydraulic gradients indicate a downward potential as groundwater travels away from the pond here mp 10 reveals maximum concentrations of cl and mn2 ranging between 21 and 68 mg l and 0 2 and 0 7 mg l respectively while no3 and so4 2 concentrations are elevated to between 0 4 and 7 4 mg l and 48 and 267 mg l respectively this indicates a predominantly oxidizing environment downgradient of the pond background concentrations for these redox indicators from outside the contaminant plume in 2009 revealed measurable no3 4 1 5 81 mg l and so4 2 19 52 mg l low concentrations of mn2 0 01 0 02 mg l and non detect dissolved fe2 and doc table 1 spatial distribution of cl doc and redox sensitive species no3 mn2 fe2 and so4 2 along the b b transect fig 8 show the degree of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated compounds and redox conditions upgradient of the discharge area high doc concentrations were observed throughout the middle and deep ports of mp 13r and the deeper ports of mp 12 the similar spatial distribution of doc and high ketone concentrations along with the occurrence of btex suggest a large portion of the doc signal may be due to the presence of ketones elevated concentrations of mn2 fe2 and doc which indicate reducing conditions are co located in the center of the transect around the deeper ports of mp 13r and mp 12 these sampling ports are located within the bedrock and su1 near the quaternary bedrock interface the reducing conditions in the bedrock and deepest part of su1 in the center of the transect loosely correspond to an area where so4 2 and chlorinated ethenes and ethanes are low these reducing conditions would limit the oxidation of btex and ketones fig 8 conversely low or non detect doc mn2 and fe2 along with elevated no3 and so4 2 at the southern and northern edge of the transect mp 14 and mp 11 within su2 and su4 indicate oxidization of ketones and btex ketone concentrations along the b b and c c transects show strong attenuation as they approach the pond bed fig 5 which could be explained by co metabolic degradation ketones and btex could serve as substrates for the microbes prior to groundwater discharging to the surface water environment 3 3 role of lithologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity on contaminant distribution a comparison of the sum of measured chlorinated ethene and ethane concentrations to the sum of measured btex and ketone concentrations fig 9 illustrates the opposing reactive behaviour of different contaminant groups under variable redox conditions the inverse relationship between the highest concentrations of chlorinated ethenes ethanes and btex ketones could be explained by contrasting redox conditions where sufficient contaminant concentrations are present the limited association between hydrocarbon oxidation reductive dichlorination with respect to lithology fig 9 shows that geologic hydrogeologic heterogeneity is not the primary mechanism controlling plume architecture rather variable groundwater flow paths through the napl source zone and spatially variable recharge are more likely influencing degradation mechanisms and ultimately contaminant distribution for instance relatively higher concentrations of btex ketones were observed within the sandy diamict at the base of the aquifer i e su1 fig 4 lower permeability and slightly deeper units were accompanied by more reducing conditions i e su1 fig 8 that would have inhibited aerobic oxidation of btex and ketones and facilitated chlorinated ethene and chlorinated ethane degradation via reductive dechlorination conversely higher concentrations of chlorinated ethenes ethanes were observed in the bedrock units and coarser sand and sandy gravel units su2 and su4 fig 4 where oxidizing conditions likely persist and prohibit degradation of the chlorinated compounds and allow for preferential degradation of btex and ketone this is supported by similarities in the distributions of these compounds fig 4 and total dissolved carbon fig 8 along the mls transect that coincide with lower concentrations of ethenes however compositional variability in the source zone might explain the absence of the expected strong positive relationship between ethenes ethanes and btex ketones concentrations during co metabolic degradation however the evidence clearly shows plume composition and concentration variability are accentuated with overlapping physical chemical and microbial heterogeneities 4 conclusions depth discrete multilevel sampling of a mixed organic contaminant plume in an unconfined aquifer provided evidence of steep concentration gradients between major contaminant groups over relatively short lateral distances tens of meters and narrow vertical distances tens of centimeters these gradients resulted in distinct hydrochemical zones and marked contaminant compositional variability consistent with degradation potential associated with redox controls peak contaminant distributions measured along the mls sampling network orthogonal to groundwater flow i e transects indicated the shallow portion of the contaminant plume migrates horizontally along the quaternary bedrock interface as the plume approaches the pond the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient shifts flow upward where the west side of the pond serves as a local groundwater receptor upward migration of contaminants is likely facilitated by the presence of permeable sand and gravelly sand su2 and su4 units underlying the pond bed thinning of a sandy diamict layer su3 along the west edge of the pond and a lack of aquitards within the unconsolidated sediments yet a comparison between transects located 20 m upgradient of the pond and within the pond bed showed considerable changes in contaminant concentrations e g over 90 reduction in peak concentrations as the plume reaches the surface water this suggests that assessment of contaminant mass discharge to receptors may be highly dependent on the distance separating multilevel transects and contaminant receptors due to increasing rates of contaminant degradation in well established redox zones near plume discharge the spatial heterogeneity observed in terms of contaminant concentration and composition did not reflect observed geologic or physical hydrogeologic heterogeneities initially this was a relatively surprising result because the quaternary sediments deposited in an ice marginal environment were expected to be hydrostratigraphically complex with multiple till units controlling plume architecture however hydrogeologic heterogeneity was not particularly strong based on several factors including small total head differentials across the quaternary sediments that indicate slight hydraulic conductivity contrasts the sandy nature of the diamicts and the limited lateral extent of many of the stratigraphic units our comparison of the spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations and compositions along closely spaced transects provided an opportunity to test the sensitivity of the plume to geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity comparison of the lithostratigraphy and hgus to the voc group distributions shown along the mls transect indicated a weak relationship between contaminant distribution and the stratigraphic or hydrogeologic unit framework closer inspection of the contaminant distributions suggested the complex internal plume architecture results from the spatial complexity in redox conditions and associated microbial communities that arise due to the high concentrations and multi component nature of the plume therefore lithologic and hydrogeologic physical heterogeneity are not the primary factors controlling contaminant distributions along the flow paths this strong influence of redox controls was corroborated by a comparison of contaminant distributions over short transverse and longitudinal distances with minimal variations in lithologic and hydrogeologic properties additional but less dominant contributors to internal plume heterogeneity included unknown variability in dnapl composition enhanced by variable dissolution rates in the aged dnapl source zone as well as limited groundwater mixing due to modest lithologic and hydrogeologic variability observed in these sandy glacial derived sediments the high concentration contaminant conditions produced strongly reducing zones that support near complete reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes at the upgradient edge of the pond these reducing zones were juxtaposed with less reducing to oxidizing zones that support preferential degradation of btex and ketones based on these findings it is reasonable to expect substantial heterogeneity in complex mixtures of organic contaminants nearing discharge to surface water even where only modest lithologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity is present future work will focus on quantifying the relative contribution of each of these processes to the observed contaminant heterogeneity by evaluating data from multiple voc and redox parameter sampling rounds through time including complementary compound specific isotope analysis csia and microbial analyses to evaluate specific degradation pathways targeting the range of conditions observed in this study phase this study adds to the growing evidence that suggests high resolution depth discrete sampling methods i e continuous core direct push multilevel sampling applied along transects are essential for characterizing the internal complexity of aged mixed organic contaminant plumes because the character of these plumes can change over lateral distances of meters or less and vertical distances of tens of cm or less in layered sedimentary systems characterizing plume flow paths solvent distributions and redox conditions at similar or even finer scales is critical to understanding risks of plume discharge to receptors as the drivers for site cleanup switch toward flux based metrics einarson 2017 itrc 2010 and focus shifts to more complex sites national research council nrc 2013 depth discrete contaminant concentrations constrained by a robust hydrogeologic framework will play a critical role in the assessment of natural attenuation and receptor risk the data collected as part of a high resolution transect approach would support cost benefit analyses of microbial and csia techniques in site characterization and minimize blending in wells used to collect groundwater for these expensive analytical techniques detailed delineation of contaminant distribution at the early stage of site characterization would ultimately improve cost effective sampling for use of some diagnostic tools e g csia and microbial analyses to strengthen process based site conceptual

1483,a complex mixture of dissolved organic contaminants emanating from a many decades old residual dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source migrates through unconfined moderately heterogeneous glacial derived sediments and sedimentary rock in a residential area of dane county wisconsin usa a portion of this contaminant plume intersects a large man made pond roughly 400 m downgradient of the source zone depth discrete multilevel groundwater sampling detailed sedimentological logs and hydraulic head profiles were used to delineate the spatial distribution of hydraulic geologic organic contaminant and redox hydrochemical conditions within the established plume along two transects immediately upgradient of the pond twenty one contaminants were detected and classified into four major contaminant groups chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes aromatics btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene and aliphatic ketones within the glacial sediments and shallow bedrock zones of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes were juxtaposed with zones of btex and ketone degradation spatial heterogeneity in the concentration and distribution of contaminant groups and redox conditions was observed over lateral distances of tens of meters and vertical distances of tens of centimeters along the two transects although the site was situated in a complex glacial depositional environment lithologic and hydraulic heterogeneity surprisingly only had a modest influence on the spatial distribution of plume contaminants depth discrete sampling along paired closely spaced transects 20 m apart was essential to assess internal plume composition concentration evolution along flow paths with strong attenuation over short migration distances this study shows how paired highly resolved transects can enhance understanding of transverse and longitudinal variability in areas where contaminant induced redox conditions control reaction zones and strong plume attenuation

the most ubiquitous and persistent subsurface contaminants worldwide often released as non aqueous phase liquids napls these contaminants readily migrate into the subsurface and can reach groundwater

hydraulic conductivity contrasts variable porosity and mineralogy e g kueper et al 1989 1993 brewster et al 1995 in addition the pore space saturation of napls in the subsurface evolves variably

long term sources of dissolved contaminant plumes the transport of mobile contaminant plumes can vary due to temporal and spatial differences in the rates of physical processes such as dissolution by advection diffusion volatilization and sorption in the 1960s to 1970s contaminants in the subsurface were thought to form relatively uniform plumes an assumption stemming from relatively few field

25 to 40 year old tce source zone in a sand and gravel aquifer concentration variations become even more pronounced if the napl source is composed of a complex mixture of organic contaminants as this further complicates the assessment of plume fate wanner et al 2018 in addition to physical processes organic contaminants are often subject to abiotic and biotic degradation that contributes to attenuation of the contaminant plume during its migration due to weak mixing processes in groundwater organic contaminant degradation e g chlorinated ethenes or btex can occur locally and create heterogeneity in contaminant distribution that overlaps with the heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties and physical processes this can lead to increasing plume complexity even for a well understood multi component source zone for example an investigation of contaminant concentrations and organic compound specific isotopic compositions in a clayey aquitard underlying a 15 year old mixed chlorinated solvent tce pce chloroform plume showed preferential degradation occurs in the low permeability aquitard wanner et al 2016 that study highlighted the importance of high resolution characterization of the entire aquitard aquifer system to achieve a complete understanding of where reactions that impact long term plume dynamics are occurring similarly spence et al 2005 observed strong zonation of redox conditions and biodegradation pathways within a petroleum hydrocarbon plume comprised of btex methyl tert butyl ether mtbe compounds and tert amyl methyl ether tame local scale properties and processes influencing contaminant reactions and transport are not easily observed in conventional long screened monitoring well data because water samples are typically blended across multiple flow zones e g reilly et al 1989 church and granato 1996 furthermore spatial heterogeneity in contaminant concentrations and their co occurrence with geologic hydrogeologic and hydrochemical variability may be under sampled or missed entirely potentially resulting in incomplete assessments of contaminant degradation mcmillan et al 2018 cozzarelli et al 2001 and bekins et al 2001 used detailed vertical sampling along a transect to assess contaminant concentration composition and redox conditions within a hydrocarbon plume they show how appropriately scaled multilevel

controlled by physical property distributions recently rønde et al 2017 demonstrated the importance of multilevel sampling in a streambed combined with seepage velocity measurements using point velocity probes to obtain more accurate estimates of pce discharge to surface water although their study considered the role of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity they focused on conditions proximal to the stream bed in a complementary manner to previous work this study evaluates the overlapping physical and chemical heterogeneities controlling the spatial distribution of contaminants within an aged contaminant plume consisting of a complex mixture of multiple organic solvents including several chlorinated ethenes and ethanes btex and ketones at a position nearly 400 m downgradient and proximal to where the plume discharges to a surface water body the study site s napl source zone comprises a complex distribution of these same solvents possibly due to multiple releases by a chemical recycler from the 1950s through the 1970s the resulting napl source zone and associated dissolved phase plume occurs in quaternary glacial sediments with multiple facies harvey et al 2019 and shallow ordovician aged sandstones and dolostones steelman et al 2017 this study uses a multi scaled continuous core and multilevel system mls approach along two transects situated 350 to 400 m downgradient of the source zone and immediately upgradient of a man made pond where a portion of the well established plume presumably discharges these closely spaced transects permit a detailed assessment of the impact of geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity on plume architecture and spatial evolution in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively physical and hydrochemical conditions along the transects are analyzed for their influence on the migration distribution and attenuation of 21 individual contaminants grouped into total chlorinated ethenes total

advances and retreats of the green bay lobe of the southern laurentide ice sheet locally the area is covered by till plains and glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits the quaternary sequence below the study area is dominated by sand gravelly sand and sandy diamict with thin layers of silt clay silty sand or gravel harvey et al 2019 an unconformity separates the glacial sediments from a sequence of upper cambrian through middle ordovician fractured sandstone siltstone and dolostone meyer et al 2016 steelman et al 2017 the study site encompasses an industrial property adjacent to a residential area in the direction of groundwater flow fig 1 a pond was constructed in 1994 as part of the residential development to provide stormwater retention the pond was excavated into glacial outwash sand and has since accumulated approximately 1 m of fine sand and silt along the pond bed bathymetry data describing the pond unpublished indicate its deepest point is approximately 4 5 m the pond lies 375 to 450 m east southeast of the chemical processing facility fig 1 surface water enters the pond through a stormwater drain located in its northwest corner and exits via a weir positioned at its southwest corner the weir controls water surface elevations in the pond at around 262 4 masl a man made drainage ditch extends south beyond the weir connecting the pond to a network of agricultural drainage ditches that carry water approximately 1 5 km to koshkonong creek estimates of flow from the northern culvert are usually less than the outflow at the southern weir which indicates a net groundwater gain to the pond swanson et al 2005 from 1950 to 1970 a chemical distributor and recycler handled various organic compounds including chlorinated solvents pce tce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca btex ketones acetone methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone and chloromethanes although the exact contaminant release history remains unclear normal onsite operations are believed to have led to multiple releases of chemical mixtures resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of pooled and residual dnapls and light napls lnapls in the quaternary deposits and bedrock characterization of source zone conditions began in the 1990s at least 20 years after the releases took place and have continued due to difficulties related to characterizing aged dnapl source zones in heterogeneous geologic materials the high concentration source zone in the unconsolidated sediments was delineated through a combination of soil measurements using a photoionization detector pid and interface probe lnapl measurements in shallow wells hsi geotrans 1998 fig 1 the dnapl source zone was delineated during an investigation and dnapl recovery program conducted through the late 1990s and early 2000s which retrieved approximately 34 m3 of dnapl from the subsurface hsi geotrans 1999 geotrans inc 2003a most of the free product dnapl was encountered in the upper portion of the tunnel city group sandstones located 45 to 56 m below ground surface geotrans inc 2003a and roughly 75 m south of the high concentration lnapl source zone in the unconsolidated sediments fig 1 dnapl recovered from wells in the upper tunnel city group bedrock had a nearly constant composition austin 2005 however residual phase dnapl distribution in the quaternary deposits and shallow bedrock has not been directly observed more recent investigations using depth discrete samples of sediment rock core and groundwater arranged along a transect 75 m downgradient of the dnapl source zone reveal a highly heterogeneous distribution of dissolved phase contaminant mass and compositions within the unconsolidated sediments and shallow bedrock units perhaps due to differential rates of napl dissolution buckley 2017 harvey 2017 groundwater flow through the geologically and chemically complex source zone at the site has created multiple variably scaled dissolved phase plumes spanning the shallow quaternary deposits and deeper sedimentary bedrock meyer et al 2008 2016 the shallowest plume was delineated using data from conventional well samples and surface water samples taken from the pond drainage ditches and koshkonong creek geotrans inc 2003b geotrans inc 2003c these investigations revealed declining total volatile organic compound tvoc concentrations between the wells near the source zone e g 223 520 μg l and the pond e g 404 7 μg l and small to non detect e g 2 7 μg l concentrations immediately downgradient of the pond between 2005 and 2018 tvoc concentrations in the pond ranged from 19 1 to 693 9 μg l tetra tech 2018 2 2 depth discrete multilevel samplers two modified waterloo mlss solinst canada ltd georgetown on canada were installed near the source zone mp 9 and downgradient of the pond mp 10 along the lateral component of groundwater flow forming a a a longsect fig 1 four additional mlss were installed along the west bank of the pond forming a b b transect fig 1 parker et al 2006 these depth discrete monitoring wells mp 11 mp 12 mp 13r and mp 14 were installed 45 to 60 m apart perpendicular to the general groundwater flow direction mlss were installed using a rotosonic drill rig fitted with a 6 5 in core barrel using a dual casing approach an outer steel casing was driven into the subsurface while a smaller core barrel was advanced into the formation to retrieve continuous core allowing the outer casing to stay in place to keep the borehole open and reduce cross connection parker et al 2006 borehole depths ranged from 18 to 38 m and were finished in the upper 3 to 4 5 m of bedrock the geology was logged in detail with a focus on visible changes in sediment texture with depth harvey et al 2019 reinterpreted these logs to construct a quaternary lithofacies model of the study area with the stratigraphic layers and nomenclature described therein adopted in this paper to characterize contaminant migration toward the pond each borehole was instrumented with a waterloo mls containing 14 to 15 depth discrete sampling ports spanning the quaternary unconsolidated sediments and upper few meters of the paleozoic sedimentary bedrock the ports were spaced 0 75 to 2 5 m apart with depths based on lithologic details noted during core logging groundwater samples from the waterloo mls wells were collected in august 2004 using a peristaltic pump in line with a stainless steel sampling manifold connected to 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa sample vials water samples were collected from each port after purging stagnant water volumes before sampling subsequent ports the manifold was washed with 50 ml of methanol followed by 500 ml of distilled water and then flushed with purge water purge volumes were between 1 4 and 7 8 l with an average of 4 9 l 1 2 l volumes depended on the tubing and sandpack volumes port depths screen interval and water column samples were packed in ice and sent overnight to the organic chemistry laboratory at the university of waterloo waterloo on canada a total of 91 groundwater samples were collected from the waterloo mls ports during the sampling event samples for hydrochemical analysis were collected immediately after purging and voc sampling at each port a 500 ml bottle was filled for anion analysis a 250 ml sample with a sulfuric acid preservative was collected for total dissolved solids dissolved organic carbon doc and ammonia analyses and a 125 ml sample of filtered 0 45 μm groundwater with a nitric acid preservative was collected for cation and trace metal analyses samples were packed in ice and shipped overnight to a private laboratory for analysis psc analytical mississauga on canada 2 3 direct push groundwater sampling procedure from august to september 2004 a second transect c c was completed by sampling groundwater from sediment beneath the western edge of the pond from the northwest corner to the pond outlet located at the southwest corner using a waterloo profiler pitkin et al 1999 fig 1 this transect was positioned approximately 20 m downgradient from the b b mls transect the waterloo profiler is a direct push device used to collect depth discrete groundwater samples in moderate to high permeability unconsolidated deposits it facilitates rapid collection of samples at multiple depths at the same surface position without retrieving decontaminating and re driving to target depths between samples the device includes a 44 mm diameter stainless steel drive point with open ports fixed with stainless steel screens the ports connect to 3 mm o d stainless steel sample tubes that run inside conventional drill rods to the ground surface samples were collected by advancing the profiler tip to the desired depth using an electric jackhammer while a peristaltic pump was used to pump contaminant free distilled water down the sample tube and out into the formation to mitigate sediment clogging of the port screen at the desired sampling depth the pump was reversed and distilled water followed by groundwater from the targeted depth were drawn up to surface where water samples were collected in the same type of manifold system as described for the mls sampling procedure samples were typically collected after purging 200 ml of water in excess of the tubing volume to ensure full removal of distilled water from the sampling line after sample collection the profiler tip was advanced to the next depth while distilled water was pumped down the line to the stainless steel tip further details on the sampling procedure can be found in guilbeault et al 2005 a vertical profile was collected at 22 locations spaced approximately 5 to 10 m apart with groundwater samples collected every 0 30 m to a depth of 4 5 m below the base of the pond grab samples of surface water were collected in the pond at every third sampling location surface water samples were obtained within 0 1 m above the pond bed in 40 ml voa vials the caps were removed and reattached at the submerged point the sample was taken to minimize vertical mixing and air exposure once collected the surface water and direct push samples were placed in ice and sent to the university of waterloo waterloo on canada for analyses a total of 170 samples were collected along the pond transect during the direct push sampling campaign 2 4 geochemical data processing voc concentrations were qualified against laboratory blanks and control samples as well as field blanks using a standardized process us epa 1999 resulting in four data quality categories 1 quantifiable results above the limit of quantification 2 detected but not quantifiable 3 flagged due to detections in the associated field blanks and 4 not detected the analysis included 21 organic compounds representing 97 of all contaminants detected at the site nineteen of the 21 compounds included in the analysis were detected in the groundwater samples to evaluate the spatial distribution of broad suites of contaminants across the mls and direct push transects the high quality detectable results i e excluding field blank flagged detections were classified into chlorinated ethene chlorinated ethane btex and ketone groups total concentrations for each contaminant group were calculated from a summation of the individual analyte concentrations within a sample according to their respective contaminant classification total ethenes consisted of 1 1 dichloroethene cis 1 2 dichloroethene tetrachloroethene trans 1 2 dichloroethene trichloroethene and vinyl chloride total ethanes consisted of 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 dichloroethane 1 2 dichloroethane and chloroethane total btex consisted of benzene ethylbenzene m p xylenes o xylene and toluene and total ketones consisted of 2 butanone 4 methyl 2 pentanone and acetone analyte concentrations below their detection limit within a sample were designated as non detects nd and the reported concentrations were excluded from the summation tvoc was calculated using the sum of the concentrations of all analytes within a sample also excluding those below their detection limit a summary of the concentrations of organic contaminant groups and inorganic contaminants chloride dissolved organic carbon nitrate manganese ferrous iron and sulfate is provided in the si organic and inorganic contaminant concentrations were gridded using the triangulation and linear interpolation algorithm available in surfer v 13 6 golden software golden co usa this interpolation scheme was selected because of its greater consistency between the gridded regions and individual data point values this interpolation method also provided a more realistic representation of the depth discrete data where vertical sampling intervals are 1 2 orders of magnitude finer in the vertical direction than the horizontal direction 3 results and discussion 3 1 resolving geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity continuous cores revealed variability in quaternary lithofacies distribution fig 2 the sediments consist of clay rich fines sandy diamicts and sands and gravels of varying thickness 0 5 m to 15 20 m thick and lateral extent 10s to 1000 s of meters parker et al 2006 harvey et al 2019 grain size analysis and permeameter measurements on repacked soil samples collected across the study area provide a wide range of hydraulic conductivity k values with k for diamicts ranging from 3 10 8 to 6 10 6 m s muddy sands ranging from 2 10 8 to 2 10 7 m s and sands and gravels ranging from 2 10 5 to 2 10 3 m s harvey et al 2019 slug tests from conventional monitoring wells in the study area indicate horizontal hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 10 6 to 2 10 4 m s within the unconsolidated sediments hsi geotrans 1998 and 8 10 9 to 1 10 3 m s within the bedrock parker et al 2015 vertical hydraulic head profiles collected in august to september 2004 from the waterloo mlss fig 2 head log show three main features 1 no to minimal change in hydraulic head with depth throughout the undifferentiated bedrock combined with lowermost quaternary sediments 2 a large change in hydraulic head with depth across a 1 m section of the upper portion of stratigraphic unit 1 su1 creating an upward vertical component of the hydraulic gradient at mls wells mp 14 mp 13r mp 12 and mp 11 and 3 no to minimal change in hydraulic head with depth throughout the uppermost quaternary sediments sections of head profiles with no to minimal head change with depth are common in areas with minimal heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dominated by lateral flow meyer et al 2014 2016 and do not indicate leakage between the depth discrete monitoring intervals of the mlss harvey et al 2019 evaluated head profiles collected multiple times per year between 2004 and 2017 from these locations and found they were highly repeatable fig 2 2016 provided as an example the persistent upward hydraulic gradients associated with the upper part of su1 and or the contact between su1 and su2 indicate some degree of restriction to vertical flow within the quaternary sediment sequence harvey et al 2019 consequently harvey et al 2019 proposed three hydrogeologic units hgus within the quaternary sediments and top of rock contact hgu1 the undifferentiated bedrock combined with the lower most quaternary sediments hgu2 the upper part of su1 and hgu3 the uppermost quaternary sediments this simple hgu model is somewhat counterintuitive because of the complex stratigraphy in this ice marginal depositional setting figs 2 and 3 the lack of hydrogeologic heterogeneity substantiated by the head profiles is attributed to the insensitivity of the head profiles in this setting to all but the largest changes in hydraulic conductivity combined with the sandy nature of the diamicts 48 89 sand in the matrix producing only small contrasts in hydraulic conductivity and no strong aquitards within the sequence harvey et al 2019 hydraulic head data collected in august and september 2004 from the mlss and in june 2004 from the conventional monitoring wells p and mw labelled wells fig 3a were contoured by hand along a vertical cross section roughly parallel to flow between the source zone and downgradient of the pond the hydraulic head distribution indicates groundwater flow is predominantly horizontal to downward toward the east between the source zone and the drumlin feature west of the pond thereafter groundwater flow shifts upward from the bedrock and lowermost quaternary deposits su1 where it enters the overlying upper quaternary deposits su2 and su4 along the west bank of the pond these data also suggest the pinching out of the su3 diamtics and facies shift of the su4 diamicts k 3 0 10 8 to 6 10 6 m s to the su4 gravelly sands k 1 7 10 5 to 2 1 10 3 m s near the western bank of the pond may further facilitate upward flow and discharge into the pond which is acting as a local groundwater drain harvey 2017 harvey et al 2019 the hydraulic head data collected in august and september 2004 from the mlss were also contoured along the mls transect perpendicular to the dominant direction of flow to further evaluate the vertical component of hydraulic gradient just upgradient of the discharge point fig 3b these head contours accentuate the strong upward component of hydraulic gradient associated with hgu2 the sandy diamict in su1 and or the contact between su1 and su2 but do not provide direct evidence of flow directions given the orientation of the section with respect to the dominant flow direction based on the head data from conventional wells and the high resolution mlss together with pond inflow and outflow data the groundwater surface water interaction can be characterized as a flow through system with groundwater predominantly discharging to the pond along the north and west side with surface water recharging toward the east and southeast 3 2 organic contaminant distribution and redox zonation tvoc profiles collected parallel fig 3a and perpendicular fig 3b to groundwater flow show concentrations can vary by five orders of magnitude with steep concentration gradients between adjacent ports data provided in table s1 maximum tvoc concentrations 10 to 500 mg l occur near the quaternary bedrock interface as the contaminants approach the west edge of the pond hydraulic gradients shift upward and direct the contaminants across the quaternary bedrock interface through the interbedded diamict of su1 and eventually through the overlying sand and gravel layers that intersect the pond su2 and su4 fig 3a these data indicate that although the upper part of su1 or the su1 su2 contact provides some resistance to flow the su1 sediments do not act as a high integrity aquitard with respect to the dissolved phase plume tvoc concentrations were further assessed by comparing the spatial distribution of organic contaminant group concentrations data provided in table s1 across the pond transect b b in fig 1 as shown in fig 4 ketones were the most concentrated across the transect up to 50 mg l followed by chlorinated ethenes up to 20 mg l and then btex and ethanes up to 5 mg l the transect reveals differences in the spatial distribution of the contaminant groups the chlorinated ethenes were mainly detected at the southern edge of the transect mp 14 in the shallowest ports of mp 13r and in the middle ports of mp 12 while btex ketones and chlorinated ethanes tended to occur in areas where chlorinated ethene concentrations were low i e middle ports of mp 13r and deep ports of mp 12 the heterogeneity observed in the contaminant distributions on the b b transect does not appear to be related to the distribution of lithostratigraphic or hydrogeologic units this lack of relationship indicates mechanisms other than differences in flow paths control contaminant distributions as the plume enters the pond the waterloo profiler results along the pond transect c c in fig 1 data provided in table s2 reveal a similar spatial distribution of ethenes ethanes and btex fig 5 as observed along the upgradient b b transect however maximum concentrations observed in the waterloo profiling results were 90 lower than the maximum concentrations observed along the transect 20 m upgradient in addition ketones were only detected in low concentrations at one sample point near the southeastern end of the pond fig 5 in the shallow portion of the pond bed concentrations of chlorinated ethanes and btex were non detect or very low across all but the northern most portion of the transect chlorinated ethenes were more concentrated across the middle of the transect fig 5 4 771 490 4 771 630 m northing surface water measurements collected from the northwest corner of the pond and from water discharging underneath the culvert confirmed higher concentrations of chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes and btex discharging to surface water data provided in table s3 chlorinated ethenes and to some extent chlorinated ethanes were also detected 50 500 μg l in surface water samples along the drainage ditch south of mp 14 fig 6 these surface water concentrations are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than those observed along the c c profiler transect the reduction of voc mass as groundwater flows through the pond bed and back out provides a partial explanation for the non detect contaminant concentrations on the downgradient side of the pond at mp 10 samples obtained from the b b transect c c transect and the pond indicate substantial contaminant concentration variability over relatively short 20 m distances chapman et al 2007 also observed marked attenuation of a tce and 1 2 cis dichloroethene cis dce plume as it intersected several minor surface water features a small pond and two streams prior to discharging into a river however their study concluded that while degradation played a role in local groundwater plume attenuation most of the observed attenuation in groundwater was due to discharge into the minor surface water features with appreciable concentrations measured in surface water samples and subsequent dilution and volatilization the attenuation of chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes btex and ketones at this study site appears to be strongly dependent on redox conditions figs 7 and 8 fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of chloride cl doc and redox sensitive species no3 mn2 fe2 and so4 2 along the a a longitudinal profile data provided in table s4 the high doc 100 mg l accumulation of mn2 2 mg l and low so4 2 50 mg l concentrations 190 m downgradient of the source zone at mp 9 directly above the quaternary bedrock interface indicate the presence of strongly reducing conditions furthermore elevated cl concentrations 13 to 280 mg l may be indicative of reductive dechlorination of the chlorinated contaminants moving 160 m downgradient to mp 12 cl and mn2 concentrations decrease to 5 to 107 mg l and 0 4 to 1 5 mg l respectively indicating weaker reducing conditions and thus lower potential for reductive dechlorination hydraulic gradients indicate a downward potential as groundwater travels away from the pond here mp 10 reveals maximum concentrations of cl and mn2 ranging between 21 and 68 mg l and 0 2 and 0 7 mg l respectively while no3 and so4 2 concentrations are elevated to between 0 4 and 7 4 mg l and 48 and 267 mg l respectively this indicates a predominantly oxidizing environment downgradient of the pond background concentrations for these redox indicators from outside the contaminant plume in 2009 revealed measurable no3 4 1 5 81 mg l and so4 2 19 52 mg l low concentrations of mn2 0 01 0 02 mg l and non detect dissolved fe2 and doc table 1 spatial distribution of cl doc and redox sensitive species no3 mn2 fe2 and so4 2 along the b b transect fig 8 show the degree of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated compounds and redox conditions upgradient of the discharge area high doc concentrations were observed throughout the middle and deep ports of mp 13r and the deeper ports of mp 12 the similar spatial distribution of doc and high ketone concentrations along with the occurrence of btex suggest a large portion of the doc signal may be due to the presence of ketones elevated concentrations of mn2 fe2 and doc which indicate reducing conditions are co located in the center of the transect around the deeper ports of mp 13r and mp 12 these sampling ports are located within the bedrock and su1 near the quaternary bedrock interface the reducing conditions in the bedrock and deepest part of su1 in the center of the transect loosely correspond to an area where so4 2 and chlorinated ethenes and ethanes are low these reducing conditions would limit the oxidation of btex and ketones fig 8 conversely low or non detect doc mn2 and fe2 along with elevated no3 and so4 2 at the southern and northern edge of the transect mp 14 and mp 11 within su2 and su4 indicate oxidization of ketones and btex ketone concentrations along the b b and c c transects show strong attenuation as they approach the pond bed fig 5 which could be explained by co metabolic degradation ketones and btex could serve as substrates for the microbes prior to groundwater discharging to the surface water environment 3 3 role of lithologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity on contaminant distribution a comparison of the sum of measured chlorinated ethene and ethane concentrations to the sum of measured btex and ketone concentrations fig 9 illustrates the opposing reactive behaviour of different contaminant groups under variable redox conditions the inverse relationship between the highest concentrations of chlorinated ethenes ethanes and btex ketones could be explained by contrasting redox conditions where sufficient contaminant concentrations are present the limited association between hydrocarbon oxidation reductive dichlorination with respect to lithology fig 9 shows that geologic hydrogeologic heterogeneity is not the primary mechanism controlling plume architecture rather variable groundwater flow paths through the napl source zone and spatially variable recharge are more likely influencing degradation mechanisms and ultimately contaminant distribution for instance relatively higher concentrations of btex ketones were observed within the sandy diamict at the base of the aquifer i e su1 fig 4 lower permeability and slightly deeper units were accompanied by more reducing conditions i e su1 fig 8 that would have inhibited aerobic oxidation of btex and ketones and facilitated chlorinated ethene and chlorinated ethane degradation via reductive dechlorination conversely higher concentrations of chlorinated ethenes ethanes were observed in the bedrock units and coarser sand and sandy gravel units su2 and su4 fig 4 where oxidizing conditions likely persist and prohibit degradation of the chlorinated compounds and allow for preferential degradation of btex and ketone this is supported by similarities in the distributions of these compounds fig 4 and total dissolved carbon fig 8 along the mls transect that coincide with lower concentrations of ethenes however compositional variability in the source zone might explain the absence of the expected strong positive relationship between ethenes ethanes and btex ketones concentrations during co metabolic degradation however the evidence clearly shows plume composition and concentration variability are accentuated with overlapping physical chemical and microbial heterogeneities 4 conclusions depth discrete multilevel sampling of a mixed organic contaminant plume in an unconfined aquifer provided evidence of steep concentration gradients between major contaminant groups over relatively short lateral distances tens of meters and narrow vertical distances tens of centimeters these gradients resulted in distinct hydrochemical zones and marked contaminant compositional variability consistent with degradation potential associated with redox controls peak contaminant distributions measured along the mls sampling network orthogonal to groundwater flow i e transects indicated the shallow portion of the contaminant plume migrates horizontally along the quaternary bedrock interface as the plume approaches the pond the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient shifts flow upward where the west side of the pond serves as a local groundwater receptor upward migration of contaminants is likely facilitated by the presence of permeable sand and gravelly sand su2 and su4 units underlying the pond bed thinning of a sandy diamict layer su3 along the west edge of the pond and a lack of aquitards within the unconsolidated sediments yet a comparison between transects located 20 m upgradient of the pond and within the pond bed showed considerable changes in contaminant concentrations e g over 90 reduction in peak concentrations as the plume reaches the surface water this suggests that assessment of contaminant mass discharge to receptors may be highly dependent on the distance separating multilevel transects and contaminant receptors due to increasing rates of contaminant degradation in well established redox zones near plume discharge the spatial heterogeneity observed in terms of contaminant concentration and composition did not reflect observed geologic or physical hydrogeologic heterogeneities initially this was a relatively surprising result because the quaternary sediments deposited in an ice marginal environment were expected to be hydrostratigraphically complex with multiple till units controlling plume architecture however hydrogeologic heterogeneity was not particularly strong based on several factors including small total head differentials across the quaternary sediments that indicate slight hydraulic conductivity contrasts the sandy nature of the diamicts and the limited lateral extent of many of the stratigraphic units our comparison of the spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations and compositions along closely spaced transects provided an opportunity to test the sensitivity of the plume to geologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity comparison of the lithostratigraphy and hgus to the voc group distributions shown along the mls transect indicated a weak relationship between contaminant distribution and the stratigraphic or hydrogeologic unit framework closer inspection of the contaminant distributions suggested the complex internal plume architecture results from the spatial complexity in redox conditions and associated microbial communities that arise due to the high concentrations and multi component nature of the plume therefore lithologic and hydrogeologic physical heterogeneity are not the primary factors controlling contaminant distributions along the flow paths this strong influence of redox controls was corroborated by a comparison of contaminant distributions over short transverse and longitudinal distances with minimal variations in lithologic and hydrogeologic properties additional but less dominant contributors to internal plume heterogeneity included unknown variability in dnapl composition enhanced by variable dissolution rates in the aged dnapl source zone as well as limited groundwater mixing due to modest lithologic and hydrogeologic variability observed in these sandy glacial derived sediments the high concentration contaminant conditions produced strongly reducing zones that support near complete reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes at the upgradient edge of the pond these reducing zones were juxtaposed with less reducing to oxidizing zones that support preferential degradation of btex and ketones based on these findings it is reasonable to expect substantial heterogeneity in complex mixtures of organic contaminants nearing discharge to surface water even where only modest lithologic and hydrogeologic heterogeneity is present future work will focus on quantifying the relative contribution of each of these processes to the observed contaminant heterogeneity by evaluating data from multiple voc and redox parameter sampling rounds through time including complementary compound specific isotope analysis csia and

discrete sampling methods i e continuous core direct push multilevel sampling applied along transects are essential for characterizing the internal complexity of aged mixed organic contaminant plumes because the character of these plumes can change over lateral distances of meters or less and vertical distances of tens of cm or less in layered sedimentary systems characterizing plume flow paths

metrics einarson 2017 itrc 2010 and focus shifts to more complex sites national research council nrc 2013 depth discrete contaminant concentrations constrained by a robust hydrogeologic framework will play a critical role in the assessment of natural attenuation and receptor risk the data collected as part of a high resolution transect approach would support cost benefit analyses of microbial and

1484,in europe most environmental based water quality research has focused on both nutrient and microbial contamination which can arise from agricultural processes and inadequate wastewater treatment recent work in ireland has linked the presence of arsenic in groundwater at elevated concentrations at national and subnational scales with bedrock lithology serving as a strong predictor variable groundwater data was collected as part of an environmental impact assessment for a road construction project and this resulting groundwater geochemistry dataset was used in this present study to assess the geochemical controls of arsenic in natural waters in addition to biological and nutrient contamination physiochemical parameters trace elements nutrients organics and microbiological parameters were collected for every quarter for four years 2004 2008 in 67 wells due to differing sampling procedures and limitations in the data only one quarter november 2005 was used to understand groundwater geochemistry in greater detail multivariate statistical techniques were used to overcome the presence of non detect data this is an important consideration as while methods exist for chemical data methods incorporating biological data are limited elevated levels of nitrate in groundwater may arise from the runoff of septic tanks and or agricultural practices in the area both pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were not detected in any wells signifying no anthropogenic contamination inputs however fuel products such as methyl tert butyl ether were detected and potentially illustrate point source contamination these were detected in only one well geochemical data indicate that elevated arsenic concentrations are present within alkali oxic groundwaters through the desorption from fe and mn oxyhydroxides i e alkali desorption this study examines of the geochemistry of arsenic in groundwater in ireland at a local scale in addition the multivariate methods used in this study were able to fully integrate both chemical and biological censored data which may be applied in other regions with similar data keywords arsenic environmental monitoring microbial contamination trace elements non detects 1 introduction groundwater represents a source of drinking water for many regions in the world through abstraction in public and private sources historically most research on groundwater contamination has focused primarily on nutrients such as nitrate from agricultural practices fenton et al 2009 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 wick et al 2012 microbial contamination arising from domestic wastewater treatment systems dwwts gill et al 2018 balderacchi et al 2013 hynds et al 2014 keegan et al 2014 llopis gonzález et al 2014 hydrocarbons from poor storage practices philips et al 2007 and major ion chemistry from the dissolution of primarily mineral phases in the bedrock reimann and birke 2010 petrunic et al 2012 caulfield et al 2014 due to advances in analytical instrumentation such as multielement determination and improved detection limits there has been an increase in the detection of trace elements with elevated concentrations of arsenic observed in europe katsoyiannis et al 2014 morrison et al 2016 mcgrory et al 2017 mcgrory et al 2018 medunić et al 2020 elevated concentrations of arsenic in groundwater can cause adverse health effects in humans bondu et al 2017a katsoyiannis et al 2014 medunić et al 2020 while public sources of groundwater from boreholes dugwells etc are regulated in ireland private sources of groundwater located mainly in rural ireland remain largely unregulated un monitored and poorly maintained hynds et al 2014 in ireland the onus remains on the homeowner to test the water quality of their private groundwater well when these private groundwater wells are sampled often there are frequent exceedances of trace elements i e iron and manganese and less frequently arsenic above the corresponding public water quality standards ayotte et al 2003 bondu et al 2017a mcgrory et al 2017 and 2018 localised studies like the present study can offer greater insights for understanding arsenic geochemistry in groundwater when compared to earlier larger scale studies mcgrory et al 2017 and 2018 this is an important consideration as there can be a large spatial variation in arsenic concentrations in groundwater over small spatial scales ravenscroft et al 2009 elevated arsenic concentrations observed from this present study location are most likely as a result of geogenic sources associated with bedrock lithology mcgrory et al 2017 this is in line with a similar trend observed for other areas in europe smedley and kinniburgh 2013 mcgrory et al 2017 medunić et al 2020 in environmental analysis non detect or censored data i e data reported below the detection limit dl are often encountered with either removal i e deleting non detect value or substitution i e replacing non detect value with a numerical value such as 0 as common practices to handle these data farnham et al 2002 grunsky 2010 helsel 2005 2010 and 2012 these traditional approaches of controlling non detects in datasets has led to over estimation and under estimation during interpretation of parameters in environmental studies due to the over or under estimation during interpretation these are not appropriate methods which is evident by lack of harmonisation and consistent methodology between several regulatory and state agencies for example the substitution method of one half of the detection limit has been historically advocated as the method of choice by the united states environmental protection agency usepa which is also adopted in europe based on the eu groundwater directive annex iv usepa 2000 ec 2006 gibbons et al 2009 however it must be noted that in the eu based on the eu groundwater directive the method of using one half of the detection limit is not recommended for handling non detect pesticide data ec 2006 in comparison the united states geological survey usgs recommends that these substitution methods are not used helsel and hirsch 2002 while previous work has shown that censored data analysis can be adopted for censored chemical data i e arsenic in groundwater these approaches are rarely encountered for biological data i e microbiological parameters in the literature microbiological data such as number of colony forming units of a bacteria in a sample may be represented mathematically as discrete data i e as a whole number while the concentration of arsenic and other water quality parameters are often represented as continuous data these data often contain decimal points as a result these substitution methods are not considered appropriate for successfully handling microbiological data canales et al 2018 while there is a limited application of censored data analysis for microbiological data in the literature recent work has shown the applicability of interpreting both censored microbiological and chemical data using multivariate analysis as an effective methodology to overcome these limitations wangkahad et al 2017 the application of multivariate statistical analysis msa can be conducted in order to understand the associations and relationships in a system with a large number of parameters including chemical microbiological and physical while traditional msa techniques fail to account for censored data farnham et al 2002 grunsky 2010 several procedures can be applied prior to implementing msa including binary methods presence absence ordinal methods ranks of data and wilcoxon type methods u scores helsel 2012 while binary procedures can result in a loss of information in the data ordinal methods are suitable where one dl is present while methods based on u scores can handle multiple dls present in the data helsel 2012 applications of ordinal based approaches with msa for water quality and microbiological parameters have been previously used elsewhere wangkahad et al 2017 however there has been a limited response to incorporate these censored data msa approaches in studies with censored microbiological data especially containing trace elements such as arsenic one of the main issues of these msa methods for censored data is how to successfully incorporate both chemical and biological data together using a censored data approach the purpose of this study is to illustrate how a msa approach can be implemented to incorporate both censored chemical and biological data in order to understand the origin of constituents in groundwater using an existing dataset this is an important consideration as currently there are a limited number of works showing how censored biological data are treated separately with few studies showing how both can be incorporated and used for interpretation of groundwater processes helsel 2012 wangkahad et al 2017 canales et al 2018 the trace element arsenic will be the focus of this study as historically the north east of ireland is known to contain elevated arsenic within groundwater mcgrory et al 2017 in addition there is limited understanding of the geochemical conditions giving rise to elevated arsenic in groundwater in local settings within ireland the objectives of this study are to implement censored data analysis in order to a investigate potential associations amongst the trace elements and with other variables such as microbiological field parameters nutrients and depth to understand groundwater processes b determine if there are any spatial associations between water quality variables c assess the source of excessive nutrient contamination d illustrate how a censored data msa approach can successfully be used to incorporate both chemical and biological data and the interpretations thereof and e explore the level of detected organic geochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and

impact statement eis for the development of the cross border ireland and northern ireland 14 km a1 n1 newry dundalk link road dual carriageway mouchel parkman 2002 groundwater sources were monitored in a rural agricultural area in north east ireland fig 1a b surface water were plotted on maps for context but no surface waters were sampled for parameters in this study area sixty seven wells were monitored quarterly for both physical and chemical parameters from november 2004 january 2008 within a 200 m buffer zone of the new road a dwwts or septic tank was present at each site while the specific location of the septic tank was not recorded field notes indicate that the majority were within the vicinity of the groundwater well the construction of this road was 30 months which started on february 2005 to july august 2007 with the road opening on 2nd august 2007 troll et al 2008 during road construction cuttings were completed in lower palaeozoic age sediments and carboniferous limestones depth of cut 5 m with a majority arising from the granites depth of cut 10 m of the slieve gullion complex bazley 2010 separately the dumping of oil has led to land contamination in some areas smith 2012 the main pressure from land use arises from mainly agriculture based land i e pastures 321 with some forestry mixed forest 313 and 324 transitional woodland scrub based on the corine land use datasets fig 1c 2 1 1 geological hydrogeological and environmental setting the geology of the area is mostly composed of lower palaeozoic silurian and ordivician turbidites and carboniferous limestones buckley and sweetman 1991 underlying these greywackes of the central belt are graptolitic shales chew and stillman 2009 to the north of the study area the local geology was deformed during the caledonian intrusion and mountain building episodes which resulted in faulting and low grade metamorphism the igneous complexes of slieve gullion were formed in the early tertiary most sites intersect the clontail formation fig 1b with the remaining sites intersecting the dinantian limestones undifferentiated formation the quaternary geology of the area mainly consists of till derived from lower palaeozoic sandstones and shales and till derived from granites with smaller amounts of alluvium bedrock outcrop or subcrop cut over raised peat lacustrine sediments estuarine silts and clays and drumlins within the locality of the study site the aquifers in the study area are classified as pi poor aquifer bedrock which is generally unproductive except for local zones lm locally important aquifer bedrock which is generally moderately productive and li locally important aquifer bedrock which is moderately productive only in local zones aquifer classification according to gsi methodology fig 1d which limits the yield of some of these private groundwater sources indeed the lower palaeozoic greywackes which contains greatest proportion of groundwater sources in this present study are classed as poor aquifers which have a low permeability with groundwater restricted to weathered zones or along fault or fissure zones mcconnell et al 2001 this area has high groundwater vulnerability according to gsi methodology with patches of extreme vulnerability with the main aquifer being pl fig 1e there are five groundwater vulnerability categories defined by the gsi that characterise the risk of contamination of groundwater by polluting activities the categories are based on i the permeability and thickness of the subsoils that overlie the groundwater ii the type of recharge whether point or diffuse and iii the thickness of the unsaturated zone through which the contaminant moves mcgrory et al 2017 the topography of the study area is hilly with higher elevation on the eastern side 182 272 m which decreases on approach to the western side 91 182 m buckley and sweetman 1991 causing groundwater to flow from a north eastern to south western direction fig 1f 2 2 groundwater sampling sampling of both shallow 6 m and deep 6 m groundwater wells was done quarterly by representatives of mouchel parkman on behalf of louth county council between 2004 and 2008 for 13 quarters private groundwater wells were purged 3 well volumes prior to sampling to remove stagnant water however due to the low permeability of the strata and groundwater ingress to the well was slow and thus full well volume was not recovered after each purge this meant thats the full 3 well volumes could not be accomplished at all sites in these cases one borehole volume was purged and was let recover where this process was repeated and then a groundwater sample was taken where it was impractical to purge i e large diameter wells a lower amount was completed or a tap sample taken at each sampling location water level measurements were taken using a dipmeter for shorthand well ids are denoted numerically i e w 22 further information on the sampling of each well is seen in table s1 supplementary information at each location a dedicated bailer was used to recover a groundwater sample in order to prevent cross contamination and after each use the bailer was cleaned and sealed in plastic sleeve field ph conductivity and temperature was recorded at each site using a portable meter these parameters were also recorded in the laboratory however field values are reported in the results in some cases it was not possible to monitor directly from the well i e no access to the well and samples were subsequently taken from the tap were after leaving it to run for 5 10 min samples

have been used to access the presence of faecal pollution in water and possible association with enteric pathogens savichtcheva and okabe 2006 however their application is associated with certain limitations savichtcheva and okabe 2006 while the presence of fib can be determined in water precise information in relation to the origin of this contamination is not known smith et al 2014 an alternative indicator of faecal pollution is with the detection of clostridium perfringens savichtcheva and okabe 2006 c perfringens faecal coliforms faecal streptococci and total coliforms were

benzo a anthrhacene chrysene benzo b fluorathene benzo k fluorathene benzo a pyrene indeno 123 cd pyrene dibenzo ah anthracene and benzo ghi perylele while the sum of 16 usepa pahs does not have a regulatory limit it is often used as an environmental indicator of organic contamination under the irish drinking water regulations the maximum concentration of the sum of 4 pahs is 100 ng l 1 benzo a

quarters of chemical data were collected from 2004 to 2008 however the data from quarter five november 2005 was used for analysis and interpretation due a high presence of censored data in the other quarters justification for choice of this quarter included i high dls were observed from some parameters due to upgrading in analytical instrumentation during monitoring 2004 2008 by the testing laboratory ii greatest proportion of trace elements above the dl were present in november 2005 iii quarter 5 shows low organic pah contamination compared to other seasons iv several measurement anomalies i e ph and temperature occurred for physical parameters in later quarters and v quarter 5 contained dissolved trace element data which was the most useful for the purposes of the present study 2 4 2 handling of data with multiple dls due to the presence of multiple censored data during chemical analysis the package non detects and data analysis nada lee 2013 was used in the r statistical environment r development core team 2017 based on methods from helsel 2012 the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf for each hydrochemistry variable was computed using the kaplan meier method helsel 2012 2 4 3 analysis by depth information in relation to well depth of some sampled sites was limited as only 39 sites had a depth value therefore wells were classified as being either a borehole bh or a dug well dw table s1 as a proxy for well depth descriptive statistics for variables for november 2005 taking account of censored values were computed for bh dw sites separately for each hydrochemistry variable ecdf were computed separately for each depth category bh and dw to test for differences in ecdfs between the bh dw variables the log rank test was performed on the ecdfs the number of samples above guideline values are given as a percentage for each variable in ireland these guideline values are not enforced for private groundwater supplies and as such they are used for informative and comparative reasons the onus for checking if parameters are below guideline values falls to the homeowner of the private groundwater supply hooks et al 2019 2 4 4 correlation analysis due to the presence of multiple dls the non parametric correlation coefficient kendall s tau τ was used to determine the strength of the monotonic relationship between pairs of variables where pairs may be singly censored one observation censored or doubly censored both observations censored helsel and hirsch 2002 helsel 2012 using the cenken function in the nada package lee 2013 strengths of correlation coefficients are described as τ 0 no relationship τ 0 3 weak relationship 0 3 τ 0 5 moderate relationship and τ 0 5 strong relationship khamis 2008 with those deemed as significance relationships in the population denoted by p value 0 05 p value 0 01 and p value 0 001 2 4 5 multivariate methods while univariate approaches use one variable at a time to perform statistical analysis the application of multivariate techniques can be applied to understand the relationships of many parameters and observations grunsky 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 these multivariate techniques can simplify the variation and relationships to a reduced number of dimensions which may be liked to a specific geochemical process grunsky 2010 by implementing clustering algorithms distinct natural groupings within multi dimensional data can be identified i e based on similarities or differences grunsky 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 hierarchical clustering was applied to cluster both variables r mode and sampled sites q mode adopting ward linkage between clusters the distance matrix for wells was determined by calculating absolute difference in ecdfs i e the distance between two individual wells i and j for the variable v k is d kij f v ki f v kj where f v k denotes the value of the kaplan meier estimated ecdf the total distance between two individual wells i and j across all p variables considered is determined by manhattan distance 1 d ij k 1 p d kij k 1 p f v ki f v kj the distance matrix for variables was kendall s tau correlation coefficient determined by the nada cenken r command i e the distance between two variables x and y is 2 d xy τ xy a heatmap was produced to display the values of the ecdfs and the resulting clustering dendrograms i e parameters and sites 2 4 6 spatial mapping spatial mapping was completed for key parameters as ph fe mn se sb no3 and tc with geology using a system of five classes the class division depended on the parameter being investigated using arcgis 10 2 esri colorado in irish national grid 1965 datum mcgrory et al 2017 mcgrory et al 2018 where non detects were present they were binned into the first classification in the case of microbiological parameters i e tc a detected value is classed as a failure so that the first interval only contained non detects i e groundwater is free from microbial contamination thus other classifications for microbiological parameters are designated as failures 2 4 7 aqueous geochemical modelling as the redox state of the groundwater was not measured eh values were calculated no3 no2 redox couple in phreeqci v3 4 appelo and postma 2005 using the wateq4f database ball and nordstrom 1991 these calculated values were used to assist in the interpretation rather than being incorporated into statistical analysis in addition saturation indices si for minerals were also calculated for wells in november 2005 the si is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the ion activity product iap of the component ions of the solid in solution to the solubility product k for the solid si log iap k the si of a given mineral indicates whether the groundwater is undersaturated si 0 at equilibrium si 0 or supersaturated si 0 naus et al 2001 appelo and postma 2005 if the groundwater is undersaturated with respect to a given mineral si then the groundwater would theoretically dissolve the mineral if present naus et al 2001 if groundwater is supersaturated with respect to a given mineral si then the mineral would theoretically precipitate from the groundwater naus et al 2001 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics results of the log rank test for differences in ecdf between the depth categories of bh and dw for different variables observed in november 2005 gives evidence of a difference for ph p 0 001 and water level p 0 001 only descriptive statistics minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum with censoring rates and percentage of

concentrations in groundwaters with observed median values for dws fe 2 μg l 1 and mn 1 μg l 1 and bhs fe 7 μg l 1 and mn 1 μg l 1 the highest concentration of fe was measured at 12820 μg l 1 in a borehole w 57 with an alkaline ph 7 99 ph units and an arsenic concentration of 9 μg l 1 the next highest value of fe was recorded in a dug well w 5 with an fe concentration of 769 l 1 with an acidic

μg l 1 in groundwater who 2005 in this study arsenic is the most detected trace element above the legal limit of 10 μg l 1 8 3 for dws and 18 6 for bhs this observation has been seen in other studies bondu et al 2017a 3 2 saturation indices the sis of several fe mn al and cu minerals was tabulated in table 4 3 3 spatial mapping interval mapping of groundwater quality parameters are illustrated in fig 4a h with the corresponding number of values per classification illustrated in table 5 as can be seen in the below table many samples were below the legal limits similar spatial distributions were observed for the same groups of parameters for example arsenic shows a spatial cluster in the central to southern area in this study fig 4a with concentrations 10 μg l 1 with ph also showing high

high concentrations of trace elements were observed e g fe by comparison other trace elements had several spatial clusters including mn there is a large variation in spatial distribution for no3 showing the widespread contamination of this nutrient most other nutrients were detected at low concentrations with low sample numbers measured at concentrations above the legal limit e g no2 and ammoniacal nitrogen while low numbers were detected for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci higher numbers were seen for total coliforms and to a somewhat lesser degree for c perfringens table 5

the partition of sites at the specification of three clusters resulting in clusters of 32 21 and 14 sites which are subsequently spatially mapped in fig 6 3 5 organic geochemistry no incidences of

mineralisation etc in combination with geochemical processes geothermal sulphide oxidation alkali desorption and reductive dissolution can contribute to the mobilisation of arsenic from the host material into the surrounding groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 based on the geochemistry of this present study arsenic is being mobilised though the process of alkali desorption as shown from the various statistical analysis mobilisation of arsenic arising from alkali desorption often produce groundwaters that give rise to elevated arsenic in addition to other oxyanion forming elements such as sb se and u through desorption from amorphous or crystalline oxyhydroxides ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 this geochemical process can be inferred from several key geochemical signatures of this process while ph is a key indicator of metal mobility and of alkali desorption it shows a weak increasing association with arsenic in the present study τ 0 27 fig 2 and table s2 which may be lower than expected due to a high number of more acidic dug wells in this study and potential outliers see below while the ph values have a narrow range in this study 6 11 8 19 ph units elevated arsenic concentrations occur at an alkaline ph 7 5 ph units with the majority of sites containing concentrations of arsenic 10 μg l 1 being sampled from deeper groundwater in boreholes fig 3b and table s1 several locations in this study which had elevated concentrations of arsenic also contained detected se and or sb fig 4e f in these groundwaters arsenic shows a positive correlation with se τ 0 11 see cluster two table 6 the presence of elevated oxidised n species such as no3 is also indicative of this mobilisation process ravenscroft et al 2009 as alkali oxic groundwaters are needed for this geochemical process while eh was not measured thermodynamic calculations indicate that the groundwater is oxic several metal oxides e g cuprous ferrite diaspore goethite and gibbsite are supersaturated in these groundwaters which is indicative of precipitation or desorption table 4 these supersaturated mineral phases indicate that these fe and mn oxides and to a lesser extent al and cu may be responsible for release and transport of arsenic in groundwaters through the process of alkaline desorption as observedin the bedrock aquifers of argentina usa and spain smedley et al 2002 ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 these observations are supported from cluster two table 6 from the hca furthermore the lack of a correlation between arsenic and iron in this study is indicative of reductive dissolution or desorption processes levitt et al 2019 interestingly arsenic is also clustered with toc cluster two table 6 with these two variables showing a weak positive correlation τ 0 16 fig 2 suggesting that the source of arsenic may be organic however further work would need to be carried out to assess this generally arsenic mobilisation through alkali desorption produces waters with arsenic concentrations 100 μg l 1 ravenscroft et al 2009 with concentrations in this study having a maximum concentration of 25 μg l 1 groundwaters with elevated arsenic concentrations 10 μg l 1 are associated with alkaline ph 7 13 8 19 ph units detection of sb and or se moderate so4 2 42 mg l 1 low fe and mn 14 μg l 1 for fe and 2 μg l 1for mn and low or no microbial contamination in contrast when fe and or mn concentrations are 20 μg l 1 then low arsenic concentrations are measured maximum arsenic concentration of 3 μg l 1 with a mixed ph of 6 38 8 04 ph units based on threshold values of key parameters e g no3 fe and mn and so4 2 it is likely that there are mixed redox processes occurring in these groundwaters mcmahon and chapelle 2008 most sites exhibiting elevated arsenic concentrations are observed in the clontail formation with corresponding lower concentrations in the dinantian limestones fig 5a whilst most of the elevated arsenic in groundwater is inferred from alkali desorption other processes may be having a greater influence on two distinct wells w 57 and w 22 the process of reductive dissolution is the most commonly encountered arsenic mobilisation mechanism encountered worldwide in groundwaters which affects many regions in southeast asia e g west bengal and bangladesh through the microbial mediated process of reductive dissolution of arsenic from metal oxides e g fe smedley and kinniburgh 2013 ali et al 2019 this process may be occurring in w 57 dissolved fe was 12 820 μg l 1 but as an isolated incident it may have occurred from contamination from sampling or specific well conditions i e stagnant water oxidising conditions using theoretically calculated eh values are prevalent in these groundwaters and as such the elevated arsenic can also result from sulphide oxidation i e w 22 although not as prevalent as reductive dissolution the processes of sulphide oxidation and alkali desorption have given rise to elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater particularly in fractured bedrock aquifers smedley et al 2002 ayotte et al 2003 hudson edwards and archer 2012 ryan et al 2015 bondu et al 2017b under the process of sulphide oxidation the oxidation of sulphide minerals such as arsenopyrite pyrite and pyrrhotite occurs to produce so4 2 rich often up to hundreds of mg l 1 acidic groundwaters in addition to increased concentrations of other trace elements e g ni pb cu zn and cd ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 besides one anomaly e g w 22 concentrations of these trace elements were generally low in w 22 several trace elements were measured at elevated values al 119 μg l 1 cr 334 μg l 1 as 15 μg l 1 fe 133 μg l 1 mn 33 μg l 1 ni 256 μg l 1 cu 100 μg l 1 and se 18 μg l 1 however the values reported for so4 2 and ph are inconsistent with this process and may represent dissolved mineral phases it also must be noted that w 22 was not sampled directly from the well but from a tap sample table s1 however other samples taken from taps did not have elevated values of trace elements as per w 22 mercury concentrations recorded in this study ranged 0 05 0 1 μg l 1 which is below the regulatory value of 1 μg l 1 in ireland which is indicative that road construction did not affect hg concentrations who 2005 ec 2007 4 2 the source of nutrient microbial and organic contamination the majority of groundwaters shows contamination of both nutrients and or microbes as evident from cluster five in table 6 and fig 5 microbiological parameters had the greatest number of samples above the legal limit with total coliforms showing the greatest proportion in both groundwater depth types generally total coliforms and faecal coliforms were more elevated when compared to c perfringens and faecal streptococci table 3 spatially most elevated microbiological parameters intersect the poorly productive aquifers pl of the study area in addition the land use of this area is pastures with a moderate to extreme groundwater vulnerability illustrating how these microbiological parameters may enter the groundwater system via flow patterns as the north of this locality has ahigh elevation the presence of these faecal microbiological bacteria indicates that some input of faecal waste or sewage to these groundwater sources elsewhere it has been shown that septic tanks were responsible for the prevalence of bacteria within groundwater with dug wells being twice as susceptible to this bacterial contamination when compared to boreholes due to surface contamination hynds et al 2012 hynds et al 2014 when improperly installed or maintained these dwwtss may represent a source of nutrients and enteric pathogens which can affect water quality naughton and hynds 2014 withers et al 2014 total coliforms have been detected in groundwater in the absence of faecal streptococci or coliforms as total coliforms are present in soil bacteria in groundwater may result from the overburden or subsoils moving into the borehole as a result of poor well construction practices in ireland older boreholes were constructed in order to maximise the flow of groundwater into the borehole resulting in a blend of deep groundwater and the more polluted shallow groundwater mcgrory et al 2018 modern borehole design i e igi 2007 epa 2013 excludes this easily polluted shallow groundwater mcgrory et al 2018 if bacteria were resulting from soils then after a dry summer the bacterial quality would improve as the shallow groundwater containing bacteria would be depleted and thus is making a negligible contribution to the borehole flow epa 2013 elevated concentrations of nitrate were detected in wells particularly above the limit of 50 mg l 1 with concentrations approaching 134 1 mg l 1 nitrate in groundwater can arise from both point and non point sources such as septic tanks oxidation of organically bound n in soils agricultural activities and animal feed with elevated concentration giving rise to health conditions e g methemoglobinemia appelo and postma 2005 bondu et al 2017a in shallow groundwaters contamination can originate from the excessive application of fertilizers and manure from agricultural practices both shallow and deeper groundwaters had similar values of elevated no3 with 10 of sites having a no3 concentration greater than the drinking water limit of nitrate i e 50 mg l 1 in contrast both nitrite no2 and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n are not present in detectable quantities in many samples which is likely as a result of the rapid conversion to no3 in a suspected oxygenated environment with denitrification as a result petrunic et al 2012 given that concentrations of no3 generally exceed 25 mg l 1 anthropogenic nutrient activity represents a major impact on groundwater in this study either from organic waste i e septic tank and slurry and or inorganic fertilizer sources also the evidence of a moderate positive correlation of nitrate with c perfringens and total coliforms a fib τ 0 38 supports the rationale that these nutrients originate from septic tank sources table s2 and fig 2 indeed septic tanks may be one potential source of anthropogenic nutrients as b shows a correlation with no3 τ 0 25 c perfringens τ 0 24 and total coliforms τ 0 16 and to a lesser degree toc τ 0 14 which is also evident from cluster 5 from the hca analysis presented in table 6 however no3 shows a weak correlation with cl illustrating how domestic sewage is not a major source of nitrate in this study zhang et al 2020 this response is further supported as b is a common component in many household detergents which moves through septic systems and thus a potential indicator of domestic waste in the environment thurman et al 1984 wang et al 2000 epa 2003 the concentrations of boron observed in this study maximum 76 μg l 1 are generally above the natural background level of 15 μg l 1 potentially indicating an urban pollution source buss et al 2004 tedd et al 2017 while b may behave conservatively in aqueous systems it can sorb onto oxyhydroxides and clay surfaces and ultimately this sorption is a mechanism to remove b from groundwater table 5 4 wang et al 2000 in addition b is also a minor component of fertilizers tedd et al 2017 however if organic waste i e septic tanks was responsible for all instances of elevated nutrients then concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen 0 1 mg l 1 would be expected to be observed if septic tanks were in close proximity to the well cronin and deakin 2000 however only five wells had concentrations 0 2 2 7 mg l 1 with the remaining wells being below the dl 0 2 or 0 258 mg l 1 it must be noted that detected ammoniacal nitrogen was observed in only boreholes and not in dug wells as expected from a septic tank source for the remaining microbiological parameters there appears to be a weak correlation except a moderate relationship exists with total coliforms and c perfringens τ 0 38 in contrast given that the groundwater vulnerability of the study ranges from moderate to extreme the groundwater may be susceptible to this nutrient contamination as a result of land spreading of fertilizers inorganic and organic slurry given that the main hydrological pressure is agricultural land and one third of sampling locations are surface dug wells while this diffuse source may be occurring in the study area as it is predominately an agricultural area detailed information on where land spreading is occurring remains unknown however given the high level of contamination from total coliforms in these groundwaters it is possible that the source of groundwater nitrate results from organic waste i e slurry or septic tank cronin and deakin 2000 however low instances of faecal coliforms including escherichia coli were detected in this study 15 shallow and deep groundwater wells suggesting that organic waste from septic systems is not a source for most sites cronin and deakin 2000 based on this and other data it is expected that the majority of elevated nitrate results from inorganic fertilizer practices due to absence of faecal coliforms with minor contribution from organic waste both slurry and septic tank sources however it must be noted that even though faecal coliforms were not detected in 52 wells this may result from the bacteria not surviving due to either attenuation or time of travel to well is greater than 100 days cronin and deakin 2000 variations in groundwater nitrate concentrations are affected by complex physical and chemical processes within the soil subsoil and aquifers which result in some areas been more susceptible to contamination when compared to others tedd et al 2014 reduction of nitrate to nitrite is expected to occur only in a small percentage given the high rate of non detects for nitrite organic n can be converted to nitrate through the process of ammonification organic matter converted to ammonia and nitrification ammonia converted to nitrate under aerobic processes wang et al 2000 while other key indices may help constrict the nutrient source such as k na ratio and cl concentrations cronin and deakin 2000 these could not be used in this study as k was not measured and this study area is within 20 km of the coast so sea spray may be a contributing factor in this study area contamination of the nutrient nitrate is likely occurring from multiple sources in addition to the above observation with nutrients a correlation is observed with na and cl τ 0 37 for many samples the na cl ratio nearly equals 1 1 indicative of halite dissolution in groundwater chenini et al 2010 with geochemical modelling illustrating that halite is undersaturated in the groundwater cluster 3 table 6 fluoride was only detectable above the legal value in one location w 23 measured at a value of 3 1 mg l 1 while groundwater showed anthropogenic contamination of nutrients i e nitrate negligible contamination of organic geochemistry i e pahs vocs and pesticides occurred with only cs2 and mtbe being detected it is expected that these vocs originated from a pyrolytic origin i e from fossil fuels such as diesel from point pollution however the low number of detected vocs could have resulted from contamination not reaching the zone of contribution of the borehole overall groundwater shows negligible contamination resulting from organic geochemistry parameters however point pollution indicative by excessive nutrient and microbes illustrates that anthropogenic activities are occurring in this area 4 3 multivariate analysis all clusters isolated from hierarchical cluster analysis contained a mixture of both dws and bhs fig 1a the first cluster for variables shows similarity amongst transition series metals i e fe cr and ni illustrating a common mineral source arsenic is clustered in the same group as other oxyanions se and sb in addition to ph further showing the key geochemical parameters in alkali desorption processes as discussed in earlier sections the 4th and 5th clusters contain the microbiological based parameters nutrients and the remaining trace element including boron illustrating the widespread nutrient i e no3 and microbial contamination present in wells of this study area while nitrate was grouped in this cluster elevated nitrate was also seen in the remaining clusters this hierarchical clustering analysis was able to discern the two dominant water processes occurring alkali desorption of arsenic from fe oxyhydroxides and microbial and nutrient contamination of wells resulting from fertilizer and organic waste this analysis showed that arsenic concentrations are also associated with redox sensitive elements e g sb and se jiang et al 2015 by using these clustering techniques it is possible to identify distinct natural groupings within multi dimensional data grunsky 2010 in contrast sites clustered from the heatmap in cluster 1 n 32 are present within the centre to south of the study area with cluster sites identified in cluster 2 n 21 are located within the centre of the study area and the remaining sites cluster 3 n 14 mainly present to the south of the study area cluster 1 represents groundwater wells mainly associated with elevated arsenic concentrations alkaline ph and detection of sb se this cluster is contained within a spatial scale that extends to the whole study area and may be constrained by groundwater flow while cluster 1 extends to the whole study area both cluster 2 and 3 are generally more isolated cluster 2 generally contains more total coliforms in addition to fe and mn with low arsenic concentrations the main sampling sites within this cluster are north west of a hill within the porphyritic granophyre bedrock geology which may represent surface runoff from an agricultural pressure cluster 3 represents groundwater wells with low microbial contamination but with elevated trace elements e g cr al fe ni cu and mn while cluster 1 and 2 are mainly present in sampling sites within the clontail formation cluster 3 contains sites within the dinantian limestones 4 4 strengths and recommendations the findings of this study show the presence of elevated arsenic in a rock type which was previously described as containing elevated arsenic mcgrory et al 2017 as this data was collected as part of an eia for a new road construction it is likely there are more of this type of datasets in ireland and elsewhere these methods described here can be applied to other areas with similar eia datasets where data on arsenic and other environmentally relevant trace elements is sparse this study examines elevated arsenic in a fractured bedrock aquifer in ireland and provides a footprint of further research in other areas and several recommendations can be made as a result of the high censoring it is recommended that for new work the objectives and deliverables of the sampling campaign need to be fully considered at the planning phase for example a more rigid sampling and analytical protocol could be adopted to quantify sub μg l 1 concentrations of trace elements this work did not examine the influence of mitigation measures e g filters at the point of use in dwellings for elevated arsenic and would be of benefit to include in future works for health evaluation future works would need to include other oxidised species i e dissolved oxygen into the sampling strategy to assist with this interpretation to understand the complex processes of sewage in more detail sewage specific microbial source tracking methodologies adopted elsewhere e g wangkahad et al 2017 would need to be completed in addition to b isotopic data widory et al 2005 inclusion of a depth data category in the sampling protocol elsewhere depth has been linked as a factor explaining elevated arsenic concentrations thomas 2007 kim et al 2011 5 conclusions groundwater were sampled and analysed for several relevant parameters of environmental concern the main conclusions of this work in this study area are summarised below the source of trace elements particularly arsenic arise from geogenic sources rather than anthropogenic activities with alkali desorption causing the mobilisation of arsenic in groundwater in most of the sites groundwaters with elevated arsenic concentrations 10 μg l 1 are associated with alkaline ph 7 13 8 19 ph units detection of sb and or se moderate so4 2 low fe and mn with low or no microbial contamination high fe and or mn groundwaters are associated with low concentrations of arsenic there are low instances of organic contaminants in groundwaters and contamination of these are most likely representative of point source fuel spills i e mtbe elevated nitrate potentially results from inorganic fertilizer with less contribution from organic waste both slurry and septic tank sources however this environmental process warrants further research to understand these complex behaviours this study showed that both censored chemical and biological data can be integrated for the application of multivariate statistical analysis it is expected that the inclusion of similar eia datasets in ireland and elsewhere can be applied to understand the distribution of trace elements in groundwater systems where data is available author

1484,in europe most environmental based water quality research has focused on both nutrient and microbial contamination which can arise from agricultural processes and inadequate wastewater treatment recent work in ireland has linked the presence of arsenic in groundwater at elevated concentrations at national and subnational scales with bedrock lithology serving as a strong predictor variable groundwater data was collected as part of an environmental impact assessment for a road construction project and this resulting groundwater geochemistry dataset was used in this present study to assess the geochemical controls of arsenic in natural waters in addition to biological and nutrient contamination physiochemical parameters trace elements nutrients organics and microbiological parameters were collected for every quarter for four years 2004 2008 in 67 wells due to differing sampling procedures and limitations in the data only one quarter november 2005 was used to understand groundwater geochemistry in greater detail multivariate statistical techniques were used to overcome the presence of non detect data this is an important consideration as while methods exist for chemical data methods incorporating biological data are limited elevated levels of nitrate in groundwater may arise from the runoff of septic tanks and or agricultural practices in the area both pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were not detected in any wells signifying no anthropogenic contamination inputs however fuel products such as methyl tert butyl ether were detected and potentially illustrate point source contamination these were detected in only one well geochemical data indicate that elevated arsenic concentrations are present within alkali oxic groundwaters through the desorption from fe and mn oxyhydroxides i e alkali desorption this study examines of the geochemistry of arsenic in groundwater in ireland at a local scale in addition the multivariate methods used in this study were able to fully integrate both chemical and biological censored data which may be applied in other regions with similar data keywords arsenic environmental monitoring microbial contamination trace elements non detects 1 introduction groundwater represents a source of drinking water for many regions in the world through abstraction in public and private sources historically most research on groundwater contamination has focused primarily on nutrients such as nitrate from agricultural practices fenton et al 2009 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 wick et al 2012 microbial contamination arising from domestic wastewater treatment systems dwwts gill et al 2018 balderacchi et al 2013 hynds et al 2014 keegan et al 2014 llopis gonzález et al 2014 hydrocarbons

due to advances in analytical instrumentation such as multielement determination and improved detection limits there has been an increase in the detection of trace elements with elevated concentrations of arsenic observed in europe katsoyiannis et al 2014 morrison et al 2016 mcgrory et al 2017 mcgrory et al 2018 medunić et al 2020 elevated concentrations of arsenic in groundwater can cause adverse health effects in humans bondu et al 2017a katsoyiannis et al 2014 medunić et al 2020 while public sources of groundwater from boreholes dugwells etc are regulated in ireland private sources of groundwater located mainly in rural ireland remain largely unregulated un monitored and poorly maintained hynds et al 2014 in ireland the onus remains on the homeowner to test the water quality of their private groundwater well when these private groundwater wells are sampled often there are frequent exceedances of trace elements i e iron and manganese and less frequently arsenic above the corresponding public water quality standards ayotte et al 2003 bondu et al 2017a mcgrory et al 2017 and 2018 localised studies like the present study can offer greater insights for understanding arsenic geochemistry in groundwater when compared to earlier larger scale studies mcgrory et al 2017 and 2018 this is an important consideration as there can be a large spatial variation in arsenic concentrations in groundwater over small spatial scales ravenscroft et al 2009 elevated arsenic concentrations observed from this present study location are most likely as a result of geogenic sources associated with bedrock lithology mcgrory et al 2017 this is in line with a similar trend observed for other areas in europe smedley and kinniburgh 2013 mcgrory et al 2017 medunić et al 2020 in environmental analysis non detect or censored data i e data reported below the detection limit dl are often encountered with either removal i e deleting non detect value or substitution i e replacing non detect value with a numerical value such as 0 as common practices to handle these data farnham et al 2002 grunsky 2010 helsel 2005 2010 and 2012 these traditional approaches of controlling non detects in datasets has led to over estimation and under estimation during interpretation of parameters in environmental studies due to the over or under estimation during interpretation these are not appropriate methods which is evident by lack of harmonisation and consistent methodology between several regulatory and state agencies for example the substitution method of one half of the detection limit has been historically advocated as the method of choice by the united states environmental protection agency usepa which is also adopted in europe based on the eu groundwater directive annex iv usepa 2000 ec 2006 gibbons et al 2009 however it must be noted that in the eu based on the eu groundwater directive the method of using one half of the detection limit is not recommended for handling non detect pesticide data ec 2006 in comparison the united states geological survey usgs recommends that these substitution methods are not used helsel and hirsch 2002 while previous work has shown that censored data analysis can be adopted for censored chemical data i e arsenic in groundwater these approaches are rarely encountered for biological data i e microbiological parameters in the literature microbiological data such as number of colony forming units of a bacteria in a sample may be represented mathematically as discrete data i e as a whole number while the concentration of arsenic and other water quality parameters are often represented as continuous data these data often contain decimal points as a result these substitution methods are not considered appropriate for successfully handling microbiological data canales et al 2018 while there is a limited application of censored data analysis for microbiological data in the literature recent work has shown the applicability of interpreting both censored microbiological and chemical data using multivariate analysis as an effective methodology to overcome these limitations wangkahad et al 2017 the application of multivariate statistical analysis msa can be conducted in order to understand the associations and relationships in a system with a large number of parameters including chemical microbiological and physical while traditional msa techniques fail to account for censored data farnham et al 2002 grunsky 2010 several procedures can be applied prior to implementing msa including binary methods presence absence ordinal methods ranks of data and wilcoxon type methods u scores helsel 2012 while binary procedures can result in a loss of information in the data ordinal methods are suitable where one dl is present while methods based on u scores can handle multiple dls present in the data helsel 2012 applications of ordinal based approaches with msa for water quality and microbiological parameters have been previously used elsewhere wangkahad et al 2017 however there has been a limited response to incorporate these censored data msa approaches in studies with censored microbiological data especially containing trace elements such as arsenic one of the main issues of these msa methods for censored data is how to successfully incorporate both chemical and biological data together using a censored data approach the purpose of this study is to illustrate how a msa approach can be implemented to incorporate both censored chemical and biological data in order to understand the origin of constituents in groundwater using an existing dataset this is an important consideration as currently there are a limited number of works showing how censored biological data are treated separately with few studies showing how both can be incorporated and used for interpretation of groundwater processes helsel 2012 wangkahad et al 2017 canales et al 2018 the trace element arsenic will be the focus of this study as historically the north east of ireland is known to contain elevated arsenic within groundwater mcgrory et al 2017 in addition there is limited understanding of the geochemical conditions giving rise to elevated arsenic in groundwater in local settings within ireland the objectives of this study are to implement censored data analysis in order to a investigate potential associations amongst the trace elements and with other variables such as microbiological field parameters nutrients and depth to understand groundwater processes b determine if there are any spatial associations between water quality variables c assess the source of excessive nutrient contamination d illustrate how a censored data msa approach can successfully be used to incorporate both chemical and biological data and the interpretations thereof and e explore the level of detected organic geochemical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and

monitored quarterly for both physical and chemical parameters from november 2004 january 2008 within a 200 m buffer zone of the new road a dwwts or septic tank was present at each site while the specific location of the septic tank was not recorded field notes indicate that the majority were within the vicinity of the groundwater well the construction of this road was 30 months which started on february 2005 to july august 2007 with the road opening on 2nd august 2007 troll et al 2008 during road construction cuttings were completed in lower palaeozoic age sediments and carboniferous limestones depth of cut 5 m with a majority arising from the granites depth of cut 10 m of the slieve gullion complex bazley 2010 separately the dumping of oil has led to land contamination in some

limestones buckley and sweetman 1991 underlying these greywackes of the central belt are graptolitic shales chew and stillman 2009 to the north of the study area the local geology was deformed during the caledonian intrusion and mountain building episodes which resulted in faulting and low grade metamorphism the igneous complexes of slieve gullion were formed in the early tertiary most sites intersect the clontail formation fig 1b with the remaining sites intersecting the dinantian limestones undifferentiated formation the quaternary geology of the area mainly consists of till derived from lower palaeozoic sandstones and shales and till derived from granites with smaller amounts of alluvium bedrock outcrop or subcrop cut over raised peat lacustrine sediments estuarine silts and clays and drumlins within the locality of the study site the aquifers in the study area are classified as pi poor aquifer bedrock which is generally unproductive except for local zones lm locally important aquifer bedrock which is generally moderately productive and li locally important aquifer bedrock which is moderately productive only in local zones aquifer classification according to gsi methodology fig 1d which limits the yield of some of these private groundwater sources indeed the lower palaeozoic greywackes which contains greatest proportion of groundwater sources in this present study are classed as poor aquifers which have a low permeability with groundwater restricted to weathered zones or along fault or fissure zones mcconnell et al 2001 this area has high groundwater vulnerability according to gsi methodology with patches of extreme vulnerability with the main aquifer being pl fig 1e there are five groundwater vulnerability categories defined by the gsi that characterise the risk of contamination of groundwater by polluting activities the categories are based on i the permeability and thickness of the subsoils that overlie the groundwater ii the type of recharge whether point or diffuse and iii the thickness of the unsaturated zone through which the contaminant moves mcgrory et al 2017 the topography of the study area is hilly with higher elevation

groundwater sampling sampling of both shallow 6 m and deep 6 m groundwater wells was done quarterly by representatives of mouchel parkman on behalf of louth county council between 2004 and 2008 for 13 quarters private groundwater wells were purged 3 well volumes prior to sampling to remove stagnant water however due to the low permeability of the strata and groundwater ingress to the well was slow and thus full well volume was not recovered after each purge this meant thats the full 3 well volumes could not be accomplished at all sites in these cases one borehole volume was purged and was let recover where this process was repeated and then a groundwater sample was taken where it was impractical to purge i e large diameter wells a lower amount was completed or a tap sample taken at each sampling location water level measurements were taken using a dipmeter for shorthand well ids are denoted numerically i e w 22 further information on the sampling of each well is seen in table s1 supplementary information at each location a dedicated bailer was used to recover a groundwater sample in order to prevent cross contamination and after each use the bailer was cleaned and sealed in

limitations savichtcheva and okabe 2006 while the presence of fib can be determined in water precise information in relation to the origin of this contamination is not known smith et al 2014 an

quarters of chemical data were collected from 2004 to 2008 however the data from quarter five november 2005 was used for analysis and interpretation due a high presence of censored data in the other quarters justification for choice of this quarter included i high dls were observed from some parameters due to upgrading in analytical instrumentation during monitoring 2004 2008 by the testing laboratory ii greatest proportion of trace elements above the dl were present in november 2005 iii quarter 5 shows low organic pah contamination compared to other seasons iv several measurement anomalies i e ph and temperature occurred for physical parameters in later quarters and v quarter 5 contained dissolved trace element data which was the most useful for the purposes of the present study 2 4 2 handling of data with multiple dls due to the presence of multiple censored data during chemical analysis the package non detects and data analysis nada lee 2013 was used in the r statistical environment r development core team 2017 based on methods from helsel 2012 the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf for each hydrochemistry variable was computed using the kaplan meier method helsel 2012 2 4 3 analysis by depth information in relation to well depth of some sampled sites was limited as only 39 sites had a depth value therefore wells were classified as being either a borehole bh or a dug well dw table s1 as a proxy for well depth descriptive statistics for variables for november 2005 taking account of censored values were computed for bh dw sites separately for each hydrochemistry variable ecdf were computed separately for each depth category bh and dw to test for differences in ecdfs between the bh dw variables the log rank test was performed on the ecdfs the number of samples above guideline values are given as a percentage for each variable in ireland these guideline values are not enforced for private groundwater supplies and as such they are used for informative and comparative reasons the onus for checking if parameters are below guideline values falls to the homeowner of the private groundwater supply hooks et al 2019 2 4 4 correlation analysis due to the presence of multiple dls the non parametric correlation coefficient kendall s tau τ was used to determine the strength of the monotonic relationship between pairs of variables where pairs may be singly censored one observation censored or doubly censored both observations censored helsel and hirsch 2002 helsel 2012 using the cenken function in the nada package lee 2013 strengths of correlation coefficients are described as τ 0 no relationship τ 0 3 weak relationship 0 3 τ 0 5 moderate relationship and τ 0 5 strong relationship khamis 2008 with those deemed as significance relationships in the population denoted by p value 0 05 p value 0 01 and p value 0 001 2 4 5 multivariate methods while univariate approaches use one variable at a time to perform statistical analysis the application of multivariate techniques can be applied to understand the relationships of many parameters and observations grunsky 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 these multivariate techniques can simplify the variation and relationships to a reduced number of dimensions which may be liked to a specific geochemical process grunsky 2010 by implementing clustering algorithms distinct natural groupings within multi dimensional data can be identified i e based on similarities or differences grunsky 2010 wangkahad et al 2017 hierarchical clustering was applied to cluster both variables r mode and sampled sites q mode adopting ward linkage between clusters the distance matrix for wells was determined by calculating absolute difference in ecdfs i e the distance between two individual wells i and j for the variable v k is d kij f v ki f v kj where f v k denotes the value of the kaplan meier estimated ecdf the total distance between two individual wells i and j across all p variables considered is determined by manhattan distance 1 d ij k 1 p d kij k 1 p f v ki f v kj the distance matrix for variables was kendall s tau correlation coefficient determined by the nada cenken r command i e the distance between two variables x and y is 2 d xy τ xy a heatmap was produced to display the values of the ecdfs and the resulting clustering dendrograms i e parameters and sites 2 4 6 spatial mapping spatial mapping was completed for key parameters as ph fe mn se sb no3 and tc with geology using a system of five classes the class division depended on the parameter being investigated using arcgis 10 2 esri colorado in irish national grid 1965 datum mcgrory et al 2017 mcgrory et al 2018 where non detects were present they were binned into the first classification in the case of microbiological parameters i e tc a detected value is classed as a failure so that the first interval only contained non detects i e groundwater is free from microbial contamination thus other classifications for microbiological parameters are designated as failures 2 4 7 aqueous geochemical modelling as the redox state of the groundwater was not measured eh values were calculated no3 no2 redox couple in phreeqci v3 4 appelo and postma 2005 using the wateq4f database ball and nordstrom 1991 these calculated values were used to assist in the interpretation rather than being incorporated into statistical analysis in addition saturation indices si for minerals were also calculated for wells in november 2005 the si is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the ion activity product iap of the component ions of the solid in solution to the solubility product k for the solid si log iap k the si of a given mineral indicates whether the groundwater is undersaturated si 0 at equilibrium si 0 or supersaturated si 0 naus et al 2001 appelo and postma 2005 if the groundwater is undersaturated with respect to a given mineral si then the groundwater would theoretically dissolve the mineral if present naus et al 2001 if groundwater is supersaturated with respect to a given mineral si then the mineral would theoretically precipitate from the groundwater naus et al 2001 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics results of the log rank test for differences in ecdf between the depth categories of bh and dw for different variables observed in november 2005 gives evidence of a difference for ph p 0 001 and water level p 0 001 only descriptive statistics minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum with censoring rates and percentage of

below the lower standard limit 6 5 ph units while no sites from either depth category exceeded the upper limit 8 5 ph units while the redox potential of groundwaters was not measured modelling using phreeqc estimated that the eh ranged from 385 to 602 9 mv average 507 1 mv standard deviation 44 8 mv the correlation of water quality parameters is observed fig 2 and table s2 with a censored scatterplot of ph and arsenic in fig 3a b several transition series metals show a weak to moderate correlation with each other e g cr ni fe and mn fig 2 both fe and mn were generally measured at low concentrations in groundwaters with observed median values for dws fe 2 μg l 1 and mn 1 μg l 1 and bhs fe 7 μg l 1 and mn 1 μg l 1 the highest concentration of fe was measured at 12820 μg l 1 in a borehole w 57 with an alkaline ph 7 99 ph units and an arsenic concentration of 9 μg l 1 the next highest value of fe was recorded in a dug well w 5 with an fe concentration of 769 l 1 with an acidic

value being 119 μg l 1 8 05 ph units in a borehole w 22 the concentration of detected mercury ranged from 0 5 0 1 μg l 1 in this study which is lower than the naturally occurring concentration of 0 5 μg l 1 in groundwater who 2005 in this study arsenic is the most detected trace element above the legal limit of 10 μg l 1 8 3 for dws and 18 6 for bhs this observation has been seen in other studies bondu et al 2017a 3 2 saturation indices the sis of several fe mn al and cu minerals was tabulated in table 4 3 3 spatial mapping interval mapping of groundwater quality parameters are illustrated in fig 4a h with the corresponding number of values per classification illustrated in table 5 as can be seen in the below table many samples were below the legal limits similar spatial distributions were observed for the same groups of parameters for example arsenic shows a spatial cluster in the central to southern area in this study fig 4a with concentrations 10 μg l 1 with ph also showing high values in these locations 7 5 ph units similar spatial associations are seen with water level and while some spatial overlap exists with se and sb this is less apparent also in this high arsenic cluster there are low concentrations of both fe and mn there is another spatial cluster of high ph 7 5 ph units to the south but arsenic concentrations are 7 5 μg l 1 for several parameters isolated high concentrations of trace elements were observed e g fe by comparison other trace elements had several spatial clusters including mn there is a large variation in spatial distribution for no3 showing the widespread contamination of this nutrient most other nutrients were detected at low concentrations with low sample numbers measured at concentrations above the legal limit e g no2 and ammoniacal nitrogen while low numbers were detected for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci higher numbers were seen for total coliforms and to a somewhat lesser degree for c perfringens table 5 3 4 hierarchical clustering table 6 shows the partition of variables at the specification of five clusters with the combined dendrogram of both variables and sites illustrated in fig 5 table 7 shows the partition of sites at the specification of three clusters resulting in clusters of 32 21 and 14 sites which are subsequently spatially mapped in fig 6 3 5 organic geochemistry no incidences of pesticides or pahs were detected in any wells in november 2005 with only a small number of vocs were detected in one well w 7 methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and carbon disulphide 58 and 14 μg l 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 trace element and arsenic groundwater geochemistry several geological and environmental settings such as deltas crystalline bedrock unconsolidated sediments mineralisation etc in combination with geochemical processes geothermal sulphide oxidation alkali desorption and reductive dissolution can contribute to the mobilisation of arsenic from the host material into the surrounding groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 based on the geochemistry of this present study arsenic is being mobilised though the process of alkali desorption as shown from the various statistical analysis mobilisation of arsenic arising from alkali desorption often produce groundwaters that give rise to elevated arsenic in addition to other oxyanion forming elements such as sb se and u through desorption from amorphous or crystalline oxyhydroxides ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 this geochemical process can be inferred from several key geochemical signatures of this process while ph is a key indicator of metal mobility and of alkali desorption it shows a weak increasing association with arsenic in the present study τ 0 27 fig 2 and table s2 which may be lower than expected due to a high number of more acidic dug wells in this study and potential outliers see below while the ph values have a narrow range in this study 6 11 8 19 ph units elevated arsenic concentrations occur at an alkaline ph 7 5 ph units with the majority of sites containing concentrations of arsenic 10 μg l 1 being sampled from deeper groundwater in boreholes fig 3b and table s1 several locations in this study which had elevated concentrations of arsenic also contained detected se and or sb fig 4e f in these groundwaters arsenic shows a positive correlation with se τ 0 11 see cluster two table 6 the presence of elevated oxidised n species such as no3 is also indicative of this mobilisation process ravenscroft et al 2009 as alkali oxic groundwaters are needed for this geochemical process while eh was not measured thermodynamic calculations indicate that the groundwater is oxic several metal oxides e g cuprous ferrite diaspore goethite and gibbsite are supersaturated in these groundwaters which is indicative of precipitation or desorption table 4 these supersaturated mineral phases indicate that these fe and mn oxides and to a lesser extent al and cu may be responsible for release and transport of arsenic in groundwaters through the process of alkaline desorption as observedin the bedrock aquifers of argentina usa and spain smedley et al 2002 ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 these observations are supported from cluster two table 6 from the hca furthermore the lack of a correlation between arsenic and iron in this study is indicative of reductive dissolution or desorption processes levitt et al 2019 interestingly arsenic is also clustered with toc cluster two table 6 with these two variables showing a weak positive correlation τ 0 16 fig 2 suggesting that the source of arsenic may be organic however further work would need to be carried out to assess this generally arsenic mobilisation through alkali desorption produces waters with arsenic concentrations 100 μg l 1 ravenscroft et al 2009 with concentrations in this study having a maximum concentration of 25 μg l 1 groundwaters with elevated arsenic concentrations 10 μg l 1 are associated with alkaline ph 7 13 8 19 ph units detection of sb and or se moderate so4 2 42 mg l 1 low fe and mn 14 μg l 1 for fe and 2 μg l 1for mn and low or no microbial contamination in contrast when fe and or mn concentrations are 20 μg l 1 then low arsenic concentrations are measured maximum arsenic concentration of 3 μg l 1 with a mixed ph of 6 38 8 04 ph units based on threshold values of key parameters e g no3 fe and mn and so4 2 it is likely that there are mixed redox processes occurring in these groundwaters mcmahon and chapelle 2008 most sites exhibiting elevated arsenic concentrations are observed in the clontail formation with corresponding lower concentrations in the dinantian limestones fig 5a whilst most of the elevated arsenic in groundwater is inferred from alkali desorption other processes may be having a greater influence on two distinct wells w 57 and w 22 the process of reductive dissolution is the most commonly encountered arsenic mobilisation mechanism encountered worldwide in groundwaters which affects many regions in southeast asia e g west bengal and bangladesh through the microbial mediated process of reductive dissolution of arsenic from metal oxides e g fe smedley and kinniburgh 2013 ali et al 2019 this process may be occurring in w 57 dissolved fe was 12 820 μg l 1 but as an isolated incident it may have occurred from contamination from sampling or specific well conditions i e stagnant water oxidising conditions using theoretically calculated eh values are prevalent in these groundwaters and as such the elevated arsenic can also result from sulphide oxidation i e w 22 although not as prevalent as reductive dissolution the processes of sulphide oxidation and alkali desorption have given rise to elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater particularly in fractured bedrock aquifers smedley et al 2002 ayotte et al 2003 hudson edwards and archer 2012 ryan et al 2015 bondu et al 2017b under the process of sulphide oxidation the oxidation of sulphide minerals such as arsenopyrite pyrite and pyrrhotite occurs to produce so4 2 rich often up to hundreds of mg l 1 acidic groundwaters in addition to increased concentrations of other trace elements e g ni pb cu zn and cd ravenscroft et al 2009 smedley and kinniburgh 2013 besides one anomaly e g w 22 concentrations of these trace elements were generally low in w 22 several trace elements were measured at elevated values al 119 μg l 1 cr 334 μg l 1 as 15 μg l 1 fe 133 μg l 1 mn 33 μg l 1 ni 256 μg l 1 cu 100 μg l 1 and se 18 μg l 1 however the values reported for so4 2 and ph are inconsistent with this process and may represent dissolved mineral phases it also must be noted that w 22 was not sampled directly from the well but from a tap sample table s1 however other samples taken from taps did not have elevated values of trace elements as per w 22 mercury concentrations recorded in this study ranged 0 05 0 1 μg l 1 which is below the regulatory value of 1 μg l 1 in ireland which is indicative that road construction did not affect hg concentrations who 2005 ec 2007 4 2 the source of nutrient microbial and organic contamination the majority of groundwaters shows contamination of both nutrients and or microbes as evident from cluster five in table 6 and fig 5 microbiological parameters had the greatest number of samples above the legal limit with total coliforms showing the greatest proportion in both groundwater depth types generally total coliforms and faecal coliforms were more elevated when compared to c perfringens and faecal streptococci table 3 spatially most elevated microbiological parameters intersect the poorly productive aquifers pl of the study area in addition the land use of this area is pastures with a moderate to extreme groundwater vulnerability illustrating how these microbiological parameters may enter the groundwater system via flow patterns as the north of this locality has ahigh elevation the presence of these faecal microbiological bacteria indicates that some input of faecal waste or sewage to these groundwater sources elsewhere it has been shown that septic tanks were responsible for the prevalence of bacteria within groundwater with dug wells being twice as susceptible to this bacterial contamination when compared to boreholes due to surface contamination hynds et al 2012 hynds et al 2014 when improperly installed or maintained these dwwtss may represent a source of nutrients and enteric pathogens which can affect water quality naughton and hynds 2014 withers et al 2014 total coliforms have been detected in groundwater in the absence of faecal streptococci or coliforms as total coliforms are present in soil bacteria in groundwater may result from the overburden or subsoils moving into the borehole as a result of poor well construction practices in ireland older boreholes were constructed in order to maximise the flow of groundwater into the borehole resulting in a blend of deep groundwater and the more polluted shallow groundwater mcgrory et al 2018 modern borehole design i e igi 2007 epa 2013 excludes this easily polluted shallow groundwater mcgrory et al 2018 if bacteria were resulting from soils then after a dry summer the bacterial quality would improve as the shallow groundwater containing bacteria would be depleted and thus is making a negligible contribution to the borehole flow epa 2013 elevated concentrations of nitrate were detected in wells particularly above the limit of 50 mg l 1 with concentrations approaching 134 1 mg l 1 nitrate in groundwater can arise from both point and non point sources such as septic tanks oxidation of organically bound n in soils agricultural activities and animal feed with elevated concentration giving rise to health conditions e g methemoglobinemia appelo and postma 2005 bondu et al 2017a in shallow groundwaters contamination can originate from the excessive application of fertilizers and manure from agricultural practices both shallow and deeper groundwaters had similar values of elevated no3 with 10 of sites having a no3 concentration greater than the drinking water limit of nitrate i e 50 mg l 1 in contrast both nitrite no2 and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n are not present in detectable quantities in many samples which is likely as a result of the rapid conversion to no3 in a suspected oxygenated environment with denitrification as a result petrunic et al 2012 given that concentrations of no3 generally exceed 25 mg l 1 anthropogenic nutrient activity represents a major impact on groundwater in this study either from organic waste i e septic tank and slurry and or inorganic fertilizer sources also the evidence of a moderate positive correlation of nitrate with c perfringens and total coliforms a fib τ 0 38 supports the rationale that these nutrients originate from septic tank sources table s2 and fig 2 indeed septic tanks may be one potential source of anthropogenic nutrients as b shows a correlation with no3 τ 0 25 c perfringens τ 0 24 and total coliforms τ 0 16 and to a lesser degree toc τ 0 14 which is also evident from cluster 5 from the hca analysis presented in table 6 however no3 shows a weak correlation with cl illustrating how domestic sewage is not a major source of nitrate in this study zhang et al 2020 this response is further supported as b is a common component in many household detergents which moves through septic systems and thus a potential indicator of domestic waste in the environment thurman et al 1984 wang et al 2000 epa 2003 the concentrations of boron observed in this study maximum 76 μg l 1 are generally above the natural background level of 15 μg l 1 potentially indicating an urban pollution source buss et al 2004 tedd et al 2017 while b may behave conservatively in aqueous systems it can sorb onto oxyhydroxides and clay surfaces and ultimately this sorption is a mechanism to remove b from groundwater table 5 4 wang et al 2000 in addition b is also a minor component of fertilizers tedd et al 2017 however if organic waste i e septic tanks was responsible for all instances of elevated nutrients then concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen 0 1 mg l 1 would be expected to be observed if septic tanks were in close proximity to the well cronin and deakin 2000 however only five wells had concentrations 0 2 2 7 mg l 1 with the remaining wells being below the dl 0 2 or 0 258 mg l 1 it must be noted that detected ammoniacal nitrogen was observed in only boreholes and not in dug wells as expected from a septic tank source for the remaining microbiological parameters there appears to be a weak correlation except a moderate relationship exists with total coliforms and c perfringens τ 0 38 in contrast given that the groundwater vulnerability of the study ranges from moderate to extreme the groundwater may be susceptible to this nutrient contamination as a result of land spreading of fertilizers inorganic and organic slurry given that the main hydrological pressure is agricultural land and one third of sampling locations are surface dug wells while this diffuse source may be occurring in the study area as it is predominately an agricultural area detailed information on where land spreading is occurring remains unknown however given the high level of contamination from total coliforms in these groundwaters it is possible that the source of groundwater nitrate results from organic waste i e slurry or septic tank cronin and deakin 2000 however low instances of faecal coliforms including escherichia coli were detected in this study 15 shallow and deep groundwater wells suggesting that organic waste from septic systems is not a source for most sites cronin and deakin 2000 based on this and other data it is expected that the majority of elevated nitrate results from inorganic fertilizer practices due to absence of faecal coliforms with minor contribution from organic waste both slurry and septic tank sources however it must be noted that even though faecal coliforms were not detected in 52 wells this may result from the bacteria not surviving due to either attenuation or time of travel to well is greater than 100 days cronin and deakin 2000 variations in groundwater nitrate concentrations are affected by complex physical and chemical processes within the soil subsoil and aquifers which result in some areas been more susceptible to contamination when compared to others tedd et al 2014 reduction of nitrate to nitrite is expected to occur only in a small percentage given the high rate of non detects for nitrite organic n can be converted to nitrate through the process of ammonification organic matter converted to ammonia and nitrification ammonia converted to nitrate under aerobic processes wang et al 2000 while other key indices may help constrict the nutrient source such as k na ratio and cl concentrations cronin and deakin 2000 these could not be used in this study as k was not measured and this study area is within 20 km of the coast so sea spray may be a contributing factor in this study area contamination of the nutrient nitrate is likely occurring from multiple sources in addition to the above observation with nutrients a correlation is observed with na and cl τ 0 37 for many samples the na cl ratio nearly equals 1 1 indicative of halite dissolution in groundwater chenini et al 2010 with geochemical modelling illustrating that halite is undersaturated in the groundwater cluster 3 table 6 fluoride was only detectable above the legal value in one location w 23 measured at a value of 3 1 mg l 1 while groundwater showed anthropogenic contamination of nutrients i e nitrate negligible contamination of organic geochemistry i e pahs vocs and pesticides occurred with only cs2 and mtbe being detected it is expected that these vocs originated from a pyrolytic origin i e from fossil fuels such as diesel from point pollution however the low number of detected vocs could have resulted from contamination not reaching the zone of contribution of the borehole overall groundwater shows negligible contamination resulting from organic geochemistry parameters however point pollution indicative by excessive nutrient and microbes illustrates that anthropogenic activities are occurring in this area 4 3 multivariate analysis all clusters isolated from hierarchical cluster analysis contained a mixture of both dws and bhs fig 1a the first cluster for variables shows similarity amongst transition series metals i e fe cr and ni illustrating a common mineral source arsenic is clustered in the same group as other oxyanions se and sb in addition to ph further showing the key geochemical parameters in alkali desorption processes as discussed in earlier sections the 4th and 5th clusters contain the microbiological based parameters nutrients and the remaining trace element including boron illustrating the widespread nutrient i e no3 and microbial contamination present in wells of this study area while nitrate was grouped in this cluster elevated nitrate was also seen in the remaining clusters this hierarchical clustering analysis was able to discern the two dominant water processes occurring alkali desorption of arsenic from fe oxyhydroxides and microbial and nutrient contamination of wells resulting from fertilizer and organic waste this analysis showed that arsenic concentrations are also associated with redox sensitive elements e g sb and se jiang et al 2015 by using these clustering techniques it is possible to identify distinct natural groupings within multi dimensional data grunsky 2010 in contrast sites clustered from the heatmap in cluster 1 n 32 are present within the centre to south of the study area with cluster sites identified in cluster 2 n 21 are located within the centre of the study area and the remaining sites cluster 3 n 14 mainly present to the south of the study area cluster 1 represents groundwater wells mainly associated with elevated arsenic concentrations alkaline ph and detection of sb se this cluster is contained within a spatial scale that extends to the whole study area and may be constrained by groundwater flow while cluster 1 extends to the whole study area both cluster 2 and 3 are generally more isolated cluster 2 generally contains more total coliforms in addition to fe and mn with low arsenic concentrations the main sampling sites within this cluster are north west of a hill within the porphyritic granophyre bedrock geology which may represent surface runoff from an agricultural pressure cluster 3 represents groundwater wells with low microbial contamination but with elevated trace elements e g cr al fe ni cu and mn while cluster 1 and 2 are mainly present in sampling sites within the clontail formation cluster 3 contains sites within the dinantian limestones 4 4 strengths and recommendations the findings of this study show the presence of elevated arsenic in a rock type which was previously described as containing elevated arsenic mcgrory et al 2017 as this data was collected as part of an eia for a new road construction it is likely there are more of this type of datasets in ireland and elsewhere these methods described here can be applied to other areas with similar eia datasets where data on arsenic and other environmentally relevant trace elements is sparse this study examines elevated arsenic in a fractured bedrock aquifer in ireland and provides a footprint of further research in other areas and several recommendations can be made as a result of the high censoring it is recommended that for new work the objectives and deliverables of the sampling campaign need to be fully considered at the planning phase for example a more rigid sampling and analytical protocol could be adopted to quantify sub μg l 1 concentrations of trace elements this work did not examine the influence of mitigation measures e g filters at the point of use in dwellings for elevated arsenic and would be of benefit to include in future works for health evaluation future works would need to include other oxidised species i e dissolved oxygen into the sampling strategy to assist with this interpretation to understand the complex processes of sewage in more detail sewage specific microbial source tracking methodologies adopted elsewhere e g wangkahad et al 2017 would need to be completed in addition to b isotopic data widory et al 2005 inclusion of a depth data category in the sampling protocol elsewhere depth has been linked as a factor explaining elevated arsenic concentrations thomas 2007 kim et al 2011 5 conclusions groundwater were sampled and analysed for several relevant parameters of environmental concern the main conclusions of this work in this study area are summarised below the source of trace elements particularly arsenic arise from geogenic sources rather than anthropogenic activities with alkali desorption causing the mobilisation of arsenic in groundwater in most of the sites groundwaters with elevated arsenic concentrations 10 μg l 1 are associated with alkaline ph 7 13 8 19 ph units detection of sb and or se moderate so4 2 low fe and mn with low or no microbial contamination high fe and or mn groundwaters are associated with low concentrations of arsenic there are low instances of organic contaminants in groundwaters and contamination of these are most likely representative of point source fuel spills i e mtbe elevated nitrate potentially results from inorganic fertilizer with less contribution from organic waste both slurry and septic tank sources however this environmental process warrants further research to understand these complex behaviours this study showed that both censored chemical and biological data can be integrated for the application of multivariate statistical analysis it is expected that the inclusion of similar eia datasets in ireland and elsewhere can be applied to understand the distribution of trace elements in groundwater systems where data is available author
