5075,fog is considered as an important source of water in many drylands and the knowledge of possible sources of its formation is essential to make future predictions prior studies have suggested the presence of locally generated fog in drylands however its formation mechanism remains unclear there have been studies on the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics on the contrary no research has yet been conducted to understand the potential contribution of soil moisture to fog formation this study therefore for the first time intends to examine such possibility in a fog dominated dryland ecosystem the namib desert the study was conducted at two sites representing two different land forms sand dunes and gravel plains in the namib desert we first examined evidence of fog formation through water vapor movement using field observations and then simulated water vapor transport using hydrus 1d model in the first part of the study soil moisture soil temperature and air temperature data were analyzed and the relationships between these variables were taken as one of the key indicators for the linkage between soil water and fog formation the analysis showed that increase in soil moisture generally corresponded to similar increase in air or soil temperature near the soil surface which implied that variation in soil moisture might be the result of water vapor movement evaporated soil moisture from lower depths to the soil surface in the second part of the study surface fluxes of water vapor were simulated using the hydrus 1d model to explore whether the available surface flux was sufficient to support fog formation the surface flux and cumulative evaporation obtained from the model showed positive surface fluxes of water vapor based on the field observations and the hydrus 1d model results it can be concluded that water vapor from soil layers is transported through the vadose zone to the surface and this water vapor likely contributes to the fog formation in fog dominated drylands like the namib desert keywords ecohydrology drylands hydrological model hydrus 1d namib desert soil moisture 1 introduction drylands are regions where precipitation is comparatively less than potential evapotranspiration the aridity index ai quantitatively defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration must be 0 65 for an area to be considered as drylands drylands can be classified using this aridity index into four sub types dry sub humid lands semi arid lands arid lands and hyper arid lands adeel et al 2005 wang et al 2012 drylands cover approximately 40 of the land surface and support more than 2 billion population worldwide wang et al 2012 since water resources are severely limited in drylands water availability poses the primary control over biological processes wang et al 2010 yu and d odorico 2015 fog although in small amount play an important supporting role in supplying water that is essential to maintain ecological functions in drylands wang et al 2017 in arid drylands where rainfall is sparse fog can be the most important form of water input which could be utilized for the dryland ecosystem to increase productivity kaseke et al 2017 qiao et al 2020 it can also constitute a major portion of the overall hydrological input especially in some of the coastal areas which often receive very little or no rainfall in a year dawson 1998 in general there are seven types of fog four of which are based on process and place of formation radiation fog sea fog steam fog and advection fog and the remaining three are designated based on their place of occurrence irrespective of the process of their formation coastal fog valley fog and mountain fog eugster 2008 out of these seven different types of fog most studies have focused on two types namely i radiation fog which is formed mainly by a cooling mechanism especially nocturnal cooling over the continental surface and ii advection fog which is formed because of the humidification near coastal areas or over the sea bergot and guedalia 1994 even though fog provides significant amount of water for dryland environments runyan et al 2019 these are the least studied components of the hydrological cycle wang et al 2017 having multiple origins fog in drylands can originate from recycling of groundwater via evapotranspiration and redistribution of water vapor in the upper soil layers more than 50 of the total fog events in the namib desert were found to be non ocean derived during their study period kaseke et al 2017 this highlights the importance of studies to determine the quantity and origin of fog in dryland ecosystems where rainfall is expected to decline due to climate change in coming years lu et al 2016 soil moisture is considered as a critical component of earth system and plays an important role in land atmosphere interactions eltahir 1998 it can be used to understand the relationship of climate soil and vegetation in dryland ecosystems fang et al 2016 li et al 2016 in water limited dryland ecosystems various eco hydrological processes are dependent on soil water availability wang et al 2009 miller et al 2012 wei et al 2019 many factors like precipitation evaporation liquid water and water vapor flow influence soil moisture near the surface in drylands and most of these factors are strongly connected in the namib desert the first millimeters of surface soil might receive enough soil moisture from fog droplets and dew formation li et al 2016 wang et al 2019 since soil water content near the soil surface in drylands is often extremely low water vapor transport plays a critical role in the overall water flux and availability d odorico and porporato 2006 saito et al 2006 yin et al 2019 the movement of soil moisture and heat are coupled the simultaneous movement of heat liquid water and water vapor at the land atmosphere interface is significant for a range of biological phenomena as well as water and energy balance of terrestrial ecosystems bittelli et al 2008 cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 the total heat flux of soil is a result of simple conduction as well as the movement of water in both the liquid and vapor states the net soil moisture movement between any two locations can be mainly attributed to the movement of moisture in soil from one location to another caused by evaporation and subsequent re condensation during this process of evaporation and re condensation a significant amount of energy is transported by the water vapor since water has high latent energy of vaporization cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 fog and soil moisture impact each other fog increases soil moisture and sometimes fog infiltrates further down to recharge groundwater systems ingraham and matthews 1990 at the same time soil water could contribute to fog formation for example using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes a recent study showed that groundwater is a source of radiation fog in the namib desert kaseke et al 2017 one possible process is through soil water evaporation and subsequence re condensation previous studies have demonstrated that soil water can be transported from one location to another by evaporation and re condensation bittelli et al 2008 cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2011 furthermore the transported soil water to the surface can be evaporated from the soil surface into atmosphere contributing to the formation of fog past studies have explored the impact of fog to groundwater recharge or soil moisture content ingraham and matthews 1988 1990 li et al 2018 liu et al 2005 prada et al 2010 sawaske and freyberg 2015 furthermore prior studies have suggested the prevalence of radiation fog in addition to the advection fog in the namib desert kaseke et al 2018a these studies identified groundwater and soil moisture as possible origins for the radiation fog in the namib desert but transport and formation mechanisms still remain unclear this research hence for the first time aims to investigate the contribution of soil moisture to the formation of fog in the namib desert the hypothesis of the study is that soil moisture contributes to the fog formation in the fog dominated dryland namib desert through the process of continuous evaporation and subsequent condensation in sub soil to test this hypothesis this research examined the relationships between volumetric soil water content soil and air temperature and fog occurrence in the study area in addition a hydrological model hydrus 1d was applied to simulate water vapor transport in the vadose zone to further evaluate the hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the namib desert was chosen for the study because it is a fog dominated dryland it is located in the coastal area of namibia and extends from the olifants river in south africa to carunjamba river in angola and has an overall stretch of 1900 km along the coast of the atlantic ocean li et al 2016 there is a wide distribution of precipitation in the namib desert with an annual average of 5 18 mm in the central namib desert li et al 2016 two land forms the gravel plains and the sand dunes at gobabeb located in the namib desert were selected since they share similar meteorological conditions but different soil textures the study sites were located within the vicinity of the gobabeb research and training centre lat 23 55 long 15 04 and elv 405 m a s l which is in the central namib desert and about 60 km inland from the atlantic ocean fig 1 the gobabeb centre is surrounded by three main land forms gravel plains to the north and east 91 sand 0 6 clay and 8 4 silt sand dune sea to the west and south 74 8 sand 5 5 clay and 19 7 silt and the ephemeral kuiseb river 91 5 sand 2 1 clay 6 4 silt to the south of the centre which separates the gravel plains and sand dune sea kaseke et al 2017 the climate at gobabeb is hyper arid with extremely infrequent precipitation events and a mean annual precipitation of 27 mm the mean monthly temperature at gobabeb ranges from 17 to 24 2 c and has an average relative humidity of around 50 with 94 mean annual foggy days eckardt et al 2013 li et al 2018 2 2 data collection the volumetric water content and soil temperature data used in the study were collected from two sites at gobabeb in the namib desert the gravel plains and the sand dunes the volumetric water content and soil temperature data were measured hourly at both sites using the cs655 water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa the soil probes were located at an approximate depth of 4 cm at both sites these soil moisture probes were installed horizontally at the sites and can detect volumetric water content from 0 to 100 with m4 command with a high precision 0 05 the daily precipitation data were collected using the tipping bucket setting at the gravel plains and the same data were used for the sand dunes as well because of their close proximity other meteorological data such as air temperature and fog were obtained from weather and fognet stations which are part of the southern african science service centre from climate change and adaptive land management sasscal for the gravel plains volumetric water content and soil temperature data from december 29 2013 to june 24 2018 and for the sand dunes data from august 5 2015 to may 22 2018 were used in the analysis furthermore soil moisture and soil temperature data used by entekhabi et al 2001 to evaluate relationship between surface temperature and soil moisture in southern africa was retrieved and digitized to compare results of their study to those of the present research the study by entekhabi et al 2001 was used to compare the results since the site considered in their study had a semi arid climate and received a higher amount of rainfall as compared to the present research in addition that study represented general relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature which would exist in most of the places with wetter climatic conditions 2 3 analysis of field data hourly volumetric water content soil temperature precipitation and fog data were used to obtain the daily values for analysis in order to demonstrate the relationship of volumetric water content with soil and air temperature simple scatter plots and box plots were used since relationships were found between volumetric soil water content and different variables such as soil temperature air temperature fog and precipitation data were analyzed to determine how the change in volumetric water content can be explained by change in different variables the statistical relationships between daily air soil temperature and volumetric water content were tested using spearman correlation coefficients the soil and air temperature were divided into distinct 5 c bins for demonstrating the relationship with volumetric water content the near surface soil temperature and air temperature were used for this study to further examine if the soil temperature follows the air temperature trend fog and precipitation data were used to understand how the volumetric soil water content responds to their occurrences or vice versa the data were analyzed for two periods i all the available data and ii data from august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 during which there was no rainfall event in order to examine whether the relationship varies when rainfall events are considered and during periods with no rainfall events the 80 non rainfall days august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 were chosen mainly because there were no data missing within that period there were several fog events during that period and this period was the one previously used by li et al 2018 to examine the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics in the namib desert furthermore the statistical analysis of data was done based on hydrologic year october to september since rainfall events at gobabeb are very rare but if these events occur they are mostly concentrated between october and april lu et al 2016 the rainfall seasonal distribution at the study sites is similar to windhoek where the rainfall is very seasonal and concentrated within the above mentioned months kaseke et al 2018b 2 4 hydrus modeling 2 4 1 model description hydrus 1d model is often used for the simulation of one dimensional water flow heat movement and solute transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2013 in the present study version 4 17 of this model was used for the simulation of water vapor transport from soil moisture at a certain depth to the soil surface the basic equation hydrus 1d model uses for the water flow is richards equation 1 θ t x k h x cos α s where θ h is the volumetric water content t is time x is the spatial coordinate considering upward direction as positive k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity h is the water pressure head α is the angle between the flow direction and vertical axis and s is the sink term see hydrus 1d user manual by šimůnek et al 2013 however since richards equation considers only liquid flow and ignores vapor flow hydrus 1d model uses the following non isothermal liquid and vapor flow equation saito et al 2006 for the water vapor transport modeling 2 θ t h t x k k υ h h x cos α k lt k υ t t x s h where θ t is the total volumetric water content t is temperature in kelvin k is the isothermal hydraulic conductivity of the liquid phase k lt is the thermal hydraulic conductivity of the liquid phase k υ h is the isothermal vapor hydraulic conductivity and k υ t is the thermal vapor hydraulic conductivity see hydrus 1d user manual by šimůnek et al 2013 2 4 2 model setup hydrus 1d model was used to simulate water vapor flow and heat transport in the vertical direction horizontal water transport was not considered the soil column was considered to be homogeneous along the depth e g soil was regarded as a single layer for the simulation the hydraulic sub model within hydrus 1d used for this study was van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 since the simulated study sites have very low vegetation cover plant transpiration was neglected and only evaporation was considered for this study the inverse solution option available in hydrus 1d was used in order to optimize the soil hydraulic parameters alpha a fitting parameter and n pore size distribution index which are the coefficients of soil water retention function see hydrus 1d user manual šimůnek et al 2013 the simulations were validated using the measured soil temperature and volumetric soil water content at a depth of 4 cm at the sand dunes and the gravel plains the validation period was considered after a certain duration of the model run in order to provide sufficient model spin up time the validation was done after 40 days at the sand dunes site since only 93 days were run in the model and the simulation results was obtained for 53 days the model spin up period provided at the gravel plains was approximately 50 of the overall time period 129 days selected for the model run and 65 days were used for the results the model was run for the rainless period to examine if the soil moisture will have sufficient surface flux and evaporation for the formation of fog at the sites the actual surface flux obtained from the model inform what actually happens at the surface whether the soil water evaporates or infiltrates e g fraction of water moves downward the higher amount of evaporation obtained from the model would suggest more soil water transported to the atmosphere while higher amount of infiltration would suggest less soil water transported to the atmosphere 2 4 3 soil hydraulic and heat transport parameters the soil hydraulic parameters required for the simulation of hydrus 1d are residual water content qr saturated water content qs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks parameter α in the soil water retention function alpha parameter n in the soil water retention function n and tortuosity parameter in the conductivity function l all these parameters except alpha and n were kept constant throughout the simulation and were obtained by the neural network prediction function rosetta lite v 1 1 schaap et al 2001 available in the hydrus 1d model by providing the percentage of sand silt and clay of the soils for this study the percentage of sand silt and clay at the sand dunes were 74 8 19 7 and 5 5 and were 91 8 4 and 0 6 at the gravel plains respectively the parameter alpha and n were optimized during the calibration by inverse modeling available in hydrus 1d model of daily observed volumetric water contents of the soil at selected depths and locations the soil hydraulic parameters used for the study are presented in table 1 the heat transport parameters for the model are volume fraction of solid phase and organic matter longitudinal thermal dispersivity coefficient b1 b2 and b3 for thermal conductivity function and volumetric heat capacities of solid phase cn organic matter co and liquid phase cw the default values of coefficients for thermal conductivity function and volumetric heat capacities as provided by the hydrus 1d model are used for both sites and the thermal conductivity equation provided by chung and horton 1987 was used for the heat transport process the heat transport parameters used in the study are presented in table 2 2 4 4 initial and boundary conditions in order to solve the richards equation for water flow the initial distribution of pressure head or water content within the flow domain is required in this study the initial condition is provided in terms of water content as 2 3 θ x t θ i x t t 0 where θ i l is defined as a water content function of x and t 0 is the time when the simulation starts see hydrus 1d user manual šimůnek et al 2013 since the daily variation of water content was used for the simulation in this study the water content and temperature values prior to the day selected as first day of simulation were set as initial quantities the atmospheric boundary conditions with surface layer were selected for the water flow at the upper boundary precipitation potential evapotranspiration minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface that facilitate evaporation and time dependent temperature of the soil surface were supplied into the model at a daily temporal resolution as time variable boundary conditions at upper boundary the average evaporation of 0 65 mm day at the gravel plains li et al 2018 was used for the simulation period at both sites because of their close proximity and the plant transpiration was neglected since there were very low vegetation cover around the sites at the lower boundary variable flux condition was used since soil moisture will change with time due to evaporation and flux will not be temporally constant the time dependent temperature of soil at the surface and lower boundary was considered as the boundary conditions for the heat transport process 3 results 3 1 statistics of soil water content fog and temperature the mean volumetric water content for the entire study period at the sand dunes and the gravel plains were found to be 0 771 and 2 105 respectively table 3 the kurtosis k value and the skewness of the mean volumetric water content for the entire study period at the sand dunes was 34 82 and 4 95 respectively table 3 for the gravel plains the k value was 18 52 with the skewness of 3 90 during the entire study period table 3 the average volumetric water content at the sand dunes and the gravel plains for the 80 non rainfall days from august 19 2015 to november 06 2015 was found to be 0 639 and 1 499 respectively table 3 for the 80 non rainfall period the k value and skewness were 0 47 and 0 54 respectively at the sand dunes and were 1 20 and 0 73 respectively at the gravel plains table 3 these values table 3 and qq plot see figs 1 and 2 in supplementary materials indicated that the volumetric water content was normally distributed around their respective means for the 80 non rainfall days while it deviated from normality for the entire study period at both sites the volumetric water content at both sites seemed to have nearly daily fluctuations with few distinct peaks within the study period fig 2 there were few rainfall events but whenever there was a rainfall event the volumetric water content reached a peak which descended gradually over time sometimes during the descending phases there were various fog events fig 2 the average annual rainfall at the study site was only 24 9 29 13 mm based on five hydrologic years the rainfall in the 2017 2018 hydrologic year was extremely high 75 4 mm while it remained below 25 mm for the remaining four hydrologic years there were only 18 rainfall days during the five hydrologic years considered in the study the average annual fog at the site was 132 79 mm with 184 fog days during three hydrologic years two years fog data not available table 4 there were 24 fog days during the 80 non rainfall period from august 19 2015 to november 06 2015 the average water content was 2 13 0 5 for the five hydrologic years at the gravel plains and was 0 76 0 2 for four hydrologic years at the sand dunes one year data not available table 4 when the atypical hydrologic year 2017 2018 with very high rainfall was removed the average water content was 1 94 0 1 for the gravel plains and was 0 66 0 1 for the sand dunes table 4 the mean soil temperature and air temperature at both sites displayed similar trends at the sand dunes the mean soil temperature during the entire study period was 24 09 c and was 25 30 c for the 80 non rainfall period similarly at the gravel plains the mean soil temperature was 25 78 c for the entire study period and 23 48 c for the 80 non rainfall period the soil temperature varied from 16 09 c to 39 73 c for the entire study period and from 16 66 c to 32 38 c for the 80 non rainfall period at the sand dunes while it varied from 14 33 c to 37 41 c for the entire study period and from 16 07 c to 31 09 c for the 80 non rainfall period at the gravel plains similarly the air temperature ranged from 9 47 c to 33 63 c for the entire study period at the sand dunes and from 9 41 c to 33 63 c at the gravel plains and from 11 84 c to 27 46 c for the 80 non rainfall period at both sites 3 2 relationship between fog volumetric soil water content and temperature soil temperature increased with increase in air temperature and vice versa fig 2 the soil temperature was generally found to be higher than the air temperature the analysis of soil temperature and volumetric water content at the sand dunes showed an increase in soil water content with increase in soil temperature figs 4 and 5 the results were similar between the entire study period and during the 80 non rainfall period figs 4 and 5 despite the greater number of outliers when the overall study period was considered as compared to the 80 non rainfall days the relationship was not substantially affected likewise the relationship between these variables showed similar characteristics at the gravel plains with an exception for soil temperatures below 15 c i e the water content at soil temperature 15 c was slightly higher as compared to the higher soil temperature groups the relationship of water content with soil temperature was more pronounced and stronger at the sand dunes as compared to the gravel plains in addition the spearman correlation coefficients table 3 also showed that there was a positive correlation between soil temperature and water content similarly the relationship of volumetric soil water content with air temperature was analyzed separately at both sites at the sand dunes this displayed a parallel pattern to the soil temperature and water content relationship however at the gravel plains the relationship of soil water content was more noticeable with the air temperature as compared to the soil temperature the outliers in the case of air temperature were more in the entire period than in the non rainfall days similar to the soil temperature and water content relationship soil water content increased with the increase in air temperature for the entire study period as well as the 80 non rainfall days at both sites overall the volumetric soil water content increased with increase in soil and air temperature at both sites regardless whether the entire study period with rainfall events or the 80 rainless days were considered figs 4 and 5 whenever there was a fog or rainfall event the volumetric water content increased and reached a peak fig 2 however it was also evident that as the volumetric water content declined there were quite a few occurrences of fog events figs 2 and 3 3 3 hydrus 1d modeling the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the water vapor fluxes by comparing the volumetric soil water content as well as soil temperature available at the sites with model output at the sand dunes the model was run from august 6 2015 to november 6 2015 with data on august 5 2015 provided as the initial conditions even though the model was run from august 6 2015 the water content obtained from the model were compared with the observed values after 40 days approximately 43 of the simulation period to allow a model spin up period the model data comparison result at the sand dunes site for soil water content was modest r2 0 36 the predicted water content values were similar except for the higher observed values of soil water content around october 6 2015 fig 6 however there was a very good fit between the simulated and observed soil temperature r2 0 99 fig 7 the mean observed volumetric soil water content for the validation period was 0 6639 and the average water content obtained from the model was 0 6641 the cumulative actual surface flux i e aggregated value of what actually happens in the surface evaporation or the infiltration obtained from the model was 0 304 mm fig 8 the cumulative infiltration was computed to be 0 184 mm at the end of the simulation period while the cumulative evaporation was 0 714 mm which is almost four times the cumulative infiltration similarly the model was run from july 1 2015 to november 6 2015 at the gravel plains site the model output was compared with observations after approximately 50 of the simulation period as model spin up period the r2 value for the simulation of soil water content was only 0 13 even though the simulated water content values were comparable fig 6 the average observed water content for the calibrated period was 1 482 and the average water content obtained from the model was 1 500 the modeled water content at the gravel plains had declining slope and did not match the increased water content after october 21 2015 similar to the sand dunes hence a lower r2 value the simulation of soil temperature nevertheless showed almost a perfect fit similar to the sand dunes site r2 0 99 fig 7 the simulation at the gravel plains was run for 129 days and the cumulative actual surface water vapor flux obtained from the model was 8 968 mm fig 8 unlike at the sand dunes the gravel plains had total evaporation of 8 994 mm which is approximately 1430 times the infiltration 0 0063 mm 4 discussion 4 1 field observations it is known that the soil water content increases with rainfall and fog events li et al 2016 2018 the occurrence of fog events during the decline of the soil water content figs 2 and 3 when there were no rainfall events suggested the possibility of either advection or radiation fog locally generated fog formation at the site however these fog events are thought to be more radiative rather than advective kaseke et al 2017 revealed that there are comparable radiation fog and advection fog in the fog zone of the namib desert for the study year and more than half of the overall fog events during the study period are not sourced from the ocean for a fog to be locally generated there should be a water source and since the study sites do not have permanent water source except the ephemeral kuiseb river the only possible sources are soil moisture and groundwater at the sites however soil moisture data were unavailable at the site with groundwater and hence only the soil moisture contribution was considered for this study the relationship between temperature and soil moisture was evaluated to examine the possibility of water vapor movement in this arid environment in general there is a positive relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture at both sites figs 4 and 5 the relationship between air temperature and soil moisture was similar to the relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture eliminating the possibility of biased results due to same sensor measuring soil moisture and soil temperature the temperatures were found to be directly proportional to each other fig 2 there were outliers seen in the analysis of the soil temperature and soil moisture during the overall study period figs 4 and 5 which may be attributed to the rainfall events causing substantial change in soil water content over a short period of time the small number of outliers seen during the analysis of 80 non rainfall days may further justify the argument the soil water content increased with increase in soil temperature at both sites figs 4 and 5 a slight exception was seen in this relationship at the gravel plains where at the lower soil temperature groups the water content seemed to be a little higher than the following higher temperature groups similarly even though the overall relationship of water content with the soil temperature appeared increasing at the sand dunes the water content at the lower soil temperature groups was slightly higher than the following soil temperature group as it was at the gravel plains the positive relationship between soil water and soil temperature may be due to the process of condensation during the transport of water vapor originated from evaporated soil moisture from a certain depth during this process the transported water vapor condenses and adds up moisture to the soil condensation also increases soil temperature through the release of latent heat because the soil temperature and air temperature followed a similar pattern it can be deduced that the soil water content would change with soil temperature in a similar way as it does with air temperature it is worth noting that the relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature observed in this study contrasts with the one presented by entekhabi et al 2001 where it is stated that the water content decreases when there is increase in the near surface soil temperature the study was done in the skukuza core site located in kruger national park south africa which had an average annual rainfall of 546 mm however the setting considered in our study is entirely different than in entekhabi et al 2001 the site considered in our study gobabeb is extremely dry with average annual precipitation of only 24 9 mm while the annual average rainfall was only around 12 3 mm until 2017 the average raised up to 24 9 mm because of heavy rainfall event in april 36 1 mm and may 30 8 mm of 2018 even though the data was available only until june 24 2018 generally there would be a negative relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture in most of the places as seen in the study by entekhabi et al 2001 however based on this study it suggests that the drier the environment the stronger positive relationship between the soil temperature and soil moisture water from soil moisture and shallow groundwater may evaporate easily in a hot and dry environment hence the strong positive relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture in such an environment like the namib desert this brings up the fact that the relationship between soil temperature and water content can be different based on the meteorological conditions and the relationship would be more positive in hot and dry environment as compared to hot and humid environment the increase in soil water content with increase in temperature can be explained by a two step process whereby increased soil temperature leads to loss of surface soil moisture and that in turn causes the movement of water in the form of vapor from the subsoil to the surface soil layers due to the available temperature gradient the 80 non rainfall days were mainly considered in order to evaluate if this relationship was valid under both rainfall and without rainfall scenarios with the assumption that without rainfall there will not be enough water source to increase the soil water content the only source could have been either fog or the soil moisture and groundwater present in the subsoil however since fog events generally occur at lower temperature and during early morning hours this reasoning favorably points towards the available soil moisture and groundwater henceforth this relationship suggests that the increase in the soil water content may be due to the water vapor transport from the soil moisture and the groundwater available at few meters below the soil surface 4 2 modeled water vapor surface fluxes the use of hydrus 1d model for the simulation of actual surface flux is to examine if the process of water vapor transport in the subsoil will lead to some contribution in the fog formation fig 8 the low value of r2 for the soil water content may be due to the approximation of the soil hydraulic parameters and the heat transport parameters required during the simulation process due to the lack of actual field measured soil hydraulic parameters such as saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity the rosetta lite v 1 1 that is available in hydrus 1d model was used to predict the values of these parameters the residual water content was also predicted by the rosetta and was higher than the initial water content observed in the field however since hydrus 1d model requires the residual water content to be lower than the initial water content to initiate the model run the residual water content had to be manually attuned and hence a value lower than the initial water content was assigned the constraints of field measured soil hydraulic parameters may be one of the reasons for the simulated soil water content not being quite synchronized with the observed values the thermal conductivity equation and heat transport parameters used in this study are the ones provided by chung and horton 1987 the hydrus 1d model has the option to choose the thermal conductivity values from either sand clay or loam options because the sites considered in this study are mostly sandy the heat transport parameters for sand as provided by the model are applied further since temperature at lower boundary was not available in the daily temporal resolution a constant temperature of 25 c was assumed at the gravel plains because this was the temperature measured at the site near the groundwater depth and a constant temperature of 24 c was assumed at the sand dunes since the soil temperature at the sand dunes was found lower than at the gravel plains for temperature profile modeled by hydrus 1d see fig 3 in supplementary materials this assumption of constant temperature at the lower boundaries may also be a reason for the differences between the modeled and observed water content values as indicated from previous literature soil temperature at around 100 cm depth would remain within a range of few degrees approximately 0 5 5 c in the namib desert and locations with similar climatic conditions goudie 1970 lancaster et al 1984 kohler et al 2010 nicholson 2011 for example goudie 1970 and lancaster et al 1984 presented soil temperature variation from surface to 120 cm depth in the namib desert kohler et al 2010 showed the soil temperature variation from soil surface to 100 cm depth in western africa and nicholson 2011 compiled soil temperature from surface to 75 cm depth over a sand dune in the sahara based on the work of peel 1974 additional model runs were performed to simulate surface flux using temperature ranging from 20 to 30 c for both study sites the results showed that temperature changes did not alter the values of heat flux drastically at both sites see fig 4 supplementary materials the validation period was selected after excluding approximately 40 of the overall simulation period in the beginning to make sure that the model reached a stable state although in a different way from precipitation fog also increases the soil water content li et al 2018 but the hydrus 1d model does not have a direct option to address any non rainfall events such as fog since the fog was not assigned into the model the possibility of soil moisture recharge by the fog water was not considered by the model this may have caused simulated water content values to be lower than the field observed ones fig 6 in addition water uptake by plants roots was neglected in this study since vegetation cover near the study sites was extremely low despite the low abundance of vegetation if water uptake by plant roots were considered the soil moisture and actual surface flux probably might have been higher since the presence of a vegetation cover is supposed to increase the soil water content as compared to the bare ground conditions that currently prevail at the study sites li et al 2016 the minimum pressure head at the soil surface hcrita a variable in hydrus 1d was required by the hydrus 1d model when the atmospheric boundary condition was selected at the upper boundary and was set to 10 5 cm for pressure head profile modeled by hydrus 1d see fig 5 in supplementary materials additional model runs were included by varying the minimum pressure head values to check if there were significant changes in the surface flux values see fig 6 in supplementary materials the results showed that even though there was a small change in the magnitude of flux obtained the resulting flux mostly matches the polarity in reported values positive and negative the actual surface flux at both sites exhibits similar patterns but different magnitudes fig 8 and this may be due to the similar meteorological conditions shared by the sites it is also evident that the actual surface water vapor flux obtained from the model is lower at the sand dunes site as compared to the gravel plains this may be attributed to the difference in soil texture at the sites the actual surface flux and evaporation values as obtained from the hydrus 1d model clearly depicts that there is water vapor exchange throughout the period from the soil to the atmosphere and this could contribute to the formation of radiation fog as well as mixed fog in the area the positive flux of water vapor at the soil surface suggest a constant transfer of soil water near the surface to the atmosphere and over time this cumulated water vapor under favorable meteorological conditions may lead to the formation of fog 5 conclusions soil moisture can be a potential source of fog in dryland ecosystems like the namib desert the field observation analysis showed that there was an increase in volumetric soil water content near soil surface with increase in soil or air temperature which is a new finding and an important piece of evidence of the biophysical basis of water vapor movement the relationship was similar during the entire study period as well as for a rainless period of 80 days the study results documented the transfer of water vapor in amount sufficient to support the formation of fog at the study sites selected for this research field observations supported by the results of hydrological modeling have demonstrated the possible contribution of soil moisture to fog formation through water vapor movement this research has for the first time demonstrated the possibility for subsoil water soil moisture to participate in the formation of fog specifically radiation fog in the namib desert the modeling results suggest that this approach can be further utilized to study possible fog sources in other regions credit

5075,fog is considered as an important source of water in many drylands and the knowledge of possible sources of its formation is essential to make future predictions prior studies have suggested the presence of locally generated fog in drylands however its formation mechanism remains unclear there have been studies on the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics on the contrary no research has yet been conducted to understand the potential contribution of soil moisture to fog formation this study therefore for the first time intends to examine such possibility in a fog dominated dryland ecosystem the namib desert the study was conducted at two sites representing two different land forms sand dunes and gravel plains in the namib desert we first examined evidence of fog formation through water vapor movement using field observations and then simulated water vapor transport using hydrus 1d model in the first part of the study soil moisture soil temperature and air temperature data were analyzed and the relationships between these variables were taken as one of the key indicators for the linkage between soil water and fog formation the analysis showed that increase in soil moisture generally corresponded to similar increase in air or soil temperature near the soil surface which implied that variation in soil moisture might be the result of water vapor movement evaporated soil moisture from lower depths to the soil surface in the second part of the study surface fluxes of water vapor were simulated using the hydrus 1d model to explore whether the available surface flux was sufficient to support fog formation the surface flux and cumulative evaporation obtained from the model showed positive surface fluxes of water vapor based on the field observations and the hydrus 1d model results it can be concluded that water vapor from soil layers is transported through the vadose zone to the surface and this water vapor likely contributes to the fog formation in fog dominated drylands like the namib desert keywords ecohydrology drylands hydrological model hydrus 1d namib desert soil moisture 1 introduction drylands are regions where precipitation is comparatively less than potential evapotranspiration the aridity index ai quantitatively defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration must be 0 65 for an area to be considered as drylands drylands can be classified using this aridity index into four sub types dry sub humid lands semi arid lands arid lands and hyper arid lands adeel et al 2005 wang et al 2012 drylands cover approximately 40 of the land surface and support more than 2 billion population worldwide wang et al 2012 since water resources are severely limited in drylands water availability poses the primary control over biological processes wang et al 2010 yu and d odorico 2015 fog although in small amount play an important supporting role in supplying water that is essential to maintain ecological functions in drylands wang et al 2017 in arid drylands where rainfall is sparse fog can be the most important form of water input which could be utilized for the dryland ecosystem to increase productivity kaseke et al 2017 qiao et al 2020 it can also constitute a major portion of the overall hydrological input especially in some of the coastal areas which often receive very little or no rainfall in a year dawson 1998 in general there are seven types of fog four of which are based on process and place of formation radiation fog sea fog steam fog and advection fog and the remaining three are designated based on their place of occurrence irrespective of the process of their formation coastal fog valley fog and mountain fog eugster 2008 out of these seven different types of fog most studies have focused on two types namely i radiation fog which is formed mainly by a cooling mechanism especially nocturnal cooling over the continental surface and ii advection fog which is formed because of the humidification near coastal areas or over the sea bergot and guedalia 1994 even though fog provides significant amount of water for dryland environments runyan et al 2019 these are the least studied components of the hydrological cycle wang et al 2017 having multiple origins fog in drylands can originate from recycling of groundwater via evapotranspiration and redistribution of water vapor in the upper soil layers more than 50 of the total fog events in the namib desert were found to be non ocean derived during their study period kaseke et al 2017 this highlights the importance of studies to determine the quantity and origin of fog in dryland ecosystems where rainfall is expected to decline due to climate change in coming years lu et al 2016 soil moisture is considered as a critical component of earth system and plays an important role in land atmosphere interactions eltahir 1998 it can be used to understand the relationship of climate soil and vegetation in dryland ecosystems fang et al 2016 li et al 2016 in water limited dryland ecosystems various eco hydrological processes are dependent on soil water availability wang et al 2009 miller et al 2012 wei et al 2019 many factors like precipitation evaporation liquid water and water vapor flow influence soil moisture near the surface in drylands and most of these factors are strongly connected in the namib desert the first millimeters of surface soil might receive enough soil moisture from fog droplets and dew formation li et al 2016 wang et al 2019 since soil water content near the soil surface in drylands is often extremely low water vapor transport plays a critical role in the overall water flux and availability d odorico and porporato 2006 saito et al 2006 yin et al 2019 the movement of soil moisture and heat are coupled the simultaneous movement of heat liquid water and water vapor at the land atmosphere interface is significant for a range of biological phenomena as well as water and energy balance of terrestrial ecosystems bittelli et al 2008 cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 the total heat flux of soil is a result of simple conduction as well as the movement of water in both the liquid and vapor states the net soil moisture movement between any two locations can be mainly attributed to the movement of moisture in soil from one location to another caused by evaporation and subsequent re condensation during this process of evaporation and re condensation a significant amount of energy is transported by the water vapor since water has high latent energy of vaporization cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 fog and soil moisture impact each other fog increases soil moisture and sometimes fog infiltrates further down to recharge groundwater systems ingraham and matthews 1990 at the same time soil water could contribute to fog formation for example using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes a recent study showed that groundwater is a source of radiation fog in the namib desert kaseke et al 2017 one possible process is through soil water evaporation and subsequence re condensation previous studies have demonstrated that soil water can be transported from one location to another by evaporation and re condensation bittelli et al 2008 cahill and parlange 1998 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2011 furthermore the transported soil water to the surface can be evaporated from the soil surface into atmosphere contributing to the formation of fog past studies have explored the impact of fog to groundwater recharge or soil moisture content ingraham and matthews 1988 1990 li et al 2018 liu et al 2005 prada et al 2010 sawaske and freyberg 2015 furthermore prior studies have suggested the prevalence of radiation fog in addition to the advection fog in the namib desert kaseke et al 2018a these studies identified groundwater and soil moisture as possible origins for the radiation fog in the namib desert but transport and formation mechanisms still remain unclear this research hence for the first time aims to investigate the contribution of soil moisture to the formation of fog in the namib desert the hypothesis of the study is that soil moisture contributes to the fog formation in the fog dominated dryland namib desert through the process of continuous evaporation and subsequent condensation in sub soil to test this hypothesis this research examined the relationships between volumetric soil water content soil and air temperature and fog occurrence in the study area in addition a hydrological model hydrus 1d was applied to simulate water vapor transport in the vadose zone to further evaluate the hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the namib desert was chosen for the study because it is a fog dominated dryland it is located in the coastal area of namibia and extends from the olifants river in south africa to carunjamba river in angola and has an overall stretch of 1900 km along the coast of the atlantic ocean li et al 2016 there is a wide distribution of precipitation in the namib desert with an annual average of 5 18 mm in the central namib desert li et al 2016 two land forms the gravel plains and the sand dunes at gobabeb located in the namib desert were selected since they share similar meteorological conditions but different soil textures the study sites were located within the vicinity of the gobabeb research and training centre lat 23 55 long 15 04 and elv 405 m a s l which is in the central namib desert and about 60 km inland from the atlantic ocean fig 1 the gobabeb centre is surrounded by three main land forms gravel plains to the north and east 91 sand 0 6 clay and 8 4 silt sand dune sea to the west and south 74 8 sand 5 5 clay and 19 7 silt and the ephemeral kuiseb river 91 5 sand 2 1 clay 6 4 silt to the south of the centre which separates the gravel plains and sand dune sea kaseke et al 2017 the climate at gobabeb is hyper arid with extremely infrequent precipitation events and a mean annual precipitation of 27 mm the mean monthly temperature at gobabeb ranges from 17 to 24 2 c and has an average relative humidity of around 50 with 94 mean annual foggy days eckardt et al 2013 li et al 2018 2 2 data collection the volumetric water content and soil temperature data used in the study were collected from two sites at gobabeb in the namib desert the gravel plains and the sand dunes the volumetric water content and soil temperature data were measured hourly at both sites using the cs655 water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa the soil probes were located at an approximate depth of 4 cm at both sites these soil moisture probes were installed horizontally at the sites and can detect volumetric water content from 0 to 100 with m4 command with a high precision 0 05 the daily precipitation data were collected using the tipping bucket setting at the gravel plains and the same data were used for the sand dunes as well because of their close proximity other meteorological data such as air temperature and fog were obtained from weather and fognet stations which are part of the southern african science service centre from climate change and adaptive land management sasscal for the gravel plains volumetric water content and soil temperature data from december 29 2013 to june 24 2018 and for the sand dunes data from august 5 2015 to may 22 2018 were used in the analysis furthermore soil moisture and soil temperature data used by entekhabi et al 2001 to evaluate relationship between surface temperature and soil moisture in southern africa was retrieved and digitized to compare results of their study to those of the present research the study by entekhabi et al 2001 was used to compare the results since the site considered in their study had a semi arid climate and received a higher amount of rainfall as compared to the present research in addition that study represented general relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature which would exist in most of the places with wetter climatic conditions 2 3 analysis of field data hourly volumetric water content soil temperature precipitation and fog data were used to obtain the daily values for analysis in order to demonstrate the relationship of volumetric water content with soil and air temperature simple scatter plots and box plots were used since relationships were found between volumetric soil water content and different variables such as soil temperature air temperature fog and precipitation data were analyzed to determine how the change in volumetric water content can be explained by change in different variables the statistical relationships between daily air soil temperature and volumetric water content were tested using spearman correlation coefficients the soil and air temperature were divided into distinct 5 c bins for demonstrating the relationship with volumetric water content the near surface soil temperature and air temperature were used for this study to further examine if the soil temperature follows the air temperature trend fog and precipitation data were used to understand how the volumetric soil water content responds to their occurrences or vice versa the data were analyzed for two periods i all the available data and ii data from august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 during which there was no rainfall event in order to examine whether the relationship varies when rainfall events are considered and during periods with no rainfall events the 80 non rainfall days august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 were chosen mainly because there were no data missing within that period there were several fog events during that period and this period was the one previously used by li et al 2018 to examine the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics in the namib desert furthermore the statistical analysis of data was done based on hydrologic year october to september since rainfall events at gobabeb are very rare but if these events occur they are mostly concentrated between october and april lu et al 2016 the rainfall seasonal distribution at the study sites is similar to windhoek where the rainfall is very seasonal and concentrated within the above mentioned months kaseke et al 2018b 2 4 hydrus modeling 2 4 1 model description hydrus 1d model is often used for the simulation of one dimensional water flow heat movement and solute transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2013 in the present study version 4 17 of this model was used for the simulation of water vapor transport from soil moisture at a certain depth to the soil surface the basic equation hydrus 1d model uses for the water flow is richards equation 1 θ t x k h x cos α s where θ h is the volumetric water content t is time x is the spatial coordinate considering upward direction as positive k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity h is the water pressure head α is the angle between the flow direction and vertical axis and s is the sink term see hydrus 1d user manual by šimůnek et al 2013 however since richards equation considers only liquid flow and ignores vapor flow hydrus 1d model uses the following non isothermal liquid and vapor flow equation saito et al 2006 for the water vapor transport modeling 2 θ t h t x k k υ h h x cos α k lt k υ t t x s h where θ t is the total volumetric water content t is temperature in kelvin k is the isothermal hydraulic conductivity of the liquid phase k lt is the thermal hydraulic conductivity of the liquid phase k υ h is the isothermal vapor hydraulic conductivity and k υ t is the thermal vapor hydraulic conductivity see hydrus 1d user manual by šimůnek et al 2013 2 4 2 model setup hydrus 1d model was used to simulate water vapor flow and heat transport in the vertical direction horizontal water transport was not considered the soil column was considered to be homogeneous along the depth e g soil was regarded as a single layer for the simulation the hydraulic sub model within hydrus 1d used for this study was van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 since the simulated study sites have very low vegetation cover plant transpiration was neglected and only evaporation was considered for this study the inverse solution option available in hydrus 1d was used in order to optimize the soil hydraulic parameters alpha a fitting parameter and n pore size distribution index which are the coefficients of soil water retention function see hydrus 1d user manual šimůnek et al 2013 the simulations were validated using the measured soil temperature and volumetric soil water content at a depth of 4 cm at the sand dunes and the gravel plains the validation period was considered after a certain duration of the model run in order to provide sufficient model spin up time the validation was done after 40 days at the sand dunes site since only 93 days were run in the model and the simulation results was obtained for 53 days the model spin up period provided at the gravel plains was approximately 50 of the overall time period 129 days selected for the model run and 65 days were used for the results the model was run for the rainless period to examine if the soil moisture will have sufficient surface flux and evaporation for the formation of fog at the sites the actual surface flux obtained from the model inform what actually happens at the surface whether the soil water evaporates or infiltrates e g fraction of water moves downward the higher amount of evaporation obtained from the model would suggest more soil water transported to the atmosphere while higher amount of infiltration would suggest less soil water transported to the atmosphere 2 4 3 soil hydraulic and heat transport parameters the soil hydraulic parameters required for the simulation of hydrus 1d are residual water content qr saturated water content qs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks parameter α in the soil water retention function alpha parameter n in the soil water retention function n and tortuosity parameter in the conductivity function l all these parameters except alpha and n were kept constant throughout the simulation and were obtained by the neural network prediction function rosetta lite v 1 1 schaap et al 2001 available in the hydrus 1d model by providing the percentage of sand silt and clay of the soils for this study the percentage of sand silt and clay at the sand dunes were 74 8 19 7 and 5 5 and were 91 8 4 and 0 6 at the gravel plains respectively the parameter alpha and n were optimized during the calibration by inverse modeling available in hydrus 1d model of daily observed volumetric water contents of the soil at selected depths and locations the soil hydraulic parameters used for the study are presented in table 1 the heat transport parameters for the model are volume fraction of solid phase and organic matter longitudinal thermal dispersivity coefficient b1 b2 and b3 for thermal conductivity function and volumetric heat capacities of solid phase cn organic matter co and liquid phase cw the default values of coefficients for thermal conductivity function and volumetric heat capacities as provided by the hydrus 1d model are used for both sites and the thermal conductivity equation provided by chung and horton 1987 was used for the heat transport process the heat transport parameters used in the study are presented in table 2 2 4 4 initial and boundary conditions in order to solve the richards equation for water flow the initial distribution of pressure head or water content within the flow domain is required in this study the initial condition is provided in terms of water content as 2 3 θ x t θ i x t t 0 where θ i l is defined as a water content function of x and t 0 is the time when the simulation starts see hydrus 1d user manual šimůnek et al 2013 since the daily variation of water content was used for the simulation in this study the water content and temperature values prior to the day selected as first day of simulation were set as initial quantities the atmospheric boundary conditions with surface layer were selected for the water flow at the upper boundary precipitation potential evapotranspiration minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface that facilitate evaporation and time dependent temperature of the soil surface were supplied into the model at a daily temporal resolution as time variable boundary conditions at upper boundary the average evaporation of 0 65 mm day at the gravel plains li et al 2018 was used for the simulation period at both sites because of their close proximity and the plant transpiration was neglected since there were very low vegetation cover around the sites at the lower boundary variable flux condition was used since soil moisture will change with time due to evaporation and flux will not be temporally constant the time dependent temperature of soil at the surface and lower boundary was considered as the boundary conditions for the heat transport process 3 results 3 1 statistics of soil water content fog and temperature the mean volumetric water content for the entire study period at the sand dunes and the gravel plains were found to be 0 771 and 2 105 respectively table 3 the kurtosis k value and the skewness of the mean volumetric water content for the entire study period at the sand dunes was 34 82 and 4 95 respectively table 3 for the gravel plains the k value was 18 52 with the skewness of 3 90 during the entire study period table 3 the average volumetric water content at the sand dunes and the gravel plains for the 80 non rainfall days from august 19 2015 to november 06 2015 was found to be 0 639 and 1 499 respectively table 3 for the 80 non rainfall period the k value and skewness were 0 47 and 0 54 respectively at the sand dunes and were 1 20 and 0 73 respectively at the gravel plains table 3 these values table 3 and qq plot see figs 1 and 2 in supplementary materials indicated that the volumetric water content was normally distributed around their respective means for the 80 non rainfall days while it deviated from normality for the entire study period at both sites the volumetric water content at both sites seemed to have nearly daily fluctuations with few distinct peaks within the study period fig 2 there were few rainfall events but whenever there was a rainfall event the volumetric water content reached a peak which descended gradually over time sometimes during the descending phases there were various fog events fig 2 the average annual rainfall at the study site was only 24 9 29 13 mm based on five hydrologic years the rainfall in the 2017 2018 hydrologic year was extremely high 75 4 mm while it remained below 25 mm for the remaining four hydrologic years there were only 18 rainfall days during the five hydrologic years considered in the study the average annual fog at the site was 132 79 mm with 184 fog days during three hydrologic years two years fog data not available table 4 there were 24 fog days during the 80 non rainfall period from august 19 2015 to november 06 2015 the average water content was 2 13 0 5 for the five hydrologic years at the gravel plains and was 0 76 0 2 for four hydrologic years at the sand dunes one year data not available table 4 when the atypical hydrologic year 2017 2018 with very high rainfall was removed the average water content was 1 94 0 1 for the gravel plains and was 0 66 0 1 for the sand dunes table 4 the mean soil temperature and air temperature at both sites displayed similar trends at the sand dunes the mean soil temperature during the entire study period was 24 09 c and was 25 30 c for the 80 non rainfall period similarly at the gravel plains the mean soil temperature was 25 78 c for the entire study period and 23 48 c for the 80 non rainfall period the soil temperature varied from 16 09 c to 39 73 c for the entire study period and from 16 66 c to 32 38 c for the 80 non rainfall period at the sand dunes while it varied from 14 33 c to 37 41 c for the entire study period and from 16 07 c to 31 09 c for the 80 non rainfall period at the gravel plains similarly the air temperature ranged from 9 47 c to 33 63 c for the entire study period at the sand dunes and from 9 41 c to 33 63 c at the gravel plains and from 11 84 c to 27 46 c for the 80 non rainfall period at both sites 3 2 relationship between fog volumetric soil water content and temperature soil temperature increased with increase in air temperature and vice versa fig 2 the soil temperature was generally found to be higher than the air temperature the analysis of soil temperature and volumetric water content at the sand dunes showed an increase in soil water content with increase in soil temperature figs 4 and 5 the results were similar between the entire study period and during the 80 non rainfall period figs 4 and 5 despite the greater number of outliers when the overall study period was considered as compared to the 80 non rainfall days the relationship was not substantially affected likewise the relationship between these variables showed similar characteristics at the gravel plains with an exception for soil temperatures below 15 c i e the water content at soil temperature 15 c was slightly higher as compared to the higher soil temperature groups the relationship of water content with soil temperature was more pronounced and stronger at the sand dunes as compared to the gravel plains in addition the spearman correlation coefficients table 3 also showed that there was a positive correlation between soil temperature and water content similarly the relationship of volumetric soil water content with air temperature was analyzed separately at both sites at the sand dunes this displayed a parallel pattern to the soil temperature and water content relationship however at the gravel plains the relationship of soil water content was more noticeable with the air temperature as compared to the soil temperature the outliers in the case of air temperature were more in the entire period than in the non rainfall days similar to the soil temperature and water content relationship soil water content increased with the increase in air temperature for the entire study period as well as the 80 non rainfall days at both sites overall the volumetric soil water content increased with increase in soil and air temperature at both sites regardless whether the entire study period with rainfall events or the 80 rainless days were considered figs 4 and 5 whenever there was a fog or rainfall event the volumetric water content increased and reached a peak fig 2 however it was also evident that as the volumetric water content declined there were quite a few occurrences of fog events figs 2 and 3 3 3 hydrus 1d modeling the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the water vapor fluxes by comparing the volumetric soil water content as well as soil temperature available at the sites with model output at the sand dunes the model was run from august 6 2015 to november 6 2015 with data on august 5 2015 provided as the initial conditions even though the model was run from august 6 2015 the water content obtained from the model were compared with the observed values after 40 days approximately 43 of the simulation period to allow a model spin up period the model data comparison result at the sand dunes site for soil water content was modest r2 0 36 the predicted water content values were similar except for the higher observed values of soil water content around october 6 2015 fig 6 however there was a very good fit between the simulated and observed soil temperature r2 0 99 fig 7 the mean observed volumetric soil water content for the validation period was 0 6639 and the average water content obtained from the model was 0 6641 the cumulative actual surface flux i e aggregated value of what actually happens in the surface evaporation or the infiltration obtained from the model was 0 304 mm fig 8 the cumulative infiltration was computed to be 0 184 mm at the end of the simulation period while the cumulative evaporation was 0 714 mm which is almost four times the cumulative infiltration similarly the model was run from july 1 2015 to november 6 2015 at the gravel plains site the model output was compared with observations after approximately 50 of the simulation period as model spin up period the r2 value for the simulation of soil water content was only 0 13 even though the simulated water content values were comparable fig 6 the average observed water content for the calibrated period was 1 482 and the average water content obtained from the model was 1 500 the modeled water content at the gravel plains had declining slope and did not match the increased water content after october 21 2015 similar to the sand dunes hence a lower r2 value the simulation of soil temperature nevertheless showed almost a perfect fit similar to the sand dunes site r2 0 99 fig 7 the simulation at the gravel plains was run for 129 days and the cumulative actual surface water vapor flux obtained from the model was 8 968 mm fig 8 unlike at the sand dunes the gravel plains had total evaporation of 8 994 mm which is approximately 1430 times the infiltration 0 0063 mm 4 discussion 4 1 field observations it is known that the soil water content increases with rainfall and fog events li et al 2016 2018 the occurrence of fog events during the decline of the soil water content figs 2 and 3 when there were no rainfall events suggested the possibility of either advection or radiation fog locally generated fog formation at the site however these fog events are thought to be more radiative rather than advective kaseke et al 2017 revealed that there are comparable radiation fog and advection fog in the fog zone of the namib desert for the study year and more than half of the overall fog events during the study period are not sourced from the ocean for a fog to be locally generated there should be a water source and since the study sites do not have permanent water source except the ephemeral kuiseb river the only possible sources are soil moisture and groundwater at the sites however soil moisture data were unavailable at the site with groundwater and hence only the soil moisture contribution was considered for this study the relationship between temperature and soil moisture was evaluated to examine the possibility of water vapor movement in this arid environment in general there is a positive relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture at both sites figs 4 and 5 the relationship between air temperature and soil moisture was similar to the relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture eliminating the possibility of biased results due to same sensor measuring soil moisture and soil temperature the temperatures were found to be directly proportional to each other fig 2 there were outliers seen in the analysis of the soil temperature and soil moisture during the overall study period figs 4 and 5 which may be attributed to the rainfall events causing substantial change in soil water content over a short period of time the small number of outliers seen during the analysis of 80 non rainfall days may further justify the argument the soil water content increased with increase in soil temperature at both sites figs 4 and 5 a slight exception was seen in this relationship at the gravel plains where at the lower soil temperature groups the water content seemed to be a little higher than the following higher temperature groups similarly even though the overall relationship of water content with the soil temperature appeared increasing at the sand dunes the water content at the lower soil temperature groups was slightly higher than the following soil temperature group as it was at the gravel plains the positive relationship between soil water and soil temperature may be due to the process of condensation during the transport of water vapor originated from evaporated soil moisture from a certain depth during this process the transported water vapor condenses and adds up moisture to the soil condensation also increases soil temperature through the release of latent heat because the soil temperature and air temperature followed a similar pattern it can be deduced that the soil water content would change with soil temperature in a similar way as it does with air temperature it is worth noting that the relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature observed in this study contrasts with the one presented by entekhabi et al 2001 where it is stated that the water content decreases when there is increase in the near surface soil temperature the study was done in the skukuza core site located in kruger national park south africa which had an average annual rainfall of 546 mm however the setting considered in our study is entirely different than in entekhabi et al 2001 the site considered in our study gobabeb is extremely dry with average annual precipitation of only 24 9 mm while the annual average rainfall was only around 12 3 mm until 2017 the average raised up to 24 9 mm because of heavy rainfall event in april 36 1 mm and may 30 8 mm of 2018 even though the data was available only until june 24 2018 generally there would be a negative relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture in most of the places as seen in the study by entekhabi et al 2001 however based on this study it suggests that the drier the environment the stronger positive relationship between the soil temperature and soil moisture water from soil moisture and shallow groundwater may evaporate easily in a hot and dry environment hence the strong positive relationship between soil temperature and soil moisture in such an environment like the namib desert this brings up the fact that the relationship between soil temperature and water content can be different based on the meteorological conditions and the relationship would be more positive in hot and dry environment as compared to hot and humid environment the increase in soil water content with increase in temperature can be explained by a two step process whereby increased soil temperature leads to loss of surface soil moisture and that in turn causes the movement of water in the form of vapor from the subsoil to the surface soil layers due to the available temperature gradient the 80 non rainfall days were mainly considered in order to evaluate if this relationship was valid under both rainfall and without rainfall scenarios with the assumption that without rainfall there will not be enough water source to increase the soil water content the only source could have been either fog or the soil moisture and groundwater present in the subsoil however since fog events generally occur at lower temperature and during early morning hours this reasoning favorably points towards the available soil moisture and groundwater henceforth this relationship suggests that the increase in the soil water content may be due to the water vapor transport from the soil moisture and the groundwater available at few meters below the soil surface 4 2 modeled water vapor surface fluxes the use of hydrus 1d model for the simulation of actual surface flux is to examine if the process of water vapor transport in the subsoil will lead to some contribution in the fog formation fig 8 the low value of r2 for the soil water content may be due to the approximation of the soil hydraulic parameters and the heat transport parameters required during the simulation process due to the lack of actual field measured soil hydraulic parameters such as saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity the rosetta lite v 1 1 that is available in hydrus 1d model was used to predict the values of these parameters the residual water content was also predicted by the rosetta and was higher than the initial water content observed in the field however since hydrus 1d model requires the residual water content to be lower than the initial water content to initiate the model run the residual water content had to be manually attuned and hence a value lower than the initial water content was assigned the constraints of field measured soil hydraulic parameters may be one of the reasons for the simulated soil water content not being quite synchronized with the observed values the thermal conductivity equation and heat transport parameters used in this study are the ones provided by chung and horton 1987 the hydrus 1d model has the option to choose the thermal conductivity values from either sand clay or loam options because the sites considered in this study are mostly sandy the heat transport parameters for sand as provided by the model are applied further since temperature at lower boundary was not available in the daily temporal resolution a constant temperature of 25 c was assumed at the gravel plains because this was the temperature measured at the site near the groundwater depth and a constant temperature of 24 c was assumed at the sand dunes since the soil temperature at the sand dunes was found lower than at the gravel plains for temperature profile modeled by hydrus 1d see fig 3 in supplementary materials this assumption of constant temperature at the lower boundaries may also be a reason for the differences between the modeled and observed water content values as indicated from previous literature soil temperature at around 100 cm depth would remain within a range of few degrees approximately 0 5 5 c in the namib desert and locations with similar climatic conditions goudie 1970 lancaster et al 1984 kohler et al 2010 nicholson 2011 for example goudie 1970 and lancaster et al 1984 presented soil temperature variation from surface to 120 cm depth in the namib desert kohler et al 2010 showed the soil temperature variation from soil surface to 100 cm depth in western africa and nicholson 2011 compiled soil temperature from surface to 75 cm depth over a sand dune in the sahara based on the work of peel 1974 additional model runs were performed to simulate surface flux using temperature ranging from 20 to 30 c for both study sites the results showed that temperature changes did not alter the values of heat flux drastically at both sites see fig 4 supplementary materials the validation period was selected after excluding approximately 40 of the overall simulation period in the beginning to make sure that the model reached a stable state although in a different way from precipitation fog also increases the soil water content li et al 2018 but the hydrus 1d model does not have a direct option to address any non rainfall events such as fog since the fog was not assigned into the model the possibility of soil moisture recharge by the fog water was not considered by the model this may have caused simulated water content values to be lower than the field observed ones fig 6 in addition water uptake by plants roots was neglected in this study since vegetation cover near the study sites was extremely low despite the low abundance of vegetation if water uptake by plant roots were considered the soil moisture and actual surface flux probably might have been higher since the presence of a vegetation cover is supposed to increase the soil water content as compared to the bare ground conditions that currently prevail at the study sites li et al 2016 the minimum pressure head at the soil surface hcrita a variable in hydrus 1d was required by the hydrus 1d model when the atmospheric boundary condition was selected at the upper boundary and was set to 10 5 cm for pressure head profile modeled by hydrus 1d see fig 5 in supplementary materials additional model runs were included by varying the minimum pressure head values to check if there were significant changes in the surface flux values see fig 6 in supplementary materials the results showed that even though there was a small change in the magnitude of flux obtained the resulting flux mostly matches the polarity in reported values positive and negative the actual surface flux at both sites exhibits similar patterns but different magnitudes fig 8 and this may be due to the similar meteorological conditions shared by the sites it is also evident that the actual surface water vapor flux obtained from the model is lower at the sand dunes site as compared to the gravel plains this may be attributed to the difference in soil texture at the sites the actual surface flux and evaporation values as obtained from the hydrus 1d model clearly depicts that there is water vapor exchange throughout the period from the soil to the atmosphere and this could contribute to the formation of radiation fog as well as mixed fog in the area the positive flux of water vapor at the soil surface suggest a constant transfer of soil water near the surface to the atmosphere and over time this cumulated water vapor under favorable meteorological conditions may lead to the formation of fog 5 conclusions soil moisture can be a potential source of fog in dryland ecosystems like the namib desert the field observation analysis showed that there was an increase in volumetric soil water content near soil surface with increase in soil or air temperature which is a new finding and an important piece of evidence of the biophysical basis of water vapor movement the relationship was similar during the entire study period as well as for a rainless period of 80 days the study results documented the transfer of water vapor in amount sufficient to support the formation of fog at the study sites selected for this research field observations supported by the results of hydrological modeling have demonstrated the possible contribution of soil moisture to fog formation through water vapor movement this research has for the first time demonstrated the possibility for subsoil water soil moisture to participate in the formation of fog specifically radiation fog in the namib desert the modeling results suggest that this approach can be further utilized to study possible fog sources in other regions credit

5076,as an important factor affecting water quality dissolved trace element dte is not well studied in the karst region here eighteen dtes were analyzed to investigate their contents seasonal spatial variations sources and controlling factors and to evaluate water quality and health risks in a karst river system chishui river southwestern china the results showed that dissolved trace element concentrations dtecs in this river were at a relatively low level compared with other chinese rivers except for cr ni sr and u other dtes had a higher median concentration in the wet period than in the dry period water quality and health risk assessments indicated that the water quality in this river had no extensive heavy metal pollution and the dtecs were below the hazard level correlation analysis and principal component analysis identified that al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr were mainly derived from natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn were dominated by anthropogenic sources carbonate and urban land distributions control the dtecs of river waters indicated by correlations of dtecs with coverage of carbonate and urban land within the draining area further analyses found that for mono lithological sub catchments with low urban land coverage the water samples from carbonate catchments had a higher concentration of co cr ni u mo li and sr and a lower concentration of ga pb sb cu as rb v mn zn al and ba than the water samples from silicate catchments these differences would be changed with the increasing of urban land coverage in mono lithological sub catchments suggesting that the impacts of urban land on dtes are not limited to as and rb indicated by correlation analyses seasonal changes in contents of dtes and in their correlations with analyzed factors reflect the regulations of seasonal hydrologic conditions this study highlights that the dtecs of river waters in the chishui river basin a region with low level of urbanization are significantly related to urban land distribution future urban planning and watershed management need consider the impacts of urbanization on the dtes and water quality in rivers in karst areas keywords karst river dissolved trace element hydrologic condition water quality health risk 1 introduction the rapid process of urbanization and the intensification of agricultural activities worldwide have led to water pollution notably heavy metal pollution in the aquatic environment krishna et al 2009 lemly 1996 liu et al 2013 pekey et al 2004 dissolved trace elements dtes are essential for natural ecosystems and human health for example al concentrations are related to the abundance of fish in rivers gaillardet et al 2003 se from industrial and agricultural sources have been found to poison fish and wildlife lemly 1996 as in groundwater put at least 100 million people at risk for cancer and other as related diseases bhattacharya et al 2007 natural sources of dtes in river waters include bedrock weathering volcanism and atmospheric precipitation etc most of which are controlled by geology gaillardet et al 2003 gonneea et al 2014 krishna et al 2009 anthropogenic sources include mining mineral processing metal smelting and waste incineration etc huang et al 2007 li and zhang 2010b liu et al 2013 meng et al 2016 trace metals tes tend to be trapped in the aquatic environment and accumulated in sediments thus threatening the aquatic ecosystems pekey et al 2004 zeng and han 2020 zeng et al 2020 some tes e g cu and zn are considered to be biological micronutrients necessary for normal growth and function of organisms in contrast some tes e g as cd hg pb se and sn are considered harmful to human health and aquatic life bhattacharya et al 2007 lemly 1996 pekey et al 2004 humans have exploited many tes from natural accumulation sites and used them and they are thus an indicator that is highly sensitive to human impacts gaillardet et al 2003 globally karst landscapes cover roughly 20 of ice free land hartmann and moosdorf 2012 and supply potable water for 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2013 due to the rapid chemical weathering rate carbonate rocks have been affecting the hydrochemical characteristics of many rivers in the world gaillardet et al 1999 additionally for this reason heavy metal elements are rapidly released as the carbonate weathering and then migrate and enrich into the environment through precipitation adsorption and complexation wu et al 2020 carbonate diagenesis can lead to a higher iron oxide content making cr ni cu and zn more easily enriched in sediments and soils in carbonate watersheds by stronger metal adsorption qu et al 2020 therefore although the contents of most of the heavy metals in carbonate bedrock are relatively low carbonate weathering is one of the major causes of metal pollution in karst areas in southwestern china qu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 previous studies have found that some dtes are mainly derived from silicates and evaporites gaillardet et al 2003 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2015 and showed that the contents of some dtes are closely related to carbonate minerals e g sr and u chen et al 2020 gonneea et al 2014 han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 palmer and edmond 1993 but there are still few systematic studies of dtes for karst dominated watersheds karst terrains are highly susceptible to anthropogenic and climatic changes sullivan et al 2019 substantial research documented that in addition to lithology land use also significantly affects the hydrochemistry of karst rivers jiang et al 2008 xu et al 2020 yue et al 2019 in addition the major ion geochemistry of karst river waters is closely related to the hydrologic condition which is regulated by climate change zhong et al 2017 research on the xijiang river found that the concentrations of some dtes e g mn zn and pb showed significant seasonal variations which are significantly affected by the monsoon climate liu et al 2017 more than half of the flux of dtes occurs in the high flow season in the pearl river which is mainly controlled by the high discharge zeng et al 2019 guizhou province the central karst region of southwestern china was one of the provinces with the fastest gross domestic product gdp growth rate in china in 2019 and is in the process of rapid urbanization the impacts of urbanization on dissolved trace element concentrations dtecs in this karst region are not yet well known for better water quality it is necessary to explore the responses of dtes in karst river waters to the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic factors gonneea et al 2014 liu et al 2017 park et al 2005 sullivan et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 so far geochemical characteristics of dtes and their contamination to the aquatic environment have been studied in many watersheds in china meng et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 as the third largest river in terms of length 6300 km in the world and the largest river in china many studies have been conducted to investigate tes of river waters and sediments in the yangtze river basin li and zhang 2010b qu et al 2019 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2009 zeng et al 2015 chishui river is the only undammed first level tributary in the yangtze river basin and an important rare fish reserve so it has unique ecological status in china chi et al 2017 jiang et al 2011 chishui river basin has abundant natural resources especially the reserves of coal and pyrite ren et al 2009 with the development of economy the environmental protection in this basin is facing unprecedented pressure moreover the chishui river flows through the karst terrains so that severe soil erosion has resulted in a fragile ecological environment chishui river basin is famous for its developed liquor industry and high aquatic biodiversity and has nearly 10 million people living in there chi et al 2017 ren et al 2009 for these reasons the importance of water quality for regional drinking water safety and the economic development in this basin is self evident based on the above considerations our study is based on the quantitative analyses of lithology and land use to investigate the eighteen selected dtes al as ba co cr cu ga li mn mo ni pb rb sb sr u v and zn of river waters in the chishui river basin southwestern china in this investigation the aims are to 1 investigate the contents and seasonal spatial variations of dtes and to evaluate water quality and health risks through the water quality index wqi and hazard quotient index hq hi respectively 2 explore the possible sources of eighteen selected dtes using multivariate statistical analyses 3 identify the main controlling factors of dtecs the results can provide important information for local water quality protection and can help to better understand the geochemical behaviour of dtes and their response to the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors in the context of global change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the chishui river is located in the transitional areas between yunnan kweichow plateau and sichuan basin in southwestern china and encompasses a basin area of approximately 18852 km2 fig 1 a and b most of this basin is occupied by mountainous or hills and the river flows from southwest to the north into the yangtze river this basin is situated in the subtropical region and the annual average temperature and precipitation range from 11 to 13 c and 800 to 1200 mm respectively zhai and qiu 2011 according to the lithological map data fig 1a this basin contains mostly carbonate sedimentary rocks 44 63 that are mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches followed by siliciclastic sedimentary rocks 24 54 that are primarily distributed in the lower reaches other rocks within this basin are mixed sedimentary rocks 30 09 and basic volcanic rocks 0 74 in 2017 the coverage of urban land cropland grassland and forest in this basin were 1 22 19 64 4 97 and 73 37 respectively fig 1b xu et al 2020 the local economy in this basin is relatively underdeveloped and the level of urbanization is relatively low ren et al 2009 2 2 water sampling and analyses two sampling campaigns from 13 sampling sites in mainstream and 25 sampling sites in tributaries were conducted in the chishui river basin representing the setting of two hydrological periods of the wet season july in 2017 and the dry season january in 2018 the distribution of sampling sites was given in fig 1 the water temperature wt ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multi parameter meter wtw multi 3630 ids germany all the water samples were collected at a depth of approximately 15 cm and filtered through 0 45 µm millipore membrane filters after collection and then acidified to ph 2 using ultra purified hno3 the water samples were sealed in acid washed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and stored at 4 c ca2 mg2 na k and si were determined by an

agilent 7700 yokogawa japan under standard operating conditions the analytical results were in good agreement with the recommended values presenting variations of 5 or less the measurements were performed at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences guiyang 2 3 statistical analyses the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess the normal distribution of data table 1 the seasonal variations in dtecs were tested by the kruskal wallis test pearson correlation analysis ca was employed to examine the correlations between different dtes and their correlations with potential controlling variables the possible sources of the selected dtes were investigated by principal component analysis pca kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were used to check the suitability of the data for pca pca using a smaller set of newly independent uncorrelated variables explains the variances of a large set of original variables and the significant principal components pcs are the linear combinations of the original variables before implementing the pca the dataset was first normalized by z score normalization to avoid the differences in the order of magnitude of the original variables pca of the normalized dataset extracted the pcs and retained the pcs with the eigenvalues 1 the statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software package spss 22 0 for windows 2 4 quantitative analyses of controlling factors to analyze the potential controlling factors for dtes 20 separate sub catchments were selected from the chishui river basin fig 1a and b table 2 we quantified the potential controlling variables for dtes of the sub catchments from two aspects lithology and land use table 2 to quantify the lithological composition of the sub catchments the digital geological map was simplified into four categories carbonate sedimentary rock siliciclastic sedimentary rock mixed sedimentary rock the combination of carbonate sedimentary rocks and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and basic volcanic rock data is sourced from china geological survey china the basic volcanic rock was not included in further analyses due to its low coverage the detailed information about the classification system is available at hartmann and moosdorf 2012 land use within this basin was classed into cropland forest grassland water body urban land and unused land fig 1b the water body and unused land were not included in further analyses we calculated the percent coverage of each of the three lithological categories and four land use types for each sub catchment all the spatial data were processed by arcgis version 10 2 esri company redlands california usa 2 5 water quality and health risk assessment methods the water quality index wqi is defined as a rate that reflects the composited impact of different water quality parameter variables and it can evaluate water quality more comprehensively xiao et al 2014 the wqi is calculated as follows eq 1 1 wqi w i c i s i 100 where wi wi wi which is the relative weight wi represents the weight of the element based on its relative importance for human health and drinking water sener et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2019 wi is the sum of the weights of all elements the weight of each dte is shown in table 3 ci represents each measured dtec of each water sample and si represents the standard for chinese drinking water ministry of health 2006 due to lacking the standards co ga li rb sr and v were not included in the wqi analyses five water quality classifications are divided base on the calculated wqi values excellent water wqi 0 50 good water wqi 50 100 poor water wqi 100 200 very poor water wqi 200 300 undrinkable water wqi 300 meng et al 2016 direct ingestion and dermal absorption through exposed skin are usually considered to be the two main exposure pathways of tes for human beings li and zhang 2010a usepa

previous studies de miguel et al 2007 usepa 2004 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2009 xiao et al 2019 hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi are used to evaluate health risks caused by dtes in aquatic ecosystems li and zhang 2010a meng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 hq is the ratio between the exposure through individual pathways and the reference dose rfd and is used to evaluate the potential non carcinogenic risk wang et al 2017 hi is the sum of the hqs for each dte from two pathways and is used to assess the total potential non carcinogenic risk the hq and hi are calculated as follows wang et al 2017 4 hq add rfd 5 hi hq ingestion hq dermal 6 rf d dermal rfd absg where rfd is the reference dose absg is the gastrointestinal absorption factor dimensionless rfddermal and rfdingestion are shown in table 4 if the hq is 1 non carcinogenic effects should be concerned if the hi is 1 the possibility of harm to human health should be considered if the hq and hi are 1 there are no deleterious effects li and zhang 2010a usepa 2004 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 3 results 3 1 characteristics of dissolved trace elements table 1 shows the statistics of dtes and physic chemical parameters including al as ba co cr cu ga li mn mo ni pb rb sb sr u v zn wt ph and ec over the two periods at 38 sampling sites in the chishui river basin the kolmogorov smirnov test results indicate that the data of cr and wt were normally distributed during the wet season and the data of ph were normally distributed in both the wet and dry seasons value 0 1 to compare dispersion between different dte datasets with different orders of magnitude the coefficient of variation cv was used instead of the standard deviation sd the kolmogorov smirnov test results and sd and cv values indicate that the mean concentration of most of the dtes had been affected by the outliers hence the median concentration rather than mean concentration for dtes was used in our analyses and to compare with the limited values in the guidelines and the mean dtecs of other river waters although which are generally given as arithmetic means the river waters had slightly alkaline characteristics and the median ph values were 8 2 and 8 5 during the wet and dry seasons respectively table 1 the median ec value in the wet period 530 μs cm 1 was higher than that in the dry period 424 μs cm 1 the median water temperature wt values were 27 3 and 10 2 in the wet and dry periods respectively the median concentrations of eighteen dtes follow increasing sequence of pb 0 03 μg l 1 ga 0 03 μg l 1 co

concentration levels between dtes in the two seasons are almost constant in table 3 we listed the mean dtecs of other rivers and the drinking water standards of tes the median dtecs of the chishui river basin were far lower than those of the yangtze river xiangjiang river and huaihe river wang et al 2017 wang et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 and lower than those of the hanjiang river except for sr li and zhang 2010b and pearl river except for ba zeng et al 2019 whereas the median concentrations of al ba li mo sb sr u v and zn of the chishui river basin were higher than the mean concentrations of those of the world rivers gaillardet et al 2003 compared with the chinese drinking water standards ministry of health 2006 and world health organization who standards who 2011 the contents of most of the dtes of the chishui river basin were far below the standard values the al concentration of water samples from sites t20 gulin river and t23 datong river and the mn concentration of water sample from site t20 gulin river in the wet season were higher than the chinese drinking water standard values al and mn thus can be considered as the main elements polluting the water quality in the chishui river basin 3 2 seasonal spatial variations of dissolved trace elements the results of kruskal wallis test demonstrate that the contents of as cu ga pb rb v and zn had significant seasonal variations p 0 05 while the seasonal variations in ba co cr li mn ni sr and u were not significant table 1 except for cr ni sr and u the median concentrations of other dtes were higher in the wet season than in the dry season and the median concentrations of cu ga pb v and zn were significantly higher p 0 01 the spatial variations in dtecs from upstream to downstream during the two periods are shown in fig 3 a r in the mainstream ba and li generally exhibited an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in contrast cr and rb showed a decreasing trend ba and zn had a higher concentration in the sites m7 and m9 which are close to the local towns with liquor factories compared the median concentrations of dtes of water samples from tributaries the water samples from sites t5 weixin river t7 tongche river t15 yanjin river t20 gulin river and t23 datong river had the outliers such as al ba li mn and zn concentrations due to most of these tributaries draining through urban areas we speculate that these outliers are related to the impacts of human activities dtecs of river waters in the mainstream would be affected by the mixing of tributary river waters thus resulting in the higher dtecs of waters in the mainstream being often observed near the outliers of the tributaries 4 discussion 4 1 water quality and health risk assessments water quality parameters were compared with the chinese drinking water standards ministry of health 2006 the concentration standard value and relative weight of each te wi table 3 were used to calculate the wqi values eq 1 and the seasonal spatial variations in wqi values are shown in fig 3s in this study the wqi values ranged from 1 7 to 33 1 and 0 9 to 15 7 during the wet and dry periods respectively water samples in the wet season from sites t15 yanjin river t20 gulin river and t23 datong river had a relatively larger wqi value 10 which were 11 5 33 1 and 10 5 respectively in the dry season only sample from site t20 gulin river had a relatively larger wqi value that was 15 7 the relatively larger wqi values of samples from site t20 gulin river in the two seasons may be related to the regional mineral distribution in gulin county ren et al 2009 the wqi values calculated using the mean and median dtec in the wet period were 4 8 and 3 6 respectively while those in the dry period were 2 3 and 1 6 respectively indicating that the water quality during the dry season was better overall in the two periods only four water samples had a wqi value of exceeding 10 therefore according to the classifications for wqi all of the water samples can be considered to have an excellent water quality wqi values are 50 these results indicate that from the perspective of assessments of dtes the natural waters within the chishui river basin are suitable for drinking without extensive heavy metal pollution the hq and hi values for dtes by ingestion and dermal pathways were calculated and the results are shown in table 4 the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for all of the dtes were smaller than 1 indicating that the hazards posed by these elements are limited that the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for children were larger than those for adults can be observed suggesting that children are more vulnerable when they are exposed to the environment of tes table 4 since the median concentrations of most of the dtes in the wet season were higher the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values were generally larger in the wet season than in the dry season resulting in the different orders of hq and hi values for dtes in the two seasons the as sr u and v had a larger hq and hi values in the two seasons indicating that they were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk for the entire basin in the two seasons and the ingestion absorption was the primary exposure pathway compared the results of hqingestion hqdermal and hi values calculated by the highest concentration of each dte in the two sampling campaigns table 4 the hqingestion values for co for adults and children were largest followed by mn as v and ba and the hqdermal values for cr for adults and children were largest followed by v mn sb and co these results show that the health threat posed by tes by the ingestion absorption is different from that by the dermal absorption additionally his values for co for both adults and children were largest and co thus was the largest contributor to non carcinogenic concern followed by mn v cr as and ba in contrast the relatively fewer contributors were al cu li mo ni pb sb sr u and zn table 4 shows that the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for some of the dtes were relatively close to 1 e g the values for as ba co cr mn and v therefore we can conclude that these tes were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk in some of the sampled rivers among the selected elements the evaluation results show that although there are health risks caused by some of the dtes in the chishui river basin there is no extensive heavy metal pollution which is consistent with the results of wqi previous studies have found the harmful effects of tes on human health for example the ingestion of as can lead to chronic health disorders bhattacharya et al 2007 and co may cause allergic dermatitis rhinitis and asthma lauwerys and lison 1994 therefore tes from anthropogenic sources should be prevented from entering the chishui river to protect its excellent water quality 4 2 possible sources of dissolved trace elements the correlation matrix demonstrates that there are strong positive correlations between the internal dtes of two groups of dtes co cu li mn and ni and as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn in both the wet and dry seasons fig 4 indicating that they might have similar sources or chemical behaviours wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo values for dtes in the wet and dry seasons were 0 629 and 0 633 respectively and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was 0 000 indicating that the data of dtes are suitable for pca five and four pcs were extracted from dtes in the wet and dry periods respectively and the eigenvalues variance and communalities are shown in table 5 in the wet season pc1 was dominated by al co cu li mn ni and sr with 31 14 of the total variance pc2 was dominated by as ba ga pb v and zn with 20 64 of the total variance pc3 explained 16 3 of the total variance that was contributed primarily by mo sb and u pc4 explained 8 6 of the total variance that was contributed primarily by cr and rb five pcs with the eigenvalues 1 totally accounted for 84 15 of the total variance in the dry season pc1 explained 37 33 of the total variance with high loadings of as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn pc2 was dominated by co cu li mn and ni with 32 37 of the total variance pc3 and pc4 were dominated by u with 9 26 of the total variance and by sr with 8 42 of the total variance respectively four pcs with the eigenvalues 1 totally accounted for 87 38 of the total variance the first three pcs for dtes in the two seasons are shown in fig 5 although there are differences in the pca results for data of dtes during the two seasons the al co cu li mn and ni and the as ba ga pb v and zn tend to dominate similar pcs respectively and there is also a strong positive correlation between these elements among the eighteen tes al is a crustal element and a key component of soils kumar et al 2001 neal et al 2006 co cu mn and ni have natural sources such as weathering of parent materials and subsequent pedogenesis due to alluvial deposits huang et al 2007 li et al 2009 li and zhang 2010b xiao et al 2019 dissolved li has been found to be primarily derived from silicates and evaporates in some river studies ma et al 2020 wang et al 2015 u concentrations are mostly determined by the dissolution of limestone palmer and edmond 1993 sr is mainly derived from geological materials and is closely related to the calcite presenting in the bedrock neal et al 2006 the high sr concentrations of river waters in our study can be attributed to the wide distribution of carbonate rocks in the karst river basin han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 based on the pca results and the above analyses the pc1 and pc3 in the wet season and the pc2 pc3 and pc4 in the dry season can be considered dominated by natural sources or processes the major sources of as pb and v are the emissions from urban and industrial activities such as energy production mining metal smelting and refining huang et al 2007 li and zhang 2010b as and pb are raw materials for electronics glass and ceramics etc and have been widely used in the electroplating industry chemical industry and electronics industry etc zeng et al 2015 ba and cr are associated with anthropogenic and geogenic sources krishna et al 2009 zn may be derived from anthropogenic activities krishna et al 2009 the samples with outliers of zn concentration in our study were collected from sites t5 weixin river and t15 yanjin river and the sub catchments where the two sites are located have a higher urban land coverage table 2 the urban land also has a significantly positive correlation with as and rb fig 6 the as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn had a high loading in the same pcs in our study pc2 and pc4 in the wet season and pc1 in the dry season indicating that they were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities such as mining urban sewage discharge and industrial emissions overall statistical analysis results suggest that al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr can be considered to be dominated by natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn can be considered to be mainly derived from anthropogenic sources 4 3 controlling factors for dissolved trace elements dtes had correlations with the analyzed variables fig 6 in the wet period mo sr and u had a positive correlation with carbonate rocks and as ga pb and v were positively correlated with siliciclastic rocks however we consider that the positive correlations of these dtes with siliciclastic rocks in the sub catchments do not necessarily mean that they are mainly controlled by siliciclastic rocks in the entire basin since they have been identified from anthropogenic sources as discussed in section 4 2 rather it may indicate that these elements were impacted by carbonate in a way that limits their concentrations in water this can be further confirmed by the significantly negative correlations between these dtes and carbonate rocks in the dry season fewer dtes had a correlation with the distribution of carbonate rocks probably because of the decline in hydrologic connectivity within each sub catchment urban land also had an impact on the dtecs in the chishui river basin indicated by the significantly positive correlations of as and rb concentrations with urban land coverage p 0 01 fig 6 this indicates that urbanization has a negative impact on river water quality which is consistent with previous studies li and zhang 2011 park et al 2005 the impacts of carbonate rocks on dtecs can be further confirmed by the comparison of dtecs between carbonate dominated catchments the coverage of carbonate rocks exceeds 80 including c09 c10 c12 c14 and t12 the total outlet of catchments c09 and c10 and silicate dominated catchments the coverage of siliciclastic rocks exceeds 80 including c17 c18 and c19 in the chishui river basin table 2 these selected catchments all also had a low urban land coverage 0 25 1 19 and 0 09 0 52 in the carbonate and silicate dominated catchments respectively indicating that these catchments are rarely disturbed by human activities we assumed that these catchments are mono lithological catchments and the dtes of river waters in these catchments are mainly derived from natural sources and affected by natural processes water samples including the samples from these mono lithological catchments were plotted with na normalized molar ratios in fig 7 a and the water samples in the plot are located between the carbonate and silicate end members a good correlation between ca na and sr na molar ratios r2 0 7 can be observed in fig 7b this correlation supports the mixing between the weathering products of carbonates high ca na and sr na molar ratios and silicates low ca na and sr na molar ratios gaillardet et al 1999 the distributions of the water samples from mono lithological catchments in the plots fig 7a and b correspond with the rock types of the mono lithological catchments additionally the ca and mg concentrations of water samples from carbonate catchments averaging at 62 75 8 72 mg l 1 and 14 97 5 34 mg l 1 respectively are more than twice the ca and mg concentrations of those from silicate catchments averaging at 22 06 9 14 mg l 1 and 2 80 1 89 mg l 1 respectively respectively fig 8 these indicate that in the carbonate dominated and silicate dominated catchments there is indeed a significant difference in weathering products produced by weathering of the two types of rocks we further found that the water samples from carbonate catchments had a higher co cr ni u mo li and sr concentrations and a lower ga pb sb cu as rb v mn zn al and ba concentrations than the water samples from silicate catchments fig 8 which may be attributed to the different te contents in carbonate and silicate bedrock and the inhibition of migration of dtes in carbonate watersheds holmström et al 1999 qu et al 2020 acidic water bodies caused by weathering of sulfide deposit or factory sewage with high contents of dtes can be quickly neutralized by limestone in carbonate watersheds and dtes transported by rivers will soon be enriched within the solid particles holmström et al 1999 qu et al 2020 in addition the inhibition of elemental migration may be due to the adsorption of sediments and the precipitation and complexation of heavy metals qu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 few studies have compared the dtecs for the mono lithological catchments however according to our results the dtes except cr having a higher concentration in carbonate catchments were mainly derived from natural sources and carbonate weathering may be the major source the finding that pb cu and zn contents of water samples from carbonate catchments are lower than those from silicate catchments is consistent with the report of qu et al 2020 and the finding that sr and u are mainly derived from carbonate weathering is consistent with many previous studies gonneea et al 2014 han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 palmer and edmond 1993 the lower dtecs in carbonate catchments and the negative correlations between dtecs and distribution of carbonate rocks within catchment may also be related to the hydrochemical characteristics of karst rivers for example the ph values of river waters draining carbonate areas are usually higher than those draining silicate areas and a strong alkaline environment may promote the precipitation of certain elements e g zn and cd wu et al 2020 the difference in dom content of river waters may also result in distinct geochemical behaviours of aquatic tes sankar et al 2019 in addition to lithology land use may be another control on riverine dtes when the contents of most of the dtes of water samples from above selected catchments were significantly lower than those from catchments with high urban land coverage e g c04 c13 and c16 reflecting that the impacts of human activities in the urban region on dtes are not limited to as and rb indicated by above ca our results show that mo sr and u and as ga pb and v were positively correlated to cropland and forest coverage respectively it is difficult to judge the relationships between dtecs with cropland and forest due to the overlapped distribution of lithology and land use e g the cropland and forest are mainly distributed over carbonate and silicate rocks in the chishui river basin fig 1a and b respectively we compared the dtecs in carbonate catchment with distinct land use c09 c10 c12 and c14 and the results show that there is no obvious difference between cropland dominated and forest dominated catchments the impacts of vegetation on riverine dtecs are also related to the root respiration rate of the plant which is a major driver of rock weathering romero mujalli et al 2018 thereafter it is reasonable to conclude that the impacts of cropland and forest on dtecs in the chishui river systems may be negligible precipitation and hydrology play an important role in controlling seasonal variations in dtecs in stream waters li and zhang 2010a sankar et al 2019 during the rainy season riverine solutes may be diluted but non point source pollutants mining waste and geological materials from weathering may increase li and zhang 2010a olı as et al 2004 the intensity and rates of chemical weathering depend upon land temperature precipitation hydrology and further factors chen et al 2020 gaillardet et al 1999 ma et al 2020 romero mujalli et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 increased discharge in the rainy season accelerates the weathering rate of rocks by increasing the reactive mineral surface area which induces chemostatic behaviour of riverine solutes derived from weathering zhong et al 2017 the release of tes contained in carbonate rocks therefore increase as the accelerated weathering rate additionally under high discharge conditions a shift towards fast near surface flow paths with reduced water rock interaction time can cause dilution which may alter the concentrations of solutes produced by different rock weathering torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 the seasonal variations in contents of dtes and in their correlations with analyzed variables in the chishui river basin have been observed most of the dtes had a higher median concentration in the wet season in our study especially cu ga pb v and zn since these elements were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources discussed in section 4 2 the seasonal variations in these elements can be attributed to the increased discharge from anthropogenic activities in the wet season the lower median concentrations of cr ni sr and u can be attributed to the dilution at high runoff because most of these elements were mainly derived from rock weathering these analyses indicate that hydrologic seasonality also plays an important role in regulating riverine dtecs which is consistent with the results of previous studies li and zhang 2011 zhu et al 2018 however we are not able to do detailed analysis due to the lack of hydrologic data in the future our approach will be better constrained if possible better coverage of temporal samples 5 conclusions in this study eighteen dtes were analyzed to investigate their contents and seasonal spatial variations and to evaluate the water quality and health risks in terms of dtecs the sources and controlling factors of dtes were identified using statistical analysis methods the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 dtecs were at a relatively low level in the chishui river basin only al and mn concentrations of some of the water samples in the wet season were higher than the values of chinese drinking water standard and the concentrations of most of the dtes were far below the standard values the results of the water quality assessments indicated that all the water samples could be considered to have an excellent water quality and no extensive heavy metal pollution health risk assessments indicated that the as sr u and v were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk for the entire basin in the two seasons and the as ba co cr mn and v were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk in some of the tributaries 2 dtecs showed significant seasonal spatial variations the concentrations of most of the dtes were higher in the wet season than in the dry season except for ba li cr and rb the concentrations of most of the dtes had no regular trends in space al ba li mn and zn concentrations had the outliers in tributaries of sub catchments with relatively higher urban land coverage 3 pca identified five pcs explaining 84 15 of the total variance and four pcs explaining 87 38 of the total variance in the wet and dry seasons respectively from the perspective of the entire basin al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr were mainly derived from natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources 4 carbonate plays an important role in controlling the dtecs in karst rivers by providing the weathering materials containing some tes e g sr and u and by inhibiting the migration of some tes the distribution of urban land in the chishui river basin is another major control on dtecs especially on concentrations of as and rb which was indicated by the significantly positive correlations p 0 01 between the two elements and urban land coverage 5 the hydrologic seasonality induced by precipitation also seems to be a regulator of dtecs in the chishui river system this was indicated by the seasonal variations in dtecs and the difference in the impacts of lithology and land use on dtecs in the two seasons we acknowledge that our results may be biased due to the lack of analyses of sediment and rock samples and sparse coverage of samples over space and time our results do show that carbonate and urban land play a significant role in controlling riverine dtecs which need to be well documented studies on the geochemical behaviours of tes in both waters and sediments in rivers draining mono lithological catchments with various urban land coverages and monitoring of river water quality with a high temporal resolution are needed urgently to enhance the understanding of impacts of natural lithology and hydrology processes and urban land distribution on the riverine dtes which can facilitate river water quality protection in the context of

5076,as an important factor affecting water quality dissolved trace element dte is not well studied in the karst region here eighteen dtes were analyzed to investigate their contents seasonal spatial variations sources and controlling factors and to evaluate water quality and health risks in a karst river system chishui river southwestern china the results showed that dissolved trace element concentrations dtecs in this river were at a relatively low level compared with other chinese rivers except for cr ni sr and u other dtes had a higher median concentration in the wet period than in the dry period water quality and health risk assessments indicated that the water quality in this river had no extensive heavy metal pollution and the dtecs were below the hazard level correlation analysis and principal component analysis identified that al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr were mainly derived from natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn were dominated by anthropogenic sources carbonate and urban land distributions control the dtecs of river waters indicated by correlations of dtecs with coverage of carbonate and urban land within the draining area further analyses found that for mono lithological sub catchments with low urban land coverage the water samples from carbonate catchments had a higher concentration of co cr ni u mo li and sr and a lower concentration of ga pb sb cu as rb v mn zn al and ba than the water samples from silicate catchments these differences would be changed with the increasing of urban land coverage in mono lithological sub catchments suggesting that the impacts of urban land on dtes are not limited to as and rb indicated by correlation analyses seasonal changes in contents of dtes and in their correlations with analyzed factors reflect the regulations of seasonal hydrologic conditions this study highlights that the dtecs of river waters in the chishui river basin a region with low level of urbanization are significantly related to urban land distribution future urban planning and watershed management need consider the impacts of urbanization on the dtes and water quality in rivers in karst areas keywords karst river dissolved trace element hydrologic condition water quality health risk 1 introduction the rapid process of urbanization and the intensification of agricultural activities worldwide have led to water pollution notably heavy metal pollution in the aquatic environment krishna et al 2009 lemly 1996 liu et al 2013 pekey et al 2004 dissolved trace elements dtes are essential for natural ecosystems and human health for example al concentrations are related to the abundance of fish in rivers gaillardet et al 2003 se from industrial and agricultural sources have been found to poison fish and wildlife lemly 1996 as in groundwater put at least 100 million people at risk for cancer and other as related diseases bhattacharya et al 2007 natural sources of dtes in river waters include bedrock weathering volcanism and atmospheric precipitation etc most of which are controlled by geology gaillardet et al 2003 gonneea et al 2014 krishna et al 2009 anthropogenic sources include mining mineral processing metal smelting and waste incineration etc huang et al 2007 li and zhang 2010b liu et al 2013 meng et al 2016 trace metals tes tend to be trapped in the aquatic environment and accumulated in sediments thus threatening the aquatic ecosystems pekey et al 2004 zeng and han 2020 zeng et al 2020 some tes e g cu and zn are considered to be biological micronutrients necessary for normal growth and function of organisms in contrast some tes e g as cd hg pb se and sn are considered harmful to human health and aquatic life bhattacharya et al 2007 lemly 1996 pekey et al 2004 humans have exploited many tes from natural accumulation sites and used them and they are thus an indicator that is highly sensitive to human impacts gaillardet et al 2003 globally karst landscapes cover roughly 20 of ice free land hartmann and moosdorf 2012 and supply potable water for 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2013 due to the rapid chemical weathering rate carbonate rocks have been affecting the hydrochemical characteristics of many rivers in the world gaillardet et al 1999 additionally for this reason heavy metal elements are rapidly released as the carbonate weathering and then migrate and enrich into the environment through precipitation adsorption and complexation wu et al 2020 carbonate diagenesis can lead to a higher iron oxide content making cr ni cu and zn more easily enriched in sediments and soils in carbonate watersheds by stronger metal adsorption qu et al 2020 therefore although the contents of most of the heavy metals in carbonate bedrock are relatively low carbonate weathering is one of the major causes of metal pollution in karst areas in southwestern china qu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 previous studies have found that some dtes are mainly derived from silicates and evaporites gaillardet et al 2003 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2015 and showed that the contents of some dtes are closely related to carbonate minerals e g sr and u chen et al 2020 gonneea et al 2014 han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 palmer and edmond 1993 but there are still few systematic studies of dtes for karst dominated watersheds karst terrains are highly susceptible to anthropogenic and climatic changes sullivan et al 2019 substantial research documented that in addition to lithology land use also significantly affects the hydrochemistry of karst rivers jiang et al 2008 xu et al 2020 yue et al 2019 in addition the major ion geochemistry of karst river waters is closely related to the hydrologic condition which is regulated by climate change zhong et al 2017 research on the xijiang river found that the concentrations of some dtes e g mn zn and pb showed significant seasonal variations which are significantly affected by the monsoon climate liu et al 2017 more than half of the flux of dtes occurs in the high flow season in the pearl river which is mainly controlled by the high discharge zeng et al 2019 guizhou province the central karst region of southwestern china was one of the provinces with the fastest gross domestic product gdp growth rate in china in 2019 and is in the process of rapid urbanization the impacts of urbanization on dissolved trace element concentrations dtecs in this karst region are not yet well known for better water quality it is necessary to explore the responses of dtes in karst river waters to the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic factors gonneea et al 2014 liu et al 2017 park et al 2005 sullivan et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 so far geochemical characteristics of dtes and their contamination to the aquatic environment have been studied in many watersheds in china meng et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 as the third largest river in terms of length 6300 km in the world and the largest river in china many studies have been conducted to investigate tes of river waters and sediments in the yangtze river basin li and zhang 2010b qu et al 2019 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2009 zeng et al 2015 chishui river is the only undammed first level tributary in the yangtze river basin and an important rare fish reserve so it has unique ecological status in china chi et al 2017 jiang et al 2011 chishui river basin has abundant natural resources especially the reserves of coal and pyrite ren et al 2009 with the development of economy the environmental protection in this basin is facing unprecedented pressure moreover the chishui river flows through the karst terrains so that severe soil erosion has resulted in a fragile ecological environment chishui river basin is famous for its developed liquor industry and high aquatic biodiversity and has nearly 10 million people living in there chi et al 2017 ren et al 2009 for these reasons the importance of water quality for regional drinking water safety and the economic development in this basin is self evident based on the above considerations our study is based on the quantitative analyses of lithology and land use to investigate the eighteen selected dtes al as ba co cr cu ga li mn mo ni pb rb sb sr u v and zn of river waters in the chishui river basin southwestern china in this investigation the aims are to 1 investigate the contents and seasonal spatial variations of dtes and to evaluate water quality and health risks through the water quality index wqi and hazard quotient index hq hi respectively 2 explore the possible sources of eighteen selected dtes using multivariate statistical analyses 3 identify the main controlling factors of dtecs the results can provide important information for local water quality protection and can help to better understand the geochemical behaviour of dtes and their response to the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors in the context of global change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the chishui river is located in the transitional areas between yunnan kweichow plateau and sichuan basin in southwestern china and encompasses a basin area of approximately 18852 km2 fig 1 a and b most of this basin is occupied by mountainous or hills and the river flows from southwest to the north into the yangtze river this basin is situated in the subtropical region and the annual average temperature and precipitation range from 11 to 13 c and 800 to 1200 mm respectively zhai and qiu 2011 according to the lithological map data fig 1a this basin contains mostly carbonate sedimentary rocks 44 63 that are mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches followed by siliciclastic sedimentary rocks 24 54 that are primarily distributed in the lower reaches other rocks within this basin are mixed sedimentary rocks 30 09 and basic volcanic rocks 0 74 in 2017 the coverage of urban land cropland grassland and forest in this basin were 1 22 19 64 4 97 and 73 37 respectively fig 1b xu et al 2020 the local economy in this basin is relatively underdeveloped and the level of urbanization is relatively low ren et al 2009 2 2 water sampling and analyses two sampling campaigns from 13 sampling sites in mainstream and 25 sampling sites in tributaries were conducted in the chishui river basin representing the setting of two hydrological periods of the wet season july in 2017 and the dry season january in 2018 the distribution of sampling sites was given in fig 1 the water temperature wt ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multi parameter meter wtw multi 3630 ids germany all the water samples were collected at a depth of approximately 15 cm and filtered through 0 45 µm millipore membrane filters after collection and then acidified to ph 2 using ultra purified hno3 the water samples were sealed in acid washed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and stored at 4 c ca2 mg2 na k and si were determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes vista mpx usa the concentrations of aluminium al arsenic as barium ba cobalt co chromium cr copper cu gallium ga lithium li manganese

agilent 7700 yokogawa japan under standard operating conditions the analytical results were in good agreement with the recommended values presenting variations of 5 or less the measurements were performed at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences guiyang 2 3 statistical analyses the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess the normal distribution of data table 1 the seasonal variations in dtecs were tested by the kruskal wallis test pearson correlation analysis ca was employed to examine the correlations between different dtes and their correlations with potential controlling variables the possible sources of the selected dtes were investigated by principal component analysis pca kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were used to check the suitability of the data for pca pca using a smaller set of newly independent uncorrelated variables explains the variances of a large set of original variables and the significant principal components pcs are the linear combinations of the original variables before implementing the pca the dataset was first normalized by z score normalization to avoid the differences in the order of magnitude of the original variables pca of the normalized dataset extracted the pcs and retained the pcs with the eigenvalues 1 the statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software package spss 22 0 for windows 2 4 quantitative analyses of controlling factors to analyze the potential controlling factors for dtes 20 separate sub catchments were selected from the chishui river basin fig 1a and b table 2 we quantified the potential controlling variables for dtes of the sub catchments from two aspects lithology and land use table 2 to quantify the lithological composition of the sub catchments the digital geological map was simplified into four categories carbonate sedimentary rock siliciclastic sedimentary rock mixed sedimentary rock the combination of carbonate sedimentary rocks and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and basic volcanic rock data is sourced from china geological survey china the basic volcanic rock was not included in further analyses due to its low coverage the detailed information about the classification system is available at hartmann and moosdorf 2012 land use within this basin was classed into cropland forest grassland water body urban land and unused land fig 1b the water body and unused land were not included in further analyses we calculated the percent coverage of each of the three lithological categories and four land use types for each sub catchment all the spatial data were processed by arcgis version 10 2 esri company redlands california usa 2 5 water quality and health risk assessment methods the water quality index wqi is defined as a rate that reflects the composited impact of different water quality parameter variables and it can evaluate water quality more comprehensively xiao et al 2014 the wqi is calculated as follows eq 1 1 wqi w i c i s i 100 where wi wi wi which is the relative weight wi represents the weight of the element based on its relative importance for human health and drinking water sener et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2019 wi is the sum of the weights of all elements the weight of each dte is shown in table 3 ci represents each measured dtec of each water sample and si represents the standard for chinese drinking water ministry of health 2006 due to lacking the standards co ga li rb sr and v were not included in the wqi analyses five water quality classifications are divided base on the calculated wqi values excellent water wqi 0 50 good water wqi 50 100 poor water wqi 100 200 very poor water wqi 200 300 undrinkable water wqi 300 meng et al 2016 direct ingestion and dermal absorption through exposed skin are usually considered to be the two main exposure pathways of tes for human beings li and zhang 2010a usepa

physic chemical parameters including al as ba co cr cu ga li mn mo ni pb rb sb sr u v zn wt ph and ec over the two periods at 38 sampling sites in the chishui river basin the kolmogorov smirnov test results indicate that the data of cr and wt were normally distributed during the wet season and the data of ph were normally distributed in both the wet and dry seasons value 0 1 to compare dispersion between different dte datasets with different orders of magnitude the coefficient of variation cv was used instead of the standard deviation sd the kolmogorov smirnov test results and sd and cv values indicate that the mean concentration of most of the dtes had been affected by the outliers hence the median concentration rather than mean concentration for dtes was used in our analyses and to compare with the limited values in the guidelines and the mean dtecs of other river waters although which are generally given as arithmetic means the river waters had slightly alkaline characteristics and the median ph values were 8 2 and 8 5 during the wet and dry seasons respectively table 1 the median ec value in the wet period 530 μs cm 1 was higher than that in the dry period 424 μs cm 1 the median water temperature wt values were 27 3 and 10 2 in the wet and dry periods respectively the median concentrations of eighteen dtes follow increasing sequence of pb 0 03 μg l 1 ga 0 03 μg l 1 co

concentration levels between dtes in the two seasons are almost constant in table 3 we listed the mean dtecs of other rivers and the drinking water standards of tes the median dtecs of the chishui river basin were far lower than those of the yangtze river xiangjiang river and huaihe river wang et al 2017 wang et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 and lower than those of the hanjiang river except for sr li and zhang 2010b and pearl river except for ba zeng et al 2019 whereas the median concentrations of al ba li mo sb sr u v and zn of the chishui river basin were higher than the mean concentrations of those of the world rivers gaillardet et al 2003 compared with the chinese drinking water standards ministry of health 2006 and world health organization who standards who 2011 the contents of most of the dtes of the chishui river basin were far below the standard values the al concentration of water samples from sites t20 gulin river and t23 datong river and the mn concentration of water sample from site t20 gulin river in the wet season were higher than the chinese drinking water standard values al and mn thus can be considered as the main elements polluting the water quality in the chishui river basin 3 2 seasonal spatial variations of dissolved trace elements the results of kruskal wallis test demonstrate that the contents of as cu ga pb rb v and zn had significant seasonal variations p 0 05 while the seasonal variations in ba co cr li mn ni sr and u were not significant table 1 except for cr ni sr and u the median concentrations of other dtes were higher in the wet season than in the dry season and the median concentrations of cu ga pb v and zn were significantly higher p 0 01 the spatial variations in dtecs from upstream to downstream during the two periods are shown in fig 3 a r in the mainstream ba and li generally exhibited an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in contrast cr and rb showed a decreasing trend ba and zn had a higher concentration in the sites m7 and m9 which are close to the local towns with liquor factories compared the median concentrations of dtes of water samples from tributaries the water samples from sites t5 weixin river t7 tongche river t15 yanjin river t20 gulin river and t23 datong river had the outliers such as al ba li mn and zn concentrations due to most of these tributaries draining through urban areas we speculate that these outliers are related to the impacts of human activities dtecs of river waters in the mainstream would be affected by the mixing of tributary river waters thus resulting in the higher dtecs of waters in the mainstream being often observed near the outliers of the tributaries 4 discussion 4 1 water quality and health risk assessments water quality parameters were compared with the chinese drinking water standards ministry of health 2006 the concentration standard value and relative weight of each te wi table 3 were used to calculate the wqi values eq 1 and the seasonal spatial variations in wqi values are shown in fig 3s in this study the wqi values ranged from 1 7 to 33 1 and 0 9 to 15 7 during the wet and dry periods respectively water samples in the wet season from sites t15 yanjin river t20 gulin river and t23 datong river had a relatively larger wqi value 10 which were 11 5 33 1 and 10 5 respectively in the dry season only sample from site t20 gulin river had a relatively larger wqi value that was 15 7 the relatively larger wqi values of samples from site t20 gulin river in the two seasons may be related to the regional mineral distribution in gulin county ren et al 2009 the wqi values calculated using the mean and median dtec in the wet period were 4 8 and 3 6 respectively while those in the dry period were 2 3 and 1 6 respectively indicating that the water quality during the dry season was better overall in the two periods only four water samples had a wqi value of exceeding 10 therefore according to the classifications for wqi all of the water samples can be considered to have an excellent water quality wqi values are 50 these results indicate that from the perspective of assessments of dtes the natural waters within the chishui river basin are suitable for drinking without extensive heavy metal pollution the hq and hi values for dtes by ingestion and dermal pathways were calculated and the results are shown in table 4 the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for all of the dtes were smaller than 1 indicating that the hazards posed by these elements are limited that the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for children were larger than those for adults can be observed suggesting that children are more vulnerable when they are exposed to the environment of tes table 4 since the median concentrations of most of the dtes in the wet season were higher the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values were generally larger in the wet season than in the dry season resulting in the different orders of hq and hi values for dtes in the two seasons the as sr u and v had a larger hq and hi values in the two seasons indicating that they were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk for the entire basin in the two seasons and the ingestion absorption was the primary exposure pathway compared the results of hqingestion hqdermal and hi values calculated by the highest concentration of each dte in the two sampling campaigns table 4 the hqingestion values for co for adults and children were largest followed by mn as v and ba and the hqdermal values for cr for adults and children were largest followed by v mn sb and co these results show that the health threat posed by tes by the ingestion absorption is different from that by the dermal absorption additionally his values for co for both adults and children were largest and co thus was the largest contributor to non carcinogenic concern followed by mn v cr as and ba in contrast the relatively fewer contributors were al cu li mo ni pb sb sr u and zn table 4 shows that the hqingestion hqdermal and hi values for some of the dtes were relatively close to 1 e g the values for as ba co cr mn and v therefore we can conclude that these tes were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk in some of the sampled rivers among the selected elements the evaluation results show that although there are health risks caused by some of the dtes in the chishui river basin there is no extensive heavy metal pollution which is consistent with the results of wqi previous studies have found the harmful effects of tes on human health for example the ingestion of as can lead to chronic health disorders bhattacharya et al 2007 and co may cause allergic dermatitis rhinitis and asthma lauwerys and lison 1994 therefore tes from anthropogenic sources should be prevented from entering the chishui river to protect its excellent water quality 4 2 possible sources of dissolved trace elements the correlation matrix demonstrates that there are strong positive correlations between the internal dtes of two groups of dtes co cu li mn and ni and as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn in both the wet and dry seasons fig 4 indicating that they might have similar sources or chemical behaviours wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo values for dtes in the wet and dry seasons were 0 629 and 0 633 respectively and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test was 0 000 indicating that the data of dtes are suitable for pca five and four pcs were extracted from dtes in the wet and dry periods respectively and the eigenvalues variance and communalities are shown in table 5 in the wet season pc1 was dominated by al co cu li mn ni and sr with 31 14 of the total variance pc2 was dominated by as ba ga pb v and zn with 20 64 of the total variance pc3 explained 16 3 of the total variance that was contributed primarily by mo sb and u pc4 explained 8 6 of the total variance that was contributed primarily by cr and rb five pcs with the eigenvalues 1 totally accounted for 84 15 of the total variance in the dry season pc1 explained 37 33 of the total variance with high loadings of as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn pc2 was dominated by co cu li mn and ni with 32 37 of the total variance pc3 and pc4 were dominated by u with 9 26 of the total variance and by sr with 8 42 of the total variance respectively four pcs with the eigenvalues 1 totally accounted for 87 38 of the total variance the first three pcs for dtes in the two seasons are shown in fig 5 although there are differences in the pca results for data of dtes during the two seasons the al co cu li mn and ni and the as ba ga pb v and zn tend to dominate similar pcs respectively and there is also a strong positive correlation between these elements among the eighteen tes al is a crustal element and a key component of soils kumar et al 2001 neal et al 2006 co cu mn and ni have natural sources such as weathering of parent materials and subsequent pedogenesis due to alluvial deposits huang et al 2007 li et al 2009 li and zhang 2010b xiao et al 2019 dissolved li has been found to be primarily derived from silicates and evaporates in some river studies ma et al 2020 wang et al 2015 u concentrations are mostly determined by the dissolution of limestone palmer and edmond 1993 sr is mainly derived from geological materials and is closely related to the calcite presenting in the bedrock neal et al 2006 the high sr concentrations of river waters in our study can be attributed to the wide distribution of carbonate rocks in the karst river basin han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 based on the pca results and the above analyses the pc1 and pc3 in the wet season and the pc2 pc3 and pc4 in the dry season can be considered dominated by natural sources or processes the major sources of as pb and v are the emissions from urban and industrial activities such as energy production mining metal smelting and refining huang et al 2007 li and zhang 2010b as and pb are raw materials for electronics glass and ceramics etc and have been widely used in the electroplating industry chemical industry and electronics industry etc zeng et al 2015 ba and cr are associated with anthropogenic and geogenic sources krishna et al 2009 zn may be derived from anthropogenic activities krishna et al 2009 the samples with outliers of zn concentration in our study were collected from sites t5 weixin river and t15 yanjin river and the sub catchments where the two sites are located have a higher urban land coverage table 2 the urban land also has a significantly positive correlation with as and rb fig 6 the as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn had a high loading in the same pcs in our study pc2 and pc4 in the wet season and pc1 in the dry season indicating that they were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities such as mining urban sewage discharge and industrial emissions overall statistical analysis results suggest that al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr can be considered to be dominated by natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn can be considered to be mainly derived from anthropogenic sources 4 3 controlling factors for dissolved trace elements dtes had correlations with the analyzed variables fig 6 in the wet period mo sr and u had a positive correlation with carbonate rocks and as ga pb and v were positively correlated with siliciclastic rocks however we consider that the positive correlations of these dtes with siliciclastic rocks in the sub catchments do not necessarily mean that they are mainly controlled by siliciclastic rocks in the entire basin since they have been identified from anthropogenic sources as discussed in section 4 2 rather it may indicate that these elements were impacted by carbonate in a way that limits their concentrations in water this can be further confirmed by the significantly negative correlations between these dtes and carbonate rocks in the dry season fewer dtes had a correlation with the distribution of carbonate rocks probably because of the decline in hydrologic connectivity within each sub catchment urban land also had an impact on the dtecs in the chishui river basin indicated by the significantly positive correlations of as and rb concentrations with urban land coverage p 0 01 fig 6 this indicates that urbanization has a negative impact on river water quality which is consistent with previous studies li and zhang 2011 park et al 2005 the impacts of carbonate rocks on dtecs can be further confirmed by the comparison of dtecs between carbonate dominated catchments the coverage of carbonate rocks exceeds 80 including c09 c10 c12 c14 and t12 the total outlet of catchments c09 and c10 and silicate dominated catchments the coverage of siliciclastic rocks exceeds 80 including c17 c18 and c19 in the chishui river basin table 2 these selected catchments all also had a low urban land coverage 0 25 1 19 and 0 09 0 52 in the carbonate and silicate dominated catchments respectively indicating that these catchments are rarely disturbed by human activities we assumed that these catchments are mono lithological catchments and the dtes of river waters in these catchments are mainly derived from natural sources and affected by natural processes water samples including the samples from these mono lithological catchments were plotted with na normalized molar ratios in fig 7 a and the water samples in the plot are located between the carbonate and silicate end members a good correlation between ca na and sr na molar ratios r2 0 7 can be observed in fig 7b this correlation supports the mixing between the weathering products of carbonates high ca na and sr na molar ratios and silicates low ca na and sr na molar ratios gaillardet et al 1999 the distributions of the water samples from mono lithological catchments in the plots fig 7a and b correspond with the rock types of the mono lithological catchments additionally the ca and mg concentrations of water samples from carbonate catchments averaging at 62 75 8 72 mg l 1 and 14 97 5 34 mg l 1 respectively are more than twice the ca and mg concentrations of those from silicate catchments averaging at 22 06 9 14 mg l 1 and 2 80 1 89 mg l 1 respectively respectively fig 8 these indicate that in the carbonate dominated and silicate dominated catchments there is indeed a significant difference in weathering products produced by weathering of the two types of rocks we further found that the water samples from carbonate catchments had a higher co cr ni u mo li and sr concentrations and a lower ga pb sb cu as rb v mn zn al and ba concentrations than the water samples from silicate catchments fig 8 which may be attributed to the different te contents in carbonate and silicate bedrock and the inhibition of migration of dtes in carbonate watersheds holmström et al 1999 qu et al 2020 acidic water bodies caused by weathering of sulfide deposit or factory sewage with high contents of dtes can be quickly neutralized by limestone in carbonate watersheds and dtes transported by rivers will soon be enriched within the solid particles holmström et al 1999 qu et al 2020 in addition the inhibition of elemental migration may be due to the adsorption of sediments and the precipitation and complexation of heavy metals qu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 few studies have compared the dtecs for the mono lithological catchments however according to our results the dtes except cr having a higher concentration in carbonate catchments were mainly derived from natural sources and carbonate weathering may be the major source the finding that pb cu and zn contents of water samples from carbonate catchments are lower than those from silicate catchments is consistent with the report of qu et al 2020 and the finding that sr and u are mainly derived from carbonate weathering is consistent with many previous studies gonneea et al 2014 han and liu 2004 neal et al 2006 palmer and edmond 1993 the lower dtecs in carbonate catchments and the negative correlations between dtecs and distribution of carbonate rocks within catchment may also be related to the hydrochemical characteristics of karst rivers for example the ph values of river waters draining carbonate areas are usually higher than those draining silicate areas and a strong alkaline environment may promote the precipitation of certain elements e g zn and cd wu et al 2020 the difference in dom content of river waters may also result in distinct geochemical behaviours of aquatic tes sankar et al 2019 in addition to lithology land use may be another control on riverine dtes when the contents of most of the dtes of water samples from above selected catchments were significantly lower than those from catchments with high urban land coverage e g c04 c13 and c16 reflecting that the impacts of human activities in the urban region on dtes are not limited to as and rb indicated by above ca our results show that mo sr and u and as ga pb and v were positively correlated to cropland and forest coverage respectively it is difficult to judge the relationships between dtecs with cropland and forest due to the overlapped distribution of lithology and land use e g the cropland and forest are mainly distributed over carbonate and silicate rocks in the chishui river basin fig 1a and b respectively we compared the dtecs in carbonate catchment with distinct land use c09 c10 c12 and c14 and the results show that there is no obvious difference between cropland dominated and forest dominated catchments the impacts of vegetation on riverine dtecs are also related to the root respiration rate of the plant which is a major driver of rock weathering romero mujalli et al 2018 thereafter it is reasonable to conclude that the impacts of cropland and forest on dtecs in the chishui river systems may be negligible precipitation and hydrology play an important role in controlling seasonal variations in dtecs in stream waters li and zhang 2010a sankar et al 2019 during the rainy season riverine solutes may be diluted but non point source pollutants mining waste and geological materials from weathering may increase li and zhang 2010a olı as et al 2004 the intensity and rates of chemical weathering depend upon land temperature precipitation hydrology and further factors chen et al 2020 gaillardet et al 1999 ma et al 2020 romero mujalli et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 increased discharge in the rainy season accelerates the weathering rate of rocks by increasing the reactive mineral surface area which induces chemostatic behaviour of riverine solutes derived from weathering zhong et al 2017 the release of tes contained in carbonate rocks therefore increase as the accelerated weathering rate additionally under high discharge conditions a shift towards fast near surface flow paths with reduced water rock interaction time can cause dilution which may alter the concentrations of solutes produced by different rock weathering torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 the seasonal variations in contents of dtes and in their correlations with analyzed variables in the chishui river basin have been observed most of the dtes had a higher median concentration in the wet season in our study especially cu ga pb v and zn since these elements were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources discussed in section 4 2 the seasonal variations in these elements can be attributed to the increased discharge from anthropogenic activities in the wet season the lower median concentrations of cr ni sr and u can be attributed to the dilution at high runoff because most of these elements were mainly derived from rock weathering these analyses indicate that hydrologic seasonality also plays an important role in regulating riverine dtecs which is consistent with the results of previous studies li and zhang 2011 zhu et al 2018 however we are not able to do detailed analysis due to the lack of hydrologic data in the future our approach will be better constrained if possible better coverage of temporal samples 5 conclusions in this study eighteen dtes were analyzed to investigate their contents and seasonal spatial variations and to evaluate the water quality and health risks in terms of dtecs the sources and controlling factors of dtes were identified using statistical analysis methods the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 dtecs were at a relatively low level in the chishui river basin only al and mn concentrations of some of the water samples in the wet season were higher than the values of chinese drinking water standard and the concentrations of most of the dtes were far below the standard values the results of the water quality assessments indicated that all the water samples could be considered to have an excellent water quality and no extensive heavy metal pollution health risk assessments indicated that the as sr u and v were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk for the entire basin in the two seasons and the as ba co cr mn and v were the largest contributors to potential non carcinogenic risk in some of the tributaries 2 dtecs showed significant seasonal spatial variations the concentrations of most of the dtes were higher in the wet season than in the dry season except for ba li cr and rb the concentrations of most of the dtes had no regular trends in space al ba li mn and zn concentrations had the outliers in tributaries of sub catchments with relatively higher urban land coverage 3 pca identified five pcs explaining 84 15 of the total variance and four pcs explaining 87 38 of the total variance in the wet and dry seasons respectively from the perspective of the entire basin al co cu li mn ni u mo sb and sr were mainly derived from natural sources while as ba cr ga pb rb v and zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources 4 carbonate plays an important role in controlling the dtecs in karst rivers by providing the weathering materials containing some tes e g sr and u and by inhibiting the migration of some tes the distribution of urban land in the chishui river basin is another major control on dtecs especially on concentrations of as and rb which was indicated by the significantly positive correlations p 0 01 between the two elements and urban land coverage 5 the hydrologic seasonality induced by precipitation also seems to be a regulator of dtecs in the chishui river system this was indicated by the seasonal variations in dtecs and the difference in the impacts of lithology and land use on dtecs in the two seasons we acknowledge that our results may be biased due to the lack of analyses of sediment and rock samples and sparse coverage of samples over space and time our results do show that carbonate and urban land play a significant role in controlling riverine dtecs which need to be well documented studies on the geochemical behaviours of tes in both waters and sediments in rivers draining mono lithological catchments with various urban land coverages and monitoring of river water quality with a high temporal resolution are needed urgently to enhance the understanding of impacts of natural lithology and hydrology processes and urban land distribution on the riverine dtes which can facilitate river water quality protection in the context of

5077,two record breaking summer droughts hit southwest china swc in 2006 and 2011 causing severe losses to the society and economy moisture sources for precipitation in swc and changes accompanied with the extreme droughts are thus investigated using a moisture tracking model the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers with observation constrained data swc is influenced by three major circulations namely the indian monsoon the east asian summer monsoon easm and the westerlies the representative source regions the southwest southeast and west contribute around 50 8 3 9 13 3 3 8 and 16 4 2 1 of the tracked moisture climatologically the westerlies turn out to be the second largest moisture contributor to swc over the easm in 2006 when the western pacific subtropical high wpsh intruded to the west the influence of the easm was intensified profoundly as it increased to be the second largest contributor to contribute 21 2 of the moisture but this change induced circulation anomalies that hindered moisture transport from the west and southwest their moisture contributions were substantially reduced resulting in an overall moisture deficit for swc in 2011 the contributions from subregions were universally reduced the moisture conveyor belt in the southwest released moisture early before it reached swc thus resulting in a shortage in moisture supply to swc the precipitation recycling ratio in swc is around 15 7 1 9 however the ratio increased during both droughts to 18 6 in 2006 and 17 7 in 2011 further analyses reveal that the external moisture decreased heavily thus making local moisture more important to result in a marked increase in the recycling ratio keywords moisture source extreme drought wam 2layers asian monsoons 1 introduction droughts affect southwest china swc frequently in recent decades and have caused severe damages to both the society and the economy of this region swc is among the most populated regions in china and thus these frequent droughts have drawn considerable attention from both the government and the academia wang et al 2015 the droughts in swc differ in time and severity in the 2000s three super droughts identified as the severest since 1961 wang et al 2016 stroke swc out of which two occurred in the summers of 2006 and 2011 the two summer droughts have since been studied especially regarding their meteorological conditions e g liu et al 2017 lu et al 2014 li et al 2011 in the summer of 2006 a relatively strong western pacific subtropical high wpsh moved anomalously northward and westward li et al 2011 under the direct control of the wpsh descending motion prevailed over swc and the transport of moisture from the bay of bengal and south china sea was suppressed liu et al 2009 li et al 2011 meanwhile a weak blocking high in the ural mountains and a shallow east asian trough facilitated a stronger zonal circulation at midlatitudes which hindered the intrusion of cold air into swc zou and gao 2007 this configuration of large scale subtropical and midlatitude circulations prevented the convergence of warm moist air from the south and cold dry air from the north over swc in the summer of 2011 water vapor transport from the bay of bengal was weakened and prevalent descending motion formed over swc with an anomalous high sun et al 2012 wang et al 2012 such a pattern which is similar to the atmospheric conditions in the summer of 2006 was unfavorable for precipitation however the wpsh exhibited contrasting behaviors as it stretched westward in 2006 but withdrew eastward in 2011 li et al 2014 indicating the nonlinearity and complexity in the summer drought formation in swc the drought in 2011 was possibly a combined result of weak moisture transport from the bay of bengal a positive geopotential height anomaly and a more easterly location of the wpsh wang et al 2015 there are several studies on the moisture sources for precipitation around swc huang and cui 2015a b pointed out that the local region the area from tibetan plateau to central china and the indian ocean are the major sources ranked from high to low in contributing moisture to sichuan swc in the extreme and torrential precipitations however most of the precipitation moisture comes from the indian ocean using similar lagrangian method chen and xu 2016 differed in that the local and its neighborhood region is the strongest moisture contributor for heavy precipitation in the sichuan basin followed by the south china sea zhang et al 2017b observed a declining trend in precipitation in swc from 1979 to 2013 and attributed the trend to the decrease in moisture contribution from the sources in the extended west from east europe to the west indian ocean nevertheless none of these studies have ever been linked to the drought events recently there are studies linking moisture sources to drought in north america roy et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2019 it s found that droughts in upwind regions can amplify droughts downwind via decreased moisture export herrera estrada et al 2019 not only the absolute amount of recycled precipitation but the recycling ratios were reduced in the u s droughts in texas and upper midwest roy et al 2019 inspired by the linkage this study tries to reveal the swc extreme summer droughts from the angle of moisture change of the sources with those presented moisture studies on precipitation of swc the sources have not been systematically classified and measured according to the influencing circulations for instance the east asian summer monsoon easm is a major influencing circulation that transports pacific moisture to swc however which part of the easm affects and how much does it contribute remain unclear furthermore as the wpsh advanced and retreated oppositely in 2006 and 2011 the moisture contributed by easm was certain to be different needless to say other moisture changes related to the droughts to answer these questions the study tracks the swc summer precipitation to the evaporative sources divides and quantifies the source contributions separately by the dominating circulations the concept of precipitationshed proposed by keys et al 2014 2017 is adopted to identify the main moisture source region for the swc precipitation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data study area model and methods section 3 presents the main results special discussions are given in section 4 on the intensified moisture transport in 2011 and the increased local recycling during both droughts section 5 gives the major conclusions 2 data model and methods 2 1 data and study area data mainly include precipitation evaporation and atmospheric data serving as model input for moisture tracking for precipitation the 0 5 gridded monthly precipitation dataset from the china meteorological administration cma is adopted zhao et al 2014 this dataset is derived from quality controlled station records from 2400 stations over china since 1961 and data from 1979 to 2012 are used the stations are densely distributed over swc zhang et al 2017b the 3 hourly 1 gridded evaporation fields from the community land model clm in the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 dataset are also chosen because the clm is a physically based model that is subject to vigorous evaluation the forcing data including precipitation temperature radiation etc are observational in general gldas outperforms other reanalyses on surface variables wang and zeng 2012 gao et al 2014 over the ocean the monthly 1 gridded evaporation fields from the objectively analyzed air sea fluxes oaflux product yu and weller 2007 are chosen oaflux has assimilated satellite data since 1985 according to an

applied for verification of precipitation changes beyond china gpcp is an observation based precipitation analysis which has been widely used among the world huffman et al 2009 the study area of swc mainly covers three provinces sichuan yunnan and guizhou and one municipality chongqing as shown in fig 1 a it is on the southeast side of the tibetan plateau the average altitude over this area is over 1800 m with a basin in the northeast mountains in the west and the yungui plateau in the south swc is under the influence of three major external circulations in summer fig 1c i e the westerlies the easm and the indian monsoon the average summer rainfall from 1979 to 2012 was approximately 555 2 mm jja 1 according to the cma data fig 1b in the drought years of 2006 and 2011 precipitation was extremely low with 397 4 mm jja 1 for 2006 and 404 0 mm jja 1 for 2011 the spatial distribution of precipitation anomalies can be referred to fig s1 2 2 model and methods 2 2 1 wam 2layers and experiment related processing the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers is an eulerian model of moisture recycling that can track moisture either forward or backward in time to quantify moisture source sink relations van der ent et al 2013 2014 wam 2layers represents an updated version of wam van der ent et al 2010 which has deficits in moisture tracking over regions with strong wind shear in the vertical direction wam 2layers basically resolves this problem by dividing the vertical direction into two layers this model has been applied in various studies e g keys et al 2017 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 guo et al 2019 compared with some lagrangian methods that track moisture by models such as flexpart and hysplit e g chu et al 2017 sodemann et al 2008 sun and wang 2014 one major difference is that wam 2layers tracks the moisture of real precipitation fallen on the ground while the lagrangian methods track the moisture released in the air which is not the actual precipitation observed on ground huang and cui 2015a besides wam 2layers is able to keep the tagged water conserved zhang et al 2017a in other words all the precipitated moisture can be tracked backward to the evaporative sources these features make wam 2layers more suitable for the ground precipitation based research the tracking algorithm is simply described as follows when the backtracking begins precipitation enters and evaporation exits the atmospheric water buckets the entered moisture of precipitation is referred to as tagged water it mixes well with the bucket water in both lower and upper buckets as model integrates with time moisture including tagged water is moved horizontally and vertically between grid cells by the prevailing winds at each time step if there is an evaporation of e from the grid on the surface and the mixed ratio is r in the lower bucket the grid contributes e r of moisture that would be finally fallen as precipitation in the target area at the same time the tagged water in the lower bucket would reduce the same amount of e r the process continues until all tagged water is depleted from the air more details can be found in zhang et al 2019 and van der ent et al 2014 the input data for wam 2layers are carefully chosen and transformed they are observation based or transformed to observations in order to get an accurate output as possible the precipitation and evaporation in era i are too inaccurate to be used directly trenberth et al 2011 zhang et al 2017b tong et al 2014 however the 3 hourly data contain information about diurnal variations to retain this diurnal information the monthly cma precipitation and oaflux evaporation which are observation based are used to rescale the era i dataset the procedures are as follows the cma precipitation is first transformed to the same spatial resolution as that of the era i dataset by taking the means of the 0 5 grids that fall into the 1 grid then the monthly era i precipitation is calculated by setting the monthly cma precipitation as the norm a ratio of the cma precipitation to the era i precipitation for each grid and each month is produced all 3 hourly era i precipitations for one grid in one month are then rescaled by multiplying those precipitations by the ratio corresponding to that month for evaporation the 1 oaflux values are first transformed linearly into the era i 1 grid then following similar procedures as with the cma data the 3 hourly era i evaporation fields over ocean are rescaled to oaflux over the grids where oaflux values are vacant the era i values are adopted over land the 3 hourly gldas evaporation is interpolated linearly to the era i 1 grid since the gldas data have a 3 hourly resolution already the interpolated gldas evaporation is taken to replace era i directly before the tracking starts all input data for wam 2layers are discretized to a 15 min time step to maintain numerical stability in moisture backtracking linear interpolation or equal division methods are utilized to transform the 6 or 3 hourly data into 15 min intervals as in previous studies e g keys et al 2014 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 zhang et al 2019 precipitation moisture may be originated from sources that evaporated more than 10 days ago before it is precipitated out numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 when moisture tracking integrates over the whole summer there is still some amount of untracked moisture in the air that was evaporated before the onset of summer this amount of moisture is not tracked any more as only moisture evaporated in summer is considered as a result when the backtracking ends on june 1st the leftover moisture in the air equals around 68 9 10 5 mm of precipitation in swc and accounts for 12 2 1 9 of the swc precipitation 2 2 2 additional methods and processing the moisture divergence is calculated directly from the field of moisture flux which is expressed as 1 div f x x f y y where fx and fy represent the zonal and meridional vertically integrated moisture flux respectively the two sample test of the student s t test is used to examine the difference between the drought years of 2006 and 2011 and the climatology the difference p value that is smaller than 0 05 is denoted as significant to analyze the precipitation moisture changes in the summer seasons of 2006 and 2011 the reference period is assigned to be 1979 2000 however due to a strong and suspicious anomaly in gldas caused by erroneous precipitation in 1996 zhou et al 2013 the year 1996 is excluded from the reference period in addition the extreme summer precipitation in 1998 caused by the super 1997 98 el niño lau and weng 2001 forced the precipitation to deviate far from the normal range fig 1b so that the year 1998 is also removed from the reference period thus 20 out of 22 years from 1979 to 2000 are chosen to constitute the valid reference period the climatological results are always assigned with an interval of one standard deviation up and down the average to indicate their variability 3 results 3 1 climatology fig 2 a shows that there are three major external source regions contributing moisture to swc the southwest region extending over the indian ocean the southeast region extending to the western north pacific wnp and the west region across the eurasia there is a clear moisture transport belt in the southwest from the east of madagascar along the east coast of africa the arabian sea india and the bay of bengal to swc the moisture contribution aggregates over this belt upwind to the west the eastern tibetan plateau provides relatively more moisture to swc beyond the tibetan plateau the region stretching from central asia to europe behind the westerlies serves as a large hinterland that continuously transports moisture to swc the hollow space in the west is due to low in situ evaporation data not shown although the easm contributes much moisture from the southeast to swc the moisture fluxes show no direct paths from the wnp to swc moisture contributed from the east is supposed to be transported by transient eddies instead of stationary flows stationary moisture transport refers to the time averaged moisture transported by the time averaged flow which tends to be large scale and persistent while transient moisture transport represents the disturbances li et al et al 2013 moisture contributed by the north is also transported by transient eddies the main moisture contributing region is further divided into four external sub regions to measure the specific regional contributions according to the influencing circulations they are the west representing the westerlies the southwest representing the indian monsoon the southeast representing the easm and the north fig 2b the southwest which covers the entire indian ocean contributes the most precipitation moisture to swc equaling approximately 250 0 27 0 mm jja 1 of precipitation this contributed precipitation moisture accounts for approximately 50 8 3 9 of the tracked swc precipitation moisture table 1 the west which covers western eurasia and part of north africa contributes the second highest amount of moisture at 80 7 11 8 mm jja 1 which accounts for 16 4 2 1 of the tracked moisture the southeast which covers most of the pacific ocean to the southeast of swc contributes 65 6 19 6 mm jja 1 of precipitation which accounts for 13 3 3 8 of the tracked moisture the north sub region contributes the least precipitation of 10 4 5 1 mm jja 1 accounting for 2 1 0 9 of the tracked moisture the impacts of different circulations are then represented by the respective moisture contributions from the source regions the strength of the circulations can be directly compared the indian monsoon is a dominant moisture source for swc in comparison the easm exerts much weaker influence although the easm exerts great influences on precipitation over east china day et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 wang and chen 2012 its direct contribution to swc does not exceed the contribution from the westerlies it is probably because swc is seated further inland and under the direct influence of the westerlies the local area of swc contributes 77 7 13 1 mm jja 1 accounting for 15 7 1 9 of the tracked moisture the local area is an important source for swc not only because its overall contribution amount is relatively large but also because of its most intense contribution fig 2a 3 2 spatial variability the variation of moisture contribution fig 2b shows that the most variable sources tend to be those that have already contributed a high value of moisture wherever the base value is large the variance is large since the absolute variance provides limited information on spatial variability the relative variance map is also presented fig 2c the relative variance refers to the percentage of standard moisture contribution deviation over the mean the relative variance can serve as an indicator that measures the stability of contribution from a source to swc the relative variance pattern differs from the others sources with high moisture contributions are likely to be low in relative contribution variance especially along the belt from the indian ocean to swc this suggests that the contribution from the southwest is relatively stable contributions from sources in the west on the other hand are not very stable as water is limited in the middle east due to the dry climate there evaporation fluctuates fiercely which leads to an unstable relative moisture contribution to swc there is no such limitation of water availability in the east however the contribution in the east is the most unstable the instability in the east is probably caused by the variation in circulation moisture transport from the east is strongly influenced by the intensity and location of the wpsh in some years when the wpsh is strong and intrudes into the west more moisture is brought from the east to swc in other years the wpsh retreats to the east and thus less moisture is contributed from the east overall the largest moisture contributors tend to be more stable which is beneficial for keeping the precipitation in swc stable 3 3 droughts in 2006 and 2011 the moisture contribution in the summer of 2006 shows that moisture contributed from the west was weakened while moisture from the east was strengthened fig 3 a b the circulation anomaly shows consistent change with more anomalous moisture fluxes coming from the east fig 3b prevailing northeasterly fluxes over swc prohibit southwesterly moisture fluxes which results in a primary moisture deficit area to the southwest of swc fig 3b the relative moisture change indicates a substantial reduction of moisture from the belt area fig 3c cf fig 2c in addition to the reduction from the west according to statistics table 1 the southwest west southeast and north sub regions contributed 148 5 39 2 70 8 and 9 2 mm jja 1 of the swc precipitation moisture accounting for 44 5 11 7 21 2 and 2 8 respectively of the tracked moisture compared with the climate mean there were substantial decreases in the moisture contribution amount from the west and the southwest however the contribution from the southeast increased its relative value increased even more by nearly 8 making it the second largest moisture contributor to swc in the background of reductions in relative contributions from both the indian monsoon and westerlies the increase of the southeast demonstrates the intensified impact of the easm as the wpsh proceeded further westward fig 1c more moisture from the pacific was transported by easm to swc nevertheless the circulation change had hindered the moisture transport from the indian monsoon and the westerlies over swc thus causing salient reductions in moisture contributed from the southwest and west the small increase from the southeast cannot make up for the huge decrease from the southwest and west resulting in an overall substantial loss in moisture contributed to swc in addition the local moisture contribution decreased but its relative contribution increased it suggests that local moisture had become more important in forming precipitation in the drought the moisture contribution in the summer of 2011 shows that moisture decreased almost everywhere except for several spot areas such as the near north fig 4 b the area with the highest moisture contribution deficit was located in southern swc the circulation anomaly indicates that more moisture was transported from northern swc which corresponds to a larger moisture contribution from the near north as the wpsh retreated a bit to the east fig 1c less moisture was anticipated to come from the pacific the relative change shows that the contribution from the east was reduced the most fig 4c in addition there were also large reductions in the belt area and in the west the regional statistics show that the sub regions contributions were all lower than normal but their relative values were generally comparable to the climate mean table 1 in comparison with 2006 the discrepancy is greatly amplified with more contribution from the west and southwest and less contribution from the southeast table 1 further demonstrating the weakened influence of the easm as the wpsh retreated to the east in 2011 although local moisture participated less in the precipitation its relative influence was strengthened this pattern is similar to that in 2006 but it is opposite to those in the u s droughts in texas and upper midwest roy et al 2019 this may imply some recycling mechanism to be further discovered to summarize the moisture changes during the two droughts show different patterns that is a west decrease and east increase in moisture contribution in 2006 and a general decrease in 2011 the roles of different sub region sources experienced abrupt changes in 2006 with the southeast replacing the west and becoming the second largest moisture contributor this change is related with the westward shift of the wpsh fig 1c in 2011 the low precipitation was largely due to a general moisture decrease from the sources among which the southwest decreased the most 4 discussion 4 1 strengthened moisture transport with less contributed moisture there is a direct moisture transport belt from the western indian ocean to swc fig 2a and moisture flux directions and the gradient of moisture contributions well demonstrate its existence in 2011 a strengthened moisture transport from the arabian sea to india along the belt was observed however the in situ moisture contribution decreased as the southwest source is the largest moisture contributor to swc the decreased amount is the greatest among the sources table 1 to determine what had happened between this strengthened moisture transport and the decreased contribution to swc climatological and anomalous moisture divergence maps are given in fig 5 a and b from the climate mean of moisture divergence it can be found that the first half of the belt stretching from madagascar to the middle arabian sea is a net moisture source fig 5a the second half of the belt from the middle arabian sea to swc is mainly a net moisture sink thus moisture transport is the strongest over the middle of the arabian sea as it accumulates moisture along the first half belt then moisture transport gradually weakens as it converges and releases moisture along the way to swc accordingly the strengthened moisture transport to the east of somalia does not start there but rather from oceanic sources north and northeast of madagascar fig 5b the anomalous moisture transport to the east of somalia enters into the weakening mode as the net moisture sink fig 5b moisture transport weakens all the way to myanmar before reaching swc there is an anomalous anticyclone that prevents the southwesterly fluxes there is prevailing anomalous moisture divergence over swc that suggests the weakening influence of the southwesterly moisture transport in sum the strengthened moisture transport from the arabian sea to india did not bring more moisture to swc but released it along the way to swc as a result there should be more precipitation along the transport path in order to verify this viewpoint precipitation change in summer 2011 with the gpcp data is displayed in fig 5c there are four positive precipitation anomaly centers around india along the path to swc that correspond well with the negative moisture divergence anomalies fig 5b 4 2 increased precipitation recycling ratio in extreme droughts the precipitation recycling ratio is defined as the contribution of local evaporation to local precipitation brubaker et al 1993 eltahir and bras 1996 this ratio is an important indicator that measures the potential of interactions between land surface processes and atmospheric processes and thus has been investigated in many studies e g goessling and reick 2011 roy et al 2019 guo et al 2018 in the drought cases of upper midwest and texas both recycled precipitations and recycling ratios were reduced roy et al 2019 in this case the recycled precipitations were both reduced which is similar to the droughts in north america herrera estrada et al 2019 roy et al 2019 however their recycling ratios were higher than normal situations table 1 this suggests that local moisture played a more important role in the extreme swc droughts to find out whether it is reasonable more evidences are provided as follows as precipitation is composed of both internal and external moisture i e moisture evaporated from the region and moisture transported from upstream to the region the relative changes in these two items can be an indicator of the change in the relative strength in forming precipitation thus the respective inputs from internal and external moisture to swc during normal and drought periods are compared the climate mean evaporation from swc in summer during the reference period was approximately 276 5 mm jja 1 whereas the evaporation was 266 7 mm jja 1 in 2006 and 280 2 mm jja 1 in 2011 table 2 the evaporation in 2011 was slightly higher than the average the climate mean moisture transport from the outside to swc in summer was equivalent to around 1182 9 mm jja 1 of the water depth in swc while it was 646 5 mm jja 1 in 2006 and 1083 7 mm jja 1 in 2011 table 2 reducing by approximately 45 3 and 8 4 respectively in 2011 moisture from outside swc decreased while moisture from inside swc increased local moisture accounted for a larger share of the total moisture resulting in a higher precipitation recycling ratio in 2006 both local evaporation and external moisture were reduced however the external moisture decreased dramatically with a minor decrease in local evaporation this imbalanced decrease also indicates that local moisture accounted for more than the average resulting in a higher than normal precipitation recycling ratio besides dominguez and kumar 2008 also found that the recycling ratio is sometimes negatively correlated to precipitation such as in the central u s plains ecoregion for those regions where moisture advection i e moisture transported from outside is the main driver of precipitation local evaporation becomes more important to sustain low precipitation when advection becomes weaker however it is worth noting that it s not universal that droughts in swc have higher precipitation recycling ratios take the drought in 1992 with the 3rd lowest precipitation fig 1b the local contribution was around 61 0 mm jja 1 while the tracked precipitation moisture was around 405 0 mm jja 1 the recycling ratio was around 15 1 a bit lower than the climate mean 5 conclusions the moisture sources for summer precipitation in swc and their changes during the extreme droughts of 2006 and 2011 are identified and quantified in this study the following conclusions are reached 1 the swc summer precipitation is strongly affected by the asian monsoons of the indian monsoon and the easm however the west controlled by the westerlies is another major source it ranks as the second largest moisture contributor climatologically to swc which is likely due to its large moisture hinterland from the westerlies the indian monsoon is the primary moisture source that contributes more than half of the swc precipitation the easm the westerlies and the local contribute approximately 13 3 3 8 16 4 2 1 and 15 7 1 9 of the tracked moisture respectively 2 generally the relative contributions from the areas with intensive moisture contributions vary little while the contributions vary strongly in the west and east however in the drought years of 2006 and 2011 the relative reductions from those intensive sources were large which substantially reduced the precipitation moisture in swc further analyses reveal that in 2006 the westward incursion of the wpsh strengthened the moisture transport from the pacific but prohibited the moisture transport from the southwest and the west to swc resulting in an overall large reduction in moisture contribution for swc the southeast as a result rose to be the second largest moisture contributor in 2011 there were no abrupt changes in the roles of the sources but a general decrease in moisture contribution was observed further analyses reveal that the moisture conveyor belt in the southwest released the moisture early before reaching swc resulting in a shortage in moisture supply for swc 3 the precipitation recycling ratio in summer swc is around 15 7 1 9 in drought years of 2006 and 2011 the ratios increased markedly to 18 6 and 17 7 respectively it is found that the moisture contributed from the external sources decreased heavily thus making local moisture more important to result in the increase in the recycling ratios this study focuses on the moisture source and moisture transport of swc however it s necessary to note that proper meterological conditions are also indispensable for precipitation to happen such as the uplifting air motions gustafsson et al 2010 to better attribute precipitation to the sources model wam2layers was applied however the eulerian model has deficiency in presenting the moisture transport paths instead the lagrangian methods that track the 3d air parcel trajectories can be a good supplement for the moisture transport path analysis the relation between wpsh and the swc precipitation is rather nonlinear the location shape and intensity of wpsh may contribute to precipitation variation in swc and even the whole eastern china zhu et al 2018 how to better quantify the wpsh and build an effective relationship between the wpsh and precipitation over china still remain

5077,two record breaking summer droughts hit southwest china swc in 2006 and 2011 causing severe losses to the society and economy moisture sources for precipitation in swc and changes accompanied with the extreme droughts are thus investigated using a moisture tracking model the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers with observation constrained data swc is influenced by three major circulations namely the indian monsoon the east asian summer monsoon easm and the westerlies the representative source regions the southwest southeast and west contribute around 50 8 3 9 13 3 3 8 and 16 4 2 1 of the tracked moisture climatologically the westerlies turn out to be the second largest moisture contributor to swc over the easm in 2006 when the western pacific subtropical high wpsh intruded to the west the influence of the easm was intensified profoundly as it increased to be the second largest contributor to contribute 21 2 of the moisture but this change induced circulation anomalies that hindered moisture transport from the west and southwest their moisture contributions were substantially reduced resulting in an overall moisture deficit for swc in 2011 the contributions from subregions were universally reduced the moisture conveyor belt in the southwest released moisture early before it reached swc thus resulting in a shortage in moisture supply to swc the precipitation recycling ratio in swc is around 15 7 1 9 however the ratio increased during both droughts to 18 6 in 2006 and 17 7 in 2011 further analyses reveal that the external moisture decreased heavily thus making local moisture more important to result in a marked increase in the recycling ratio keywords moisture source extreme drought wam 2layers asian monsoons 1 introduction droughts affect southwest china swc frequently in recent decades and have caused severe damages to both the society and the economy of this region swc is among the most populated regions in china and thus these frequent droughts have drawn considerable attention from both the government and the academia wang et al 2015 the droughts in swc differ in time and severity in the 2000s three super droughts identified as the severest since 1961 wang et al 2016 stroke swc out of which two occurred in the summers of 2006 and 2011 the two summer droughts have since been studied especially regarding their meteorological conditions e g liu et al 2017 lu et al 2014 li et al 2011 in the summer of 2006 a relatively strong western pacific subtropical high wpsh moved anomalously northward and westward li et al 2011 under the direct control of the wpsh descending motion prevailed over swc and the transport of moisture from the bay of bengal and south china sea was suppressed liu et al 2009 li et al 2011 meanwhile a weak blocking high in the ural mountains and a shallow east asian trough facilitated a stronger zonal circulation at midlatitudes which hindered the intrusion of cold air into swc zou and gao 2007 this configuration of large scale subtropical and midlatitude circulations prevented the convergence of warm moist air from the south and cold dry air from the north over swc in the summer of 2011 water vapor transport from the bay of bengal was weakened and prevalent descending motion formed over swc with an anomalous high sun et al 2012 wang et al 2012 such a pattern which is similar to the atmospheric conditions in the summer of 2006 was unfavorable for precipitation however the wpsh exhibited contrasting behaviors as it stretched westward in 2006 but withdrew eastward in 2011 li et al 2014 indicating the nonlinearity and complexity in the summer drought formation in swc the drought in 2011 was possibly a combined result of weak moisture transport from the bay of bengal a positive geopotential height anomaly and a more easterly location of the wpsh wang et al 2015 there are several studies on the moisture sources for precipitation around swc huang and cui 2015a b pointed out that the local region the area from tibetan plateau to central china and the indian ocean are the major sources ranked from high to low in contributing moisture to sichuan swc in the extreme and torrential precipitations however most of the precipitation moisture comes from the indian ocean using similar lagrangian method chen and xu 2016 differed in that the local and its neighborhood region is the strongest moisture contributor for heavy precipitation in the sichuan basin followed by the south china sea zhang et al 2017b observed a declining trend in precipitation in swc from 1979 to 2013 and attributed the trend to the decrease in moisture contribution from the sources in the extended west from east europe to the west indian ocean nevertheless none of these studies have ever been linked to the drought events recently there are studies linking moisture sources to drought in north america roy et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2019 it s found that droughts in upwind regions can amplify droughts downwind via decreased moisture export herrera estrada et al 2019 not only the absolute amount of recycled precipitation but the recycling ratios were reduced in the u s droughts in texas and upper midwest roy et al 2019 inspired by the linkage this study tries to reveal the swc extreme summer droughts from the angle of moisture change of the sources with those presented moisture studies on precipitation of swc the sources have not been systematically classified and measured according to the influencing circulations for instance the east asian summer monsoon easm is a major influencing circulation that transports pacific moisture to swc however which part of the easm affects and how much does it contribute remain unclear furthermore as the wpsh advanced and retreated oppositely in 2006 and 2011 the moisture contributed by easm was certain to be different needless to say other moisture changes related to the droughts to answer these questions the study tracks the swc summer precipitation to the evaporative sources divides and quantifies the source contributions separately by the dominating circulations the concept of precipitationshed proposed by keys et al 2014 2017 is adopted to identify the main moisture source region for the swc precipitation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data study area model and methods section 3 presents the main results special discussions are given in section 4 on the intensified moisture transport in 2011 and the increased local recycling during both droughts section 5 gives the major conclusions 2 data model and methods 2 1 data and study area data mainly include precipitation evaporation and atmospheric data serving as model input for moisture tracking for precipitation the 0 5 gridded monthly precipitation dataset from the china meteorological administration cma is adopted zhao et al 2014 this dataset is derived from quality controlled station records from 2400 stations over china since 1961 and data from 1979 to 2012 are used the stations are densely distributed over swc zhang et al 2017b the 3 hourly 1 gridded evaporation fields from the community land model clm in the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 dataset are also chosen because the clm is a physically based model that is subject to vigorous evaluation the forcing data including precipitation temperature radiation etc are observational in general gldas outperforms other reanalyses on surface variables wang and zeng 2012 gao et al 2014 over the ocean the monthly 1 gridded evaporation fields from the objectively analyzed air sea fluxes oaflux product yu and weller 2007 are chosen oaflux has assimilated satellite data since 1985 according to an evaluation oaflux agrees well with in situ buoy data and appears to be best among the available products trenberth et al 2011 these monthly precipitation and evaporation data are used to rescale the reanalysis which is detailed in the model and methods section for the atmospheric data the reanalysis dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf interim era i hereafter

over 1800 m with a basin in the northeast mountains in the west and the yungui plateau in the south swc is under the influence of three major external circulations in summer fig 1c i e the westerlies

extremely low with 397 4 mm jja 1 for 2006 and 404 0 mm jja 1 for 2011 the spatial distribution of precipitation anomalies can be referred to fig s1 2 2 model and methods 2 2 1 wam 2layers and experiment related processing the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers is an eulerian model of moisture recycling that can track moisture either forward or backward in time to quantify moisture source sink relations van der ent et al 2013 2014 wam 2layers represents an updated version of wam van der ent et al 2010 which has deficits in moisture tracking over regions with strong wind shear in the vertical direction wam 2layers basically resolves this problem by dividing the vertical direction into two layers this model has been applied in various studies e g keys et al 2017 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 guo et al 2019 compared with some lagrangian methods that track moisture by models such as flexpart and hysplit e g chu et al 2017 sodemann et al 2008 sun and wang 2014 one major difference is that wam 2layers tracks the moisture of real precipitation fallen on the ground while the lagrangian methods track the moisture released in the air which is not the actual precipitation observed on ground huang and cui 2015a besides wam 2layers is able to keep the tagged water conserved zhang et al 2017a in other words all the precipitated moisture can be tracked backward to the evaporative sources these features make wam 2layers more suitable for the ground precipitation based research the tracking algorithm is simply described as follows when the backtracking begins precipitation enters and evaporation exits the atmospheric water buckets the entered moisture of precipitation is referred to as tagged water it mixes well with the bucket water in both lower and upper buckets as model integrates with time moisture including tagged water is moved horizontally and vertically between grid cells by the prevailing winds at each time step if there is an evaporation of e from the grid on the surface and the mixed ratio is r in the lower bucket the grid contributes e r of moisture that would be finally fallen as precipitation in the target area at the same time the tagged water in the lower bucket would reduce the same amount of e r the process continues until all tagged water is depleted from the air more details can be found in zhang et al 2019 and van der ent et al 2014 the input data for wam 2layers are carefully chosen and transformed they are observation based or transformed to observations in order to get an accurate output as possible the precipitation and evaporation in era i are too inaccurate to be used directly trenberth et al 2011 zhang et al 2017b tong et al 2014 however the 3 hourly data contain information about diurnal variations to retain this diurnal information the monthly cma precipitation and oaflux evaporation which are observation based are used to rescale the era i dataset the procedures are as follows the cma precipitation is first transformed to the same spatial resolution as that of the era i dataset by taking the means of the 0 5 grids that fall into the 1 grid then the monthly era i precipitation is calculated by setting the monthly cma precipitation as the norm a ratio of the cma precipitation to the era i precipitation for each grid and each month is produced all 3 hourly era i precipitations for one grid in one month are then rescaled by multiplying those precipitations by the ratio corresponding to that month for evaporation the 1 oaflux values are first transformed linearly into the era i 1 grid then following similar procedures as with the cma data the 3 hourly era i evaporation fields over ocean are rescaled to oaflux over the grids where oaflux values are vacant the era i values are adopted over land the 3 hourly gldas evaporation is interpolated linearly to the era i 1 grid since the gldas data have a 3 hourly resolution already the interpolated gldas evaporation is taken to replace era i directly before the tracking starts all input data for wam 2layers are discretized to a 15 min time step to maintain numerical stability in moisture backtracking linear interpolation or equal division methods are utilized to transform the 6 or 3 hourly data into 15 min intervals as in previous studies e g keys et al 2014 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 zhang et al 2019 precipitation moisture may be originated from sources that evaporated more than 10 days ago before it is precipitated out numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 when moisture tracking integrates over the whole summer there is still some amount of untracked moisture in the air that was evaporated before the onset of summer this amount of moisture is not tracked any more as only moisture evaporated in summer is considered as a result when the backtracking ends on june 1st the leftover moisture in the air equals around 68 9 10 5 mm of precipitation in swc and accounts for 12 2 1 9 of the swc precipitation 2 2 2 additional methods and processing the moisture divergence is calculated directly from the field of moisture flux which is expressed as 1 div f x x f y y where fx and fy represent the zonal and meridional vertically integrated moisture flux respectively the two sample test of the student s t test is used to examine the difference between the drought years of 2006 and 2011 and the climatology the difference p value that is smaller than 0 05 is denoted as significant to analyze the precipitation moisture changes in the summer seasons of 2006 and 2011 the reference period is assigned to be 1979 2000 however due to a strong and suspicious anomaly in gldas caused by erroneous precipitation in 1996 zhou et al 2013 the year 1996 is excluded from the reference period in addition the extreme summer precipitation in 1998 caused by the super 1997 98 el niño lau and weng 2001 forced the precipitation to deviate far from the normal range fig 1b so that the year 1998 is also removed from the reference period thus 20 out of 22 years from 1979 to 2000 are chosen to constitute the valid reference period the climatological results are always assigned with an interval of one standard deviation up and down the average to indicate their variability 3 results 3 1 climatology fig 2 a shows that there are three major external source regions contributing moisture to swc the southwest region extending over the indian ocean the southeast region extending to the western north pacific wnp and the west region across the eurasia there is a clear moisture transport belt in the southwest from the east of madagascar along the east coast of africa the arabian sea india and the bay of bengal to swc the moisture contribution aggregates over this belt upwind to the west the eastern tibetan plateau provides relatively more moisture to swc beyond the tibetan plateau the region stretching from central asia to europe behind the westerlies serves as a large hinterland that continuously transports moisture to swc the hollow space in the west is due to low in situ evaporation data not shown although the easm contributes much moisture from the southeast to swc the moisture fluxes show no direct paths from the wnp to swc moisture contributed from the east is supposed to be transported by transient eddies instead of stationary flows stationary moisture transport refers to the time averaged moisture transported by the time averaged flow which tends to be large scale and persistent while transient moisture transport represents the disturbances li et al et al 2013 moisture contributed by the north is also transported by transient eddies the main moisture contributing region is further divided into four external sub regions to measure the specific regional contributions according to the influencing circulations they are the west representing the westerlies the southwest representing the indian monsoon the southeast representing the easm and the north fig 2b the southwest which covers the entire indian ocean contributes the most precipitation moisture to swc equaling approximately 250 0 27 0 mm jja 1 of precipitation this contributed precipitation moisture accounts for approximately 50 8 3 9 of the tracked swc precipitation moisture table 1 the west which covers western eurasia and part of north africa contributes the second highest amount of moisture at 80 7 11 8 mm jja 1 which accounts for 16 4 2 1 of the tracked moisture the southeast which covers most of the pacific ocean to the southeast of swc contributes 65 6 19 6 mm jja 1 of precipitation which accounts for 13 3 3 8 of the tracked moisture the north sub region contributes the least precipitation of 10 4 5 1 mm jja 1 accounting for 2 1 0 9 of the tracked moisture the impacts of different circulations are then represented by the respective moisture contributions from the source regions the strength of the circulations can be directly compared the indian monsoon is a dominant moisture source for swc in comparison the easm exerts much weaker influence although the easm exerts great influences on precipitation over east china day et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 wang and chen 2012 its direct contribution to swc does not exceed the contribution from the westerlies it is probably because swc is seated further inland and under the direct influence of the westerlies the local area of swc contributes 77 7 13 1 mm jja 1 accounting for 15 7 1 9 of the tracked moisture the local area is an important source for swc not only because its overall contribution amount is relatively large but also because of its most intense contribution fig 2a 3 2 spatial variability the variation of moisture contribution fig 2b shows that the most variable sources tend to be those that have already contributed a high value of moisture wherever the base value is large the variance is large since the absolute variance provides limited information on spatial variability the relative variance map is also presented fig 2c the relative variance refers to the percentage of standard moisture contribution deviation over the mean the relative variance can serve as an indicator that measures the stability of contribution from a source to swc the relative variance pattern differs from the others sources with high moisture contributions are likely to be low in relative contribution variance especially along the belt from the indian ocean to swc this suggests that the contribution from the southwest is relatively stable contributions from sources in the west on the other hand are not very stable as water is limited in the middle east due to the dry climate there evaporation fluctuates fiercely which leads to an unstable relative moisture contribution to swc there is no such limitation of water availability in the east however the contribution in the east is the most unstable the instability in the east is probably caused by the variation in circulation moisture transport from the east is strongly influenced by the intensity and location of the wpsh in some years when the wpsh is strong and intrudes into the west more moisture is brought from the east to swc in other years the wpsh retreats to the east and thus less moisture is contributed from the east overall the largest moisture contributors tend to be more stable which is beneficial for keeping the precipitation in swc stable 3 3 droughts in 2006 and 2011 the moisture contribution in the summer of 2006 shows that moisture contributed from the west was weakened while moisture from the east was strengthened fig 3 a b the circulation anomaly shows consistent change with more anomalous moisture fluxes coming from the east fig 3b prevailing northeasterly fluxes over swc prohibit southwesterly moisture fluxes which results in a primary moisture deficit area to the southwest of swc fig 3b the relative moisture change indicates a substantial reduction of moisture from the belt area fig 3c cf fig 2c in addition to the reduction from the west according to statistics table 1 the southwest west southeast and north sub regions contributed 148 5 39 2 70 8 and 9 2 mm jja 1 of the swc precipitation moisture accounting for 44 5 11 7 21 2 and 2 8 respectively of the tracked moisture compared with the climate mean there were substantial decreases in the moisture contribution amount from the west and the southwest however the contribution from the southeast increased its relative value increased even more by nearly 8 making it the second largest moisture contributor to swc in the background of reductions in relative contributions from both the indian monsoon and westerlies the increase of the southeast demonstrates the intensified impact of the easm as the wpsh proceeded further westward fig 1c more moisture from the pacific was transported by easm to swc nevertheless the circulation change had hindered the moisture transport from the indian monsoon and the westerlies over swc thus causing salient reductions in moisture contributed from the southwest and west the small increase from the southeast cannot make up for the huge decrease from the southwest and west resulting in an overall substantial loss in moisture contributed to swc in addition the local moisture contribution decreased but its relative contribution increased it suggests that local moisture had become more important in forming precipitation in the drought the moisture contribution in the summer of 2011 shows that moisture decreased almost everywhere except for several spot areas such as the near north fig 4 b the area with the highest moisture contribution deficit was located in southern swc the circulation anomaly indicates that more moisture was transported from northern swc which corresponds to a larger moisture contribution from the near north as the wpsh retreated a bit to the east fig 1c less moisture was anticipated to come from the pacific the relative change shows that the contribution from the east was reduced the most fig 4c in addition there were also large reductions in the belt area and in the west the regional statistics show that the sub regions contributions were all lower than normal but their relative values were generally comparable to the climate mean table 1 in comparison with 2006 the discrepancy is greatly amplified with more contribution from the west and southwest and less contribution from the southeast table 1 further demonstrating the weakened influence of the easm as the wpsh retreated to the east in 2011 although local moisture participated less in the precipitation its relative influence was strengthened this pattern is similar to that in 2006 but it is opposite to those in the u s droughts in texas and upper midwest roy et al 2019 this may imply some recycling mechanism to be further discovered to summarize the moisture changes during the two droughts show different patterns that is a west decrease and east increase in moisture contribution in 2006 and a general decrease in 2011 the roles of different sub region sources experienced abrupt changes in 2006 with the southeast replacing the west and becoming the second largest moisture contributor this change is related with the westward shift of the wpsh fig 1c in 2011 the low precipitation was largely due to a general moisture decrease from the sources among which the southwest decreased the most 4 discussion 4 1 strengthened moisture transport with less contributed moisture there is a direct moisture transport belt from the western indian ocean to swc fig 2a and moisture flux directions and the gradient of moisture contributions well demonstrate its existence in 2011 a strengthened moisture transport from the arabian sea to india along the belt was observed however the in situ moisture contribution decreased as the southwest source is the largest moisture contributor to swc the decreased amount is the greatest among the sources table 1 to determine what had happened between this strengthened moisture transport and the decreased contribution to swc climatological and anomalous moisture divergence maps are given in fig 5 a and b from the climate mean of moisture divergence it can be found that the first half of the belt stretching from madagascar to the middle arabian sea is a net moisture source fig 5a the second half of the belt from the middle arabian sea to swc is mainly a net moisture sink thus moisture transport is the strongest over the middle of the arabian sea as it accumulates moisture along the first half belt then moisture transport gradually weakens as it converges and releases moisture along the way to swc accordingly the strengthened moisture transport to the east of somalia does not start there but rather from oceanic sources north and northeast of madagascar fig 5b the anomalous moisture transport to the east of somalia enters into the weakening mode as the net moisture sink fig 5b moisture transport weakens all the way to myanmar before reaching swc there is an anomalous anticyclone that prevents the southwesterly fluxes there is prevailing anomalous moisture divergence over swc that suggests the weakening influence of the southwesterly moisture transport in sum the strengthened moisture transport from the arabian sea to india did not bring more moisture to swc but released it along the way to swc as a result there should be more precipitation along the transport path in order to verify this viewpoint precipitation change in summer 2011 with the gpcp data is displayed in fig 5c there are four positive precipitation anomaly centers around india along the path to swc that correspond well with the negative moisture divergence anomalies fig 5b 4 2 increased precipitation recycling ratio in extreme droughts the precipitation recycling ratio is defined as the contribution of local evaporation to local precipitation brubaker et al 1993 eltahir and bras 1996 this ratio is an important indicator that measures the potential of interactions between land surface processes and atmospheric processes and thus has been investigated in many studies e g goessling and reick 2011 roy et al 2019 guo et al 2018 in the drought cases of upper midwest and texas both recycled precipitations and recycling ratios were reduced roy et al 2019 in this case the recycled precipitations were both reduced which is similar to the droughts in north america herrera estrada et al 2019 roy et al 2019 however their recycling ratios were higher than normal situations table 1 this suggests that local moisture played a more important role in the extreme swc droughts to find out whether it is reasonable more evidences are provided as follows as precipitation is composed of both internal and external moisture i e moisture evaporated from the region and moisture transported from upstream to the region the relative changes in these two items can be an indicator of the change in the relative strength in forming precipitation thus the respective inputs from internal and external moisture to swc during normal and drought periods are compared the climate mean evaporation from swc in summer during the reference period was approximately 276 5 mm jja 1 whereas the evaporation was 266 7 mm jja 1 in 2006 and 280 2 mm jja 1 in 2011 table 2 the evaporation in 2011 was slightly higher than the average the climate mean moisture transport from the outside to swc in summer was equivalent to around 1182 9 mm jja 1 of the water depth in swc while it was 646 5 mm jja 1 in 2006 and 1083 7 mm jja 1 in 2011 table 2 reducing by approximately 45 3 and 8 4 respectively in 2011 moisture from outside swc decreased while moisture from inside swc increased local moisture accounted for a larger share of the total moisture resulting in a higher precipitation recycling ratio in 2006 both local evaporation and external moisture were reduced however the external moisture decreased dramatically with a minor decrease in local evaporation this imbalanced decrease also indicates that local moisture accounted for more than the average resulting in a higher than normal precipitation recycling ratio besides dominguez and kumar 2008 also found that the recycling ratio is sometimes negatively correlated to precipitation such as in the central u s plains ecoregion for those regions where moisture advection i e moisture transported from outside is the main driver of precipitation local evaporation becomes more important to sustain low precipitation when advection becomes weaker however it is worth noting that it s not universal that droughts in swc have higher precipitation recycling ratios take the drought in 1992 with the 3rd lowest precipitation fig 1b the local contribution was around 61 0 mm jja 1 while the tracked precipitation moisture was around 405 0 mm jja 1 the recycling ratio was around 15 1 a bit lower than the climate mean 5 conclusions the moisture sources for summer precipitation in swc and their changes during the extreme droughts of 2006 and 2011 are identified and quantified in this study the following conclusions are reached 1 the swc summer precipitation is strongly affected by the asian monsoons of the indian monsoon and the easm however the west controlled by the westerlies is another major source it ranks as the second largest moisture contributor climatologically to swc which is likely due to its large moisture hinterland from the westerlies the indian monsoon is the primary moisture source that contributes more than half of the swc precipitation the easm the westerlies and the local contribute approximately 13 3 3 8 16 4 2 1 and 15 7 1 9 of the tracked moisture respectively 2 generally the relative contributions from the areas with intensive moisture contributions vary little while the contributions vary strongly in the west and east however in the drought years of 2006 and 2011 the relative reductions from those intensive sources were large which substantially reduced the precipitation moisture in swc further analyses reveal that in 2006 the westward incursion of the wpsh strengthened the moisture transport from the pacific but prohibited the moisture transport from the southwest and the west to swc resulting in an overall large reduction in moisture contribution for swc the southeast as a result rose to be the second largest moisture contributor in 2011 there were no abrupt changes in the roles of the sources but a general decrease in moisture contribution was observed further analyses reveal that the moisture conveyor belt in the southwest released the moisture early before reaching swc resulting in a shortage in moisture supply for swc 3 the precipitation recycling ratio in summer swc is around 15 7 1 9 in drought years of 2006 and 2011 the ratios increased markedly to 18 6 and 17 7 respectively it is found that the moisture contributed from the external sources decreased heavily thus making local moisture more important to result in the increase in the recycling ratios this study focuses on the moisture source and moisture transport of swc however it s necessary to note that proper meterological conditions are also indispensable for precipitation to happen such as the uplifting air motions gustafsson et al 2010 to better attribute precipitation to the sources model wam2layers was applied however the eulerian model has deficiency in presenting the moisture transport paths instead the lagrangian methods that track the 3d air parcel trajectories can be a good supplement for the moisture transport path analysis the relation between wpsh and the swc precipitation is rather nonlinear the location shape and intensity of wpsh may contribute to precipitation variation in swc and even the whole eastern china zhu et al 2018 how to better quantify the wpsh and build an effective relationship between the wpsh and precipitation over china still remain

5078,the effect of preferential flow pf in loess is of direct interest as flood irrigation is commonly found in loess regions where precipitation is scarce this study was to assess the applicability of time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert data on monitoring infiltration in loess and to analyze the effects of preexisting preferential path on infiltration process at a localized scale an in situ single ring infiltrometer sri test was conducted above a preexisting near surface crack under a constant influx 10 cm water head for 8h and the test was monitored by the means of 2 d time lapse ert and validated by an exploratory trench the ert results observed some increasing uncertainties in the electrical resistivity in part due to daily temperature variation however they showed that the infiltration process under the presence of preferential path can be effectively monitored by time lapse ert with a combination of unit electrode spacing ues the test results showed a high relative reduction of electrical resistivity 80 due to matrix flow mf and pf within 0 0 5h of the test and followed by a transformation of preferential flow to a more matrix dominated unsaturated flow i e preferential to matrix flow pmf with continuous downward progression into the deeper subsurface greater than 1 2 m while mf stagnated at the near surface about 0 4 m the results suggested that the presence of even a near surface preferential path significantly accelerate the infiltration into the deeper loess by the means of pmf as compared to observed slow infiltration of pure matrix flow in

in 1968 irrigating water raises the groundwater table gwt in the overlying loess layer dai et al 1999 jin and dai 2007 which has induced more than 200 loess related landslides on the margin of the terrace peng et al 2018 the landslides have resulted in slope retreat along the margin of hft at a rate of 0 024 km2 yr 1 about 3 annual terrace depletion and have caused significant impact to the local community series of laboratory tests on the mechanical behaviors of the hft malan loess emphasize the driving effects of the irrigation induced groundwater recharge on landslides xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2014 a failure mechanism for multi staged retrogressive flowslide in loess is proposed by qi et al 2018 in which the increasing groundwater level causes strain softening at the base of the loess layer and a localized slope failure and in turn impedes groundwater drainage at the slope surface such a localized slope failure can result in a drained to undrained shearing transition with convergence of groundwater to the landslide scarp as a new hydraulic gradient is introduced while such an instability process indicates that irrigation acts as the primary cause of the landslides in hft the infiltration process in loess is often neglected within the scope of landslide research previous studies on in situ infiltration in loess suggest that the infiltration depth is typically limited to shallow soil with little effects on the perched groundwater in deep soil tu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 indicate that the infiltration depth in intact loess is about 3 m under a daily precipitation of 120 mm huang et al 2017 and huang et al 2020 show that the groundwater recharge rate is about 55 100 mm yr 1 in a loess terrace which yield a duration of 160 400 yrs for precipitation to reach the groundwater table according to the chloride mass balance these observations focus on the infiltration process that is governed by matrix flow mf due to gravitational attraction and matric suction without addressing the effects of preferential paths zeng et al 2016 indicate that the sinkholes in hft can form preferential channels for irrigating water to infiltrate directly into the deep soil while the mf stagnates within less than 5 m in the near surface feng et al 2020 and li et al 2018 analyze the micro scale vertical joints in loess samples by using micro ct scans and indicate that the joints can promote preferential flow pf with the well developed joint systems that are commonly found in the malan loess in hft derbyshire 2001 mf and pf are likely to be concomitant as the sub vertical joints form conduits for rapid water transmission however limited studies address the interplays of pf and mf in loess under long term irrigation while column tests on remolded loess can provide some insights on the infiltration process e g hou et al 2018 the complex structure of intact loess results in difficulties to replicate the field conditions in a laboratory setting field monitoring of the infiltration process provides means to directly characterize the flow behaviors monitoring methods such as time or frequency domain reflectometer tensiometer piezometer and instrumented wells are often used to study field infiltration in loess tu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 the single ring infiltrometer sri is commonly used to estimate the in situ hydraulic properties reynolds and elrick 1990 bagarello et al 2016 2014 and the variation of the tension infiltrometer is employed to discuss the subsurface heterogeneous soil structure logsdon 1997 however most conventional methods provide point data along the depth or surface which cannot account for the spatial variability of soil water content swc in part due to the presence of pf and they often use sensors that are destructive to the intact soil structure and may produce additional infiltration paths michot et al 2003 rothe et al 1997 the electrical resistivity tomography ert technique has been employed to study variations in soil structure swc fluid composition samouëlian et al 2006 and or solute transport olsen et al 1999 sawyer et al 2015 ert was also used to assess swc in croplands beff et al 2013 michot et al 2003 and to characterize slope hydrological response to different landslide events peng et al 2019 as well as the hydrological process in a loess slope zeng et al 2016 time lapse ert measurements can be used for monitoring subsurface hydrological processes such as the hydrological impact on pore water pressure affecting shallow slope stability zieher et al 2017 or for identifying flow behaviors in a weathered clay shale slope travelletti et al 2012 the applications of ert are versatile yet they are primarily focusing on hydrological variations at a hillslope scale with limited ert data reported on water infiltration in natural loess at a localized scale under controlled influx in this study a sri test was coupled with time lapse ert monitoring to analyze the in situ infiltration process in loess above a preexisting preferential path under a controlled influx with the main objectives of 1 assessing the applicability of time lapse ert data on monitoring infiltration pattern in loess and 2 analyzing the effects of preexisting preferential channels on infiltration process in loess at a localized scale 2 study area the hft terrace is an arid loess terrace located in the loess plateau of china fig 1 a the primary crops are vegetables wheat corn and fruit trees cropland covers about 80 of the surface area of hft with an average annual water consumption for irrigation of 7 106 m3 qi et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 the average annual precipitation in hft is 310 mm with 70 80 concentrated from july to september whereas the average annual evaporation reaches 1689 mm geological environmental monitoring institute of gansu 2011 fig 1b such dry conditions have resulted in a long lasting flood irrigation program on the terrace where irrigating water is pumped from the adjacent yellow river and distributed over the surface by gravity the flood irrigation applies 8 to 10 times per year with a depth of about 10 cm for each irrigation activity which increases the groundwater level in hft at the average rate of 0 4 m yr 1 qi et al 2018 data from a monitoring borehole b1 in fig 1a indicates that the groundwater level has increased about 1 0 m from 2015 to 2017 with 14 reported landslides showing strong temporal correlation between slope failures and irrigation activities fig 1c the terrace consists of four layers in sequence of silty loess thickness 26 48 m alluvial clay 3 20 m fluvial gravel 1 6 m and the bedrock comprises sandstone with mudstone partings and the bedding plane dipping 135 11 fig 2 a and 2b sub vertical joints are observed in the loess layer and provide preferential conduits for groundwater recharge the apparent spring lines are visible at the slope surface along the edge of the terrace with seepage of groundwater at or near the bottom of the loess layer the failure surfaces of landslides in hft develop in the loess layer and subsequently propagate into the underlying layers at different depths depending on primarily included angle between the principle sliding direction and the bedrock dip peng et al 2018 the test site is located at the edge of the terrace in the crown area of the ch 7 landslide fig 2c location in hft see fig 1a dense distribution of crown cracks is commonly found prior to landslides in hft peng et al 2018 as exemplified by the dc 2 flowslide fig 2d and 2e conchoidal tensile cracks are common near the crest and are resulted from the unloading of the previous failures tensile cracks can form preferential channels for irrigating water that are vital to the saturation of the base of the loess layer and the development of failure surfaces the openings of the tensile cracks typically exceed 20 cm within 3 m of the crown but they range from 1 cm to over 1 m near the landslide crown with evident vertical offsets qi et al 2018 these preexisting cracks provide an ideal condition to study the effects of preferential path in the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil physics properties loess contains predominately silt sized quartz grains greater than75 that are bonded by various cementation agents e g salt fan et al 2017 water film derbyshire and mellors 1988 pye 1995 carbonate milodowski et al 2015 and clay smalley et al 2006 the bulk density of loess in hft was 1 43 g cm 3 with the plastic limit liquid limit and saturated water content of 18 27 and 35 respectively the in situ water content was 8 with a low degree of saturation the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity in a loess slope is relatively low in the order of 1 83 10 5 to 8 63 10 4 cm s 1 wang et al 2018 which can be several times greater than that in a horizontal direction without pf the mf in loess usually presents a semi circular wetting front and infiltrates into the upper subsurface with a limited depth due to the relatively low hydraulic conductivity tu et al 2009 however a preferential path can alter such a infiltration pattern and induce a more complicated wetting front shape wang et al 2018 3 2 single ring infiltrometer in this work an in house designed sri was used to study infiltration process in loess by monitoring the infiltration rate and regulating influx during the field test the standard double ring infiltrometer may cause different infiltration rate for the inner and outer rings which results in difficulties in estimating the field infiltration rate and its relationship with the time lapse ert results fig 3 represents the schematic setup of the sri apparatus the main components of the sri included an infiltrometer cylinder and a water tank with a pump placed at an automatic scale the infiltrometer and water tank were connected by the inlet and outlet pipes the inlet pipe provided a continuous inflow and a constant water head was maintained by the outlet pipe i e 10 cm to simulate the flood irrigation the sri apparatus was carefully inserted into the soil with 5 cm without disturbing the original soil structure as the top loess is relatively unconsolidated and porous a fine sand layer was laid at the bottom of the infiltrometer cylinder to ensure uniform infiltration and a layer of coarse sand was laid upon the fine sand layer to avoid the water wash to the fine sand a salt content of 15 g kg 1 was used for the infiltrated water to increase the contrast of electrical resistivity between dry and wetted loess the conventional constant head sri overestimates the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s by assuming it is equal to the infiltration ratio of the cylinder q s which neglect the effects of soil hydraulic properties ring radius ring insertion and the depth of ponding reynolds and elrick 1990 suggest that the k s of a constant head sri test can be expressed as 1 k s q s h c 1 d c 2 d 1 α c 1 d c 2 d 1 where q s q s π a 2 cm min 1 represents the infiltration ratio of the cylinder q s ml min 1 is the infiltration flow rate which is determined by the changes in weight of water over time i e 207 ml min 1 a cm is the inner radius of the cylinder i e 25 cm h cm is the water head in the cylinder to simulate the local flood irrigation i e 10 cm d cm is the depth of intrusion in the soil i e 5 cm and α cm 1 is the sorptive number of the soil which is estimated as 0 04 cm 1 for clay reynolds and elrick 1990 c 1 and c 2 are dimensionless constants that are estimated to be 0 316 π and 0 184 π for h 5 cm and d 3 cm respectively youngs et al 1993 3 3 test site characterization the ert measurement was conducted with a wda 1 apparatus chongqing china with a single channel 2 d electrical survey system with the wenner configuration ling et al 2016 each ert measurement lasted about 30 min the resistivity data was inverted in the res2dinv software using the least squares method loke and barker 1996 all electrodes were placed through satellite based positioning systems using a real time kinematic rtk device and the two electrodes within the sri cylinder were covered with plastic bags to avoid the short circuits during the measurements fig 4 a shows the arrangement of three ert profiles that were surveyed to select an optimal sri test location including p1 purple line p2 blue line and p3 red line p2 was aligned with p1 behind the scarp of ch 7 landslide and p3 was perpendicular to p1 and p2 as a key parameter affecting the resolution of the results the unit electrodes spacing ues was adjusted according to the objective of the profile a combination of ues was used here to ensure the survey depths and resolutions table 1 p1 had a ues of 3 m with the maximum survey depth of 35 0 m and a resolution of 1 5 m it was to detect the gwt behind the scarp of the landslide p2 was to identify the preexisting subsurface anomalies that might form preferential paths for the test and it had a ues of 0 5 m with the survey depth and resolution of 6 m and 0 25 m respectively p3 was to assess the spatial variability of subsurface cracks prior to the sri test and to monitor infiltrate process during the test a small ues of 0 2 m was used for p3 with a resolution of 0 1 m and a survey depth of 2 1 m at the center of profile the apparent electrical resistivity for the gwt in hft is about 14 0 ωm peng et al 2019 which supports our finding on the gwt behind the scarp of the ch 7 landslide with a fluctuation of about 10 m in depth according to the ert result of p1 fig 4b fig 4c shows the uav djiphantom3pro imagery of the test site acquired at a height of 20 m and the ert result of p2 which indicates an intense development of crown cracks at the test site and identifies at least 7 surface cracks along p2 with decreasing openings as moving further away from the scarp the ert result interpreted 9 subsurface anomalies with extremely high electrical resistivity of about 80 000 ωm comparisons with the uav data revealed 3 hidden near surface cracks in regions a b and c i e f1 f2 and f4 in fig 4c that may form the potential preferential channels for the infiltration test especially since irrigation tends to avoid areas with visible surface cracks fig 4d presents the uav data and the ert results of p3 that passed through crack f1 and was perpendicular to p2 the sri test location was above crack f1 as it was situated closer to the cropland and further away from other surface cracks the selected area for analyzing infiltration process was below the sri at the center of p3 with a width of 2 0 m and a depth of 2 1 m to encompass the areas affected by infiltration in light of the ert results an exploratory trench length 2 m and depth 1 8 m was excavated to observe the subsurface flow behavior at the sri location along p3 after the test was completed ten soil samples were retrieved in the trench to determine the swc using the alcohol drying method including 4 samples at the centerline of the sri location at the depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m and 0 7 m respectively and 6 samples at the left side of the centerline at the depth of 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively 3 4 time lapse electrical resistivity tomography a total of 10 ert measurements were conducted along p3 an ert measurement was conducted along p3 prior to the test to provide a reference measurement three subsequent ert measurements were conducted within the first 1 5 h of the test with 6 additional ert measurements conducted in the next 6 h i e one measurement per hour each measurement lasted for 30 mins the ert measurements were collected within 8 h and the positions of the sri and ert apparatuses remained unchanged throughout the test it was assumed that the change of resistivity was mainly attributed to the changing swc and the soil pores were filled with water when no relative change in electrical resistivity was detected even the soil might not be at a saturated state as each ert survey lasted about 30 mins it reflected the global change of swc during each measurement no apparent surface settlement was found during the test the relative change of electrical resistivity to the reference resistivity provides more meaningful insights due to the large variability of the absolute electrical resistivity zieher et al 2017 the relative change of electrical resistivity rc can be obtained from 2 rc 1 r t r 0 100 where r 0 ωm is the reference electrical resistivity r t ωm is the resistivity at any given measurement during the test and t represents the time step ranges from 1 to 9 the rc increased as water filled the soil pores which decreased the electrical resistivity and it reflected the accumulated variations to the global reference throughout the test the sequential change of electrical resistivity δ r c is the difference in electrical resistivity between any two consecutive time steps which is expressed as 3 δ r c rc t rc t 1 where rc t and rc t 1 are the relative change of the t th and the t 1 th measurement to the reference measurement respectively the isoline of rc and δ r c were processed in surfer golden software the original dataset was preprocessed by using the kriging gridding method the change rate of δ r c describes the change rate of the swc which offers comparison with the measured infiltration rate from the sri test the change rate r δ r c min 1 is obtained from 4 r δ r c δ r c t where t min is the duration between the consecutive measurements the results of p3 were employed to discuss the uncertainty excluding the central area affected by the sri test fig 4d the mean rc and δ r c of these ert measurements were used to characterize the variations in the background along p3 throughout the test 4 results and interpretation 4 1 uncertainty characterization fig 5 a delineates the mean rc along p3 during the test it indicates a large localized cumulative variation at the uppermost 0 25 m the average of the mean rc at 0 1 m was about 27 similar observation can be found for the mean δ r c with a greater variation at the uppermost 0 2 m fig 5b fig 5c plots the change of the mean rc along p3 with depth at each time step showing the maximum reduction of 37 the background rc was considered less than 35 with neglectable change of water content in the attempt to better characterize the infiltration process fig 5d presents the change of the mean δ r c along p3 with depth at each time step showing the maximum reduction of about 8 the average of the mean δ r c at 0 1 m was about 6 fig 5b and thus the background δ r c was considered less than 6 therefore more conservative value of rc 35 and δ r c 6 were considered adequate to identify key areas of water content change in the infiltration process given the variations in the ert results the magnitude of variations of the mean rc and the mean δ r c appeared to be reduced after 3 5h suggesting the subsurface soil was approaching a more stabilized state the overall large variation along p3 was in part due to the low global electrical resistivity of loess at the test location where the peak resistivity was about 800 ωm fig 4d a small reduction in the absolute electrical resistivity fig 5e and 5f might result in a large relative reduction the near surface variation might be attributed to the soil properties the standard data inversion method clément et al 2009 as well as the effects of surface temperature which was discussed in the later section 4 2 infiltration rate estimation fig 6 shows the changes of the estimated infiltration rate during the sri test the reduction of water in the tank was recorded by the scale which represents the volume of infiltrated water no surface runoff was observed throughout the test the initial infiltration rate was distinctly higher within the first 0 5h as the soil was considerably dry the infiltration rate stabilized after the initial phase at an average rate of 207 ml min 1 with some variations 30 ml min 1 the k s value of 6 67 10 4 cm s 1 was derived from eq 1 the r δ r c in consecutive measurements are shown in fig 6 the change of r δ r c agreed with the change of infiltration rate in general with a peak of 55 86 min 1 in the initial phase followed by a rapid reduction and stabilization the lowest r δ r c of 2 8 min 1 was found at the end of the test the variation of infiltration rate could be largely ascribed to the initial swc and the subsurface heterogeneous structure logsdon 1997 the initial high infiltration rate and r δ r c suggested an abrupt infiltration of dry soil and ingress of water in the near surface preferential paths 4 3 evolution of infiltration patterns fig 7 presents the evolution of the rc isoline that delineates a 2 d profile of the enhanced relative change in resistivity during the test the variation of rc provided an indication on the spatial and temporal changes of the swc and thus reflected the infiltration process and flow pattern with a constant head influx the near surface rc isoline exhibited a gradual downward propagation in a semi circular wetting front reaching up to 0 4 m in depth below the sri which represented a more uniform mf due to gravitational attraction an instant relative reduction in electrical resistivity was seen at the beginning of the test extending diagonally from the wetting front to the left the ert measurements was not able to capture the development of pf due to the rapid water transmission along the preexisting preferential path but the spatial distribution of the rc isoline clearly indicated the existence of such a preferential path which contributed the occurrence of pf the possible pf exhibited continuous downward movement up to about 1 4 m in depth and extends to the boundary of the observation window no evident pf was found at the right of the mf boundary suggesting the preexisting preferential channel might be confined to the left of the profile lateral flow lf as indicated by the lateral propagation of rc isoline was seen around the near surface after about 3 5h of the test fig 8 a depicts the progressing flow boundaries from the evolution of the rc isoline little reduction in rc was found after the 75 isoline approached 0 4 m in depth such an observation suggested that rc 75 could conceptually represent the mf wetting front since it reflected a high degree of saturation as compared to the neighboring area the higher rc 75 represented the mf regime and the lower rc 35 75 represented a flow regime that appeared to be affected by pf as well as mf such a flow pattern emerged after the development of pf in this work and revealed a transformation from preferential to matrix flow i e pmf these temporal variations of rc suggested that pmf could emerge at an early stage of the infiltration process and it can propagate considerably deeper than the mf the subtle lateral movement of the wetting front was also captured by the rc isolines the temporal progression of rc with depth illustrated the development of different flow patterns during the test fig 8b 8f for all five cross sections the peak rc appeared to be within 0 4 m in depth due to the higher water content at near surface and it was reduced to 35 at about 0 9 m in depth the rc at the centerline was largely affected by the near surface mf fig 8b as it reached 98 at the top of the profile after 3 5h indicating a saturated state at the near surface fig 8c shows the peak rc at 0 4 m due to the initial development of pf on the left the steady increase of rc over time indicated the progressing boundary of the pmf fig 8d and fig 8e are within the diameter of the sri and exhibiting similar trends as compared to the centerline fig 8f represents the flow profile of the rightmost cross section where the rc was considerably lower with no apparent development of pf it was postulated that the pf provided significant contributions to the large variation of infiltration rate at the beginning of the test and it continued to affect the infiltration process by gradually progressing downwards through the form of pmf into the deeper unsaturated soils over time while the vertical propagation of mf stagnated at about 0 4 m 4 4 time step progression of subsurface flow the δ r c reflects the locations with high contrast of water content from two consecutive time steps as shown in fig 9 the maximum difference between any two consecutive measurements from 0 5 to 1 0h fig 9b to 6 5 7 5h fig 9i was less than 18 the initial δ r c of 0 0 0 5h fig 9a was identical to the initial rc fig 7a with the maximum value of about 80 which indicated that the mf wetting front moved downwards and at the same time resulted in a sharp increase of water content to the left of mf due to pf fig 9b shows a concentrated movement of mf during 0 5 1 0h fig 9c and fig 9d shows a sharp increase of water content between 0 1 and 0 4 m in depth near the surface in addition to a visibly rise of water content below the preexisting preferential path that was induced by pmf the increase of water content due to pmf appeared to last from 1 0h to 4 5h during which the near surface infiltration was governed by mf fig 7c 7f as the soil approaching a fully saturated state in the mf area and the preferential paths were filled with water increase of water content was seen below 0 1 m outside of the sri boundary after 4 5h fig 9g 9i because the infiltration in the late stage was dominated by the near surface lf in part due to the higher hydraulic gradient introduced by the dry loess on both sides of the near surface fig 10 a illustrates the flow profiles at different time steps with δ r c greater than 6 which better characterize the change of water content between two consecutive time steps evident increase of water content was observed at the near surface and in the preexisting preferential path at the early stage of the test whereas downward propagation of pmf appeared to dominate the infiltration between 1 0 and 3 5h the δ r c profiles at the left of the sri boundary indicated an abrupt change occurred at between 0 4 and 0 8 m in depth as the results of pmf fig 10c similar trend of δ r c can be found around the centerline fig 10b 10d and 10e with considerably higher δ r c in the near surface due to mf the higher δ r c within 0 3 m in depth at the late stage can be ascribed to lf as shown in fig 10c and 10f the δ r c plot indicated the significant effect of the preexisting preferential path and the subsequent pmf on the increase of water content in the deeper subsurface 4 5 field validation an exploratory trench was excavated after the test which halved the sri test location and aligns with the survey line p3 by combining the field observation and ert measurements two apparent cracks f1 and f2 two voids c1 and c2 and a block of dense soil mass m1 were found below the test location fig 11 locations of the electrical resistivity anomalies in the reference measurement aligned with the locations of f1 and m1 fig 11a indicating that f1 formed the preexisting preferential path the voids c1 and c2 were not fully distinguishable in the reference data the reference measurement also showed a small anomaly underneath f1 about 1 m below the surface which suggested that a small discontinuity e g macropore may be present this small anomaly may not overlap the exact location of f2 found in the trench but no apparent effects of f2 or this anomaly on the infiltration process were observed the infiltration pattern supported the development of pf through the preexisting preferential path at the beginning of the test and the subsequent development of pmf fig 11b the dense soil mass was visibly dry and intact in structure as compared to the surrounding soil and it acted as an obstacle to the infiltration process with a seemingly lower local permeability fig 11b and 11d the flow characteristics were further validated by obtaining the water content of soil samples retrieved at different depth in the trench fig 11c the water content appeared to be above 34 within the mf zone and about 30 at the mf wetting front of which the boundary was represented by l1 the water content at a saturated state in the test location was 35 as water in the preferential path f1 progressed downwards and transferred into an unsaturated pmf a gradual decrease of water content with depth was found in the pmf zone as the wetting front l2 reached a depth of 1 4 m indicating that a preexisting preferential path cannot maintain a saturated state during the test the field observation differed from the ert results in the deeper subsurface the infiltration pattern of the ert result showed that a high rc isoline extended from the preexisting preferential path diagonally further into the deeper soil whereas the plotted wetting front by visual interpretation suggested that pmf progressed more vertically downwards below f1 the reference ert data showed an elongated anomaly diagonally below f1 this might suggest the presence of another crack that was not visible in the trench and not connected to f1 which might result in the error in the ert results fig 11b the overall wetting front plotted by visual interpretation fig 11d appeared to be deeper than the apparent ert results fig 11b such a difference may also be attributed to the changes occurred during the trench excavation approx 3h the resolution of the ert measurement and the uncertainty induced by the saltwater inevitably the disturbance during the excavation can generate negative effects on the accuracy of the subsurface soil profile 5 discussion 5 1 resolution and uncertainties of the measurement previous studies on water content dynamics typically apply a ues ranging from 0 01to 0 05 m for high resolution in laboratory tests table 2 a ues ranging from 0 5 to 5 m is commonly employed for field scale mapping and or monitoring which provides a resolution ranging from 0 25 to 2 5 m that may neglect the influence of small subsurface cracks the ert results in this work showed that a combination of ues i e 0 2 3 m was able to provide effective means to monitor field infiltration process in which a large ues was used to evaluate plot scale information for the test site at a low resolution and a small ues was to gather localized test data at a high resolution notwithstanding the inherent variabilities in the subsurface it is apparent that a ues of 0 2 m was sufficient to capture the key preexisting anomalies that affected the infiltration process in this test fig 12 a presents the variation of surface temperature during the test which may influence the ert measurement the daily temperature was obtained by the meteorological station about 500 m to the test site at the borehole b1 see fig 1 the surface temperature increased for more than 7 c within 3h prior to the test and for about 6 c during the first 3h of the test fig 12b shows an intensified variation of mean δ r c with increasing temperature from the start to the first 2 5h of the test with an apparent decreasing trend as temperature decreased which conformed closely to the results discussed in fig 5d such a variation in the background which potentially precluded from the effects of infiltration may be ascribed to the continual decrease of electrical resistivity with an increasing temperature due to ion agitation samouëlian et al 2006 the record of soil temperature is typically required to correct ert measurement that lasts over several days brunet et al 2010 travelletti et al 2012 however this result shows that day time fluctuation of surface temperature can also produce an apparent variability in the measurement in silt dominated loess such a variability can cause negative impact on the results of ert measurements especially if accurate quantitative interpretations are needed 5 2 effects of preferential path on infiltration in hft preferential path promotes vertical infiltration and discharge in slopes köhne and mohanty 2005 mulungu et al 2005 preferential paths are omnipresent in loess and their effects on infiltration process and in particular on pf requires further analyses gravitational attraction and matric suction are the primary factors governing infiltration without considering preferential paths levine and salvucci 1999 rahimi et al 2010 this may not provide an accurate representation of the infiltration process in hft due to the dense distribution of cracks and macro pores which can form potential preferential paths to accelerate infiltration zeng et al 2016 studied the groundwater responses to flood irrigation in hft and indicated that water can infiltrate directly through sinkholes which acted as preferential paths and recharge the groundwater in the terrace the results of this work suggested that the preexisting cracks promoted infiltration not only through a direct ingress of pf but also a resultant pmf that infiltrated into the deeper soil it was postulated that the depth of pmf depends on the depth of the preexisting preferential path however depending on the size of the preferential path a pmf is unlikely to transfer into pf if a preferential path was within the area of influence of that pmf the field observation in this work was not adequate to support the hypothesis that distant preexisting preferential paths can be connected by the pmf the preferred flood irrigation in hft was required to maintain the minimum distance of 10 m from the edge of the terrace to mitigate crack developments and landslides the results of this study show that this standard practice fails to consider the preexisting subsurface cracks and macro pores which can permit rapid transmission of irrigating water so that the flood irrigation provides little benefits to the roots of the crops 6 conclusions an sri test was conducted with a controlled influx on the heifangtai terrace to study the effects of preexisting preferential paths on infiltration process in loess the test was monitored by using time lapse ert measurements the ert results were interpreted to analyze the infiltration characteristics and flow movement above a hidden subsurface crack the subsurface anomalies and the end of test infiltration pattern were further validated by an exploratory trench with water content obtained at different depth the results showed that infiltration pattern under the influence of preferential path can be effectively monitored by time lapse ert with a combined ues for measurement in addition to robust field validation however the effects of excavation on identifying subsurface features cannot be excluded the results suggested that the preexisting preferential path provided rapid water transmission in the form of preferential flow which subsequently transferred into a more matrix dominated unsaturated flow namely preferential to matrix flow as it continued to progress downwards into the deeper soil at the same time the wetting front of the near surface matrix flow continued to progress downwards until it stagnated at about 0 4 m in depth these results provided field evidence on the infiltration process in deeper loess layer through a localized near surface preferential path while conforming to the observations on the intact loess where infiltration was limited to shallow surface even under prolonged water influx e g tu et al 2009 the results also indicated that the effects of temperature on ert measurement may not be neglected in loess under the presence of substantial temperature increase even the

5078,the effect of preferential flow pf in loess is of direct interest as flood irrigation is commonly found in loess regions where precipitation is scarce this study was to assess the applicability of time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert data on monitoring infiltration in loess and to analyze the effects of preexisting preferential path on infiltration process at a localized scale an in situ single ring infiltrometer sri test was conducted above a preexisting near surface crack under a constant influx 10 cm water head for 8h and the test was monitored by the means of 2 d time lapse ert and validated by an exploratory trench the ert results observed some increasing uncertainties in the electrical resistivity in part due to daily temperature variation however they showed that the infiltration process under the presence of preferential path can be effectively monitored by time lapse ert with a combination of unit electrode spacing ues the test results showed a high relative reduction of electrical resistivity 80 due to matrix flow mf and pf within 0 0 5h of the test and followed by a transformation of preferential flow to a more matrix dominated unsaturated flow i e preferential to matrix flow pmf with continuous downward progression into the deeper subsurface greater than 1 2 m while mf stagnated at the near surface about 0 4 m the results suggested that the presence of even a near surface preferential path significantly accelerate the infiltration into the deeper loess by the means of pmf as compared to observed slow infiltration of pure matrix flow in

semiarid areas are sensitive to anthropogenic changes in land use especially under long term irrigations heifangtai hft is a loess terrace adjacent to the yellow river where communal irrigation began in 1968 irrigating water raises the groundwater table gwt in the overlying loess layer dai et al 1999 jin and dai 2007 which has induced more than 200 loess related landslides on the margin of the terrace peng et al 2018 the landslides have resulted in slope retreat along the margin of hft at a rate of 0 024 km2 yr 1 about 3 annual terrace depletion and have caused significant impact to the local community series of laboratory tests on the mechanical behaviors of the hft malan loess emphasize the driving effects of the irrigation induced groundwater recharge on landslides xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2014 a failure mechanism for multi staged retrogressive flowslide in loess is proposed by qi et al 2018 in which the increasing groundwater level causes strain softening at the base of the loess layer and a localized slope failure and in turn impedes groundwater drainage at the slope surface such a localized slope failure can result in a drained to undrained shearing transition with convergence of groundwater to the landslide scarp as a new hydraulic gradient is introduced while such an instability process indicates that irrigation acts as the primary cause of the landslides in hft the infiltration process in loess is often neglected within the scope of landslide research previous studies on in situ infiltration in loess suggest that the infiltration depth is typically limited to shallow soil with little effects on the perched groundwater in deep soil tu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 indicate that the infiltration depth in intact loess is about 3 m under a daily precipitation of 120 mm huang et al 2017 and huang et al 2020 show that the groundwater recharge rate is about 55 100 mm yr 1 in a loess terrace which yield a duration of 160 400 yrs for precipitation to reach the groundwater table according to the chloride mass balance these observations focus on the infiltration process that is governed by matrix flow mf due to gravitational attraction and matric suction without addressing the effects of preferential paths zeng et al 2016 indicate that the sinkholes in hft can form preferential channels for irrigating water to infiltrate directly into the deep soil while the mf stagnates within less than 5 m in the near surface feng et al 2020 and li et al 2018 analyze the micro scale vertical joints in loess samples by using micro ct scans and indicate that the joints can promote preferential flow pf with the well developed joint systems that are commonly found in the malan loess in hft derbyshire 2001 mf and pf are likely to be concomitant as the sub vertical joints form conduits for rapid water transmission however limited studies address the interplays of pf and mf in loess under long term irrigation while column tests on remolded loess can provide some insights on the infiltration process e g hou et al 2018 the complex structure of intact loess results in difficulties to replicate the field conditions in a laboratory setting field monitoring of the infiltration process provides means to directly characterize the flow behaviors monitoring methods such as time or frequency domain reflectometer tensiometer piezometer and instrumented wells are often used to study field infiltration in loess tu et al 2009 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 the single ring infiltrometer sri is commonly used to estimate the in situ hydraulic properties reynolds and elrick 1990 bagarello et al 2016 2014 and the variation of the tension infiltrometer is employed to discuss the subsurface heterogeneous soil structure logsdon 1997 however most conventional methods provide point data along the depth or surface which cannot account for the spatial variability of soil water content swc in part due to the presence of pf and they often use sensors that are destructive to the intact soil structure and may produce additional infiltration paths michot et al 2003 rothe et al 1997 the electrical resistivity tomography ert technique has been employed to study variations in soil structure swc fluid composition samouëlian et al 2006 and or solute transport olsen et al 1999 sawyer et al 2015 ert was also used to assess swc in croplands beff et al 2013 michot et al 2003 and to characterize slope hydrological response to different landslide events peng et al 2019 as well as the hydrological process in a loess slope zeng et al 2016 time lapse ert measurements can be used for monitoring subsurface hydrological processes such as the hydrological impact on pore water pressure affecting shallow slope stability zieher et al 2017 or for identifying flow behaviors in a weathered clay shale slope travelletti et al 2012 the applications of ert are versatile yet they are primarily focusing on hydrological variations at a hillslope scale with limited ert data reported on water infiltration in natural loess at a localized scale under controlled influx in this study a sri test was coupled with time lapse ert monitoring to analyze the in situ infiltration process in loess above a preexisting preferential path under a controlled influx with the main objectives of 1 assessing the applicability of time lapse ert data on monitoring infiltration pattern in loess and 2 analyzing the effects of preexisting preferential channels on infiltration process in loess at a localized scale 2 study area the hft terrace is an arid loess terrace located in the loess plateau of china fig 1 a the primary crops are vegetables wheat corn and fruit trees cropland covers about 80 of the surface area of hft with an average annual water consumption for irrigation of 7 106 m3 qi et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 the average annual precipitation in hft is 310 mm with 70 80 concentrated from july to september whereas the average annual evaporation reaches 1689 mm geological environmental monitoring institute of gansu 2011 fig 1b such dry conditions have resulted in a long lasting flood irrigation program on the terrace where irrigating water is pumped from the adjacent yellow river and distributed over the surface by gravity the flood irrigation applies 8 to 10 times per year with a depth of about 10 cm for each irrigation activity which increases the groundwater level in hft at the average rate of 0 4 m yr 1 qi et al 2018 data from a monitoring borehole b1 in fig 1a indicates that the groundwater level has increased about 1 0 m from 2015 to 2017 with 14 reported landslides showing strong temporal correlation between slope failures and irrigation activities fig 1c the terrace consists of four layers in sequence of silty loess thickness 26 48 m alluvial clay 3 20 m fluvial gravel 1 6 m and the bedrock comprises sandstone with mudstone partings and the bedding plane dipping 135 11 fig 2 a and 2b sub vertical joints are observed in the loess layer and provide preferential conduits for groundwater recharge the apparent spring lines are visible at the slope surface along the edge of the terrace with seepage of groundwater at or near the bottom of the loess layer the failure surfaces of landslides in hft develop in the loess layer and subsequently propagate into the underlying layers at different depths depending on primarily included angle between the principle sliding direction and the bedrock dip peng et al 2018 the test site is located at the edge of the terrace in the crown area of the ch 7 landslide fig 2c location in hft see fig 1a dense distribution of crown cracks is commonly found prior to landslides in hft peng et al 2018 as exemplified by the dc 2 flowslide fig 2d and 2e conchoidal tensile cracks are common near the crest and are resulted from the unloading of the previous failures tensile cracks can form preferential channels for irrigating water that are vital to the saturation of the base of the loess layer and the development of failure surfaces the openings of the tensile cracks typically exceed 20 cm within 3 m of the crown but they range from 1 cm to over 1 m near the landslide crown with evident vertical offsets qi et al 2018 these preexisting cracks provide an ideal condition to study the effects of preferential path in the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil physics properties loess contains predominately silt sized quartz grains greater than75 that are bonded by various cementation agents e g salt fan et al 2017 water film derbyshire and mellors 1988 pye 1995 carbonate milodowski et al 2015 and clay smalley et al 2006 the bulk density of loess in hft was 1 43 g cm 3 with the plastic limit liquid limit and saturated water content of 18 27 and 35 respectively the in situ water content was 8 with a low degree of saturation the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity in a loess slope is relatively low in the order of 1 83 10 5 to 8 63 10 4 cm s 1 wang et al 2018 which can be several times greater than that in a horizontal direction without pf the mf in loess usually presents a semi circular wetting front and infiltrates into the upper subsurface with a limited depth due to the relatively low hydraulic conductivity tu et al 2009 however a preferential path can alter such a infiltration pattern and induce a more complicated wetting front shape wang et al 2018 3 2 single ring infiltrometer in this work an in house designed sri was used to study infiltration process in loess by monitoring the infiltration rate and regulating influx during the field test the standard double ring infiltrometer may cause different infiltration rate for the inner and outer rings which results in difficulties in estimating the field infiltration rate and its relationship with the time lapse ert results fig 3 represents the schematic setup of the sri apparatus the main components of the sri included an infiltrometer cylinder and a water tank with a pump placed at an automatic scale the infiltrometer and water tank were connected by the inlet and outlet pipes the inlet pipe provided a continuous inflow and a constant water head was maintained by the outlet pipe i e 10 cm to simulate the flood irrigation the sri apparatus was carefully inserted into the soil with 5 cm without disturbing the original soil structure as the top loess is relatively unconsolidated and porous a fine sand layer was laid at the bottom of the infiltrometer cylinder to ensure uniform infiltration and a layer of coarse sand was laid upon the fine sand layer to avoid the water wash to the fine sand a salt content of 15 g kg 1 was used for the infiltrated water to increase the contrast of electrical resistivity between dry and wetted loess the conventional constant head sri overestimates the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s by assuming it is equal to the infiltration ratio of the cylinder q s which neglect the effects of soil hydraulic properties ring radius ring insertion and the depth of ponding reynolds and elrick 1990 suggest that the k s of a constant head sri test can be expressed as 1 k s q s h c 1 d c 2 d 1 α c 1 d c 2 d 1 where q s q s π a 2 cm min 1 represents the infiltration ratio of the cylinder q s ml min 1 is the infiltration flow rate which is determined by

cm is the depth of intrusion in the soil i e 5 cm and α cm 1 is the sorptive number of the soil which is estimated as 0 04 cm 1 for clay reynolds and elrick 1990 c 1 and c 2 are dimensionless constants that are estimated to be 0 316 π and 0 184 π for h 5 cm and d 3 cm respectively youngs et al 1993 3 3 test site characterization the ert measurement was conducted with a wda 1 apparatus chongqing china with a single channel 2 d electrical survey system with the wenner configuration ling et al 2016 each ert measurement lasted about 30 min the resistivity data was inverted in the res2dinv software using the least squares method loke and barker 1996 all electrodes were placed through satellite based positioning systems using a real time kinematic rtk device and the two electrodes within the sri cylinder were covered with plastic bags to avoid the short circuits during the measurements fig 4 a shows the arrangement of three ert profiles that were surveyed to select an optimal sri test location including p1 purple line p2 blue line and p3 red line p2 was aligned with p1 behind the scarp of ch 7 landslide and p3 was perpendicular to p1 and p2 as a key parameter affecting the resolution of the results the unit electrodes spacing ues was adjusted according to the objective of the profile a combination of ues was used here to ensure the survey depths and resolutions table 1 p1 had a ues of 3 m with the maximum survey depth of 35 0 m and a resolution of 1 5 m it was to detect the gwt behind the scarp of the landslide p2 was to identify the preexisting subsurface anomalies that might form preferential paths for the test and it had a ues of 0 5 m with the survey depth and resolution of 6 m and 0 25 m respectively p3 was to assess the spatial variability of subsurface cracks prior to the sri test and to monitor infiltrate process during the test a small ues of 0 2 m was used for p3 with a resolution of 0 1 m and a survey depth of 2 1 m at the center of profile the apparent electrical resistivity for the gwt in hft is about 14 0 ωm peng et al 2019 which supports our finding on the gwt behind the scarp of the ch 7 landslide with a fluctuation of about 10 m in depth according to the ert result of p1 fig 4b fig 4c shows the uav djiphantom3pro imagery of the test site acquired at a height of 20 m and the ert result of p2 which indicates an intense development of crown cracks at the test site and identifies at least 7 surface cracks along p2 with decreasing openings as moving further away from the scarp the ert result interpreted 9 subsurface anomalies with extremely high electrical resistivity of about 80 000 ωm comparisons with the uav data revealed 3 hidden near surface cracks in regions a b and c i e f1 f2 and f4 in fig 4c that may form the potential preferential channels for the infiltration test especially since irrigation tends to avoid areas with visible surface cracks fig 4d presents the uav data and the ert results of p3 that passed through crack f1 and was perpendicular to p2 the sri test location was above crack f1 as it was situated closer to the cropland and further away from other surface cracks the selected area for analyzing infiltration process was below the sri at the center of p3 with a width of 2 0 m and a depth of 2 1 m to encompass the areas affected by infiltration in light of the ert results an exploratory trench length 2 m and depth 1 8 m was excavated to observe the subsurface flow behavior at the sri location along p3 after the test was completed ten soil samples were retrieved in the trench to determine the swc using the alcohol drying method including 4 samples at the centerline of the sri location at the depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m and 0 7 m respectively and 6 samples at the left side of the centerline at the depth of 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively 3 4 time lapse electrical resistivity tomography a total of 10 ert measurements were conducted along p3 an ert measurement was conducted along p3 prior to the test to provide a reference measurement three subsequent ert measurements were conducted within the first 1 5 h of the test with 6 additional ert measurements conducted in the next 6 h i e one measurement per hour each measurement lasted for 30 mins the ert measurements were collected within 8 h and the positions of the sri and ert apparatuses remained unchanged throughout the test it was assumed that the change of resistivity was mainly attributed to the changing swc and the soil pores were filled with water when no relative change in electrical resistivity was detected even the soil might not be at a saturated state as each ert survey lasted about 30 mins it reflected the global change of swc during each measurement no apparent surface settlement was found during the test the relative change of electrical resistivity to the reference resistivity provides more meaningful insights due to the large variability of the absolute electrical resistivity zieher et al 2017 the relative change of electrical resistivity rc can be obtained from 2 rc 1 r t r 0 100 where r 0 ωm is the reference electrical resistivity r t ωm is the resistivity at any given measurement during the test and t represents the time step ranges from 1 to 9 the rc increased as water filled the soil pores which decreased the electrical resistivity and it reflected the accumulated variations to the global reference throughout the test the sequential change of electrical resistivity δ r c is the difference in electrical resistivity between any two consecutive time steps which is expressed as 3 δ r c rc t rc t 1 where rc t and rc t 1 are the relative change of the t th and the t 1 th measurement to the reference measurement respectively the isoline of rc and δ r c were processed in surfer golden software the original dataset was preprocessed by using the kriging gridding method the change rate of δ r c describes the change rate of the swc which offers comparison with the measured infiltration rate from the sri test the change rate r δ r c min 1 is obtained from 4 r δ r c δ r c t where t min is the duration between the consecutive measurements the results of p3 were employed to discuss the uncertainty excluding the central area affected by the sri test fig 4d the mean rc and δ r c of these ert measurements were used to characterize the variations in the background along p3 throughout the test 4 results and interpretation 4 1 uncertainty characterization fig 5 a delineates the mean rc along p3 during the test it indicates a large localized cumulative variation at the uppermost 0 25 m the average of the mean rc at 0 1 m was about 27 similar observation can be found for the mean δ r c with a greater variation at the uppermost 0 2 m fig 5b fig 5c plots the change of the mean rc along p3 with depth at each time step showing the maximum reduction of 37 the background rc was considered less than 35 with neglectable change of water content in the attempt to better characterize the infiltration process fig 5d presents the change of the mean δ r c along p3 with depth at each time step showing the maximum reduction of about 8 the average of the mean δ r c at 0 1 m was about 6 fig 5b and thus the background δ r c was considered less than 6 therefore more conservative value of rc 35 and δ r c 6 were considered adequate to identify key areas of water content change in the infiltration process given the variations in the ert results the magnitude of variations of the mean rc and the mean δ r c appeared to be reduced after 3 5h suggesting the subsurface soil was approaching a more stabilized state the overall large variation along p3 was in part due to the low global electrical resistivity of loess at the test location where the peak resistivity was about 800 ωm fig 4d a small reduction in the absolute electrical resistivity fig 5e and 5f might result in a large relative reduction the near surface variation might be attributed to the soil properties the standard data inversion method clément et al 2009 as well as the effects of surface temperature which was discussed in the later section 4 2 infiltration rate estimation fig 6 shows the changes of the estimated infiltration rate during the sri test the reduction of water in the tank was recorded by the scale which represents the volume of infiltrated water no surface runoff was observed throughout the test the initial infiltration rate was distinctly higher within the first 0 5h as the soil was considerably dry the infiltration rate stabilized after the initial phase at an average rate of 207 ml min 1 with some variations 30 ml min 1 the k s value of 6 67 10 4 cm s 1 was derived from eq 1 the r δ r c in consecutive measurements are shown in fig 6 the change of r δ r c agreed with the change of infiltration rate in general with a peak of 55 86 min 1 in the initial phase followed by a rapid reduction and stabilization the lowest r δ r c of 2 8 min 1 was found at the end of the test the variation of infiltration rate could be largely ascribed to the initial swc and the subsurface heterogeneous structure logsdon 1997 the initial high infiltration rate and r δ r c suggested an abrupt infiltration of dry soil and ingress of water in the near surface preferential paths 4 3 evolution of infiltration patterns fig 7 presents the evolution of the rc isoline that delineates a 2 d profile of the enhanced relative change in resistivity during the test the variation of rc provided an indication on the spatial and temporal changes of the swc and thus reflected the infiltration process and flow pattern with a constant head influx the near surface rc isoline exhibited a gradual downward propagation in a semi circular wetting front reaching up to 0 4 m in depth below the sri which represented a more uniform mf due to gravitational attraction an instant relative reduction in electrical resistivity was seen at the beginning of the test extending diagonally from the wetting front to the left the ert measurements was not able to capture the development of pf due to the rapid water transmission along the preexisting preferential path but the spatial distribution of the rc isoline clearly indicated the existence of such a preferential path which contributed the occurrence of pf the possible pf exhibited continuous downward movement up to about 1 4 m in depth and extends to the boundary of the observation window no evident pf was found at the right of the mf boundary suggesting the preexisting preferential channel might be confined to the left of the profile lateral flow lf as indicated by the lateral propagation of rc isoline was seen around the near surface after about 3 5h of the test fig 8 a depicts the progressing flow boundaries from the evolution of the rc isoline little reduction in rc was found after the 75 isoline approached 0 4 m in depth such an observation suggested that rc 75 could conceptually represent the mf wetting front since it reflected a high degree of saturation as compared to the neighboring area the higher rc 75 represented the mf regime and the lower rc 35 75 represented a flow regime that appeared to be affected by pf as well as mf such a flow pattern emerged after the development of pf in this work and revealed a transformation from preferential to matrix flow i e pmf these temporal variations of rc suggested that pmf could emerge at an early stage of the infiltration process and it can propagate considerably deeper than the mf the subtle lateral movement of the wetting front was also captured by the rc isolines the temporal progression of rc with depth illustrated the development of different flow patterns during the test fig 8b 8f for all five cross sections the peak rc appeared to be within 0 4 m in depth due to the higher water content at near surface and it was reduced to 35 at about 0 9 m in depth the rc at the centerline was largely affected by the near surface mf fig 8b as it reached 98 at the top of the profile after 3 5h indicating a saturated state at the near surface fig 8c shows the peak rc at 0 4 m due to the initial development of pf on the left the steady increase of rc over time indicated the progressing boundary of the pmf fig 8d and fig 8e are within the diameter of the sri and exhibiting similar trends as compared to the centerline fig 8f represents the flow profile of the rightmost cross section where the rc was considerably lower with no apparent development of pf it was postulated that the pf provided significant contributions to the large variation of infiltration rate at the beginning of the test and it continued to affect the infiltration process by gradually progressing downwards through the form of pmf into the deeper unsaturated soils over time while the vertical propagation of mf stagnated at about 0 4 m 4 4 time step progression of subsurface flow the δ r c reflects the locations with high contrast of water content from two consecutive time steps as shown in fig 9 the maximum difference between any two consecutive measurements from 0 5 to 1 0h fig 9b to 6 5 7 5h fig 9i was less than 18 the initial δ r c of 0 0 0 5h fig 9a was identical to the initial rc fig 7a with the maximum value of about 80 which indicated that the mf wetting front moved downwards and at the same time resulted in a sharp increase of water content to the left of mf due to pf fig 9b shows a concentrated movement of mf during 0 5 1 0h fig 9c and fig 9d shows a sharp increase of water content between 0 1 and 0 4 m in depth near the surface in addition to a visibly rise of water content below the preexisting preferential path that was induced by pmf the increase of water content due to pmf appeared to last from 1 0h to 4 5h during which the near surface infiltration was governed by mf fig 7c 7f as the soil approaching a fully saturated state in the mf area and the preferential paths were filled with water increase of water content was seen below 0 1 m outside of the sri boundary after 4 5h fig 9g 9i because the infiltration in the late stage was dominated by the near surface lf in part due to the higher hydraulic gradient introduced by the dry loess on both sides of the near surface fig 10 a illustrates the flow profiles at different time steps with δ r c greater than 6 which better characterize the change of water content between two consecutive time steps evident increase of water content was observed at the near surface and in the preexisting preferential path at the early stage of the test whereas downward propagation of pmf appeared to dominate the infiltration between 1 0 and 3 5h the δ r c profiles at the left of the sri boundary indicated an abrupt change occurred at between 0 4 and 0 8 m in depth as the results of pmf fig 10c similar trend of δ r c can be found around the centerline fig 10b 10d and 10e with considerably higher δ r c in the near surface due to mf the higher δ r c within 0 3 m in depth at the late stage can be ascribed to lf as shown in fig 10c and 10f the δ r c plot indicated the significant effect of the preexisting preferential path and the subsequent pmf on the increase of water content in the deeper subsurface 4 5 field validation an exploratory trench was excavated after the test which halved the sri test location and aligns with the survey line p3 by combining the field observation and ert measurements two apparent cracks f1 and f2 two voids c1 and c2 and a block of dense soil mass m1 were found below the test location fig 11 locations of the electrical resistivity anomalies in the reference measurement aligned with the locations of f1 and m1 fig 11a indicating that f1 formed the preexisting preferential path the voids c1 and c2 were not fully distinguishable in the reference data the reference measurement also showed a small anomaly underneath f1 about 1 m below the surface which suggested that a small discontinuity e g macropore may be present this small anomaly may not overlap the exact location of f2 found in the trench but no apparent effects of f2 or this anomaly on the infiltration process were observed the infiltration pattern supported the development of pf through the preexisting preferential path at the beginning of the test and the subsequent development of pmf fig 11b the dense soil mass was visibly dry and intact in structure as compared to the surrounding soil and it acted as an obstacle to the infiltration process with a seemingly lower local permeability fig 11b and 11d the flow characteristics were further validated by obtaining the water content of soil samples retrieved at different depth in the trench fig 11c the water content appeared to be above 34 within the mf zone and about 30 at the mf wetting front of which the boundary was represented by l1 the water content at a saturated state in the test location was 35 as water in the preferential path f1 progressed downwards and transferred into an unsaturated pmf a gradual decrease of water content with depth was found in the pmf zone as the wetting front l2 reached a depth of 1 4 m indicating that a preexisting preferential path cannot maintain a saturated state during the test the field observation differed from the ert results in the deeper subsurface the infiltration pattern of the ert result showed that a high rc isoline extended from the preexisting preferential path diagonally further into the deeper soil whereas the plotted wetting front by visual interpretation suggested that pmf progressed more vertically downwards below f1 the reference ert data showed an elongated anomaly diagonally below f1 this might suggest the presence of another crack that was not visible in the trench and not connected to f1 which might result in the error in the ert results fig 11b the overall wetting front plotted by visual interpretation fig 11d appeared to be deeper than the apparent ert results fig 11b such a difference may also be attributed to the changes occurred during the trench excavation approx 3h the resolution of the ert measurement and the uncertainty induced by the saltwater inevitably the disturbance during the excavation can generate negative effects on the accuracy of the subsurface soil profile 5 discussion 5 1 resolution and uncertainties of the measurement previous studies on water content dynamics typically apply a ues ranging from 0 01to 0 05 m for high resolution in laboratory tests table 2 a ues ranging from 0 5 to 5 m is commonly employed for field scale mapping and or monitoring which provides a resolution ranging from 0 25 to 2 5 m that may neglect the influence of small subsurface cracks the ert results in this work showed that a combination of ues i e 0 2 3 m was able to provide effective means to monitor field infiltration process in which a large ues was used to evaluate plot scale information for the test site at a low resolution and a small ues was to gather localized test data at a high resolution notwithstanding the inherent variabilities in the subsurface it is apparent that a ues of 0 2 m was sufficient to capture the key preexisting anomalies that affected the infiltration process in this test fig 12 a presents the variation of surface temperature during the test which may influence the ert measurement the daily temperature was obtained by the meteorological station about 500 m to the test site at the borehole b1 see fig 1 the surface temperature increased for more than 7 c within 3h prior to the test and for about 6 c during the first 3h of the test fig 12b shows an intensified variation of mean δ r c with increasing temperature from the start to the first 2 5h of the test with an apparent decreasing trend as temperature decreased which conformed closely to the results discussed in fig 5d such a variation in the background which potentially precluded from the effects of infiltration may be ascribed to the continual decrease of electrical resistivity with an increasing temperature due to ion agitation samouëlian et al 2006 the record of soil temperature is typically required to correct ert measurement that lasts over several days brunet et al 2010 travelletti et al 2012 however this result shows that day time fluctuation of surface temperature can also produce an apparent variability in the measurement in silt dominated loess such a variability can cause negative impact on the results of ert measurements especially if accurate quantitative interpretations are needed 5 2 effects of preferential path on infiltration in hft preferential path promotes vertical infiltration and discharge in slopes köhne and mohanty 2005 mulungu et al 2005 preferential paths are omnipresent in loess and their effects on infiltration process and in particular on pf requires further analyses gravitational attraction and matric suction are the primary factors governing infiltration without considering preferential paths levine and salvucci 1999 rahimi et al 2010 this may not provide an accurate representation of the infiltration process in hft due to the dense distribution of cracks and macro pores which can form potential preferential paths to accelerate infiltration zeng et al 2016 studied the groundwater responses to flood irrigation in hft and indicated that water can infiltrate directly through sinkholes which acted as preferential paths and recharge the groundwater in the terrace the results of this work suggested that the preexisting cracks promoted infiltration not only through a direct ingress of pf but also a resultant pmf that infiltrated into the deeper soil it was postulated that the depth of pmf depends on the depth of the preexisting preferential path however depending on the size of the preferential path a pmf is unlikely to transfer into pf if a preferential path was within the area of influence of that pmf the field observation in this work was not adequate to support the hypothesis that distant preexisting preferential paths can be connected by the pmf the preferred flood irrigation in hft was required to maintain the minimum distance of 10 m from the edge of the terrace to mitigate crack developments and landslides the results of this study show that this standard practice fails to consider the preexisting subsurface cracks and macro pores which can permit rapid transmission of irrigating water so that the flood irrigation provides little benefits to the roots of the crops 6 conclusions an sri test was conducted with a controlled influx on the heifangtai terrace to study the effects of preexisting preferential paths on infiltration process in loess the test was monitored by using time lapse ert measurements the ert results were interpreted to analyze the infiltration characteristics and flow movement above a hidden subsurface crack the subsurface anomalies and the end of test infiltration pattern were further validated by an exploratory trench with water content obtained at different depth the results showed that infiltration pattern under the influence of preferential path can be effectively monitored by time lapse ert with a combined ues for measurement in addition to robust field validation however the effects of excavation on identifying subsurface features cannot be excluded the results suggested that the preexisting preferential path provided rapid water transmission in the form of preferential flow which subsequently transferred into a more matrix dominated unsaturated flow namely preferential to matrix flow as it continued to progress downwards into the deeper soil at the same time the wetting front of the near surface matrix flow continued to progress downwards until it stagnated at about 0 4 m in depth these results provided field evidence on the infiltration process in deeper loess layer through a localized near surface preferential path while conforming to the observations on the intact loess where infiltration was limited to shallow surface even under prolonged water influx e g tu et al 2009 the results also indicated that the effects of temperature on ert measurement may not be neglected in loess under the presence of substantial temperature increase even the measurement was conducted within several hours credit authorship contribution statement kuanyao zhao conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft

5079,evapotranspiration et typically accounts for 60 70 of precipitation in rural basins of the southeastern united states since 1930 substantial reforestation of former croplands has occurred in the piedmont and appalachian highlands in this area leading to an expected increase in et and reduction in baseflow this study examines relationships between basin vegetative cover abiotic factors and water budget partitioning in 45 usgs gaged rural basins in the southeastern us data are for the 1982 2014 water years with watersheds having 40 forest cover crystalline rock aquifers minimal basin

mixed forest but has a positive relationship with et while deciduous and total forest have negative relationships with et comparison of water balance and budyko estimated et indicates that deciduous and total forest are associated with negative residuals while evergreen is not significant these results show that forest cover effects on basin et are complicated forest cover type is important for water yield management in this region and abiotic basin characteristics exert stronger control than forest cover on et keywords hydrology evapotranspiration water budgets watershed streamflow budyko 1 introduction whether and how to mitigate the hydrologic effects of climate change are pressing questions for hydrologists requiring better understanding of how rural vegetation management affects water budgets and streamflows because of higher leaf area indices higher interception and somewhat deeper rooting forest cover increases et and reduces average streamflows relative to croplands pastures and lawns in the same hydroclimatic region according to water budget studies teuling 2018 syntheses of paired watershed experiments shows forests are the most water use intensive land cover

estimates of et suggest an opposite relationship between forest and grassland et that grassland et as a fraction of precipitation is 9 higher that of forests williams et al 2012 however lysimeter measurements match the results of water budget studies and indicate that eddy flux underestimates latent heat flux from forest canopies teuling 2018 paired watershed studies typically focus on first or second order basins with species diversity limited by management thus ignoring confounding factors associated with larger scale mixed land use watersheds that cannot independently account for et variability driven by abiotic factors such as watershed elevation and latitude regardless water budget measurements are subject to substantial uncertainty and accurate and precise measurement of et is difficult and expensive a better understanding of the role of forests and forest type on the variability of water budgets across a region is needed to develop policies for maintaining hydrologic ecosystem services in the face of climate change and expanding human populations in humid environments annual evapotranspiration et typically accounts for half or more of precipitation p inputs and the amount of et partly depends on the composition and condition of vegetation types in a watershed watershed responses to afforestation or deforestation are not linear and are dependent upon watershed specific factors including soil depth and water holding capacity climate factors such as temperature precipitation and vapor pressure deficit and physiological factors such as plant rooting depth and hydraulic traits andréassian 2004 water budget responsiveness to vegetation change varies with annual precipitation and temperature and these abiotic factors are often more important than biotic ones sahin and hall 1996 stednick 1996 sanford and selnick 2013 teuling et al 2019 globally vegetative management influences watershed water budgets oudin et al 2008 but the relative effects of forest types and the scale of vegetative effects to abiotic effects are less clear forests are the dominant land cover in rural basins of the piedmont and appalachian highlands of the southeastern united states sanford and selnick 2013 wear and greis 2013 these forests are comprised of two broad functional groups deciduous and evergreen of which deciduous forest area is more than twice that of

1968 swank and douglass 1974 bosch and hewlett 1982 which is explained by biological and physiological factors that contribute to different water use behavior ford et al 2010 evergreens maintain canopy cover interception i and transpiration t throughout the year while deciduous forests lose their leaves in winter or in dry seasons evergreen and deciduous species also conduct water differently evergreens typically have higher stomatal conductance although hardwoods exhibit a wide range of conductance ford et al 2010 carlquist 2001 sperry et al 2006 in the southeast deciduous species are more dominant in riparian areas that have more available water than upland areas bosch and hewlett 1982 ford et al 2010 evergreen forests have a lower albedo and reflect less incoming solar radiation than deciduous forests and this increases evergreen et potential rosenberg 1986 however bosch and hewlett 1982 found that watersheds with evergreen forests occurred in more humid environments than deciduous forested watersheds thus confounding the relationships between et climate and land cover in the southeastern u s streamflow q has been declining gotvald 2016 stephens and bledsoe 2020 found that over the last 25 50 years the majority of southeast watersheds had decreases in average annual 7 day low flows of 4 16 mm and understanding the drivers of these decreases is important observed trends of decreasing total streamflow could be due to recurring droughts stephens and bledsoe 2020 changes in precipitation distribution reforestation increasing consumptive use changes in forest composition increasing temperatures and longer growing seasons due to climate change pourmokhtarian et al 2017 vadeboncoeur et al 2018 or a combination of these factors gotvald 2016 the region has seen an increase in forest cover since approximately 1940 when a trend of agricultural land abandonment began auch et al 2015 jackson et al 2005a jacksonet al 2005b ramankutty et al 2010 trimble et al 1987 the southeast is predicted to see a continued conversion of deciduous forests to evergreen due to increased demand for softwood timber production wear and greis 2013 trimble et al 1987 attempted to determine if water yield decreased due to afforestation of cropland from 1919 to 1967 across ten usgs gaged watersheds in the piedmont of alabama georgia and south carolina this small set of watersheds included some with large reservoirs and some with substantial urbanization and the analysis suffered from low resolution land cover estimates data gaps and confounding simultaneous increases in urbanization and afforestation auch et al 2015 trimble et al 1987 nonetheless trimble et al 1987 determined that increases in forested areas were associated with decreases in water yield and that watershed land cover modifications of 20 could be detected this is inconsistent with findings by bosch and hewlett 1982 who suggested that changes would need to be larger to be detectable in the southeast lu et al 2003 calculated water balance et for 36 watersheds and attempted to determine if forest cover type was important for predicting et they found slight but non significant model improvements by considering forest type lu et al 2003 however many of the watersheds were in the coastal plain and underlain with high conductivity aquifers with the potential for leakiness fan 2019 which can allow water to exit the basins through regional groundwater flow paths and bias water balance estimates in a nationwide analysis of water balance et abiotic factors including temperature and precipitation had the most influence on et but including total forest cover provided slight significant improvements to model evaluations sanford and selnick 2013 these authors did not report forest type effects our objective in this study is to examine how average annual watershed et is influenced by land cover distribution including forest type and other geographic variables including latitude elevation drainage area population mean annual air temperature average vapor pressure deficit the dryness index and available soil water storage specifically we sought to answer three questions 1 does average annual water balance et increase as the fraction of forest cover in the basin increases 2 does the type of forest evergreen versus deciduous affect the answer to the first question and 3 to what degree do pertinent geographic variables influence the variation of et across these basins our approach was to use a large set 45 of undammed rural southeastern watersheds underlain by crystalline rock with long term usgs streamflow records available climatic data and small amounts of urbanization and irrigation confining the watersheds to crystalline rock aquifers reduces the effects of storage changes and the potential for significant cross basin groundwater movement fan 2019 mcguinness 1963 2 methods 2 1 watershed selection we selected all southeastern watersheds meeting the following criteria 1 located over piedmont and blue ridge crystalline rock aquifers 2 precipitation p and usgs discharge q data available from water years 1982 2014 3 mean forest cover greater than or equal to forty percent 4 reservoir surface area less than one percent of total watershed area calculated from the national inventory of dams database goteti 2014 5 located outside of metropolitan areas and 6 no substantial changes in land cover through time see mahalanobis distance details in section 2 2 the final dataset consisted of 45 watersheds fig 1 table s1 we limited our study to crystalline rock aquifers which have low conductivity and well productivity mcguinness 1963 and thus reduce the potential for water balance errors associated with groundwater pumping leakage to regional flow paths or long storage discharge lags we limited the basins to those with 40 in order to have enough forest cover to separate the effects of evergreen deciduous and total forest the defined study area fig 1 includes most of the water supply watersheds for the rapidly growing cities of the developing interstate 85 megapolitan corridor from atlanta ga to raleigh nc terando et al 2014 population growth and development in these cities is expected to adversely affect aquatic health and reduce assimilative capacity for pollutants van metre et al 2019 watershed population densities population km2 range from 35 to 987 averaging 176 with a standard deviation of 160 table 2 basin drainage areas range from 66 to 4 389 km2 averaging 772 km2 with a standard deviation of 910 km2 watershed mean elevations above mean sea level amsl range from 100 to 1 009 m averaging 315 m with a standard deviation of 182 m watershed outlet latitudes range from 32 9168 to 37 2085 n averaging 35 4526 n with a standard deviation of 1 1925 2 2 data acquisition publicly available land cover hydrologic and meteorological datasets were used in this study as listed below temporal data were aggregated from daily or monthly timesteps to annual totals that were averaged for water years 1982 2014 october 1 1981 through september 30 2014 spatial data were aggregated to the watershed scale mcmanamay et al 2012 gis overlays were performed in arcgis database development and statistical analyses were performed in r 3 6 1 grolemund and wickham 2011 hirsch and de cicco 2015 r core team 2019 wickham and francois 2015 mean daily discharges q ft3 s from the us geological survey were converted to runoff depth mm day area weighted averages of total monthly precipitation p mm and mean monthly temperature t c were from the prism dataset 4 km resolution prism 2012 blodgett et al 2011 daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity were from the university of idaho gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 blodgett et al 2011 watershed boundaries were from the us geological survey usgs 2011 land cover was from 30 m national land cover datasets nlcd for 2001 2006 and 2011 homer et al 2015 the 1992 nlcd dataset was not used because of inconsistencies with subsequent classifications land cover types include water developed barren deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrubland herbaceous grassland pasture crops and wetlands pasture and grass were grouped together as grass all other cover types were combined to other cover total forest was calculated as the sum of deciduous evergreen and mixed forest mahalanobis distances were calculated for each watershed between the three landcover datasets 2001 2006 and 2011 for evergreen deciduous mixed forest and grass cover proportions mahalanobis 2015 watersheds with non normal mahalanobis distances were excluded interactively using qq plots using the r stats package r core team 2019 land cover from the three datasets was averaged by watershed and class then logit transformed prior to regression analysis average basin elevation was calculated using 30 m data from the national elevation dataset ned ned 1999 populations densities population km2 were estimated using 2010 block level census data and watershed areas walker 2018 potential evapotranspiration pet mm was determined using the priestley taylor formulation and gridmet meteorological variables guo et al 2016 priestley and taylor 1972 vapor pressure deficits vpd millibars were calculated using daily maximum and minimum relative humidity and temperature from the gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 alien 1998 available soil water storage aws from 0 to 150 cm was extracted from the ssurgo database and an area weighted average was calculated for each watershed ssurgo 2016 2 3 screening of land cover and basin regression variables vpd was excluded from multivariate models because of strong covariance with elevation and temperature correlation coefficient 0 85 population density and drainage area were not significant factors based on bivariate linear regressions and were excluded from further analysis 2 4 water balance direct measurement of et is difficult and expensive making indirect techniques necessary the long term watershed water balance is a common indirect method for estimating et and is calculated for gaged watersheds with long records of available p and q eq 1 1 et p q ds dt where changes in storage over a long record ds dt are assumed to be negligible long periods reduce the effects of interannual changes in watershed storage bosch and hewlett 1982 rice and emanuel 2019 and memory effects nippgen et al 2016 the water balance does not allow for separation of canopy interception i or soil evaporation es from total et any biases in the precipitation or runoff measurements bias et estimates 2 5 temporal changes in water budgets because we analyzed water budgets using long term averages of q and p we wanted to screen each watershed for temporal shifts in hydrology temporal changes were evaluated by comparing q to p using double mass analysis searcy et al 1960 cumulative q was graphed against cumulative p for each watershed temporal changes were evaluated by visually inspecting each timeseries for an inflection point when q increased or decreased relative to p no significant changes through time are indicated if the double mass curve is near linear minor changes are to be expected due to annual variations in climate and other conditions searcy et al 1960 2 6 budyko analysis we employed the budyko framework to compare the influence of climate on et budyko 1974 hypothesized a functional relationship between p et and pet based on the assumption that et is limited whenever water or energy are insufficient to support pet the budyko framework extends the water balance method by using both mass and energy balance equations to constrain the physical system sposito 2017 the budyko method assumes that long term changes in water and energy fluxes across the land surface can be neglected p entering a watershed exits as q or et and incoming shortwave radiation is balanced by outgoing longwave radiation plus latent heat losses due to evapotranspiration the budyko method relies on a nonlinear empirical relationship between the dryness index pet p and the evaporative index aet p which has the effect of normalizing by p many alternate non linear formulations have been developed some with parameters to improve the fit for watersheds with varying land cover or other properties zhang et al 2001 wang and tang 2014 we first compare different budyko type formulations for our watershed in the complementary space budyko 1974 zhanget al 2001 then calculate residuals between the estimates from zhang et al 2001 with w 2 0 for forest and w 0 5 for non forest and water balance evaporative indices aet p to evaluate forest cover type we acknowledge that this linear scaling of w is an approximation which introduces some error however we checked the relationships between empirical and water balance et with fixed w values 0 5 1 and 2 and using the parameter free budyko 1974 all of which show the same significance following oudin et al 2008 land cover accounting models were parameterized to evaluate the influence of land cover on et land cover accounting models had no more than five parameters with each tied to the proportion of a land cover class in each watershed oudin et al 2008 the included parameters were ti total forest ei evergreen forest di deciduous forest mi mixed forest gi grass and oi all other covers not explicitly represented as a sensitivity analysis one model contained a free parameter sigma not tied to a land cover variable land cover is not important if sigma performed as well as the land cover parameters oudin et al 2008 preliminary comparisons of common budyko type models with our watersheds indicated that the zhang et al 2001 method provided the best et prediction zhang et al 2001 oudin et al 2008 thus we used the landcover accounting zhang et al 2001 model from oudin et al 2008 to estimate the effects of land cover on watershed et 2 7 regression analysis land cover and basin characteristics regression models were constructed to evaluate the effects of land cover and non land cover variables on watershed et bivariate regressions were fit between et and every variable of interest variables that were strongly correlated correlation coefficient 0 7 were excluded from further analysis by selecting the variable from correlated pairs with the highest predictive power r2 variables with non significant relationships were also excluded from further analysis multivariate models were constructed from the remaining variables and their interactions the multivariate models were evaluated using aic from the r package stats r core team 2019 regression models were evaluated to ensure that the assumptions were met including independence between variables linear relationships between independent and dependent variables as well as independent and normally distributed residuals michael and patrick 1971 3 results within the selected watersheds deciduous forest is the most common vegetation type followed by grass then evergreen forest and then mixed forest other land cover includes small amounts of low and medium intensity development median 6 shrub median 2 barren crops emergent herbaceous wetland and woody wetland medians 1 each table 1 total forest cover ranges from 43 to 95 median 60 with deciduous forest cover ranging from 23 to 80 median 45 and evergreen ranging from 3 to 34 median 10 table 1 grass cover ranges from 1 to 40 median 21 other land covers including developed barren crops herbaceous wetland water and woody wetland range from 1 to 30 median 4 overall land cover proportions of the entire region as defined by the crystalline rock aquifer polygon have a similar central tendency to the 45 study watersheds but deciduous forests are more common and evergreen forests are less common in the study watersheds than regionally fig 2 table 1 mean annual precipitation for the 32 year period range from 1 124 to 1 847 mm across the watersheds averaging 1 252 mm with a standard deviation of 136 mm table 3 fig 3 mean annual discharges range from 217 to 998 mm averaging 434 mm with a standard deviation of 147 mm table 3 fig 3 water balance et is less variable and normally distributed shapiro wilk p value 0 4733 ranging from 640 to 971 mm with mean and median of 817 and 824 mm and a standard deviation of 61 mm table 3 fig 3 most of the basins average et falls between 725 and 900 mm while three basins 35 6 44 have et above 900 mm and three basins 25 10 27 are below 725 mm pet ranges from 1 001 mm to 1 167 mm averaging 1 067 mm with a standard deviation of 48 mm 3 1 temporal variation in hydrologic behavior double mass curve analysis of q versus p indicates that the large majority of the 45 watersheds exhibited no changes or very gradual changes in these relationships through time fig s1 seven watersheds 2 6 15 19 29 30 34 had a decrease in q near the end of the 32 year period this decrease was likely due to a recurring drought that appeared to affect a band of piedmont watersheds from sc to central nc stephens and bledsoe 2020 given the small number of watersheds affected and the limited amount of time this drought effect should not alter the interpretation of the overall results but we report it here since it may be a source of estimated et variability 3 2 budyko analysis most watersheds were tightly clustered in the complementary space fig 4 reflecting the similarity of the climate geology and et across the study area the plurality of basins fall along the budyko 1958 curve with forty two percent of the studied basins falling between the zhang et al 2001 curves defined by w 1 15 and w 1 95 scattering across these lines in the vertical aet p axis thus the difference between water balance aet p and zhang et al 2001 aet p for each watershed reveals differences in aet processes across watersheds fig 4 the distance between the water balance estimated aet p ratio and the zhang et al 2001 estimated aet p ratio is negatively related to the percentage of both total and deciduous forest and unrelated to evergreen forest percentage a 1 increase in deciduous or total forest cover corresponds to a 0 27 or 0 29 decrease respectively in the difference between the two estimates in aet p space fig 5 consequently many of the water balance estimates of aet p fall below the empirical predictions for watersheds where deciduous and total forest cover exceeded 50 and 70 respectively figs 4 and 5 including land cover zhang et al 2001 in the model improves the fit although different combinations of land cover parameters produce similar results table 4 each of the models accounting for forest type had a slightly better fit r2 0 18 than the total forest model r2 0 15 the sensitivity analysis with a free parameter not tied to land cover performed the worst r2 0 09 indicating that land cover parameters are significant table 4 while forest cover type improved budyko type et estimates total forest had similar support 3 3 regression analysis of et as a function of land cover and basin variables bivariate linear regression analysis indicates et has significant relationships with both evergreen and deciduous forest cover but with opposite signs table 5 fig 6 an increase in evergreen forest cover is associated with an increase in et and an increase in deciduous land cover is associated with a decrease in et both relationships are noisy with low correlations r2 0 159 and 0 107 respectively mixed forest cover has a significant negative trend with et r2 0 107 interestingly total forest cover was not significantly related to et table 5 regression analysis suggests that the type of forest cover is more meaningful than total forest cover bivariate linear regression between et and basin characteristics indicate that temperature r2 0 402 elevation r2 0 237 latitude r2 0 175 and aws r2 0 152 each significantly affect basin water budgets et relationships with temperature elevation and latitude were stronger and better supported than any of the vegetative cover relationships table 5 et increases with temperature vpd and aws and decreases with elevation and latitude drainage area precipitation and population density were not significant when examined individually table 5 fig 7 temperature elevation vpd aws and latitude explain more of the et relationship than evergreen deciduous or mixed forest correlations between evergreen deciduous and mixed forest types with et are significant and explain more of the variation than total forest alone for which the correlation is not significant multivariate regressions with et as the response indicate that precipitation and temperature together offer the best explanatory power and together their adjusted r2 is 0 408 these two variables also had the only significant interactions for simplicity non significant interactions are not shown in table 6 the best models with three or more variables all included precipitation and temperature the addition of land cover variables to the models that include precipitation and temperature did not improve model fits although the univariate regressions indicate that forest cover type is important it is less important than several abiotic factors particularly the combination of temperature and precipitation table 6 4 discussion watershed scale et in the southeastern u s is sensitive to the type of forest cover deciduous evergreen mixed and even more sensitive to abiotic factors including precipitation temperature and available water storage together as well as temperature elevation and latitude individually vegetative effects on et are mediated by climatic and geologic variation so that vegetative signals are noisy when viewed across a broad geographic region e g freund et al 2020 teuling et al 2019 and in the small basins 50 000 km2 that were included in our study li et al 2013 bosch and hewlett 1982 found evidence for higher et in evergreen basins but results were confounded by generally higher precipitation in these basins where precipitation was comparable evergreen forests transpired more water than deciduous forests vadeboncoeur et al 2018 examined et relationships across a larger more climatically variable region and found that the dominant controls of et vary systematically with increasing et in the most energy limited part of the region and decreasing et in the less energy limited parts of the region variations in the abiotic template along with variations in functional diversity of species affect our ability to detect effects of vegetation type here watershed scale sensitivity to land cover was detectable at a lower threshold than the 20 suggested by bosch and hewlett 1982 but was in line with the suggestion of trimble et al 1987 that forest cover changes less than 20 can be detected in short vegetation composition partly controls watershed scale et but variations in abiotic controls such as elevation latitude precipitation temperature lithology and aspect often matter more sanford and selnick 2013 fan et al 2019 metzen et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 our analysis indicates that increasing total forest cover does not necessarily increase basin et forest type matters in these watersheds increasing deciduous and mixed forest cover was associated with lower et while increasing evergreen forest cover was associated with higher et regression analysis indicated that watersheds with more evergreen forest had higher et and those with more deciduous forest had less budyko residuals also suggested that watersheds with more deciduous cover had less et but budyko residuals did not identify the effects of evergreen cover as statistically significant taken together the analysis argues for considering forest type to improve predictions of the effects of forest cover on et the study region is currently dominated by deciduous forests but there is some potential for loblolly pine afforestation by conversion from marginal agricultural wear and greis 2013 the data indicate that conversion of other cover types to fast growing loblolly pine would increase et and reduce stream baseflow the impact of forestry operations on water budgets is critical to understand particularly given predictions of increased atmospheric co2 temperature growing season length and precipitation variability due to climate change hwang et al 2018 pourmokhtarian et al 2017 vose et al 2011 higher co2 levels generally increase water use efficiency tyree and alexander 1993 battipaglia et al 2013 but jaramillo et al 2018 found that increased forest biomass increased regional et and masked any potential reduction in et due to increase water use efficiency additional plot scale data nested in gauged watersheds should provide useful insights to help understand the dynamics of watershed scale et where multiple land cover types and management strategies may act together to contribute to total et boggs et al 2015 caldwell et al 2018 in addition reanalysis of the global datasets for forest type effects may be of value since the last review evaluating the effects of forest type was bosch and hewlett 1982 which focused on paired watershed experiments rather than mixed use basins in this study we calculate long term watershed scale water budgets to address changing stream flows relative to land cover the watershed water balance is prone to errors from land cover uncertainty unaccounted basin water losses or gains consumptive uses irrigation shifts in forest management practices and forest succession the focus on large rural undammed crystalline bedrock and mostly forested basins helps control for these factors we could not account for effects of forest age distributions functional diversity among species within our forest type categories or tree sizes and ages although it is likely that deciduous forests are on average older than evergreen forests in the region given that the rotation length of commercial pine plantations is generally 25 30 years it is possible that such unaccounted for effects contribute to the noisy character of et relationships presented here 5 conclusions abiotic landscape variables and vegetative cover types and abiotic variables interact to affect the variation in water balance estimated evapotranspiration et across 45 rural mixed land cover watersheds in the southeastern u s water balance et is highly variable across the region ranging from 641 to 971 mm results indicate that et is most sensitive to abiotic watershed characteristics primarily the combination of temperature and precipitation but also including elevation vpd aws and latitude all of which explain more variation in et than any individual vegetative metric yet we can also show that basin scale average et is sensitive to forest cover and forest type specifically the relative mix of deciduous and evergreen forest the vegetative cover relationships with et are noisy and vegetative metrics individually explain less than a third of the variation explained by average watershed air temperature while evergreen forest cover is less common than deciduous cover it explains more of et variability than does total forest cover alone and is associated with greater et while deciduous and mixed forests are associated with lower et than evergreen forests thus increasing evergreen forest cover in the region would decrease water yields contrary to prior syntheses of global paired watershed experiments andréassian 2004 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 bosch and hewlett 1982 total forest cover in these watersheds appears to have little effect on water balances and residuals from the zhang curve suggest that et decreases with increasing total forest cover although this result is likely an effect of forest composition specifically the relative dominance of deciduous forest while biotic factors are the most important for controlling et and streamflow forest type influences water yield the response to afforestation or deforestation in the southeastern us depends upon the type of forest vegetation that is grown or harvested 6 data

5079,evapotranspiration et typically accounts for 60 70 of precipitation in rural basins of the southeastern united states since 1930 substantial reforestation of former croplands has occurred in the piedmont and appalachian highlands in this area leading to an expected increase in et and reduction in baseflow this study examines relationships between basin vegetative cover abiotic factors and water budget partitioning in 45 usgs gaged rural basins in the southeastern us data are for the 1982 2014 water years with watersheds having 40 forest cover crystalline rock aquifers minimal basin water export and no large reservoirs long term annual et is calculated using the water budget equation et p q which ranges from 641 to 971 mm yr median 824 vegetative cover and other basin variables are regressed against et to quantify the effects of vegetative and forest types budyko analysis is employed to compare the watersheds and to evaluate factors affecting residuals regression analysis indicates that et behavior is best explained by abiotic factors i e precipitation and temperature but forest cover type also has some effect evergreen forest cover is less common than deciduous or mixed forest but has a positive relationship with et while deciduous and total forest have negative relationships with et comparison of water balance and budyko estimated et indicates that deciduous and total forest are associated with negative residuals while evergreen is not significant these results show that forest cover effects on basin et are complicated forest cover type is important for water yield management in this region and abiotic basin characteristics exert stronger control than forest cover on et keywords hydrology evapotranspiration water budgets watershed streamflow budyko 1 introduction whether and how to mitigate the hydrologic effects of climate change are pressing questions for hydrologists requiring better understanding of how rural vegetation management affects water budgets and streamflows because of higher leaf area indices higher interception and somewhat deeper rooting forest cover increases et and reduces average streamflows relative to croplands pastures and lawns in the same hydroclimatic region according to water budget studies teuling 2018 syntheses of paired watershed experiments shows forests are the most water use intensive land cover type and that afforestation of grassland reduces water yield by 44 75 andréassian 2004 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 hibbert 1967 teuling 2018 paradoxically global synthesis of eddy flux estimates of et suggest an opposite relationship between forest and grassland et that grassland et as a fraction of precipitation is 9 higher that of forests williams et al 2012 however lysimeter measurements match the results of water budget studies and indicate that eddy flux underestimates latent heat flux from forest canopies teuling 2018 paired watershed studies typically focus on first or second order basins with species diversity limited by management thus ignoring confounding factors associated with larger scale mixed land use watersheds that cannot independently account for et variability driven by abiotic factors such as watershed elevation and latitude regardless water budget measurements are subject to substantial uncertainty and accurate and precise measurement of et is difficult and expensive a better understanding of the role of forests and forest type on the variability of water budgets across a region is needed to develop policies for maintaining hydrologic ecosystem services in the face of climate change and expanding human populations in humid environments annual evapotranspiration et typically accounts for half or more of precipitation p inputs and the amount of et partly depends on the composition and condition of vegetation types in a watershed watershed responses to afforestation or deforestation are not linear and are dependent upon watershed specific factors including soil depth and water holding capacity climate factors such as temperature precipitation and vapor pressure deficit and physiological factors such as plant rooting depth and hydraulic traits andréassian 2004 water budget responsiveness to vegetation change varies with annual precipitation and temperature and these abiotic factors are often more important than biotic ones sahin and hall 1996 stednick 1996 sanford and selnick 2013 teuling et al 2019 globally vegetative management influences watershed water budgets oudin et al 2008 but the relative effects of forest types and the scale of vegetative effects to abiotic effects are less clear forests are the dominant land cover in rural basins of the piedmont and appalachian highlands of the southeastern united states sanford and selnick 2013 wear and greis 2013 these forests are comprised of two broad functional groups deciduous and evergreen of which deciduous forest area is more than twice that of evergreen wear and greis 2013 southeastern evergreen forests are dominated by several pine species most notably loblolly pine pinus taeda l that are highly productive and commonly grown for wood products washlenberg 1960 wear and greis 2013 some high elevation watersheds in the appalachian highlands also contain eastern white pine p strobus and spruce fir communities wear and greis 2013 southeast deciduous species are far more numerous than evergreen species and exhibit a broader range of traits wear and greis 2013 some deciduos species such as chestnut oak quercus montana and northern red oak quercus rubra have lower et than evergreens pinus strobus ford et al 2010 whearas american sweet gum liquidambar styraciflua have higher et than evergreen loblolly pines caldwell et al 2018 understanding the relative effects of forest types on water use is important for forest and stream flow management evergreen forests transpire more water than deciduous forests swank and miner 1968 swank and douglass 1974 bosch and hewlett 1982 which is explained by biological and physiological factors that contribute to different water use behavior ford et al 2010 evergreens maintain canopy cover interception i and transpiration t throughout the year while deciduous forests lose their leaves in winter or in dry seasons evergreen and deciduous species also conduct water differently evergreens typically have higher stomatal conductance although hardwoods exhibit a wide range of conductance ford et al 2010 carlquist 2001 sperry et al 2006 in the southeast deciduous species are more dominant in riparian areas that have more available water than upland areas bosch and hewlett 1982 ford et al 2010 evergreen forests have a lower albedo and reflect less incoming solar radiation than deciduous forests and this increases evergreen et potential rosenberg 1986 however bosch and hewlett 1982 found that watersheds with evergreen forests occurred in more humid environments than deciduous forested watersheds thus confounding the relationships between et climate and land cover in the southeastern u s streamflow q has been declining gotvald 2016 stephens and bledsoe 2020 found that over the last 25 50 years the majority of southeast watersheds had decreases in average annual 7 day low flows of 4 16 mm and understanding the drivers of these decreases is important observed trends of decreasing total streamflow could be due to recurring droughts stephens and bledsoe 2020 changes in precipitation distribution reforestation increasing consumptive use changes in forest composition increasing temperatures and longer growing seasons due to climate change pourmokhtarian et al 2017 vadeboncoeur et al 2018 or a combination of these factors gotvald 2016 the region has seen an increase in forest cover since approximately 1940 when a trend of agricultural land abandonment began auch et al 2015 jackson et al 2005a jacksonet al 2005b ramankutty et al 2010 trimble et al 1987 the southeast is predicted to see a continued conversion of deciduous forests to evergreen due to increased demand for softwood timber production wear and greis 2013 trimble et al 1987 attempted to determine if water yield decreased due to afforestation of cropland from 1919 to 1967 across ten usgs gaged watersheds in the piedmont of alabama georgia and south carolina this small set of watersheds included some with large reservoirs and some with substantial urbanization and the analysis suffered from low resolution land cover estimates data gaps and confounding simultaneous increases in urbanization and afforestation auch et al 2015 trimble et al 1987 nonetheless trimble et al 1987 determined that increases in forested areas were associated with decreases in water yield and that watershed land cover modifications of 20 could be detected this is inconsistent with findings by bosch and hewlett 1982 who suggested that changes would need to be larger to be detectable in the southeast lu et al 2003 calculated water balance et for 36 watersheds and attempted to determine if forest cover type was important for predicting et they found slight but non significant model improvements by considering forest type lu et al 2003 however many of the watersheds were in the coastal plain and underlain with high conductivity aquifers with the potential for leakiness fan 2019 which can allow water to exit the basins through regional groundwater flow paths and bias water balance estimates in a nationwide analysis of water balance et abiotic factors including temperature and precipitation had the most influence on et but including total forest cover provided slight significant improvements to model evaluations sanford and selnick 2013 these authors did not report forest type effects our objective in this study is to examine how average annual watershed et is influenced by land cover distribution including forest type and other geographic variables including latitude elevation drainage area population mean annual air temperature average vapor pressure deficit the dryness index and available soil water storage specifically we sought to answer three questions 1 does average annual water balance et increase as the fraction of forest cover in the basin increases 2 does the type of forest evergreen versus deciduous affect the answer to the first question and 3 to what degree do pertinent geographic variables influence the variation of et across these basins our approach was to use a large set 45 of undammed rural southeastern watersheds underlain by crystalline rock with long term usgs streamflow records available climatic data and small amounts of urbanization and irrigation confining the watersheds to crystalline rock aquifers reduces the effects of storage changes and the potential for significant cross basin groundwater movement fan 2019 mcguinness 1963 2 methods 2 1 watershed selection we selected all southeastern watersheds meeting

metropolitan areas and 6 no substantial changes in land cover through time see mahalanobis distance details in section 2 2 the final dataset consisted of 45 watersheds fig 1 table s1 we limited our study to crystalline rock aquifers which have low conductivity and well productivity mcguinness 1963 and thus reduce the potential for water balance errors associated with groundwater pumping leakage to regional flow paths or long storage discharge lags we limited the basins to those with 40 in order to have enough forest cover to separate the effects of evergreen deciduous and total forest the defined study area fig 1 includes most of the water supply watersheds for the rapidly growing cities of the developing interstate 85 megapolitan corridor from atlanta ga to raleigh nc terando et al 2014 population growth and development in these cities is expected to adversely affect aquatic health and reduce assimilative capacity for pollutants van metre et al 2019 watershed population densities population km2 range from 35 to 987 averaging 176 with a standard deviation of 160 table 2 basin drainage areas range from 66 to 4 389 km2 averaging 772 km2 with a standard deviation of 910 km2 watershed mean elevations above mean sea level amsl range from 100 to 1 009 m averaging 315 m with a standard deviation of 182 m watershed outlet latitudes range from 32 9168 to 37 2085 n averaging 35 4526 n with a standard deviation of 1 1925 2 2 data acquisition publicly available land cover hydrologic and meteorological datasets were used in this study as listed below temporal data were aggregated from daily or monthly timesteps to annual totals that were averaged for water years 1982 2014 october 1 1981 through september 30 2014 spatial data were aggregated to the watershed scale mcmanamay et al 2012 gis overlays were performed in arcgis database development and statistical analyses were performed in r 3 6 1 grolemund and wickham 2011 hirsch and de cicco 2015 r core team 2019 wickham and francois 2015 mean daily discharges q ft3 s from the us geological survey were converted to runoff depth mm day area weighted averages of total monthly precipitation p mm and mean monthly temperature t c were from the prism dataset 4 km resolution prism 2012 blodgett et al 2011 daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity were from the university of idaho gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 blodgett et al 2011 watershed boundaries were from the us geological survey usgs 2011 land cover was from 30 m national land cover datasets nlcd for 2001 2006 and 2011 homer et al 2015 the 1992 nlcd dataset was not used because of inconsistencies with subsequent classifications land cover types include water developed barren deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrubland herbaceous grassland pasture crops and wetlands pasture and grass were grouped together as grass all other cover types were combined to other cover total forest was calculated as the sum of deciduous evergreen and mixed forest mahalanobis distances were calculated for each watershed between the three landcover datasets 2001 2006 and 2011 for evergreen deciduous mixed forest and grass cover proportions mahalanobis 2015 watersheds with non normal mahalanobis distances were excluded interactively using qq plots using the r stats package r core team 2019 land cover from the three datasets was averaged by watershed and class then logit transformed prior to regression analysis average basin elevation was calculated using 30 m data from the national elevation dataset ned ned 1999 populations densities population km2 were estimated using 2010 block level census data and watershed areas walker 2018 potential evapotranspiration pet mm was determined using the priestley taylor formulation and gridmet meteorological variables guo et al 2016 priestley and taylor 1972 vapor pressure deficits vpd millibars were calculated using daily maximum and minimum relative humidity and temperature from the gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 alien 1998 available soil water storage aws from 0 to 150 cm was extracted from the ssurgo database and an area weighted average was calculated for each watershed ssurgo 2016 2 3 screening of land cover and basin regression variables vpd was excluded from multivariate models because of strong covariance with elevation and temperature correlation coefficient 0 85 population density and drainage area were not significant factors based on bivariate linear regressions and were excluded from further analysis 2 4 water balance direct measurement of et is difficult and expensive making indirect techniques necessary the long term watershed water balance is a common indirect method for estimating et and is calculated for gaged watersheds with long records of available p and q eq 1 1 et p q ds dt where changes in storage over a long record ds dt are assumed to be negligible long periods reduce the effects of interannual changes in watershed storage bosch and hewlett 1982 rice and emanuel 2019 and memory effects nippgen et al 2016 the water balance does not allow for separation of canopy interception i or soil evaporation es from total et any biases in the precipitation or runoff measurements bias et estimates 2 5 temporal changes in water budgets because we analyzed water budgets using long term averages of q and p we wanted to screen each watershed for temporal shifts in hydrology temporal changes were evaluated by comparing q to p using double mass analysis searcy et al 1960 cumulative q was graphed against cumulative p for each watershed temporal changes were evaluated by visually inspecting each timeseries for an inflection point when q increased or decreased relative to p no significant changes through time are indicated if the double mass curve is near linear minor changes are to be expected due to annual variations in climate and other conditions searcy et al 1960 2 6 budyko analysis we employed the budyko framework to compare the influence of climate on et budyko 1974 hypothesized a functional relationship between p et and pet based on the assumption that et is limited whenever water or energy are insufficient to support pet the budyko framework extends the water balance method by using both mass and energy balance equations to constrain the physical system sposito 2017 the budyko method assumes that long term changes in water and energy fluxes across the land surface can be neglected p entering a watershed exits as q or et and incoming shortwave radiation is balanced by outgoing longwave radiation plus latent heat losses due to evapotranspiration the budyko method relies on a nonlinear empirical relationship between the dryness index pet p and the evaporative index aet p which has the effect of normalizing by p many alternate non linear formulations have been developed some with parameters to improve the fit for watersheds with varying land cover or other properties zhang et al 2001 wang and tang 2014 we first compare different budyko type formulations for our watershed in the complementary space budyko 1974 zhanget al 2001 then calculate residuals between the estimates from zhang et al 2001 with w 2 0 for forest and w 0 5 for non forest and water balance evaporative indices aet p to evaluate forest cover type we acknowledge that this linear scaling of w is an approximation which introduces some error however we checked the relationships between empirical and water balance et with fixed w values 0 5 1 and 2 and using the parameter free budyko 1974 all of which show the same significance following oudin et al 2008 land cover accounting models were parameterized to evaluate the influence of land cover on et land cover accounting models had no more than five parameters with each tied to the proportion of a land cover class in each watershed oudin et al 2008 the included parameters were ti total forest ei evergreen forest di deciduous forest mi mixed forest gi grass and oi all other covers not explicitly represented as a sensitivity analysis one model contained a free parameter sigma not tied to a land cover variable land cover is not important if sigma performed as well as the land cover parameters oudin et al 2008 preliminary comparisons of common budyko type models with our watersheds indicated that the zhang et al 2001 method provided the best et prediction zhang et al 2001 oudin et al 2008 thus we used the landcover accounting zhang et al 2001 model from oudin et al 2008 to estimate the effects of land cover on watershed et 2 7 regression analysis land cover and basin characteristics regression models were constructed to evaluate the effects of land cover and non land cover variables on watershed et bivariate regressions were fit between et and every variable of interest variables that were strongly correlated correlation coefficient 0 7 were excluded from further analysis by selecting the variable from correlated pairs with the highest predictive power r2 variables with non significant relationships were also excluded from further analysis multivariate models were constructed from the remaining variables and their interactions the multivariate models were evaluated using aic from the r package stats r core team 2019 regression models were evaluated to ensure that the assumptions were met including independence between variables linear relationships between independent and dependent variables as well as independent and normally distributed residuals michael and patrick 1971 3 results within the selected watersheds deciduous forest is the most common vegetation type followed by grass then evergreen forest and then mixed forest other land cover includes small amounts of low and medium intensity development median 6 shrub median 2 barren crops emergent herbaceous wetland and woody wetland medians 1 each table 1 total forest cover ranges from 43 to 95 median 60 with deciduous forest cover ranging from 23 to 80 median 45 and evergreen ranging from 3 to 34 median 10 table 1 grass cover ranges from 1 to 40 median 21 other land covers including developed barren crops herbaceous wetland water and woody wetland range from 1 to 30 median 4 overall land cover proportions of the entire region as defined by the crystalline rock aquifer polygon have a similar central tendency to the 45 study watersheds but deciduous forests are more common and evergreen forests are less common in the study watersheds than regionally fig 2 table 1 mean annual precipitation for the 32 year period range from 1 124 to 1 847 mm across the watersheds averaging 1 252 mm with a standard deviation of 136 mm table 3 fig 3 mean annual discharges range from 217 to 998 mm averaging 434 mm with a standard deviation of 147 mm table 3 fig 3 water balance et is less variable and normally distributed shapiro wilk p value 0 4733 ranging from 640 to 971 mm with mean and median of 817 and 824 mm and a standard deviation of 61 mm table 3 fig 3 most of the basins average et falls between 725 and 900 mm while three basins 35 6 44 have et above 900 mm and three basins 25 10 27 are below 725 mm pet ranges from 1 001 mm to 1 167 mm averaging 1 067 mm with a standard deviation of 48 mm 3 1 temporal variation in hydrologic behavior double mass curve analysis of q versus p indicates that the large majority of the 45 watersheds exhibited no changes or very gradual changes in these relationships through time fig s1 seven watersheds 2 6 15 19 29 30 34 had a decrease in q near the end of the 32 year period this decrease was likely due to a recurring drought that appeared to affect a band of piedmont watersheds from sc to central nc stephens and bledsoe 2020 given the small number of watersheds affected and the limited amount of time this drought effect should not alter the interpretation of the overall results but we report it here since it may be a source of estimated et variability 3 2 budyko analysis most watersheds were tightly clustered in the complementary space fig 4 reflecting the similarity of the climate geology and et across the study area the plurality of basins fall along the budyko 1958 curve with forty two percent of the studied basins falling between the zhang et al 2001 curves defined by w 1 15 and w 1 95 scattering across these lines in the vertical aet p axis thus the difference between water balance aet p and zhang et al 2001 aet p for each watershed reveals differences in aet processes across watersheds fig 4 the distance between the water balance estimated aet p ratio and the zhang et al 2001 estimated aet p ratio is negatively related to the percentage of both total and deciduous forest and unrelated to evergreen forest percentage a 1 increase in deciduous or total forest cover corresponds to a 0 27 or 0 29 decrease respectively in the difference between the two estimates in aet p space fig 5 consequently many of the water balance estimates of aet p fall below the empirical predictions for watersheds where deciduous and total forest cover exceeded 50 and 70 respectively figs 4 and 5 including land cover zhang et al 2001 in the model improves the fit although different combinations of land cover parameters produce similar results table 4 each of the models accounting for forest type had a slightly better fit r2 0 18 than the total forest model r2 0 15 the sensitivity analysis with a free parameter not tied to land cover performed the worst r2 0 09 indicating that land cover parameters are significant table 4 while forest cover type improved budyko type et estimates total forest had similar support 3 3 regression analysis of et as a function of land cover and basin variables bivariate linear regression analysis indicates et has significant relationships with both evergreen and deciduous forest cover but with opposite signs table 5 fig 6 an increase in evergreen forest cover is associated with an increase in et and an increase in deciduous land cover is associated with a decrease in et both relationships are noisy with low correlations r2 0 159 and 0 107 respectively mixed forest cover has a significant negative trend with et r2 0 107 interestingly total forest cover was not significantly related to et table 5 regression analysis suggests that the type of forest cover is more meaningful than total forest cover bivariate linear regression between et and basin characteristics indicate that temperature r2 0 402 elevation r2 0 237 latitude r2 0 175 and aws r2 0 152 each significantly affect basin water budgets et relationships with temperature elevation and latitude were stronger and better supported than any of the vegetative cover relationships table 5 et increases with temperature vpd and aws and decreases with elevation and latitude drainage area precipitation and population density were not significant when examined individually table 5 fig 7 temperature elevation vpd aws and latitude explain more of the et relationship than evergreen deciduous or mixed forest correlations between evergreen deciduous and mixed forest types with et are significant and explain more of the variation than total forest alone for which the correlation is not significant multivariate regressions with et as the response indicate that precipitation and temperature together offer the best explanatory power and together their adjusted r2 is 0 408 these two variables also had the only significant interactions for simplicity non significant interactions are not shown in table 6 the best models with three or more variables all included precipitation and temperature the addition of land cover variables to the models that include precipitation and temperature did not improve model fits although the univariate regressions indicate that forest cover type is important it is less important than several abiotic factors particularly the combination of temperature and precipitation table 6 4 discussion watershed scale et in the southeastern u s is sensitive to the type of forest cover deciduous evergreen mixed and even more sensitive to abiotic factors including precipitation temperature and available water storage together as well as temperature elevation and latitude individually vegetative effects on et are mediated by climatic and geologic variation so that vegetative signals are noisy when viewed across a broad geographic region e g freund et al 2020 teuling et al 2019 and in the small basins 50 000 km2 that were included in our study li et al 2013 bosch and hewlett 1982 found evidence for higher et in evergreen basins but results were confounded by generally higher precipitation in these basins where precipitation was comparable evergreen forests transpired more water than deciduous forests vadeboncoeur et al 2018 examined et relationships across a larger more climatically variable region and found that the dominant controls of et vary systematically with increasing et in the most energy limited part of the region and decreasing et in the less energy limited parts of the region variations in the abiotic template along with variations in functional diversity of species affect our ability to detect effects of vegetation type here watershed scale sensitivity to land cover was detectable at a lower threshold than the 20 suggested by bosch and hewlett 1982 but was in line with the suggestion of trimble et al 1987 that forest cover changes less than 20 can be detected in short vegetation composition partly controls watershed scale et but variations in abiotic controls such as elevation latitude precipitation temperature lithology and aspect often matter more sanford and selnick 2013 fan et al 2019 metzen et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 our analysis indicates that increasing total forest cover does not necessarily increase basin et forest type matters in these watersheds increasing deciduous and mixed forest cover was associated with lower et while increasing evergreen forest cover was associated with higher et regression analysis indicated that watersheds with more evergreen forest had higher et and those with more deciduous forest had less budyko residuals also suggested that watersheds with more deciduous cover had less et but budyko residuals did not identify the effects of evergreen cover as statistically significant taken together the analysis argues for considering forest type to improve predictions of the effects of forest cover on et the study region is currently dominated by deciduous forests but there is some potential for loblolly pine afforestation by conversion from marginal agricultural wear and greis 2013 the data indicate that conversion of other cover types to fast growing loblolly pine would increase et and reduce stream baseflow the impact of forestry operations on water budgets is critical to understand particularly given predictions of increased atmospheric co2 temperature growing season length and precipitation variability due to climate change hwang et al 2018 pourmokhtarian et al 2017 vose et al 2011 higher co2 levels generally increase water use efficiency tyree and alexander 1993 battipaglia et al 2013 but jaramillo et al 2018 found that increased forest biomass increased regional et and masked any potential reduction in et due to increase water use efficiency additional plot scale data nested in gauged watersheds should provide useful insights to help understand the dynamics of watershed scale et where multiple land cover types and management strategies may act together to contribute to total et boggs et al 2015 caldwell et al 2018 in addition reanalysis of the global datasets for forest type effects may be of value since the last review evaluating the effects of forest type was bosch and hewlett 1982 which focused on paired watershed experiments rather than mixed use basins in this study we calculate long term watershed scale water budgets to address changing stream flows relative to land cover the watershed water balance is prone to errors from land cover uncertainty unaccounted basin water losses or gains consumptive uses irrigation shifts in forest management practices and forest succession the focus on large rural undammed crystalline bedrock and mostly forested basins helps control for these factors we could not account for effects of forest age distributions functional diversity among species within our forest type categories or tree sizes and ages although it is likely that deciduous forests are on average older than evergreen forests in the region given that the rotation length of commercial pine plantations is generally 25 30 years it is possible that such unaccounted for effects contribute to the noisy character of et relationships presented here 5 conclusions abiotic landscape variables and vegetative cover types and abiotic variables interact to affect the variation in water balance estimated evapotranspiration et across 45 rural mixed land cover watersheds in the southeastern u s water balance et is highly variable across the region ranging from 641 to 971 mm results indicate that et is most sensitive to abiotic watershed characteristics primarily the combination of temperature and precipitation but also including elevation vpd aws and latitude all of which explain more variation in et than any individual vegetative metric yet we can also show that basin scale average et is sensitive to forest cover and forest type specifically the relative mix of deciduous and evergreen forest the vegetative cover relationships with et are noisy and vegetative metrics individually explain less than a third of the variation explained by average watershed air temperature while evergreen forest cover is less common than deciduous cover it explains more of et variability than does total forest cover alone and is associated with greater et while deciduous and mixed forests are associated with lower et than evergreen forests thus increasing evergreen forest cover in the region would decrease water yields contrary to prior syntheses of global paired watershed experiments andréassian 2004 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 bosch and hewlett 1982 total forest cover in these watersheds appears to have little effect on water balances and residuals from the zhang curve suggest that et decreases with increasing total forest cover although this result is likely an effect of forest composition specifically the relative dominance of deciduous forest while biotic factors are the most important for controlling et and streamflow forest type influences water yield the response to afforestation or deforestation in the southeastern us depends upon the type of forest vegetation that is grown or harvested 6 data
