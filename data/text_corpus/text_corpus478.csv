2390,soil moisture sm is a key state variable in the water energy cycle between atmosphere and land surface but existing passive microwave soil moisture products typically have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers which fails to meet the requirements of regional applications even though numerous machine deep learning methods have been applied to downscale sm few studies have investigated the performance differences of diverse approaches and attempted to integrate various methods to improve downscaling accuracy therefore this study firstly evaluated and inter compared the downscaling performances of six machine deep learning approaches and further proposed a hybrid downscaling method based on bayesian three cornered hat merging match the daily 1 km seamless soil moisture product during 2015 2019 over the qinghai tibet plateau was then obtained evaluation and inter comparison results revealed that there was obvious performance discrepancy among different downscaling approaches and the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and random forest rf were the best two methods which performed best in the southern and eastern of the plateau respectively while the artificial neural network ann outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas validation against in situ measurements showed that compared with smap sm the match sm exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error with mean r and ubrmse values of 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 the mean r and ubrmse values for smap sm were 0 67 and 0 056 m3 m3 respectively in addition the match sm presented great improvement compared with any single downscaled sm data having the highest correlation and the lowest ubrmse scores while among different methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 residual network resnet besides the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporal variations of soil moisture and precipitation and effectively represent the spatial patterns of soil moisture satisfactory downscaling results were achieved in arid and semi arid areas whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions such overestimation was inherent from original smap sm but was mitigated after downscaling in conclusion performance differences existed among diverse downscaling approaches and the developed match method could maximize the potentials of each method and show encouraging downscaling performances keywords soil moisture downscaling machine learning integration inter comparison the qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm defined as the total amount of water within the unsaturated zone peng et al 2017b is a key state variable in water cycle and energy budgets of land ecosystem brocca et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2015 controlling the process of evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 influencing the partitioning of infiltration and runoff tuttle and salvucci 2014 and governing vegetation water uptake qu et al 2021 thus having an essential role in weather forecasting koster randal et al 2004 drought monitoring hirschi et al 2011 and water resource management zhang et al 2016 accurate and detailed information of the spatiotemporal distribution of sm would therefore greatly improve our understanding of the land atmosphere system as the water tower of asia the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the source of seven major river in asia however due to the complex and unique geographical environment detailed seamless soil moisture information with high precision and high resolution over the qtp is still severely lacking there are various approaches to obtain soil moisture information including in situ measurements and remotely sensed estimation generally speaking ground observation can provide precise estimation of soil moisture but are costly and labor intensive and also have poor spatial representation for neighboring areas due to its high spatial heterogeneity peng et al 2017b while remote sensing especially microwave remote sensing becomes the most promising tools in mapping regional to global soil moisture owing to the direct relationship between the electromagnetic radiation soil dielectric and water content and the better penetrating capability of microwaves ebrahimi khusfi et al 2018 ma et al 2019 sabaghy et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 therefore ample efforts have been devoted to retrieve surface soil moisture using microwave remote sensing including the active remote sensors such as the c sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellite snoeij et al 2010 and the metop a b advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 and passive remote sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e brocca et al 2011 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 and the l band radiometer onboard the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 satellite nevertheless microwave soil moisture products usually have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers such soil moisture products are only suitable for potential applications at continental and global scales but fail to meet regional application requirements such as water resource management fang et al 2018 drought monitoring peng et al 2017a precipitation evapotranspiration estimation peng et al 2021a and precision agriculture crow et al 2000 fang et al 2018 peng et al 2021a hence numerous downscaling methods have been proposed to derive soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolution and these methods can be divided into four categories microwave based downscaling optical based downscaling data assimilation based downscaling and machine learning based downscaling techniques sabaghy et al 2018 microwave based downscaling methods such as the change detection algorithm piles et al 2009 active passive optional algorithm das et al 2011 and baseline algorithm das et al 2014 can combine the high spatial resolution of active microwave with the high sensitivity to soil moisture of passive microwave but suffer from the low temporal coverage of radar high sensitivity to vegetation cover and surface roughness and lacking of concurrent active and passive observations sabaghy et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 comparatively the optical based methods have the advantages of disaggregating soil moisture into higher spatial resolution due to the high spatiotemporal optical observations based on the land surface temperature lst vegetation indes vi triangle feature space carlson et al 1994 gillies and carlson 1995 several approaches have been developed including the polynomial fitting downscaling method piles et al 2011 the dispatch model merlin et al 2012 and the ucla model kim and hogue 2012 some simple and efficient indices also have been exploited in the downscaling process such as the vegetation temperature condition index vtci wan et al 2004 and the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 in addition data assimilation method gains its popularity in downscaling soil moisture since it accounts for both model and measurement uncertainties and has great physical process interpretability and model transferability sabaghy et al 2018 seo et al 2021 machine learning deep learning have also been increasingly leveraged in soil moisture downscaling during the past few decades owing to its advantages of dealing with non linear problems and massive remote sensing data ali et al 2015 srivastava et al 2013 utilized the artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and generalized linear model glm to downscale the smos soil moisture product wei et al 2019 have successfully generated the 1 km soil moisture product over the qinghai tibet plateau by exploiting the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and integrating 26 soil moisture indices abowarda et al 2021 conducted the soil moisture downscaling at field scale 30 m using both data fusion and random forest rf algorithm xu et al 2021 also improved the spatial resolution of smap soil moisture products using the convolutional neural network cnn these studies implied that by leveraging the machine learning algorithms high spatial resolution soil moisture data with satisfactory accuracy could be obtained however only a few studies have intercompared the performances of different soil moisture downscaling methods and the performance discrepancy of diverse machine learning approaches should be further investigated besides based on existing researches it could be inferred that the performances of machine learning methods vary with the algorithm itself abowarda et al 2021 long et al 2019 wei et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 see table 3 for example the tree based algorithms such as the rf and the gbdt usually achieve satisfactory downscaling results due to their great capability in dealing with tabulate data while the ann could well fit the high dimension nonlinear relationship between surface variables and sm but are easily affected by uninformative data the cnn consider the local geospatial features of auxiliary factors through convolution and the long short term memory network lstm exhibits great ability in time series prediction and could capture the long and short term trends of soil moisture thus usually shows high correlation in the downscaled sm recently zhao et al 2022 intercompared the machine learning and deep learning approaches for soil moisture downscaling in the qtp and also revealed that differences existed among various methods specifically the deep learning methods outperformed the two classic machine learning approaches e g rf and ann with higher correlation and lower ubrmse while methods such as the residual network resnet that considering neighborhood relationship could further enhance the downscaling accuracy and provide more detailed spatial patterns in addition the spatial patterns of uncertainty for each method varied and the ann and resnet mainly performed best in the northeastern of the plateau while the rf had the lowest uncertainty in the southwestern regions nonetheless until recently few studies have attempted to integrate diverse machine deep learning approaches to improve downscaling accuracy despite the distinct performance differences among various downscaling methods the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 can be applied to quantify the error variances of a geophysical measurement system without knowing the ground truth and has been widely used for satellite based products assessment and merging such as precipitation and soil moisture chen et al 2022 2018 gruber et al 2017 peng et al 2021b in analogous to the tc method the three cornered hat tch method developed by premoli and tavella 1993 also estimates the relative uncertainty within three independent datasets by removing the common signal of true observations xu et al 2020 later an improved tch method was proposed he et al 2020 liu et al 2019 which could be applied to more than three time series and considered the cross correlation among datasets such approach offers a possible solution for combining different machine deep learning algorithms to downscale soil moisture therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the downscaling performances of different machine deep learning methods and develop a robust downscaling approach based on the machine learning and three cornered hat match method that integrates various machine deep learning algorithms the daily soil moisture product with high spatial resolution 1 km and high accuracy during 2015 2019 over the qtp was generated and the spatial patterns of soil moisture was analyzed overall in this study we aimed to address the following three specific questions 1 do the different machine deep learning approaches have similar or diverse downscaling performances 2 does the proposed method have the potential to integrate various methods to further improve the downscaling accuracy 3 how well does the match method behave compared with single downscaling method 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 located in southwestern china is the largest plateau in china with a total area of about 2 57 million km2 ma et al 2017b known as the roof of the world the qtp has a mean elevation of more than 4000 m dropping from more than 8000 m in the west to less than 1000 m in the east wang et al 2019 affected by factors such as altitude geomorphology indian ocean and pacific monsoons and westerly circulation the qtp extends from the humid monsoon zone in the southeast to the cold and arid plateau climate zone in the northwest zhang et al 2007 the central and southern parts of the qtp are influenced by the indian monsoon and have abundant precipitation while the western and northern parts of the qtp are affected by westerly winds and have less precipitation as the hengduan mountains block most of the water vapor although the southeast asian monsoon prevails in the eastern part of the qtp precipitation is limited ma et al 2017b as a result the average annual precipitation decreases from 1764 mm in the southeast to 16 mm in the northwest and the average annual temperature also drops from 15 5 c to 5 0 c chen et al 2015 the qtp has diverse vegetation types including forests shrubs meadows grasslands and deserts meadows and grasslands account for about 70 of the total area and are mainly distributed in the central and eastern regions shrubs and forests are mainly located in the southeast while deserts are distributed in the northwest piao et al 2011 2 2 smap soil moisture data the national aeronautics and space administration nasa s smap mission was launched on january 31 2015 aiming at monitoring global surface soil moisture and freeze thaw state entekhabi et al 2010a with the help of the l band radar and radiometer the smap satellite can provide surface soil moisture 5 cm depth observations with a spatial resolution of 3 km and 40 km respectively and achieve a global coverage within 2 3 days however the radar sensor of the smap satellite was damaged on july 7 2015 due to a hardware failure the descending and ascending half orbit passes of the smap satellite are at 6 a m and 6 p m local time respectively this study utilized the smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture version 7 descending product which adopts an improved brightness temperature calibration methodology and an enhanced land surface model to estimate soil temperature the soilgrid250m product was also exploited to provide soil information 2 3 modis products sandholt et al 2002 and zeng et al 2019 has summarized the interacting factors that are closely related to soil moisture and determine the surface brightness temperature these factors can be categorized into vegetation energy climate topography and soil properties therefore several moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis collection 6 products were adopted to derive these auxiliary variables table 1 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi were calculated from the daily mod09ga product the land surface temperature including the daytime lst and the difference of daytime and nighttime lst were derived from the mod11a1 and mod11a2 products both white sky and black sky albedo for visible near infrared and shortwave bands were obtained from the mcd43a3 product with a spatiotemporal resolution of 500 m and 1 day the yearly land cover was provided by the mcd12q1 product and the international geosphere biosphere program igbp land cover classification scheme was selected 2 4 other auxiliary datasets in addition to the above satellite data the world wildlife fund wwf hydrosheds void filled digital elevation model dem at a 3 arc seconds resolution was used to provide topographic factors elevation aspect slope and topographic wetness index twi the soil textures clay sand silt fractions and soil organic carbon soc with a resolution of 250 m were also utilized in this study since the soil textures are essential descriptors of the hydraulic transmissivity and the soc is recognized to impact the hydraulic conductivity of soil grillakis et al 2021 nemes et al 2005 all these soil parameters were obtained from the recently released basic soil property dataset of high resolution china soil information grids feng and ganlin 2021 liu et al 2022a the daily precipitation data were from the chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data dataset which incorporates 0 05 resolution satellite imagery with in situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series table 1 lists the ancillary variables used in this study 2 5 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ soil moisture measurements from the international soil moisture network ismn were chosen as ground truth to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed match method the ismn provides quality controlled and harmonized in situ soil moisture datasets from various operational networks and ground validation campaigns dorigo et al 2021 2011 three networks on the qtp namely the ngari 18 sites available including 3 ali sites and 15 shiquanhe sites naqu 9 sites available and maqu 20 sites available monitoring networks were selected only the data with 0 5 cm depth e g 0 5 cm or 5 cm were selected table 2 and the preprocessing was conducted following the guidance of ma et al 2019 2021 1 the evaluation period was set as the unfrozen season from may to october during 2015 2019 2 the utc time of ground observations was converted into local time to remove the temporal mismatch during evaluation 3 only the good quality records flagged as g for each sites were retained and sites have fewer than 30 samples were excluded 4 only stations that have correlation with p value 0 01 were considered to obtain robust statistical results 3 methodology fig 2 showed the framework flow of the downscaling method used in this study first sm downscaling predictors including ndvi evi lst albedo soc soil texture clay sand and silt terrain dem slope aspect and twi landcover latitude longitude and day of the year doy were preprocessed and resampled to 36 km then six machine learning models were constructed taking the smap soil moisture data as target and the corresponding downscaled surface soil moisture was generated a bayesian based three cornered hat btch merging method was subsequently applied to obtain the final downscaled surface soil moisture finally the performance of each downscaled sm and merged downscaled product was evaluated using ground based measurements and inter compared 3 1 data preprocessing spatiotemporally continuous input variables should be obtained to improve the completeness of downscaled sm for ndvi and evi the cloud free time series were reconstructed using harmonic analysis of time series hants algorithm which has been widely applied to reconstruct time series of ndvi lai as well as lst to remove random noise or eliminate cloud snow contamination roerink et al 2000 shiff et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 a similar integrated method developed by yang et al 2019 was exploited to reconstruct daily modis lst data using both mod11a1 and mod11a2 product as for albedo a savitzky golay filter was utilized to generate the gap filled albedo data all the auxiliary data were then resampled to 36 km and 1 km for model training and predicting meanwhile water mask was also applied to exclude water bodies and permanent soil and ice area during model construction data were randomly divided into training set 70 validating set 20 and testing set 10 and all predictors were normalized using z score standard normalization hyperparameters were optimized using grid search strategy and bayesian optimization and 5 fold cross validation technique was also adopted 3 2 machine learning methods for downscaling six machine deep learning methods namely the random forest rf the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the artificial neural network ann the long short term memory network lstm the convolutional neural network cnn and the residual network resnet have been utilized for downscaling rf is an ensemble learning algorithm which integrates multiple decision trees breiman 2001 the basic idea of rf is to use bootstrap to generate multiple sample sets and a decision tree is constructed for each set predictions of each individual tree are aggregated to yield final results by averaging liu et al 2020 such strategy makes it insensitive to multivariate collinearity and it also has great ability in dealing with data noise and overfitting shangguan et al 2022 gbdt is another popular ensemble learning approach based on boosting which constructs several weak decision trees and finally combines them to form a strong learner after many iterations thus being robust to outliers and unbalanced data jerome 2001 ann is a flexible and efficient method that interconnects neurons or nodes as a network to solve complex nonlinear problem elnashar et al 2020 generally the architecture of ann consists of one input layer several hidden layers and an output layer and each layer is comprised of several neurons lstm is a deep learning algorithm that makes full use of sequential information hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it takes the output of previous step as input and therefore allows information from previous step to further influence the next moment in this study the variables on previous 3 days were utilized cnn is a classical data driven deep learning model which was first proposed by lecun et al 1989 and has been successfully applied in the domain of downscaling such as ndvi nomura and oki 2021 precipitation jiang et al 2021 temperature sun and lan 2021 as well as soil moisture xu et al 2021 the basic structure of the cnn consists of an input layer several hidden layers including a convolutional layer a pooling layer and an output layer the resnet model is developed on the foundation of cnn he et al 2016 and has been used in the field of object detection chen et al 2020 image classification liu et al 2021b and soil moisture downscaling zhao et al 2022 the core module of resnet is the residual block that implements shortcut connections in the network architecture thus reducing gradient explosion and alleviating the performance degradation problem to some extent specially the typical resnet 18 architecture with 8 residual blocks was utilized in this study table 3 shows the performance comparison of these methods in soil moisture downscaling and their main features advantages and drawbacks 3 3 bayesian three cornered hat merging the bayesian three cornered hat btch method he et al 2020 was leveraged to integrate different machine learning approaches to generate a more accurate downscaled sm product for the ith sm product s m i the probability density function pdf could be expressed as follows 1 p sm i sm t 1 σ i 2 π e x p ε i 2 2 σ i 2 l sm t sm i 2 ε i sm i sm t where sm t is the true value of sm ε i and σ i 2 are the zero mean white noise and error variance of the ith sm product respectively l is the likelihood function in the condition of n sets of sm product the likelihood function of true sm s m t could be expressed as follows 3 l sm t sm 1 sm 2 sm n i 1 n p sm i sm t i 1 n 1 2 π σ i e x p ε i 2 2 σ i 2 in order to get the maximum likelihood value of sm t in eq 3 the cost function could be defined as 4 j sm t i 1 n ε i 2 2 σ i 2 i 1 n sm i sm t 2 2 σ i 2 by setting the first variation of j sm t to zero sm t could be obtained as 5 sm t i 1 n w i sm i where 6 w i k 1 k i n σ k 2 j 1 n k 1 k j n σ k 2 the error variance σ i 2 of each sm product could be derived by utilizing the three cornered hat tch method consider the time series sm i i 1 2 n of the six downscaled sm products generated by different machine learning methods at each pixel the tch method splits each time series into true value and error as follows 7 sm i sm true ε i where sm true is the true value and ε i is the zero mean white noise of sm i then the difference between the n 1 time series and the reference series can be expressed as 8 y i n sm i sm n ε i ε n i 1 2 n 1 where y is a matrix with n 1 time series and the covariance matrix of y is given as 9 s c o v y then the n n unknown covariance matrix of the individual noise r can be described as 10 s j r j t j i u where i is the n 1 n 1 identity matrix and u is a n 1 unit column vector to solve eq 10 an objective function f that fulfills the positive definiteness of r can be defined as 11 f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i 1 n j 1 n r ij 2 i j where k s n 1 and the constraint function g and the initial iteration conditions are 12 g r 1 n r nn r s k 0 13 r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s u t s 1 u after obtaining the matrix r by minimizing eq 11 the square root of the diagonal values of r denotes the uncertainty of each downscaled sm product for a detailed introduction and formula calculation of the tch method please refer to tavella and premoli 1994 and liu et al 2021a 3 4 evaluation metrics the in situ observations were used for evaluation and were averaged on a daily scale to ensure temporal consistency with smap product four traditional statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient r root mean square error r m s e unbiased rmse u b r m s e and bias entekhabi et al 2010a were adopted in this study these metrics can be calculated as follows 14 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 15 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 16 ubrmse i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n 17 bias 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x i and y i are the downscaled sm and observed sm values respectively and n is the size of samples however the spatial mismatching gap between the in situ points and satellite pixels exists during evaluation and the errors in the rmse and bias metrics could partly be due to the mismatch issue entekhabi et al 2010b ma et al 2021 while the r and ubrmse are less influenced by such mismatch thus more emphasis is placed on these two metrics in the following sections besides the daily observations from the stations that located in the same cell were averaged before evaluation to mitigate the mismatching problem in addition since the merged soil moisture could be obtained from 18 sm m i n w i sm i sm true i n w i i n w i ε i sm true ε m 19 i n w i 1 the error of merged sm then could be derived by 20 ε m i n w i ε i and the error variance of merged sm σ ε m 2 could be calculated as 21 σ ε m 2 w r w t where w is the 1 n vector of merging weight and r is the n n covariance matrix of the individual noise calculated using tch method and the square root of σ ε m 2 represents the tch uncertainty of merged sm 4 results 4 1 inter comparison between different machine learning methods first the downscaling performances of different machine learning methods were evaluated against in situ measurements and inter compared table 4 shows the mean evaluation results of these six machine learning methods in different networks it could be observed that the performances of different machine learning approaches varied at different network for the maqu network the gbdt had the best r and ubrmse scores with the values of 0 48 and 0 059 m3 m3 respectively while the resnet method exhibited the lowest rmse and bias values as for the naqu network the ann showed the lowest ubrmse value 0 057 m3 m3 and the rf had the highest correlation 0 64 with ground observations similarly the resnet presented the best rmse and bias scores however even though the resnet possessed the lowest ubrmse 0 032 m3 m3 in ngari network the ann model outperformed other methods at ngari network with the highest r scores and the lowest rmse and bias values given the r and ubrmse metrics that are less sensitive to the mismatching issue it could be concluded that the gbdt had the greatest potential in downscaling sm followed by the rf ann resnet lstm and cnn model the tree based algorithms including gbdt and rf have been demonstrated to outperform other machine deep learning approaches in dealing with tabulate data due to the ensemble learning strategy meanwhile the ann could well extract the high dimension nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and complicated surface variables especially in cold regions previous study has justified the great capability of lstm in soil moisture prediction li et al 2022 and it also yielded relatively high correlation in this study yet large ubrmse also existed the resnet model however generated better bias but also lower correlation owing to its skip connection and residual learning characteristics fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of best performing methods according to the uncertainty calculated by tch method distinct discrepancy existed in the spatial distribution for each algorithm that performed best specifically the gbdt model showed the best performance in 38 54 of the qtp area mainly located in the southern regions followed by rf 38 15 mostly distributed in the eastern areas in addition the cnn and resnet methods had the lowest uncertainty in the arid regions of the northern plateau such as the qaidam basin the area percentages were 1 77 and 4 4 respectively the ann model however had the superiority in the northwestern regions with a total percentage of 13 67 which was consistent with the evaluation results against in situ measurements that ann performed best in the ngari network whereas the lstm only accounted for 3 47 of the plateau and performed best mostly in the valleys of the qtp in addition the tch uncertainty of each approach under diverse land covers was presented in fig 4 to further elaborate the performance differences overall all methods performed better in barren and shrub land while had relatively larger uncertainty in savannas and forest land among various methods the tree based model including gbdt and rf had the lowest uncertainty under all land covers and the lstm and cnn had the worst downscaling ability with a mean uncertainty of 0 046 m3 m3 and 0 044 m3 m3 respectively besides the ann achieved the best scores in barren land but showed large uncertainty in savannas the mean uncertainty of ann in barren land and savannas were 0 027 m3 m3 and 0 052 m3 m3 the performance of resnet also varied a lot ranging from 0 034 m3 m3 in barren to 0 049 m3 m3 in grassland based on the above results conclusions could be drawn that there was indeed a certain performance difference among various machine learning approaches for soil moisture downscaling and such discrepancy might be mainly associated with the characteristics of algorithms themselves but also related to the underlying surface e g land cover 4 2 evaluation of match soil moisture fig 5 shows the violin plots and boxplots of the evaluation metrics of downscaled match sm and original smap sm products at the station scale for each network compared with smap sm product the downscaled sm product using match method had comparable accuracy and was much closer to ground truth with mean r ubrmse rmse and bias values of 0 55 0 047 m3 m3 0 082 m3 m3 and 0 040 m3 m3 for all stations respectively while the overall mean values of r ubrmse rmse and bias for smap were 0 67 0 056 m3 m3 0 097 m3 m3 and 0 061 m3 m3 respectively specifically for the r value the match sm was inferior than smap sm in all networks with mean r values of 0 49 0 66 and 0 57 for maqu naqu and ngari network respectively while the mean r values of smap sm for maqu naqu and ngari network were 0 67 0 74 and 0 64 respectively however with regards to the ubrmse score the match sm product exhibited obviously better performance than smap sm in naqu network with a mean ubrmse value of 0 059 m3 m3 while the mean ubrmse for smap was 0 091 m3 m3 similarly the downscaled sm also showed better accuracy in ngari network with an improvement of 0 008 m3 m3 nevertheless for the maqu network the match sm had slightly higher ubrmse than smap sm and the mean ubrmse were 0 058 m3 m3 and 0 056 m3 m3 respectively as for the rmse metric the mean values of match sm for maqu naqu and ngari network were 0 089 m3 m3 0 118 m3 m3 and 0 055 m3 m3 respectively while those for smap sm were 0 109 m3 m3 0 150 m3 m3 and 0 058 m3 m3 respectively in terms of bias the downscaled sm had better performances than smap sm in naqu and maqu network but presented relatively higher bias in ngari network in addition evaluation was conducted at the network scale to further investigate whether match sm product could capture the dynamic evolution of areal in situ sm sánchez ruiz et al 2014 the ground observations smap sm product and match sm product were first averaged within each network on the daily scale and metrics were then calculated table 5 shows the evaluation metrics regarding the error statistics both match and smap sm products had the best scores in ngari network followed by maqu network while in naqu network the two products both presented the worst performances according to the land cover distributions in fig 1 this finding implied that both smap and match based products could well estimate the soil moisture in arid and semi arid areas but behaved relatively poorly in densely vegetated regions in comparison with the original smap product the downscaled product had obvious improvement in naqu network showing comparable correlation and good agreement with in situ observations with ubrmse enhanced from 0 075 m3 m3 to 0 056 m3 m3 this might due to the fact that the match sm had slight underestimation compared with smap sm while the smap sm was overestimated against ground measurements however it was worth noting that the r value in maqu network decreased sharply after downscaling but were relatively stable in naqu and ngari networks the ubrmse values of the downscaled product in the three networks ranging from 0 016 m3 m3 to 0 056 m3 m3 were mostly less than the accuracy criterion of 0 040 m3 m3 and fully complied with the requirements of the smap mission demonstrating that the downscaled sm product could not only well maintain the original smap accuracy but also improve the product spatial resolution overall it could be inferred that the match method has great potential in downscaling sm with high accuracy 4 3 improvements of model integration fig 6 presents the comparison of evaluation metrics between match sm and the machine learning based downscaled sms to further justify the potential of model integration obviously the match method outperformed these six machine deep learning approaches with the highest correlation and the lowest ubrmse score the mean values of r and ubrmse for match sm were 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 respectively while among different machine learning methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 resnet however it should be noted that the mean rmse value of resnet was slightly lower than match sm and the absolute value of mean bias for match method was also higher than those of ann cnn and resnet nevertheless the bias and rmse metrics were prone to be impacted by the spatial mismatch between satellite footprint and ground point while the r and ubrmse could alleviate such influence to a certain extent to which more attention should be paid therefore it could still be concluded that the match method could effectively integrate the strengths of different machine learning algorithms to generate sm product with high spatial resolution and precision and show great potential in the field of soil moisture downscaling besides based the evaluation results in section 4 1 and 4 2 in different networks apparent improvements could be observed between the match sm and each single machine learning downscaled sm with correlation and ubrmse enhanced by 0 09 0 15 and 0 002 0 006 m3 m3 respectively fig 7 exhibits the density plot of the uncertainty for the downscaled sms generated by each machine learning method the match sm and the composed minimum uncertainty of each approaches the spatial distributions of the composed minimum uncertainty and the uncertainty of match sm were also presented in fig 8 compared with each single downscaled sm the integrated soil moisture had obviously lower uncertainty with a mean value of 0 013 m3 m3 and a range of 0 0 04 m3 m3 while the mean value and range for the composed minimum uncertainty were 0 021 m3 m3 and 0 0 06 m3 m3 respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the merged soil moisture had apparently higher accuracy across the qtp especially in the southern and eastern regions indicating the great potential and efficiency of the proposed match method for soil moisture downscaling the merged sm had uncertainty basically below 0 03 m3 m3 in these areas whereas the values for the composed minimum uncertainty were almost above 0 03 m3 m3 and even reached 0 06 m3 m3 in some regions meanwhile fig 8 implied that all methods could achieve satisfactory downscaling results in the western and northwestern regions while the uncertainty was slightly larger in the southern and southeastern of the qtp 4 4 temporal variations besides in order to further analyze the temporal variations of downscaled results the smap sm match sm and in situ observations were plotted against precipitation during the unfrozen period of 2015 2019 at the network scale fig 9 the values of smap sm product downscaled sm product ground measurements and precipitation for each station within a network were averaged on the daily scale for all networks the downscaled sm product could well capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture the sm values for all networks exhibited significant seasonal variations and also presented good temporal consistency with the occurrence of rainfall events high precipitation usually resulted in high moisture condition in summer since soil moisture has an obvious and strong physical connection with precipitation brocca et al 2014 specifically for ngari network relatively high sm values were mainly attributed to the predominant precipitation in the summer moreover sudden increases in sm from july to august could be observed followed by a smooth decline driven by evapotranspiration and drainage after a rainfall pulse ciabatta et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 nevertheless the sensitivity of soil moisture to precipitation was slightly hampered after downscaling which might be attributed to the weighting merge procedure such merging strategy pays less attention to abnormal values and may yield smooth and robust sm data in naqu network downscaled sm product presented better consistency with original smap sm product than that of in situ measurements besides compared with ground values obvious overestimation could be observed both for downscaled sm and smap sm such overestimation was reasonable since naqu belongs to semi humid climate and has very dense vegetation in summer which hampers the retrieval accuracy of smap sm ayres et al 2021 fan et al 2020 ma et al 2017a as for maqu network comparing with the original smap product the downscaled results had lower bias throughout the whole study period having better agreement with ground observations and maintaining good sensitivity to precipitation similarly the downscaled sm was found to be smoother in time and was underestimated to a certain extent when compared with smap sm 5 discussions 5 1 spatial patterns of downscaled sm fig 10 presents the average annual match sm and smap sm estimates from 2015 to 2019 from the perspective of spatial distribution the sm over the qtp gradually decreased from southeast to northwest showing relatively wet and dry statuses in east and west regions respectively this kind of distribution reflected the dominant impacts of climate and topography on the spatial pattern of sm the high sm areas were mainly situated in the east and southeast of the qtp and the climate there belonged to the plateau temperate humid semi humid climate with abundant precipitation while the dry regions were located in the northwest of the qtp with arid semi arid climate at the same time relative wet condition was also found around the qinghai lake but the moisture condition of the qaidam basin in the north was quite dry extremely low precipitation due to the blocking effect of the surrounding mountains coupled with the high evapotranspiration caused by strong solar radiation have contributed to the low soil moisture levels in this basin similar spatial pattern could also be found from the original smap sm map fig 10 four places with different hydroclimatic and topographic conditions were further selected to show the spatial details of soil moisture apparently the downscaled sm product could provide much richer spatial distribution information and could fill the gaps of original smap sm product to a certain extent however it should be noted that the values of downscaled sm in maqu sites were somehow lower than those of the smap sm product indicating that there existed an underestimation of the downscaled product over the original coarse scale smap sm product which were mainly distributed in the east regions given the evaluation results in section 4 2 it could be found that the original smap sm exhibited overestimation issues in relatively humid areas as high topsoil volumetric water content could affect the effective soil roughness which in turn led to the overestimation to some extent the match method therefore failed to obtain satisfactory downscaling results in areas with high moisture levels and showed certain degree of overestimation 5 2 analysis of scale effects the scale effects in this study mainly refers to two aspects the different spatial observation scale between in situ points and satellite pixels and the application of downscaling models at fine scale but constructed at coarse scale qu et al 2021 although the evaluation and comparison results revealed that different approaches had diverse performances and the integration could well improve the downscaling accuracy the spatial mismatch between ground point and satellite footprint inevitably hinder the evaluation reliability to a certain extent therefore in order to draw a fail evaluation and sound conclusion the r and ubrmse metrics were more emphasized in this study since the ubrmse could remove the bias caused by spatial mismatch ma et al 2021 and the correlation is indifferent to any bias in mean or amplitude of variations entekhabi et al 2010b besides two dense networks e g ngari and maqu network were adopted in this study and stations within a same pixel were averaged before evaluation which could also mitigate the representative error caused by spatial mismatch ma et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 meanwhile dong et al 2020 demonstrated that the representative errors do not influence the relative accuracy assessment of sm products hence the findings obtained are relatively sound and fair the latter aspect is also the key assumption of utilizing machine learning algorithms in downscaling wei et al 2019 therefore the original smap sm both at 36 km and 9 km and the smap sentinel 1 sm 3 km product were selected as references with different scales and comparisons were made between the match sm and reference sms to test whether the match method is robust enough to be applied across scales as is shown in fig 11 the downscaled sm had high correlation with original 36 km smap product this was reasonable since the 36 km smap sm was used for training models compared with 36 km smap the performance of downscaled sm was improved slightly at 9 km with correlation coefficients r increasing from 0 80 to 0 82 and rmse changing from 0 080 m3 m3 to 0 077 m3 m3 when it comes to 3 km scale the performance was deteriorated and the r rmse and bias were 0 52 0 130 m3 m3 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively meanwhile it could be observed that a certain portion of smap 3 km data with low values was severely overestimated in the downscaled sm increasing from around 0 0 11 m3 m3 to 0 25 0 45 m3 m3 5 3 feature importance the feature importance was also evaluated using the permutation feature importance technique which refers to the decrease in prediction accuracy when a predictor variable is randomly permuted breiman 2001 zhang et al 2022 the reduction of mean absolute error was chosen as the referencing criterion as is shown in fig 12 although the importance of features varied among different methods the vegetation including ndvi and evi temperature including lst day and lst diff terrain including dem slope aspect and twi and albedos were the main factors impacting downscaling for all methods which is agreement with previous studies long et al 2019 these factors are directly connected with the physical cycle of soil moisture dynamics and have been widely utilized in soil moisture downscaling researches in addition features such as longitude latitude and doy day of the year representing the geographical location and time domain information also showed great influences besides the soil texture clay sand and silt information had a certain degree of impacts on downscaling with importance ranging from 5 94 to 11 31 since it influences water infiltration rates permeability and soil water storage capacity the soc also exerted essential impact on sm accounting for 5 11 15 74 on the contrary the effects of land cover types were quite small only accounting for 0 93 8 38 5 4 limitations and prospects despite the good capability of match method in downscaling soil moisture some limitations and drawbacks still exist firstly obtaining temporally continuous and spatially complete predicting variables are crucial for downscaling because factors such as lst and ndvi that have great importance on downscaling are prone to cloud contamination and gaps often exist especially on the daily scale however some researches either neglect or simply address it by linear interpolation which may introduce extra errors to downscaling the harmonic analysis of time series hants algorithm and savitzky golay filter were utilized in this study to fill gaps however more accurate and effective methods such as starfm feng et al 2006 estarfm zhu et al 2010 and staarch hilker et al 2009 should be adopted for gap filling and generating spatiotemporally complete auxiliary variables with high quality in addition precipitation was not considered as predictors in this study due to its coarse spatial resolution 0 05 the contribution of such coarse scale precipitation data to soil moisture downscaling is very limited zhang et al 2022 as a consequence the downscaled sm was smoothed and the ability of capturing precipitation was weakened to a certain extent when comparing with smap sm and in situ measurements future study should take precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution 1 km daily into account for downscaling to further improve the sensitivity and responses of downscaled sm to precipitation furthermore due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution or incomplete spatiotemporal coverage of smap brightness temperature or sentiel 1 radar backscattering coefficient these two variables were not considered in this study besides since the spatial mismatch inevitably affected the evaluation results more dense networks should be utilized to further test the potential of match method in future works the integration of different machine learning algorithms is achieved by leveraging a weighted merging strategy based on bayesian maximum likelihood estimation and relative uncertainty calculated by tch method such uncertainty however is static and time invariant failing to fully characterize the error information of soil moisture especially in time domain and is insufficient for data assimilation and data fusion studies wu et al 2021 attempts have been made in previous researches to investigate and quantify the temporal dynamics of sm errors by exploiting the triple collocation analysis tca with a time moving window which relaxes the stationary assumption of tch into a short time scale dorigo et al 2010 loew and schlenz 2011 zwieback et al 2012 therefore the potential application of utilizing time variant sm errors in merging process should also be explored in further studies 6 conclusions different machine deep learning methods were utilized for soil moisture downscaling and a robust hybrid downscaling method that integrates various approaches based on bayesian three cornered hat merging match was proposed in this study the performance of each single approach was evaluated and intercompared and their differences were fully discussed the potential and feasibility of match method was comprehensively assessed by evaluating against in situ measurements and comparing with single method the key findings are given as follows 1 evaluation and inter comparison results of different downscaling methods revealed that their performances varied at different networks based on the r and ubrmse metrics the gbdt showed the best performance followed by the rf ann resnet lstm and cnn model besides distinct discrepancy existed in the spatial distribution of best performing methods the gbdt had the lowest uncertainty in the southern of the qtp and the rf exhibited best performance in the eastern regions while the ann outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas 2 compared with original smap sm the match sm presented comparable performance and lower errors with mean r and ubrmse values of 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 in addition comparison with single downscaled sm indicated that the match sm exhibited great improvement and had the highest correlation 0 55 and the lowest ubrmse 0 047 m3 m3 scores while among different machine learning methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 resnet 3 regarding temporal variations the downscaled sm could also effectively capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture and rainfall and well reflect seasonal variations however due to the weighted merging process and non consideration of precipitation as a predictor the sensitivity of downscaled sm was slightly weaker than that of smap and in situ measurements and the sm time series were smoothed to some extent 4 in terms of spatial distribution the downscaled sm could well represent the spatial pattern of soil moisture characterizing as wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest meanwhile the match method could effectively and accurately downscale soil moisture in arid and semi arid areas such as the west of the qtp whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions such overestimation was inherent from the original smap sm but was alleviated after downscaling having better agreement with in situ measurements based on the above findings it seems that the match method has great potential in soil moisture downscaling the downscaled sm product is much valuable for many fields such as drought monitoring and water resources management future works should focus on developing spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture at field scales e g 30 m credit authorship

2390,soil moisture sm is a key state variable in the water energy cycle between atmosphere and land surface but existing passive microwave soil moisture products typically have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers which fails to meet the requirements of regional applications even though numerous machine deep learning methods have been applied to downscale sm few studies have investigated the performance differences of diverse approaches and attempted to integrate various methods to improve downscaling accuracy therefore this study firstly evaluated and inter compared the downscaling performances of six machine deep learning approaches and further proposed a hybrid downscaling method based on bayesian three cornered hat merging match the daily 1 km seamless soil moisture product during 2015 2019 over the qinghai tibet plateau was then obtained evaluation and inter comparison results revealed that there was obvious performance discrepancy among different downscaling approaches and the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and random forest rf were the best two methods which performed best in the southern and eastern of the plateau respectively while the artificial neural network ann outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas validation against in situ measurements showed that compared with smap sm the match sm exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error with mean r and ubrmse values of 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 the mean r and ubrmse values for smap sm were 0 67 and 0 056 m3 m3 respectively in addition the match sm presented great improvement compared with any single downscaled sm data having the highest correlation and the lowest ubrmse scores while among different methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 residual network resnet besides the downscaled sm could accurately reflect the temporal variations of soil moisture and precipitation and effectively represent the spatial patterns of soil moisture satisfactory downscaling results were achieved in arid and semi arid areas whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions such overestimation was inherent from original smap sm but was mitigated after downscaling in conclusion performance differences existed among diverse downscaling approaches and the developed match method could maximize the potentials of each method and show encouraging downscaling performances keywords soil moisture downscaling machine learning integration inter comparison the qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm defined as the total amount of water within the unsaturated zone peng et al 2017b is a key state variable in water cycle and energy budgets of land ecosystem brocca et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2015 controlling the process of evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 influencing the partitioning of infiltration and runoff tuttle and salvucci 2014 and governing vegetation water uptake qu et al 2021 thus having an essential role in weather forecasting koster randal et al 2004 drought monitoring hirschi et al 2011 and water resource management zhang et al 2016 accurate and detailed information of the spatiotemporal distribution of sm would therefore greatly improve our understanding of the land atmosphere system as the water tower of asia the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the source of seven major river in asia however due to the complex and unique geographical environment detailed seamless soil moisture information with high precision and high resolution over the qtp is still severely lacking there are various approaches to obtain soil moisture information including in situ measurements and remotely sensed estimation generally speaking ground observation can provide precise estimation of soil moisture but are costly and labor intensive and also have poor spatial representation for neighboring areas due to its high spatial heterogeneity peng et al 2017b while remote sensing especially microwave remote sensing becomes the most promising tools in mapping regional to global soil moisture owing to the direct relationship between the electromagnetic radiation soil dielectric and water content and the better penetrating capability of microwaves ebrahimi khusfi et al 2018 ma et al 2019 sabaghy et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 therefore ample efforts have been devoted to retrieve surface soil moisture using microwave remote sensing including the active remote sensors such as the c sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellite snoeij et al 2010 and the metop a b advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 and passive remote sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e brocca et al 2011 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 and the l band radiometer onboard the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 satellite nevertheless microwave soil moisture products usually have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers such soil moisture products are only suitable for potential applications at continental and global scales but fail to meet regional application requirements such as water resource management fang et al 2018 drought monitoring peng et al 2017a precipitation evapotranspiration estimation peng et al 2021a and precision agriculture crow et al 2000 fang et al 2018 peng et al 2021a hence numerous downscaling methods have been proposed to derive soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolution and these methods can be divided into four categories microwave based downscaling optical based downscaling data assimilation based downscaling and machine learning based downscaling techniques sabaghy et al 2018 microwave based downscaling methods such as the change detection algorithm piles et al 2009 active passive optional algorithm das et al 2011 and baseline algorithm das et al 2014 can combine the high spatial resolution of active microwave with the high sensitivity to soil moisture of passive microwave but suffer from the low temporal coverage of radar high sensitivity to vegetation cover and surface roughness and lacking of concurrent active and passive observations sabaghy et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 comparatively the optical based methods have the advantages of disaggregating soil moisture into higher spatial resolution due to the high spatiotemporal optical observations based on the land surface temperature lst vegetation indes vi triangle feature space carlson et al 1994 gillies and carlson 1995 several approaches have been developed including the polynomial fitting downscaling method piles et al 2011 the dispatch model merlin et al 2012 and the ucla model kim and hogue 2012 some simple and efficient indices also have been exploited in the downscaling process such as the vegetation temperature condition index vtci wan et al 2004 and the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 in addition data assimilation method gains its popularity in downscaling soil moisture since it accounts for both model and measurement uncertainties and has great physical process interpretability and model transferability sabaghy et al 2018 seo et al 2021 machine learning deep learning have also been increasingly leveraged in soil moisture downscaling during the past few decades owing to its advantages of dealing with non linear problems and massive remote sensing data ali et al 2015 srivastava et al 2013 utilized the artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and generalized linear model glm to downscale the smos soil moisture product wei et al 2019 have successfully generated the 1 km soil moisture product over the qinghai tibet plateau by exploiting the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and integrating 26 soil moisture indices abowarda et al 2021 conducted the soil moisture downscaling at field scale 30 m using both data fusion and random forest rf algorithm xu et al 2021 also improved the spatial resolution of smap soil moisture products using the convolutional neural network cnn these studies implied that by leveraging the machine learning algorithms high spatial resolution soil moisture data with satisfactory accuracy could be obtained however only a few studies have intercompared the performances of different soil moisture downscaling methods and the performance discrepancy of diverse machine learning approaches should be further investigated besides based on existing researches it could be inferred that the performances of machine learning methods vary with the algorithm itself abowarda et al 2021 long et al 2019 wei et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 see table 3 for example the tree based algorithms such as the rf and the gbdt usually achieve satisfactory downscaling results due to their great capability in dealing with tabulate data while the ann could well fit the high dimension nonlinear relationship between surface variables and sm but are easily affected by uninformative data the cnn consider the local geospatial features of auxiliary factors through convolution and the long short term memory network lstm exhibits great ability in time series prediction and could capture the long and short term trends of soil moisture thus usually shows high correlation in the downscaled sm recently zhao et al 2022 intercompared the machine learning and deep learning approaches for soil moisture downscaling in the qtp and also revealed that differences existed among various methods specifically the deep learning methods outperformed the two classic machine learning approaches e g rf and ann with higher correlation and lower ubrmse while methods such as the residual network resnet that considering neighborhood relationship could further enhance the downscaling accuracy and provide more detailed spatial patterns in addition the spatial patterns of uncertainty for each method varied and the ann and resnet mainly performed best in the northeastern of the plateau while the rf had the lowest uncertainty in the southwestern regions nonetheless until recently few studies have attempted to integrate diverse machine deep learning approaches to improve downscaling accuracy despite the distinct performance differences among various downscaling methods the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 can be applied to quantify the error variances of a geophysical measurement system without knowing the ground truth and has been widely used for satellite based products assessment and merging such as precipitation and soil moisture chen et al 2022 2018 gruber et al 2017 peng et al 2021b in analogous to the tc method the three cornered hat tch method developed by premoli and tavella 1993 also estimates the relative uncertainty within three independent datasets by removing the common signal of true observations xu et al 2020 later an improved tch method was proposed he et al 2020 liu et al 2019 which could be applied to more than three time series and considered the cross correlation among datasets such approach offers a possible solution for combining different machine deep learning algorithms to downscale soil moisture therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the downscaling performances of different machine deep learning methods and develop a robust downscaling approach based on the machine learning and three cornered hat match method that integrates various machine deep learning algorithms the daily soil moisture product with high spatial resolution 1 km and high accuracy during 2015 2019 over the qtp was generated and the spatial patterns of soil moisture was analyzed overall in this study we aimed to address the following three specific questions 1 do the different machine deep learning approaches have similar or diverse downscaling performances 2 does the proposed method have the potential to integrate various methods to further improve the downscaling accuracy 3 how well does the match method behave compared with single downscaling method 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 located in southwestern china is the largest plateau in china with a total area of about 2 57 million km2 ma et al 2017b known as the roof of the world the qtp has a mean elevation of more than 4000 m dropping from more than 8000 m in the west to less than 1000 m in the east wang et al 2019 affected by factors such as altitude geomorphology indian ocean and pacific monsoons and westerly circulation the qtp extends from the humid monsoon zone in the southeast to the cold and arid plateau climate zone in the northwest zhang et al 2007 the central and southern parts of the qtp are influenced by the indian monsoon and have abundant precipitation while the western and northern parts of the qtp are affected by westerly winds and have less precipitation as the hengduan mountains block most of the water vapor although the southeast asian monsoon prevails in the eastern part of the qtp precipitation is limited ma et al 2017b as a result the average annual precipitation decreases from 1764 mm in the southeast to 16 mm in the northwest and the average annual temperature also drops from 15 5 c to 5 0 c chen et al 2015 the qtp has diverse vegetation types including forests shrubs meadows grasslands and deserts meadows and grasslands account for about 70 of the total area and are mainly distributed in the central and eastern regions shrubs and forests are mainly located in the southeast while deserts are distributed in the northwest piao et al 2011 2 2 smap soil moisture data the national aeronautics and space administration nasa s smap mission was launched on january 31 2015 aiming at monitoring global surface soil moisture and freeze thaw state entekhabi et al 2010a with the help of the l band radar and radiometer the smap satellite can provide surface soil moisture 5 cm depth observations with a spatial resolution of 3 km and 40 km respectively and achieve a global coverage within 2 3 days however the radar sensor of the smap satellite was damaged on july 7 2015 due to a hardware failure the descending and ascending half orbit passes of the smap satellite are at 6 a m and 6 p m local time respectively this study utilized the smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture version 7 descending product which adopts an improved brightness temperature calibration methodology and an enhanced land surface model to estimate soil temperature the soilgrid250m product was also exploited to provide soil information 2 3 modis products sandholt et al 2002 and zeng et al 2019 has summarized the interacting factors that are closely related to soil moisture and determine the surface brightness temperature these factors can be categorized into vegetation energy climate topography and soil properties therefore several moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis collection 6 products were adopted to derive these auxiliary variables table 1 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi were calculated from the daily mod09ga product the land surface temperature including the daytime lst and the difference of daytime and nighttime lst were derived from the mod11a1 and mod11a2 products both white sky and black sky albedo for visible near infrared and shortwave bands were obtained from the mcd43a3 product with a spatiotemporal resolution of 500 m and 1 day the yearly land cover was provided by the mcd12q1 product and the international geosphere biosphere program igbp land cover classification scheme was selected 2 4 other auxiliary datasets in addition to the above satellite data the world wildlife fund wwf hydrosheds void filled digital elevation model dem at a 3 arc seconds resolution was used to provide topographic factors elevation aspect slope and topographic wetness index twi the soil textures clay sand silt fractions and soil organic carbon soc with a resolution of 250 m were also utilized in this study since the soil textures are essential descriptors of the hydraulic transmissivity and the soc is recognized to impact the hydraulic conductivity of soil grillakis et al 2021 nemes et al 2005 all these soil parameters were obtained from the recently released basic soil property dataset of high resolution china soil information grids feng and ganlin 2021 liu et al 2022a the daily precipitation data were from the chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data dataset which incorporates 0 05 resolution satellite imagery with in situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series table 1 lists the ancillary variables used in this study 2 5 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ soil moisture measurements from the international soil moisture network ismn were chosen as ground truth to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed match method the ismn provides quality controlled and harmonized in situ soil moisture datasets from various operational networks and ground validation campaigns dorigo et al 2021 2011 three networks on the qtp namely the ngari 18 sites available including 3 ali sites and 15 shiquanhe sites naqu 9 sites available and maqu 20 sites available monitoring networks were selected only the data with 0 5 cm depth e g 0 5 cm or 5 cm were selected table 2 and the preprocessing was conducted following the guidance of ma et al 2019 2021 1 the evaluation period was set as the unfrozen season from may to october during 2015 2019 2 the utc time of ground observations was converted into local time to remove the temporal mismatch during evaluation 3 only the good quality records flagged as g for each sites were retained and sites have fewer than 30 samples were excluded 4 only stations that have correlation with p value 0 01 were considered to obtain robust statistical results 3 methodology fig 2 showed the framework flow of the downscaling method used in this study first sm downscaling predictors including ndvi evi lst albedo soc soil texture clay sand and silt terrain dem slope aspect and twi landcover latitude longitude and day of the year doy were preprocessed and resampled to 36 km then six machine learning models were constructed taking the smap soil moisture data as target and the corresponding downscaled surface soil moisture was generated a bayesian based three cornered hat btch merging method was subsequently applied to obtain the final downscaled surface soil moisture finally the performance of each downscaled sm and merged downscaled product was evaluated using ground based measurements and inter compared 3 1 data preprocessing spatiotemporally continuous input variables should be obtained to improve the completeness of downscaled sm for ndvi and evi the cloud free time series were reconstructed using harmonic analysis of time series hants algorithm which has been widely applied to reconstruct time series of ndvi lai as well as lst to remove random noise or eliminate cloud snow contamination roerink et al 2000 shiff et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 a similar integrated method developed by yang et al 2019 was exploited to reconstruct daily modis lst data using both mod11a1 and mod11a2 product as for albedo a savitzky golay filter was utilized to generate the gap filled albedo data all the auxiliary data were then resampled to 36 km and 1 km for model training and predicting meanwhile water mask was also applied to exclude water bodies and permanent soil and ice area during model construction data were randomly divided into training set 70 validating set 20 and testing set 10 and all predictors were normalized using z score standard normalization hyperparameters were optimized using grid search strategy and bayesian optimization and 5 fold cross validation technique was also adopted 3 2 machine learning methods for downscaling six machine deep learning methods namely the random forest rf the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the artificial neural network ann the long short term memory network lstm the convolutional neural network cnn and the residual network resnet have been utilized for downscaling rf is an ensemble learning algorithm which integrates multiple decision trees breiman 2001 the basic idea of rf is to use bootstrap to generate multiple sample sets and a decision tree is constructed for each set predictions of each individual tree are aggregated to yield final results by averaging liu et al 2020 such strategy makes it insensitive to multivariate collinearity and it also has great ability in dealing with data noise and overfitting shangguan et al 2022 gbdt is another popular ensemble learning approach based on boosting which constructs several weak decision trees and finally combines them to form a strong learner after many iterations thus being robust to outliers and unbalanced data jerome 2001 ann is a flexible and efficient method that interconnects neurons or nodes as a network to solve complex nonlinear problem elnashar et al 2020 generally the architecture of ann consists of one input layer several hidden layers and an output layer and each layer is comprised of several neurons lstm is a deep learning algorithm that makes full use of sequential information hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it takes the output of previous step as input and therefore allows information from previous step to further influence the next moment in this study the variables on previous 3 days were utilized cnn is a classical data driven deep learning model which was first proposed by lecun et al 1989 and has been successfully applied in the domain of downscaling such as ndvi nomura and oki 2021 precipitation jiang et al 2021 temperature sun and lan 2021 as well as soil moisture xu et al 2021 the basic structure of the cnn consists of an input layer several hidden layers including a convolutional layer a pooling layer and an output layer the resnet model is developed on the foundation of cnn he et al 2016 and has been used in the field of object detection chen et al 2020 image classification liu et al 2021b and soil moisture downscaling zhao et al 2022 the core module of resnet is the residual block that implements shortcut connections in the network architecture thus reducing gradient explosion and alleviating the performance degradation problem to some extent specially the typical resnet 18 architecture with 8 residual blocks was utilized in this study table 3 shows the performance comparison of these methods in soil moisture downscaling and their main features advantages and drawbacks 3 3 bayesian three cornered hat merging the bayesian three cornered hat btch method he et al 2020 was leveraged to integrate different machine learning approaches to generate a more accurate downscaled sm product for the ith sm product s m i the probability density function pdf could be expressed as follows 1 p sm

cornered hat tch method consider the time series sm i i 1 2 n of the six downscaled sm products generated by different machine learning methods at each pixel the tch method splits each time series

introduction and formula calculation of the tch method please refer to tavella and premoli 1994 and liu et al 2021a 3 4 evaluation metrics the in situ observations were used for evaluation and were averaged on a daily scale to ensure temporal consistency with smap product four traditional statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient r root mean square error r m s e unbiased rmse u b r m s e and bias entekhabi et al 2010a were adopted in this study these metrics can be calculated as follows 14 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 15 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 16 ubrmse i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n 17 bias 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x i and y i are the downscaled sm and observed sm values respectively and n is the size of samples however the spatial mismatching gap between the in situ points and satellite pixels exists during evaluation and the errors in the rmse and bias metrics could partly be due to the mismatch issue entekhabi et al 2010b ma et al 2021 while the r and ubrmse are less influenced by such mismatch thus more emphasis is placed on these two metrics in the following sections besides the daily observations from the stations that located in the same cell were averaged before evaluation to mitigate the mismatching problem in addition since the merged soil moisture could be obtained from 18 sm m i n w i sm i sm true i n w i i n w i ε i sm true ε m 19 i n w i 1 the error of merged sm then could be derived by 20 ε m i n w i ε i and the error variance of merged sm σ ε m 2 could be calculated as 21 σ ε m 2 w r w t where w is the 1 n vector of merging weight and r is the n n covariance matrix of the individual noise calculated using tch method and the square root of σ ε m 2 represents the tch uncertainty of merged sm 4 results 4 1 inter comparison between different machine learning methods first the downscaling performances of different machine learning methods were evaluated against in situ measurements and inter compared table 4 shows the mean evaluation results of these six machine learning methods in different networks it could be observed that the performances of different machine learning approaches varied at different network for the maqu network the gbdt had the best r and ubrmse scores with the values of 0 48 and 0 059 m3 m3 respectively while the resnet method exhibited the lowest rmse and bias values as for the naqu network the ann showed the lowest ubrmse value 0 057 m3 m3 and the rf had the highest correlation 0 64 with ground observations similarly the resnet presented the best rmse and bias scores however even though the resnet possessed the lowest ubrmse 0 032 m3 m3 in ngari network the ann model outperformed other methods at ngari network with the highest r scores and the lowest rmse and bias values given the r and ubrmse metrics that are less sensitive to the mismatching issue it could be concluded that the gbdt had the greatest potential in downscaling sm followed by the rf ann resnet lstm and cnn model the tree based algorithms including gbdt and rf have been demonstrated to outperform other machine deep learning approaches in dealing with tabulate data due to the ensemble learning strategy meanwhile the ann could well extract the high dimension nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and complicated surface variables especially in cold regions previous study has justified the great capability of lstm in soil moisture prediction li et al 2022 and it also yielded relatively high correlation in this study yet large ubrmse also existed the resnet model however generated better bias but also lower correlation owing to its skip connection and residual learning characteristics fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of best performing methods according to the uncertainty calculated by tch method distinct discrepancy existed in the spatial distribution for each algorithm that performed best specifically the gbdt model showed the best performance in 38 54 of the qtp area mainly located in the southern regions followed by rf 38 15 mostly distributed in the eastern areas in addition the cnn and resnet methods had the lowest uncertainty in the arid regions of the northern plateau such as the qaidam basin the area percentages were 1 77 and 4 4 respectively the ann model however had the superiority in the northwestern regions with a total percentage of 13 67 which was consistent with the evaluation results against in situ measurements that ann performed best in the ngari network whereas the lstm only accounted for 3 47 of the plateau and performed best mostly in the valleys of the qtp in addition the tch uncertainty of each approach under diverse land covers was presented in fig 4 to further elaborate the performance differences overall all methods performed better in barren and shrub land while had relatively larger uncertainty in savannas and forest land among various methods the tree based model including gbdt and rf had the lowest uncertainty under all land covers and the lstm and cnn had the worst downscaling ability with a mean uncertainty of 0 046 m3 m3 and 0 044 m3 m3 respectively besides the ann achieved the best scores in barren land but showed large uncertainty in savannas the mean uncertainty of ann in barren land and savannas were 0 027 m3 m3 and 0 052 m3 m3 the performance of resnet also varied a lot ranging from 0 034 m3 m3 in barren to 0 049 m3 m3 in grassland based on the above results conclusions could be drawn that there was indeed a certain performance difference among various machine learning approaches for soil moisture downscaling and such discrepancy might be mainly associated with the characteristics of algorithms themselves but also related to the underlying surface e g land cover 4 2 evaluation of match soil moisture fig 5 shows the violin plots and boxplots of the evaluation metrics of downscaled match sm and original smap sm products at the station scale for each network compared with smap sm product the downscaled sm product using match method had comparable accuracy and was much closer to ground truth with mean r ubrmse rmse and bias values of 0 55 0 047 m3 m3 0 082 m3 m3 and 0 040 m3 m3 for all stations respectively while the overall mean values of r ubrmse rmse and bias for smap were 0 67 0 056 m3 m3 0 097 m3 m3 and 0 061 m3 m3 respectively specifically for the r value the match sm was inferior than smap sm in all networks with mean r values of 0 49 0 66 and 0 57 for maqu naqu and ngari network respectively while the mean r values of smap sm for maqu naqu and ngari network were 0 67 0 74 and 0 64 respectively however with regards to the ubrmse score the match sm product exhibited obviously better performance than smap sm in naqu network with a mean ubrmse value of 0 059 m3 m3 while the mean ubrmse for smap was 0 091 m3 m3 similarly the downscaled sm also showed better accuracy in ngari network with an improvement of 0 008 m3 m3 nevertheless for the maqu network the match sm had slightly higher ubrmse than smap sm and the mean ubrmse were 0 058 m3 m3 and 0 056 m3 m3 respectively as for the rmse metric the mean values of match sm for maqu naqu and ngari network were 0 089 m3 m3 0 118 m3 m3 and 0 055 m3 m3 respectively while those for smap sm were 0 109 m3 m3 0 150 m3 m3 and 0 058 m3 m3 respectively in terms of bias the downscaled sm had better performances than smap sm in naqu and maqu network but presented relatively higher bias in ngari network in addition evaluation was conducted at the network scale to further investigate whether match sm product could capture the dynamic evolution of areal in situ sm sánchez ruiz et al 2014 the ground observations smap sm product and match sm product were first averaged within each network on the daily scale and metrics were then calculated table 5 shows the evaluation metrics regarding the error statistics both match and smap sm products had the best scores in ngari network followed by maqu network while in naqu network the two products both presented the worst performances according to the land cover distributions in fig 1 this finding implied that both smap and match based products could well estimate the soil moisture in arid and semi arid areas but behaved relatively poorly in densely vegetated regions in comparison with the original smap product the downscaled product had obvious improvement in naqu network showing comparable correlation and good agreement with in situ observations with ubrmse enhanced from 0 075 m3 m3 to 0 056 m3 m3 this might due to the fact that the match sm had slight underestimation compared with smap sm while the smap sm was overestimated against ground measurements however it was worth noting that the r value in maqu network decreased sharply after downscaling but were relatively stable in naqu and ngari networks the ubrmse values of the downscaled product in the three networks ranging from 0 016 m3 m3 to 0 056 m3 m3 were mostly less than the accuracy criterion of 0 040 m3 m3 and fully complied with the requirements of the smap mission demonstrating that the downscaled sm product could not only well maintain the original smap accuracy but also improve the product spatial resolution overall it could be inferred that the match method has great potential in downscaling sm with high accuracy 4 3 improvements of model integration fig 6 presents the comparison of evaluation metrics between match sm and the machine learning based downscaled sms to further justify the potential of model integration obviously the match method outperformed these six machine deep learning approaches with the highest correlation and the lowest ubrmse score the mean values of r and ubrmse for match sm were 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 respectively while among different machine learning methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 resnet however it should be noted that the mean rmse value of resnet was slightly lower than match sm and the absolute value of mean bias for match method was also higher than those of ann cnn and resnet nevertheless the bias and rmse metrics were prone to be impacted by the spatial mismatch between satellite footprint and ground point while the r and ubrmse could alleviate such influence to a certain extent to which more attention should be paid therefore it could still be concluded that the match method could effectively integrate the strengths of different machine learning algorithms to generate sm product with high spatial resolution and precision and show great potential in the field of soil moisture downscaling besides based the evaluation results in section 4 1 and 4 2 in different networks apparent improvements could be observed between the match sm and each single machine learning downscaled sm with correlation and ubrmse enhanced by 0 09 0 15 and 0 002 0 006 m3 m3 respectively fig 7 exhibits the density plot of the uncertainty for the downscaled sms generated by each machine learning method the match sm and the composed minimum uncertainty of each approaches the spatial distributions of the composed minimum uncertainty and the uncertainty of match sm were also presented in fig 8 compared with each single downscaled sm the integrated soil moisture had obviously lower uncertainty with a mean value of 0 013 m3 m3 and a range of 0 0 04 m3 m3 while the mean value and range for the composed minimum uncertainty were 0 021 m3 m3 and 0 0 06 m3 m3 respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the merged soil moisture had apparently higher accuracy across the qtp especially in the southern and eastern regions indicating the great potential and efficiency of the proposed match method for soil moisture downscaling the merged sm had uncertainty basically below 0 03 m3 m3 in these areas whereas the values for the composed minimum uncertainty were almost above 0 03 m3 m3 and even reached 0 06 m3 m3 in some regions meanwhile fig 8 implied that all methods could achieve satisfactory downscaling results in the western and northwestern regions while the uncertainty was slightly larger in the southern and southeastern of the qtp 4 4 temporal variations besides in order to further analyze the temporal variations of downscaled results the smap sm match sm and in situ observations were plotted against precipitation during the unfrozen period of 2015 2019 at the network scale fig 9 the values of smap sm product downscaled sm product ground measurements and precipitation for each station within a network were averaged on the daily scale for all networks the downscaled sm product could well capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture the sm values for all networks exhibited significant seasonal variations and also presented good temporal consistency with the occurrence of rainfall events high precipitation usually resulted in high moisture condition in summer since soil moisture has an obvious and strong physical connection with precipitation brocca et al 2014 specifically for ngari network relatively high sm values were mainly attributed to the predominant precipitation in the summer moreover sudden increases in sm from july to august could be observed followed by a smooth decline driven by evapotranspiration and drainage after a rainfall pulse ciabatta et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 nevertheless the sensitivity of soil moisture to precipitation was slightly hampered after downscaling which might be attributed to the weighting merge procedure such merging strategy pays less attention to abnormal values and may yield smooth and robust sm data in naqu network downscaled sm product presented better consistency with original smap sm product than that of in situ measurements besides compared with ground values obvious overestimation could be observed both for downscaled sm and smap sm such overestimation was reasonable since naqu belongs to semi humid climate and has very dense vegetation in summer which hampers the retrieval accuracy of smap sm ayres et al 2021 fan et al 2020 ma et al 2017a as for maqu network comparing with the original smap product the downscaled results had lower bias throughout the whole study period having better agreement with ground observations and maintaining good sensitivity to precipitation similarly the downscaled sm was found to be smoother in time and was underestimated to a certain extent when compared with smap sm 5 discussions 5 1 spatial patterns of downscaled sm fig 10 presents the average annual match sm and smap sm estimates from 2015 to 2019 from the perspective of spatial distribution the sm over the qtp gradually decreased from southeast to northwest showing relatively wet and dry statuses in east and west regions respectively this kind of distribution reflected the dominant impacts of climate and topography on the spatial pattern of sm the high sm areas were mainly situated in the east and southeast of the qtp and the climate there belonged to the plateau temperate humid semi humid climate with abundant precipitation while the dry regions were located in the northwest of the qtp with arid semi arid climate at the same time relative wet condition was also found around the qinghai lake but the moisture condition of the qaidam basin in the north was quite dry extremely low precipitation due to the blocking effect of the surrounding mountains coupled with the high evapotranspiration caused by strong solar radiation have contributed to the low soil moisture levels in this basin similar spatial pattern could also be found from the original smap sm map fig 10 four places with different hydroclimatic and topographic conditions were further selected to show the spatial details of soil moisture apparently the downscaled sm product could provide much richer spatial distribution information and could fill the gaps of original smap sm product to a certain extent however it should be noted that the values of downscaled sm in maqu sites were somehow lower than those of the smap sm product indicating that there existed an underestimation of the downscaled product over the original coarse scale smap sm product which were mainly distributed in the east regions given the evaluation results in section 4 2 it could be found that the original smap sm exhibited overestimation issues in relatively humid areas as high topsoil volumetric water content could affect the effective soil roughness which in turn led to the overestimation to some extent the match method therefore failed to obtain satisfactory downscaling results in areas with high moisture levels and showed certain degree of overestimation 5 2 analysis of scale effects the scale effects in this study mainly refers to two aspects the different spatial observation scale between in situ points and satellite pixels and the application of downscaling models at fine scale but constructed at coarse scale qu et al 2021 although the evaluation and comparison results revealed that different approaches had diverse performances and the integration could well improve the downscaling accuracy the spatial mismatch between ground point and satellite footprint inevitably hinder the evaluation reliability to a certain extent therefore in order to draw a fail evaluation and sound conclusion the r and ubrmse metrics were more emphasized in this study since the ubrmse could remove the bias caused by spatial mismatch ma et al 2021 and the correlation is indifferent to any bias in mean or amplitude of variations entekhabi et al 2010b besides two dense networks e g ngari and maqu network were adopted in this study and stations within a same pixel were averaged before evaluation which could also mitigate the representative error caused by spatial mismatch ma et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 meanwhile dong et al 2020 demonstrated that the representative errors do not influence the relative accuracy assessment of sm products hence the findings obtained are relatively sound and fair the latter aspect is also the key assumption of utilizing machine learning algorithms in downscaling wei et al 2019 therefore the original smap sm both at 36 km and 9 km and the smap sentinel 1 sm 3 km product were selected as references with different scales and comparisons were made between the match sm and reference sms to test whether the match method is robust enough to be applied across scales as is shown in fig 11 the downscaled sm had high correlation with original 36 km smap product this was reasonable since the 36 km smap sm was used for training models compared with 36 km smap the performance of downscaled sm was improved slightly at 9 km with correlation coefficients r increasing from 0 80 to 0 82 and rmse changing from 0 080 m3 m3 to 0 077 m3 m3 when it comes to 3 km scale the performance was deteriorated and the r rmse and bias were 0 52 0 130 m3 m3 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively meanwhile it could be observed that a certain portion of smap 3 km data with low values was severely overestimated in the downscaled sm increasing from around 0 0 11 m3 m3 to 0 25 0 45 m3 m3 5 3 feature importance the feature importance was also evaluated using the permutation feature importance technique which refers to the decrease in prediction accuracy when a predictor variable is randomly permuted breiman 2001 zhang et al 2022 the reduction of mean absolute error was chosen as the referencing criterion as is shown in fig 12 although the importance of features varied among different methods the vegetation including ndvi and evi temperature including lst day and lst diff terrain including dem slope aspect and twi and albedos were the main factors impacting downscaling for all methods which is agreement with previous studies long et al 2019 these factors are directly connected with the physical cycle of soil moisture dynamics and have been widely utilized in soil moisture downscaling researches in addition features such as longitude latitude and doy day of the year representing the geographical location and time domain information also showed great influences besides the soil texture clay sand and silt information had a certain degree of impacts on downscaling with importance ranging from 5 94 to 11 31 since it influences water infiltration rates permeability and soil water storage capacity the soc also exerted essential impact on sm accounting for 5 11 15 74 on the contrary the effects of land cover types were quite small only accounting for 0 93 8 38 5 4 limitations and prospects despite the good capability of match method in downscaling soil moisture some limitations and drawbacks still exist firstly obtaining temporally continuous and spatially complete predicting variables are crucial for downscaling because factors such as lst and ndvi that have great importance on downscaling are prone to cloud contamination and gaps often exist especially on the daily scale however some researches either neglect or simply address it by linear interpolation which may introduce extra errors to downscaling the harmonic analysis of time series hants algorithm and savitzky golay filter were utilized in this study to fill gaps however more accurate and effective methods such as starfm feng et al 2006 estarfm zhu et al 2010 and staarch hilker et al 2009 should be adopted for gap filling and generating spatiotemporally complete auxiliary variables with high quality in addition precipitation was not considered as predictors in this study due to its coarse spatial resolution 0 05 the contribution of such coarse scale precipitation data to soil moisture downscaling is very limited zhang et al 2022 as a consequence the downscaled sm was smoothed and the ability of capturing precipitation was weakened to a certain extent when comparing with smap sm and in situ measurements future study should take precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution 1 km daily into account for downscaling to further improve the sensitivity and responses of downscaled sm to precipitation furthermore due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution or incomplete spatiotemporal coverage of smap brightness temperature or sentiel 1 radar backscattering coefficient these two variables were not considered in this study besides since the spatial mismatch inevitably affected the evaluation results more dense networks should be utilized to further test the potential of match method in future works the integration of different machine learning algorithms is achieved by leveraging a weighted merging strategy based on bayesian maximum likelihood estimation and relative uncertainty calculated by tch method such uncertainty however is static and time invariant failing to fully characterize the error information of soil moisture especially in time domain and is insufficient for data assimilation and data fusion studies wu et al 2021 attempts have been made in previous researches to investigate and quantify the temporal dynamics of sm errors by exploiting the triple collocation analysis tca with a time moving window which relaxes the stationary assumption of tch into a short time scale dorigo et al 2010 loew and schlenz 2011 zwieback et al 2012 therefore the potential application of utilizing time variant sm errors in merging process should also be explored in further studies 6 conclusions different machine deep learning methods were utilized for soil moisture downscaling and a robust hybrid downscaling method that integrates various approaches based on bayesian three cornered hat merging match was proposed in this study the performance of each single approach was evaluated and intercompared and their differences were fully discussed the potential and feasibility of match method was comprehensively assessed by evaluating against in situ measurements and comparing with single method the key findings are given as follows 1 evaluation and inter comparison results of different downscaling methods revealed that their performances varied at different networks based on the r and ubrmse metrics the gbdt showed the best performance followed by the rf ann resnet lstm and cnn model besides distinct discrepancy existed in the spatial distribution of best performing methods the gbdt had the lowest uncertainty in the southern of the qtp and the rf exhibited best performance in the eastern regions while the ann outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas 2 compared with original smap sm the match sm presented comparable performance and lower errors with mean r and ubrmse values of 0 55 and 0 047 m3 m3 in addition comparison with single downscaled sm indicated that the match sm exhibited great improvement and had the highest correlation 0 55 and the lowest ubrmse 0 047 m3 m3 scores while among different machine learning methods the highest r was 0 50 gbdt and the lowest ubrmse was 0 052 m3 m3 resnet 3 regarding temporal variations the downscaled sm could also effectively capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture and rainfall and well reflect seasonal variations however due to the weighted merging process and non consideration of precipitation as a predictor the sensitivity of downscaled sm was slightly weaker than that of smap and in situ measurements and the sm time series were smoothed to some extent 4 in terms of spatial distribution the downscaled sm could well represent the spatial pattern of soil moisture characterizing as wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest meanwhile the match method could effectively and accurately downscale soil moisture in arid and semi arid areas such as the west of the qtp whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions such overestimation was inherent from the original smap sm but was alleviated after downscaling having better agreement with in situ measurements based on the above findings it seems that the match method has great potential in soil moisture downscaling the downscaled sm product is much valuable for many fields such as drought monitoring and water resources management future works should focus on developing spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture at field scales e g 30 m credit authorship

2391,intermittent karst springs iks are common phenomena in karst areas where spring flow rates rise and fall in variable periods which is generally attributed to the siphon structure in karst aquifers however the previous model assumed that the siphon cavity received a fixed recharge rate thus the iks showed a fixed periodic characteristic in this study an improved theoretical model iks model was proposed to simulate the hydrological process of iks with changing periods by considering the varying recharge rate from aquifers to the siphon cavity the model uses two tandem tanks to represent the karst aquifer and siphon cavity separately the numerical solution was obtained by the iterative method to predict the periodic variations of flow rate and eruption time of iks the iks model was verified by physical experiments under four representative recharge conditions showing good consistency between theoretical and experimental results it reveals the hydrologic processes mechanism of the iks by quantitatively describing the relationship between the cycle period of the iks discharge variations and the flow exchanges in the siphon cavity aquifer system furthermore this model performs well in simulating the hydrological process of chaoshuidong spring in central china and approximately estimated the hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer in the basin based on observed periodic changes in spring discharge these findings might be essential for the development management and protection of groundwater resources in iks keywords intermittent karst springs theoretical model physical experiments periodic variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst aquifer is one of the most important sources of freshwater supply globally there are about 13 8 of the earth s land covered by carbonate rocks and about 20 25 of the world s population usually uses karst groundwater as their primary domestic water ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 karst areas have strong heterogeneity and different water bearing media have different groundwater regulation and storage capacities intermittent karst springs iks are one of the more complex types whose flow rate is sometimes stable and sometimes erupts guo et al 2022 2020 milanovic 2007 sanz et al 2016 most models assume a fixed period for this hydrological process bonacci and bojanić 1991 mangin 1969 xiao and zhang 2021 however the iks exhibit a periodic changing characteristic with increasing flow monitoring frequency and duration debieche et al 2020 guo et al 2022 consequently there remains a challenge in understanding and modeling this hydrological process iks refers to the periodic discharge of groundwater controlled by a special karst development structure in karst areas which is a common phenomenon reported globally alfaro and wallace 1994 bonacci and bojanić 1991 debieche et al 2020 guo et al 2020 igracev 2014 milanovic 2007 scheibe et al 2015 it is also called ebb and flow springs white 2019 rhythmic karst springs bonacci and bojanić 1991 debieche et al 2020 xiao and zhang 2021 siphon springs milanovic 2007 sanz et al 2016 and periodic springs kansou and bredeweg 2014 due to the heterogeneity of karst aqueous medium and the zoning of karst development the direction of groundwater is primarily horizontal and vertical changes frequently during the migration process therefore karst siphon pipes are commonly developed mudry et al 2014 which are conditions for forming iks similar to geysers such as the old faithful iks also has a certain rhythm and its flow is sometimes steady and sometimes erupting however the formation mechanisms are different the former is related to geothermal vandemeulebrouck et al 2013 while the latter is closely related to special geological structures from the reported case studies the frequency is inconsistent and constantly changing in the period of no rainfall recharge the groundwater will still flow out intermittently in iks which is obviously different from ordinary karst springs the interpretation of siphon structure is widely accepted for the causes of intermittent hydrological processes in iks bonacci and bojanić 1991 milanovic 2007 which was confirmed in the fuentetota spring area in spain through diving and cave exploration sanz et al 2016 the iks s geological structure can be generalized as a recharge aquifer storage cave and siphon pipe in series fig 1 when rainfall recharges the aquifer the water table in the siphon cavity is usually lower than point b the bottom of the peak of the siphon pipe and groundwater is temporarily stored in the cavity defined as the silent period when the water table in the siphon cavity is higher than point b the groundwater begins to discharge and drain the air in the siphon pipe until the water table in the siphon cavity rises to the point t the top of peak of the siphon pipe the air in the siphon is completely discharged and forms a negative pressure therefore the groundwater in the cavity is automatically discharged through the siphon pipe which is called the siphon period then the groundwater table dropped to point e the higher end of the siphon pipe the air entered the siphon pipe causing the siphon process interruption with the flow rapidly decreased to zero one silent period and one subsequent siphon period are called one intermittent cycle for iks the hydrological process of iks is the response to rainfall which is mainly related to the magnitude of rainfall the degree of karst development and the way of groundwater discharge hartmann et al 2014 lv et al 2020 mangin 1969 first proposed a mathematical model for modeling iks and verified that the siphon structure is the main cause of the intermittent discharge bonacci and bojanić 1991 generalized the iks as a siphon pipe and an underground karst reservoir with a steady water supply and proposed a mathematical model to simulate the hydrological processes under different aquifer water level conditions which was applied to the hydrological process simulation of several iks in yugoslavia xiao and zhang 2021 further developed the model and revealed the relationship between recharge discharge and intermittent period duration suggesting that the recharge has an essential impact on the time of the intermittent cycle however these models all showed a fixed period because they assumed that the siphon cavities received a fixed recharge rate in fact as the water table in the aquifer decreases the discharge period gradually increases guo et al 2020 in summary previous work is inspiring but weak on the period variation of iks the aims of this study are to a simulate the intermittent drainage process of iks b reveal the mechanism and influencing factors of the period variation of intermittent discharge and c uncover the hidden information of discharge periodic variations based on the conceptual model of iks a theoretical model was proposed to simulate the intermittent hydrological process of iks and testes through indoor physical experiments then it was applied to chaoshuidong iks in central china as a case study finally the sensitivity and limitations of the model are discussed 2 theoretical model 2 1 water release processes in aquifers to explore the relationship between the rainfall karst aquifers siphon cavities and the intermittent hydrological process of iks we generalize the aquifer and the siphon cavity in fig 1 as cylindrical tanks named r1 and r2 respectively meanwhile the model has the following assumptions 1 the aquifer only receives rainfall recharge and does not receive infiltration recharge from rivers 2 it is considered that the surrounding rock fissures in the siphon cavern are not developed and the aquifer only supplies the siphon cavity through a single karst pipe 3 groundwater discharge through siphon pipe is the only way for iks without scatter discharged of epikarst springs as shown in fig 1 the discharge variation of iks is mainly influenced by the recharge rate of the aquifer q 1 and the regulation capacity of the siphon cavity the former is constantly changing which is the main reason for the variation of the hydrological cycle in turn the recharge rate of the aquifer is influenced by the recharge rate of rainfall q 0 q 0 could be zero a constant value or a variable when there is no rainfall q 0 0 the water drainage and water level from an aquifer can be described as the following equation by maillet 1905 1 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t h 1 t h 1 0 e α t where q 1 t is the discharge rate of the aquifer at time t cm3 s 1 q 1 0 is the initial discharge rate of the aquifer cm3 s 1 α is an attenuation coefficient 1 s h 1 t is the water level of the aquifer at time t cm h 1 0 is the initial water level of the aquifer cm and the α is a comprehensive coefficient related to the permeability coefficient the specific yield of the aquifer and the average groundwater seepage length lin 1984 2 α k d s l m where k d is the average hydraulic coefficient cm s s is the specific yield lm is the average seepage length cm if q 0 is always equal to a constant value q 0 the water table in tank r1 at any time t is 3 h 1 t h 1 t 1 q 0 a 1 q 1 t 1 a 1 in this case the water table attenuation of the aquifer still conforms to eq 1 however it is difficult to determine the initial attenuation head h 1 0 corresponding to time t in eq 1 therefore we assume that h 1 t at time t in eq 3 is equivalent to h 1 t at time tn in eq 1 then tn can be expressed as 4 t n l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 α then from eq 1 and eq 4 the flow q 1 at time t is 5 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t n q 1 0 e l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 q 0 t q 0 there is also a particular situation where rainfall recharge equals discharge and the aquifer s water levels remain uncharged to sum up according to the rainfall conditions the q 1 can be described as the following three different processes 6 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t q 0 0 q 1 t q 1 0 e l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 q 0 0 q 1 t q 1 0 q 1 t q 0 2 2 intermittent discharge processes in iks q 2 represents the intermittent discharge of iks related to the aquifer recharge and siphon structure when h 2 reaches point t in fig 1 the water in the siphon cavity r2 will be quickly released this process can be divided into two stages in stage 1 when the water table h2 is just higher than hb the water starts to pass point b and overflows and at the same time the air in the pipe is discharged this process is similar to the weir flow process 7 q 2 t β b 2 g h 2 t h b 1 5 h b h 2 t h t 8 h 2 t q 1 t q 2 t a 2 h 2 t 1 where β is a outflow coefficient obtained by measuring multiple flow values of q 2 by volume method and then reversely solving the equation dimensionless b is the wet circumference which is approximately equal to the siphon pipe diameter d 2 cm g is the gravitational acceleration cm s 2 h 2 t represents the water table in r2 at time t cm ht is the height of the highest point of the siphon pipe cm hb is the height of water beginning to overflow in the siphon cavity equal to ht d 2 cm and a 2 is the cross sectional area of the siphon cavity cm2 when the water table in r2 reaches ht the flow in stage 1 reaches the maximum and the air in the siphon is completely emptied the second phase begins with a rapid increase and then a gradual decrease in flow when the water table drops to the he the entrance height of the siphon pipe in the siphon cavity air enters the siphon pipe and q 2 is rapidly reduced to 0 in stage 2 q 2 can be derived from bernoulli s equation 9 q 2 t d 2 2 π 4 2 g h 2 t h o 1 λ l 2 d 2 h e h 2 t where λ is the dimensionless coefficient of friction which can be calculated by the colebrook white formula giustolisi et al 2011 he is the height of stopping overflow in the siphon cavity cm and ho is the height of the outlet of the siphon spring cm 2 3 intermittent cycle variation model according to the water level decay equation of the aquifer and the intermittent cycle process we deduce the equation for calculating the duration of any siphon process as the aquifer replenishes the siphon cavity the water level decreases exponentially fig 1 because the structure of the siphon cavity is fixed the volume of the siphon cavity being filled v is 10 v h t h e a 2 δ v where δv is the volume of water supplied by r1 to r2 during the siphon period m3 since δv is negligible relative to v and we assume that the time of the siphon period is fixed equal to t eqs 1 and 4 are calculated from the moment of attenuation just after the last rainfall recharge however we cannot determine the q 1 0 in eq 1 at the beginning of the siphon period therefore we need to calculate the time ε t required to store a specific volume v at any time t then the siphon period has just ended at t and the silent period begins and lasts for ε t assume that there are multiple siphon periods over a period of time whose end times are expressed as t 1 t 2 t 3 tn the duration times of silent periods are expressed as ε t 1 ε t 2 ε t 3 ε t n then start times of siphon periods can be denoted as y 1 y 2 y 3 y n fig 2 and there is the following relationship 11 y i t i ε t i if the duration of the silent period is much longer than that of siphon outflow ε t t namely then t is approximately considered equal to 0 in fig 2 in this case the discharge process is instantaneously completed so the water storage process of the karst aquifer supplying the siphon cavity is continuous that is 12 y i y i 1 ε yi 1 from eq 1 the relationship between ε t and v in a single silent period is 13 v t t ε t q 1 0 e α t d t 1 α q 1 0 e α t ε t e α t further the duration of the silent period ε t at any time t is 14 ε t 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 e α t therefore ε t is related to the initial flow rate q 0 the attenuation coefficient of the aquifer and the volume v of the siphon cavity if t 0 then the start time of any siphon period can be expressed as 15 y i y i 1 t ε y i 1 t from eq 14 and eq 15 the time of the i th siphon period can be expressed as 16 y i y i 1 t 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 e α y i 1 t i 1 y i 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 i 1 then the duration of the i th silent period is 17 s i y i y i 1 t based on eqs 16 and 17 we could predict the time of the next siphon period when q 0 0 and when q 0 q 1 the duration of the single silent period is fixed and can be approximated as 18 s i v q 0 2 4 parameter calibration and performance criteria when simulating intermittent periodic changes the attenuation coefficient α is the only parameter that needs to be corrected which can be estimated using the genetic algorithm ga through the matlab 14 0 ga toolbox goldberg and holland 1988 ga is a heuristic search algorithm based on the biological evolution process and is widely

model is built based on fig 3 in the lab to verify the rationality of the theoretical model specific dimensions and connections are as follows q 0 is regulated by a constant flow device controlled by a valve the left water tank r1 is composed of an organic glass cylinder with an inner diameter of d 1 19 cm and a height of 1 m the right side is connected to the water tank r2 through a straight pipe and the straight pipe adopts a smooth soft hose with a diameter of 0 8 cm and a length of 40 cm the right water tank r2 is an organic glass cylinder with a diameter of d 2 14 cm and a height of 0 6 m the siphon pipe was connected to the right side of r2 the diameter d 2 of the siphon pipe was 0 6 cm and the length l 2 was 0 5 m a bending bracket fixed the siphon pipe and the bottom of the water tank r2 was used as the reference standard for the height in this experiment after the physical model is built the values of ht hb he and ho are 6 76 6 16 0 6 and 30 cm respectively fig 3 the quantity q 1 of the aquifer recharge siphon cavity and the quantity q 2 of the siphon cavity discharge is measured by the volume method the ltc levelogger edge groundwater automatic recorder solinst canada is placed at the bottom of r1 and r2 respectively the range is 0 30 m the accuracy is 1 5 cm and the monitoring step is 15 s and 5 s respectively the water table change is converted into the period flow and at the same time the accurate time of the siphon phenomenon is recorded manually with a clock 3 2 experimental scenario setting to study the hydrological process of iks under different conditions we need to design the model s initial conditions to ensure that the model is closer to the actual situation this experiment mainly considered the following four scenarios table 1 1 after heavy rainfall the water table of r1 continues to decline for a long time without rainfall recharge the flow rate q 1 also gradually decreases in the experimental simulation of this situation q 0 is equal to 0 and the initial water table of the aquifer is set to 77 cm and then continues to decrease 2 if rainfall lasts long and is stable during a specific time and the rainfall intensity is small the aquifer has a constant flow of rainfall recharge but the recharge amount q 0 per unit time is less than the flow rate q 1 the water table of aquifer r1 will continue to drop after continuous debugging in this experiment the initial water table was 77 cm and q 0 stabilized at 5 46 cm3 s 3 also during a specific period especially at the beginning of rainfall the rainfall process lasts long and is stable with immense rainfall intensity the recharge amount q 0 per unit time is greater than the flow rate q 1 the water table of the aquifer will continue to rise after continuous debugging the initial water table of the designed aquifer is 42 cm and q 0 is equal to 14 25 cm3 s 4 in some cases the karst aquifer receives continuous rainfall recharge or the scale of the karst recharge aquifer is much larger than the volume of the siphon cavity which will keep the aquifer groundwater table h1 relatively constant during the evaluation period as a result the flow rate q 1 remains constant but it is not easy to keep h 1 relatively constant in this case we directly connect q 0 to r2 and replace the constant q 1 recharge with q 0 each scenario test is repeated three times and the average value and mean square error are calculated 3 3 results of the experiment and theoretical model testing the parameters of four different scenarios are brought into the theoretical model constructed in this paper the simulation results agree with the experimental results fig 4 the nse coefficients of the four scenarios were 0 82 0 82 0 83 and 0 7 respectively and the kge coefficients of the four scenarios were 0 91 0 86 0 87 and 0 78 respectively indicating that the iks model established can simulate the hydrological process of iks well fig 4 shows the changes in the flow rate q 1 of the aquifer water tank supplying the siphon cavity and the flow rate q 2 of iks observed in four different scenarios by controlling different recharged conditions the flow rate q 1 is different scenarios which affects the periodic characteristics the time of one silent period and one siphon period of iks the initial head of the first two scenarios see fig 4a and b was the same so the initial flow rate was 10 82 cm3 s however due to the rainfall recharged in scenario 2 the recession rate of q 1 was reduced by about half compared with that in scenario 1 after ten cycles the flow decayed to 9 09 cm3 s in scenario 2 at the same time it was 6 12 cm3 s in scenario 1 under the condition of no rainfall scenario 1 or weak rainfall scenario 2 replenishment the duration of the silent period gradually increased with the number of cycles increasing from 95 s to 158 s and from 92 4 s to 114 s respectively compared with no rainfall replenishment the silent period increases in less time in both cases the time of the siphon period is in a downward trend which is approximately reduced from 43 s to 40 s this indicates that the aquifer recharge affects the siphoning period time in scenario 3 the initial aquifer water table was lower after receiving substantial recharge the water table in r1 continued to rise causing the flow rate of q 1 to rise from 8 04 cm3 s to 10 28 cm3 s and the q 1 to increase gradually the silent period was reduced from 128 99 s to 102 19 s due to the gradual increase in the water release rate the time of the siphon period was rising furthermore in scenario 4 the flow rate of q 1 was stabilized at 14 5 cm3 s due to the constant water table in r1 when the aquifer s water table remains constant the ten silent periods and the siphon period simulated are almost the same the average times of siphon periods and silent periods were 58 83 s and 50 55 s respectively with the continuous increase of the aquifer replenishment rate of the siphon cavity the duration of the siphon period continued to increase under the same siphon structure in the experimental scenario the outlet flow rate of the siphon period increased gradually within 4 5 s at this time accompanied by air discharged in the siphon pipe the outlet flow rate increased to the maximum and gradually decreased after the air was eliminated because the same siphon chamber and siphon pipe device were used in the four different scenarios the maximum flow rate during the siphon period was the same and was about 43 cm3 s fig 4 indicating that the peak flow during the siphon period is related to the siphon structure and not so much to the recharge of the aquifer however the duration of the siphon period is quite different the average time of the siphon period was 40 33 40 76 41 41 and 50 55 s and the corresponding average flow rate q 2 is 8 62 9 97 9 31 and 19 5 cm3 s respectively fig 5 b therefore in addition to the influence of the siphon structure the water release capacity of the aquifer q 1 also affects the hydrological process of iks in addition to verify the feasibility of the intermittent cycle variation model we simulated the change in silent period time for scenario 1 and 4 based on eqs 17 and 18 respectively and the results are shown in fig 5a kge coefficients were 0 94 and 0 97 respectively indicating that the model proposed can reasonably predict the time of the subsequent discharge of iks in these two scenarios 4 iks model application to the chaoshuidong spring 4 1 study area and data set the chaoshuidong basin csb is located in yichang city hubei province in central china with a drainage area of 4 05 km2 fig 6 according to the previous geophysical exploration and hydrological monitoring the chaoshuidong spring csd is a typical iks with a 3800 m3 volume of the siphon cavity as shown in fig 6 the csd karst water system has a complete cambrian shibai qinjiamiao formation the cambrian shipai formation 1sh in fig 6 and the cambrian qinjiamiao formation 2q in fig 6 are the water barrier boundaries above and below the cambrian tianheban formation 1t in fig 6 and the shilongdong formation 1sl in fig 6 are the main aquifers according to the analysis of the preliminary geophysical exploration and surface karst development morphology the main body of the siphon cavity is located in the tianheban aquifer fig 6b during the siphon period the groundwater of the tianheban aquifer discharged through the siphon pipe while the groundwater from the shilongdong aquifer discharged during the silent period guo et al 2022 the elevation of the csd spring is 456 86 m as shown in fig 6c two layers of karst development exist in the spring basin by multi electrode resistivity testing with elevations of 350 410 m and 425 455 m the former represents the siphon cavity and siphon pipe within the tianheban aquifer and the latter represents the shallow karst pipes of the shilongdong aquifer an ltc levelogger edge groundwater automatic recorder was placed at the csd outlet to gauge the flow temperature and conductivity at a frequency of 15 min moreover an automatic meteorological station qingyi china was installed near the csd to monitor the rainfall for 30 min fig 7 shows the flow changes of csd between 10 august and 16 september 2021 which can be divided into two periods rainfall and no rainfall periods there are ten siphon periods from 18 august to16 september 2021 the time interval of which gradually increased from 1 55 d to 3 95 d during this period the change in the intermittent cycle of the csd is consistent with the conditions of scenario 1 in this paper therefore we used the iks model proposed to simulate the discharge variations of csd from 18 august to 16 september 2021 the simulation time step is 15 min 4 2 methods and results of parameter identification the iks model constructed in this paper has 7 primary model parameters as shown in table 2 among them the most critical parameter is α according to the eq 16 the change of the intermittent cycle is only related to the volume of the siphon cavity the initial value of recharge and the attenuation coefficient of the aquifer furthermore by fitting the sequence of the interval time between two adjacent siphon peaks of csd the attenuation coefficient can be obtained as 0 044 d fig 8 in addition the groundwater discharge during a single siphon in csd is almost the same so the volume of the siphon cavity is confirmed to be 3800 m3 therefore based on the time of the first silent period of 1 48 d we identified the initial value of q 1 0 to be 2575 m3 d to reduce the number of parameters to be determined we set ho to 0 the product of a 2 and ht is the siphon cavity so only l 2 d 2 and a 2 need to be identified among the 7 parameters and the results of the parameters identified by the genetic algorithm are shown in table 2 4 3 the case study simulation results the simulation results are shown in fig 7 although the nse and kge coefficients of the model are 0 1 and 0 6 respectively the model simulation results are still satisfactory from the perspective of peak flow and peak time table 3 all the peak flow simulation errors are within 10 and 80 of the peak time error is within 2 5 h the observed and simulated silent periods are relatively stable with mean values of 7 68 and 5 13 h respectively and coefficients of variation of 0 06 and 0 04 respectively which further confirms the peak flow and duration of the siphon period are only related to the siphon structure the simulated value is smaller than the observed value because the model proposed believes that when the water level is lower than the siphon inlet the siphon period stops immediately eq 9 in fact some groundwater may decay slowly the simulated silent period increases monotonically while the observed value decreases last time possibly due to unmonitored rainfall recharge it also shows that the silent period will gradually increase with the increase of time and the decrease of the water level of the aquifer in addition the kge coefficient has a more excellent value than the nse coefficient for such intermittent hydrological time series further based on eq 2 we initially inferred the hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer the fissure ratio measured was between 0 3 and 4 3 with an average of 2 3 which was used as the specific yield s the location of the siphon cavity is close to the csd outlet so we regard the width of the basin about 1100 m as the average seepage length the calculated k d turns out to be 1 11 m d according to eq 2 which is close to the calculated result of the karst aquifer in the nearby area luo et al 2016 therefore it is feasible to calculate the average hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer based on the variation of intermittent cycles 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters a complex hydrological model usually contains the characteristics of many parameters and parameter sensitivity analysis provides an optimal method to study which parameter changes impact the model s output the hydrological model of the iks proposed in this paper mainly includes three types of external influence factors recharge aquifer characteristics and siphon structure characteristics with a total of 8 parameters in addition considering that there is a specific connection between different parameters for example the siphon pipe s length and diameter represent the size of the siphon pipe volume therefore four combination parameters are added based on the model structure parameters as shown in table 4 in this study we use the oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis method to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed model parameters morris 1991 van hoey et al 2014 the calculation method of parameter sensitivity s is shown in eq 20 s can be obtained by changing the value of δe separately while keeping other parameters unchanged 20 s m e i e i δ e i e p m e i e i e p m e i e i e p δ e i e i where m is the output result of the model with the total runoff as the objective function ei represents the initial value of the model parameters moreover δei 10 of the initial value is the slight change of the initial value of the parameters the larger the absolute value of s the more sensitive the parameter is to the model the parameters and simulation results of scenario 3 are used as initial values the oat method needs to run the model 12 times to obtain the sensitivity of each parameter during the operation the nes and kge coefficient value and the simulation result after the parameter change are recorded simultaneously and compared with the simulation result of scenario 3 to reflect the change of different parameter changes to the shape of the runoff simulation table 4 indicates that the parameters that significantly impact the model simulation results include the diameter volume and shape of the siphon pipe the volume ratio of siphon pipe and siphon cavity the initial flow rate and the height of the highest point of the siphon pipe the shape is much worse than the initial simulation result fig 9 the impact results can be divided into three aspects the time of the silent period the time of the siphon period and the flow process of the siphon period the greater the initial flow q 1 0 means the higher the initial water table of the aquifer which will shorten the time of silent time furthermore the area of the siphon cavity and the threshold height will increase the silent period a larger cavity means a longer silent period of water storage time the diameter of the siphon pipe and its related parameters such as the volume of the siphon pipe v 1 the volume of the siphon pipe and the volume ratio of the siphon cavity v 1 v 2 have a significant influence on the duration of the siphon period which are 32 s 29 s and 28 s respectively other parameters have a negligible effect on the time of the siphon period with an average of 40 s since the drainage volume of a single siphon period is constant the duration will be gradually shortened to increase the flow rate in the siphon period the maximum drainage flow rate increases from 45 cm3 s to about 60 cm3 s in summary the main factors affecting the periodicity of iks are the size and shape of the karst siphon pipe especially the diameter of the siphon pipe followed by the initial flow rate of the aquifer replenishing the cavity the former is relatively stable for a certain time so in the actual iks system its dynamic mainly depends on the characteristics of the aquifer after the last rainfall recharge which is conducive to our subsequent research and prediction on the dynamics of iks 5 2 limitations of the iks model although the model proposed performs satisfactorily in fitting the hydrological process of the physical model and the field case this study has limitations in this paper 1 the actual karst geyser structure in the field is often more complex than the physical model constructed in this paper there may be multiple siphon cavities and siphon pipe structures thus showing a more complex rainfall runoff dynamic process therefore more case studies are needed to improve the model structure 2 in the case application of the iks model only intermittent hydrological processes in the no rainfall period are studied however there is no intermittent dynamic feature in the process of rainfall recharge which needs to be further explored 6 conclusions in this paper a theoretical model for simulating the intermittent hydrological processes is proposed by generalizing the model of water circulation in iks the proposed model can well simulate the hydrological process in four different scenarios of indoor physical experiments and reveals the mechanisms and influencing factors of the variation of the discharge period of iks the siphon structure is the main factor affecting the variation of the iks siphon period discharge especially the diameter of the siphon pipe in addition rainfall and the water release capacity of the aquifer affect the hydrological process of the iks silent period and the duration of the silent period gradually increases as the groundwater level of the aquifer decreases the iks model was used to simulate the hydrological time series with no rainfall recharge in the chaoshuidong spring in central china the results indicate that the model proposed has satisfactory performance in simulating peak time and peak flow at the same time the permeability coefficient of the aquifer in the basin is calculated according to the change in the intermittent cycle which is valuable for evaluating the water resources of the iks system and provides a new idea for us to study the hydrological process of other karst springs credit authorship contribution

2391,intermittent karst springs iks are common phenomena in karst areas where spring flow rates rise and fall in variable periods which is generally attributed to the siphon structure in karst aquifers however the previous model assumed that the siphon cavity received a fixed recharge rate thus the iks showed a fixed periodic characteristic in this study an improved theoretical model iks model was proposed to simulate the hydrological process of iks with changing periods by considering the varying recharge rate from aquifers to the siphon cavity the model uses two tandem tanks to represent the karst aquifer and siphon cavity separately the numerical solution was obtained by the iterative method to predict the periodic variations of flow rate and eruption time of iks the iks model was verified by physical experiments under four representative recharge conditions showing good consistency between theoretical and experimental results it reveals the hydrologic processes mechanism of the iks by quantitatively describing the relationship between the cycle period of the iks discharge variations and the flow exchanges in the siphon cavity aquifer system furthermore this model performs well in simulating the hydrological process of chaoshuidong spring in central china and approximately estimated the hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer in the basin based on observed periodic changes in spring discharge these findings might be essential for the development management and protection of groundwater resources in iks keywords intermittent karst springs theoretical model physical experiments periodic variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst aquifer is one of the most important sources of freshwater supply globally there are about 13 8 of the earth s land covered by carbonate rocks and about 20 25 of the world s population usually uses karst groundwater as their primary domestic water ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 karst areas have strong heterogeneity and different water bearing media have different groundwater regulation and storage capacities intermittent karst springs iks are one of the more complex types whose flow rate is sometimes stable and sometimes erupts guo et al 2022 2020 milanovic 2007 sanz et al 2016 most models assume a fixed period for this hydrological process bonacci and bojanić 1991 mangin 1969 xiao and zhang 2021 however the iks exhibit a periodic changing characteristic with increasing flow monitoring frequency and duration debieche et al 2020 guo et al 2022 consequently there remains a challenge in understanding and modeling this hydrological process iks refers to the periodic discharge of groundwater controlled by a special karst development structure in karst areas which is a common phenomenon reported globally alfaro and wallace 1994 bonacci and bojanić 1991 debieche et al 2020 guo et al 2020 igracev 2014 milanovic 2007 scheibe et al 2015 it is also called ebb and flow springs white 2019 rhythmic karst springs bonacci and bojanić 1991 debieche et al 2020 xiao and zhang 2021 siphon springs milanovic 2007 sanz et al 2016 and periodic springs kansou and bredeweg 2014 due to the heterogeneity of karst aqueous medium and the zoning of karst development the direction of groundwater is primarily horizontal and vertical changes frequently during the migration process therefore karst siphon pipes are commonly developed mudry et al 2014 which are conditions for forming iks similar to geysers such as the old faithful iks also has a certain rhythm and its flow is sometimes steady and sometimes erupting however the formation mechanisms are different the former is related to geothermal vandemeulebrouck et al 2013 while the latter is closely related to special geological structures from the reported case studies the frequency is inconsistent and constantly changing in the period of no rainfall recharge the groundwater will still flow out intermittently in iks which is obviously different from ordinary karst springs the interpretation of siphon structure is widely accepted for the causes of intermittent hydrological processes in iks bonacci and bojanić 1991 milanovic 2007 which was confirmed in the fuentetota spring area in spain through diving and cave exploration sanz et al 2016 the iks s geological structure can be generalized as a recharge aquifer storage cave and siphon pipe in series fig 1 when rainfall recharges the aquifer the water table in the siphon cavity is usually lower than point b the bottom of the peak of the siphon pipe and groundwater is temporarily stored in the cavity defined as the silent period when the water table in the siphon cavity is higher than point b the groundwater begins to discharge and drain the air in the siphon pipe until the water table in the siphon cavity rises to the point t the top of peak of the siphon pipe the air in the siphon is completely discharged and forms a negative pressure therefore the groundwater in the cavity is automatically discharged through the siphon pipe which is called the siphon period then the groundwater table dropped to point e the higher end of the siphon pipe the air entered the siphon pipe causing the siphon process interruption with the flow rapidly decreased to zero one silent period and one subsequent siphon period are called one intermittent cycle for iks the hydrological process of iks is the response to rainfall which is mainly related to the magnitude of rainfall the degree of karst development and the way of groundwater discharge hartmann et al 2014 lv et al 2020 mangin 1969 first proposed a mathematical model for modeling iks and verified that the siphon structure is the main cause of the intermittent discharge bonacci and bojanić 1991 generalized the iks as a siphon pipe and an underground karst reservoir with a steady water supply and proposed a mathematical model to simulate the hydrological processes under different aquifer water level conditions which was applied to the hydrological process simulation of several iks in yugoslavia xiao and zhang 2021 further developed the model and revealed the relationship between recharge discharge and intermittent period duration suggesting that the recharge has an essential impact on the time of the intermittent cycle however these models all showed a fixed period because they assumed that the siphon cavities received a fixed recharge rate in fact as the water table in the aquifer decreases the discharge period gradually increases guo et al 2020 in summary previous work is inspiring but weak on the period variation of iks the aims of this study are to a simulate the intermittent drainage process of iks b reveal the mechanism and influencing factors of the period variation of intermittent discharge and c uncover the hidden information of discharge periodic variations based on the conceptual model of iks a theoretical model was proposed to simulate the intermittent hydrological process of iks and testes through indoor physical experiments then it was applied to chaoshuidong iks in central china as a case study finally the sensitivity and limitations of the model are discussed 2 theoretical model 2 1 water release processes in aquifers to explore the relationship between the rainfall karst aquifers siphon cavities and the intermittent hydrological process of iks we generalize the aquifer and the siphon cavity in fig 1 as cylindrical tanks named r1 and r2 respectively meanwhile the model has the following assumptions 1 the aquifer only receives rainfall recharge and does not receive infiltration recharge from rivers 2 it is considered that the surrounding rock fissures in the siphon cavern are not developed and the aquifer only supplies the siphon cavity through a single karst pipe 3 groundwater discharge through siphon pipe is the only way for iks without scatter discharged of epikarst springs as shown in fig 1 the discharge variation of iks is mainly influenced by the recharge rate of the aquifer q 1 and the regulation capacity of the siphon cavity the former is constantly changing which is the main reason for the variation of the hydrological cycle in turn the recharge rate of the aquifer is influenced by the recharge rate of rainfall q 0 q 0 could be zero a constant value or a variable when there is no rainfall q 0 0 the water drainage and water level from an aquifer can be described as the following equation by maillet 1905 1 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t h 1 t h 1 0 e α t where q 1 t is the discharge rate of the aquifer at time t cm3 s 1 q 1 0 is the initial discharge rate of the aquifer cm3 s 1 α is an attenuation coefficient 1 s h 1 t is the water level of the aquifer at time t cm h 1 0 is the initial water level of the aquifer cm and the α is a comprehensive coefficient related to the permeability coefficient the specific yield of the aquifer and the average groundwater seepage length lin 1984 2 α k d s l m where k d is the average hydraulic coefficient cm s s is the specific yield lm is the average seepage length cm if q 0 is always equal to a constant value q 0 the water table in tank r1 at any time t is 3 h 1 t h 1 t 1 q 0 a 1 q 1 t 1 a 1 in this case the water table attenuation of the aquifer still conforms to eq 1 however it is difficult to determine the initial attenuation head h 1 0 corresponding to time t in eq 1 therefore we assume that h 1 t at time t in eq 3 is equivalent to h 1 t at time tn in eq 1 then tn can be expressed as 4 t n l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 α then from eq 1 and eq 4 the flow q 1 at time t is 5 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t n q 1 0 e l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 q 0 t q 0 there is also a particular situation where rainfall recharge equals discharge and the aquifer s water levels remain uncharged to sum up according to the rainfall conditions the q 1 can be described as the following three different processes 6 q 1 t q 1 0 e α t q 0 0 q 1 t q 1 0 e l n h 1 t l n h 1 0 q 0 0 q 1 t q 1 0 q 1 t q 0 2 2 intermittent discharge processes in iks q 2 represents the intermittent discharge of iks related to the aquifer recharge and siphon structure when h 2 reaches point t in fig 1 the water in the siphon cavity r2 will be quickly released this process can be divided into two stages in stage 1 when the water table h2 is just higher than hb the water starts to pass point b and overflows and at the same time the air in the pipe is discharged this process is similar to the weir flow process 7 q 2 t β b 2 g h 2 t h b 1 5 h b h 2 t h t 8 h 2 t q 1 t q 2 t a 2 h 2 t 1 where β is a outflow coefficient obtained by measuring multiple flow values of q 2 by volume method and then reversely solving the equation dimensionless b is the wet circumference which is approximately equal to the siphon pipe diameter d 2 cm g is the gravitational acceleration cm s 2 h 2 t represents the water table in r2 at time t cm ht is the height of the highest point of the siphon pipe cm hb is the height of water beginning to overflow in the siphon cavity equal to ht d 2 cm and a 2 is the cross sectional area of the siphon cavity cm2 when the water table in r2 reaches ht the flow in stage 1 reaches the maximum and the air in the siphon is completely emptied the second phase begins with a rapid increase and then a gradual decrease in flow when the water table drops to the he the entrance height of the siphon pipe in the siphon cavity air enters the siphon pipe and q 2 is rapidly reduced to 0 in stage 2 q 2 can be derived from bernoulli s equation 9 q 2 t d 2 2 π 4 2 g h 2 t h o 1 λ l 2 d 2 h e h 2 t where λ is the dimensionless coefficient of friction which can be calculated by the colebrook white formula giustolisi et al 2011 he is the height of stopping overflow in the siphon cavity cm and ho is the height of the outlet of the siphon spring cm 2 3 intermittent cycle variation model according to the water level decay equation of the aquifer and the intermittent cycle process we deduce the equation for calculating the duration of any siphon process as the aquifer replenishes the siphon cavity the water level decreases exponentially fig 1 because the structure of the siphon cavity is fixed the volume of the siphon cavity being filled v is 10 v h t h e a 2 δ v where δv is the volume of water supplied by r1 to r2 during the siphon period m3 since δv is negligible relative to v and we assume that the time of the siphon period is fixed equal to t eqs 1 and 4 are calculated from the moment of attenuation just after the last rainfall recharge however we cannot determine the q 1 0 in eq 1 at the beginning of the siphon period therefore we need to calculate the time ε t required to store a specific volume v at any time t then the siphon period has just ended at t and the silent period begins and lasts for ε t assume that there are multiple siphon periods over a period of time whose end times are expressed as t 1 t 2 t 3 tn the duration times of silent periods are expressed as ε t 1 ε t 2 ε t 3 ε t n then start times of siphon periods can be denoted as y 1 y 2 y 3 y n fig 2 and there is the following relationship 11 y i t i ε t i if the duration of the silent period is much longer than that of siphon outflow ε t t namely then t is approximately considered equal to 0 in fig 2 in this case the discharge process is instantaneously completed so the water storage process of the karst aquifer supplying the siphon cavity is continuous that is 12 y i y i 1 ε yi 1 from eq 1 the relationship between ε t and v in a single silent period is 13 v t t ε t q 1 0 e α t d t 1 α q 1 0 e α t ε t e α t further the duration of the silent period ε t at any time t is 14 ε t 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 e α t therefore ε t is related to the initial flow rate q 0 the attenuation coefficient of the aquifer and the volume v of the siphon cavity if t 0 then the start time of any siphon period can be expressed as 15 y i y i 1 t ε y i 1 t from eq 14 and eq 15 the time of the i th siphon period can be expressed as 16 y i y i 1 t 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 e α y i 1 t i 1 y i 1 α l n 1 α v q 1 0 i 1 then the duration of the i th silent period is 17 s i y i y i 1 t based on eqs 16 and 17 we could predict the time of the next siphon period when q 0 0 and when q 0 q 1 the duration of the single silent period is fixed and can be approximated as 18 s i v q 0 2 4 parameter calibration and performance criteria when simulating intermittent periodic changes the attenuation coefficient α is the only parameter that needs to be corrected which

model is built based on fig 3 in the lab to verify the rationality of the theoretical model specific dimensions and connections are as follows q 0 is regulated by a constant flow device controlled by a valve the left water tank r1 is composed of an organic glass cylinder with an inner diameter of d 1 19 cm and a height of 1 m the right side is connected to the water tank r2 through a straight pipe and the straight pipe adopts a smooth soft hose with a diameter of 0 8 cm and a length of 40 cm the right water tank r2 is an organic glass cylinder with a diameter of d 2 14 cm and a height of 0 6 m the siphon pipe was connected to the right side of r2 the diameter d 2 of the siphon pipe was 0 6 cm and the length l 2 was 0 5 m a bending bracket fixed the siphon pipe and the bottom of the water tank r2 was used as the reference standard for the height in this experiment after the physical model is built the values of ht hb he and ho are 6 76 6 16 0 6 and 30 cm respectively fig 3 the quantity q 1 of the aquifer recharge siphon cavity and the quantity q 2 of the siphon cavity discharge is measured by the volume method the ltc levelogger edge groundwater automatic recorder solinst canada is placed at the bottom of r1 and r2 respectively the range is 0 30 m the accuracy is 1 5 cm and the monitoring step is 15 s and 5 s respectively the water table change is converted into the period flow and at the same time the accurate time of the siphon phenomenon is recorded manually with a clock 3 2 experimental scenario setting to study the hydrological process of iks under different conditions we need to design the model s initial conditions to ensure that the model is closer to the actual situation this experiment mainly considered the following four scenarios table 1 1 after heavy rainfall the water table of r1 continues to decline for a long time without rainfall recharge the flow rate q 1 also gradually decreases in the experimental simulation of this situation q 0 is equal to 0 and the initial water table of the aquifer is set to 77 cm and then continues to decrease 2 if rainfall lasts long and is stable during a specific time and the rainfall intensity is small the aquifer has a constant flow of rainfall recharge but the recharge amount q 0 per unit time is less than the flow rate q 1 the water table of aquifer r1 will continue to drop after continuous debugging in this experiment the initial water table was 77 cm and q 0 stabilized at 5 46 cm3 s 3 also during a specific period especially at the beginning of rainfall the rainfall process lasts long and is stable with immense rainfall intensity the recharge amount q 0 per unit time is greater than the flow rate q 1 the water table of the aquifer will continue to rise after continuous debugging the initial water table of the designed aquifer is 42 cm and q 0 is equal to 14 25 cm3 s 4 in some cases the karst aquifer receives continuous rainfall recharge or the scale of the karst recharge aquifer is much larger than the volume of the siphon cavity which will keep the aquifer groundwater table h1 relatively constant during the evaluation period as a result the flow rate q 1 remains constant but it is not easy to keep h 1 relatively constant in this case we directly connect q 0 to r2 and replace the constant q 1 recharge with q 0 each scenario test is repeated three times and the average value and mean square error are calculated 3 3 results of the experiment and theoretical model testing the parameters of four different scenarios are brought into the theoretical model constructed in this paper the simulation results agree with the experimental results fig 4 the nse coefficients of the four scenarios were 0 82 0 82 0 83 and 0 7 respectively and the kge coefficients of the four scenarios were 0 91 0 86 0 87 and 0 78 respectively indicating that the iks model established can simulate the hydrological process of iks well fig 4 shows the changes in the flow rate q 1 of the aquifer water tank supplying the siphon cavity and the flow rate q 2 of iks observed in four different scenarios by controlling different recharged conditions the flow rate q 1 is different scenarios which affects the periodic characteristics the time of one silent period and one siphon period of iks the initial head of the first two scenarios see fig 4a and b was the same so the initial flow rate was 10 82 cm3 s however due to the rainfall recharged in scenario 2 the recession rate of q 1 was reduced by about half compared with that in scenario 1 after ten cycles the flow decayed to 9 09 cm3 s in scenario 2 at the same time it was 6 12 cm3 s in scenario 1 under the condition of no rainfall scenario 1 or weak rainfall scenario 2 replenishment the duration of the silent period gradually increased with the number of cycles increasing from 95 s to 158 s and from 92 4 s to 114 s respectively compared with no rainfall replenishment the silent period increases in less time in both cases the time of the siphon period is in a downward trend which is approximately reduced from 43 s to 40 s this indicates that the aquifer recharge affects the siphoning period time in scenario 3 the initial aquifer water table was lower after receiving substantial recharge the water table in r1 continued to rise causing the flow rate of q 1 to rise from 8 04 cm3 s to 10 28 cm3 s and the q 1 to increase gradually the silent period was reduced from 128 99 s to 102 19 s due to the gradual increase in the water release rate the time of the siphon period was rising furthermore in scenario 4 the flow rate of q 1 was stabilized at 14 5 cm3 s due to the constant water table in r1 when the aquifer s water table remains constant the ten silent periods and the siphon period simulated are almost the same the average times of siphon periods and silent periods were 58 83 s and 50 55 s respectively with the continuous increase of the aquifer replenishment rate of the siphon cavity the duration of the siphon period continued to increase under the same siphon structure in the experimental scenario the outlet flow rate of the siphon period increased gradually within 4 5 s at this time accompanied by air discharged in the siphon pipe the outlet flow rate increased to the maximum and gradually decreased after the air was eliminated because the same siphon chamber and siphon pipe device were used in the four different scenarios the maximum flow rate during the siphon period was the same and was about 43 cm3 s fig 4 indicating that the peak flow during the siphon period is related to the siphon structure and not so much to the recharge of the aquifer however the duration of the siphon period is quite different the average time of the siphon period was 40 33 40 76 41 41 and 50 55 s and the corresponding average flow rate q 2 is 8 62 9 97 9 31 and 19 5 cm3 s respectively fig 5 b therefore in addition to the influence of the siphon structure the water release capacity of the aquifer q 1 also affects the hydrological process of iks in addition to verify the feasibility of the intermittent cycle variation model we simulated the change in silent period time for scenario 1 and 4 based on eqs 17 and 18 respectively and the results are shown in fig 5a kge coefficients were 0 94 and 0 97 respectively indicating that the model proposed can reasonably predict the time of the subsequent discharge of iks in these two scenarios 4 iks model application to the chaoshuidong spring 4 1 study area and data set the chaoshuidong basin csb is located in yichang city hubei province in central china with a drainage area of 4 05 km2 fig 6 according to the previous geophysical exploration and hydrological monitoring the chaoshuidong spring csd is a typical iks with a 3800 m3 volume of the siphon cavity as shown in fig 6 the csd karst water system has a complete cambrian shibai qinjiamiao formation the cambrian shipai formation 1sh in fig 6 and the cambrian qinjiamiao formation 2q in fig 6 are the water barrier boundaries above and below the cambrian tianheban formation 1t in fig 6 and the shilongdong formation 1sl in fig 6 are the main aquifers according to the analysis of the preliminary geophysical exploration and surface karst development morphology the main body of the siphon cavity is located in the tianheban aquifer fig 6b during the siphon period the groundwater of the tianheban aquifer discharged through the siphon pipe while the groundwater from the shilongdong aquifer discharged during the silent period guo et al 2022 the elevation of the csd spring is 456 86 m as shown in fig 6c two layers of karst development exist in the spring basin by multi electrode resistivity testing with elevations of 350 410 m and 425 455 m the former represents the siphon cavity and siphon pipe within the tianheban aquifer and the latter represents the shallow karst pipes of the shilongdong aquifer an ltc levelogger edge groundwater automatic recorder was placed at the csd outlet to gauge the flow temperature and conductivity at a frequency of 15 min moreover an automatic meteorological station qingyi china was installed near the csd to monitor the rainfall for 30 min fig 7 shows the flow changes of csd between 10 august and 16 september 2021 which can be divided into two periods rainfall and no rainfall periods there are ten siphon periods from 18 august to16 september 2021 the time interval of which gradually increased from 1 55 d to 3 95 d during this period the change in the intermittent cycle of the csd is consistent with the conditions of scenario 1 in this paper therefore we used the iks model proposed to simulate the discharge variations of csd from 18 august to 16 september 2021 the simulation time step is 15 min 4 2 methods and results of parameter identification the iks model constructed in this paper has 7 primary model parameters as shown in table 2 among them the most critical parameter is α according to the eq 16 the change of the intermittent cycle is only related to the volume of the siphon cavity the initial value of recharge and the attenuation coefficient of the aquifer furthermore by fitting the sequence of the interval time between two adjacent siphon peaks of csd the attenuation coefficient can be obtained as 0 044 d fig 8 in addition the groundwater discharge during a single siphon in csd is almost the same so the volume of the siphon cavity is confirmed to be 3800 m3 therefore based on the time of the first silent period of 1 48 d we identified the initial value of q 1 0 to be 2575 m3 d to reduce the number of parameters to be determined we set ho to 0 the product of a 2 and ht is the siphon cavity so only l 2 d 2 and a 2 need to be identified among the 7 parameters and the results of the parameters identified by the genetic algorithm are shown in table 2 4 3 the case study simulation results the simulation results are shown in fig 7 although the nse and kge coefficients of the model are 0 1 and 0 6 respectively the model simulation results are still satisfactory from the perspective of peak flow and peak time table 3 all the peak flow simulation errors are within 10 and 80 of the peak time error is within 2 5 h the observed and simulated silent periods are relatively stable with mean values of 7 68 and 5 13 h respectively and coefficients of variation of 0 06 and 0 04 respectively which further confirms the peak flow and duration of the siphon period are only related to the siphon structure the simulated value is smaller than the observed value because the model proposed believes that when the water level is lower than the siphon inlet the siphon period stops immediately eq 9 in fact some groundwater may decay slowly the simulated silent period increases monotonically while the observed value decreases last time possibly due to unmonitored rainfall recharge it also shows that the silent period will gradually increase with the increase of time and the decrease of the water level of the aquifer in addition the kge coefficient has a more excellent value than the nse coefficient for such intermittent hydrological time series further based on eq 2 we initially inferred the hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer the fissure ratio measured was between 0 3 and 4 3 with an average of 2 3 which was used as the specific yield s the location of the siphon cavity is close to the csd outlet so we regard the width of the basin about 1100 m as the average seepage length the calculated k d turns out to be 1 11 m d according to eq 2 which is close to the calculated result of the karst aquifer in the nearby area luo et al 2016 therefore it is feasible to calculate the average hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer based on the variation of intermittent cycles 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters a complex hydrological model usually contains the characteristics of many parameters and parameter sensitivity analysis provides an optimal method to study which parameter changes impact the model s output the hydrological model of the iks proposed in this paper mainly includes three types of external influence factors recharge aquifer characteristics and siphon structure characteristics with a total of 8 parameters in addition considering that there is a specific connection between different parameters for example the siphon pipe s length and diameter represent the size of the siphon pipe volume therefore four combination parameters are added based on the model structure parameters as shown in table 4 in this study we use the oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis method to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed model parameters morris 1991 van hoey et al 2014 the calculation method of parameter sensitivity s is shown in eq 20 s can be obtained by changing the value of δe separately while keeping other parameters unchanged 20 s m e i e i δ e i e p m e i e i e p m e i e i e p δ e i e i where m is the output result of the model with the total runoff as the objective function ei represents the initial value of the model parameters moreover δei 10 of the initial value is the slight change of the initial value of the parameters the larger the absolute value of s the more sensitive the parameter is to the model the parameters and simulation results of scenario 3 are used as initial values the oat method needs to run the model 12 times to obtain the sensitivity of each parameter during the operation the nes and kge coefficient value and the simulation result after the parameter change are recorded simultaneously and compared with the simulation result of scenario 3 to reflect the change of different parameter changes to the shape of the runoff simulation table 4 indicates that the parameters that significantly impact the model simulation results include the diameter volume and shape of the siphon pipe the volume ratio of siphon pipe and siphon cavity the initial flow rate and the height of the highest point of the siphon pipe the shape is much worse than the initial simulation result fig 9 the impact results can be divided into three aspects the time of the silent period the time of the siphon period and the flow process of the siphon period the greater the initial flow q 1 0 means the higher the initial water table of the aquifer which will shorten the time of silent time furthermore the area of the siphon cavity and the threshold height will increase the silent period a larger cavity means a longer silent period of water storage time the diameter of the siphon pipe and its related parameters such as the volume of the siphon pipe v 1 the volume of the siphon pipe and the volume ratio of the siphon cavity v 1 v 2 have a significant influence on the duration of the siphon period which are 32 s 29 s and 28 s respectively other parameters have a negligible effect on the time of the siphon period with an average of 40 s since the drainage volume of a single siphon period is constant the duration will be gradually shortened to increase the flow rate in the siphon period the maximum drainage flow rate increases from 45 cm3 s to about 60 cm3 s in summary the main factors affecting the periodicity of iks are the size and shape of the karst siphon pipe especially the diameter of the siphon pipe followed by the initial flow rate of the aquifer replenishing the cavity the former is relatively stable for a certain time so in the actual iks system its dynamic mainly depends on the characteristics of the aquifer after the last rainfall recharge which is conducive to our subsequent research and prediction on the dynamics of iks 5 2 limitations of the iks model although the model proposed performs satisfactorily in fitting the hydrological process of the physical model and the field case this study has limitations in this paper 1 the actual karst geyser structure in the field is often more complex than the physical model constructed in this paper there may be multiple siphon cavities and siphon pipe structures thus showing a more complex rainfall runoff dynamic process therefore more case studies are needed to improve the model structure 2 in the case application of the iks model only intermittent hydrological processes in the no rainfall period are studied however there is no intermittent dynamic feature in the process of rainfall recharge which needs to be further explored 6 conclusions in this paper a theoretical model for simulating the intermittent hydrological processes is proposed by generalizing the model of water circulation in iks the proposed model can well simulate the hydrological process in four different scenarios of indoor physical experiments and reveals the mechanisms and influencing factors of the variation of the discharge period of iks the siphon structure is the main factor affecting the variation of the iks siphon period discharge especially the diameter of the siphon pipe in addition rainfall and the water release capacity of the aquifer affect the hydrological process of the iks silent period and the duration of the silent period gradually increases as the groundwater level of the aquifer decreases the iks model was used to simulate the hydrological time series with no rainfall recharge in the chaoshuidong spring in central china the results indicate that the model proposed has satisfactory performance in simulating peak time and peak flow at the same time the permeability coefficient of the aquifer in the basin is calculated according to the change in the intermittent cycle which is valuable for evaluating the water resources of the iks system and provides a new idea for us to study the hydrological process of other karst springs credit authorship contribution

2392,most current optical thermal based surface soil moisture ssm retrieval methods only utilize the instantaneous measurements made by onboard polar orbit satellites and they require soil texture as prior knowledge to obtain the volumetric ssm content a recent study developed a diurnal land surface temperature lst based ssm retrieval method to directly estimate the volumetric ssm content without the knowledge of soil texture however most subsequent studies have only examined the use of this method on bare soils therefore the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the method over vegetated regions with both experimental data and satellite observations first the impacts of vegetation on ssm retrieval were investigated through physics based common land model simulations and high accuracy with an overall root mean square error rmse of 0 010 m3m 3 was achieved when the underlying surface was covered by moderate fractional vegetation cover from 0 to 0 6 with a given soil texture based on the simulated results the ssm was then estimated using data from an ameriflux site dominated by crops during the growing season in 2018 the results were further verified using in situ measurements and this showed that the estimated ssm correlated well with in situ measurements with an rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 a further evaluation of the meteosat second generation msg derived ssm at the pixel scale was made using the proposed method and the results revealed an overall acceptable accuracy rmse of 0 074 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071 m3m 3 against the smap sentinel 1 ssm product at the same spatial resolution of 3 km data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm is an essential variable participating in the global water cycle and it affects the energy balance between the atmosphere and the earth s surface dorigo et al 2017 liu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in agricultural applications ssm can affect plant water availability and it is the main source of water for most crops martínez fernández et al 2016 zhang and zhou 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition accurate spatiotemporal ssm information can be used to provide early warnings about natural disasters such as droughts floods and landslides liu et al 2016 balti et al 2020 bahramian et al 2021 tangdamrongsub et al 2021 due to its diverse importance many methods have been proposed to obtain ssm with satellite data on various scales li et al 2021 peng et al 2021 over the past few decades it has been widely recognized that remote sensing based ssm retrieval is one of the most efficient ways of obtaining ssm and its spatiotemporal dynamics across regional and global scales li and rodell 2013 vereecken et al 2014 kim et al 2021 peng et al 2021 yan et al 2022 and the research focus to date has mostly been on optical and microwave based ssm retrievals as is known ssm is an indirect variable that should be estimated from direct parameters of remotely sensed measurements however most of the currently available methods can only obtain ssm proxies rather than obtaining the quantitative volumetric ssm content in physical units such as m3m 3 or cm3cm 3 due to the coupling between the volumetric ssm content and soil texture accurate soil texture data are commonly required as an auxiliary prior knowledge to decouple the volumetric ssm content from satellite derived ssm proxies although significant spatial heterogeneity of soil texture can commonly be found over natural surfaces a number of regional or global digital soil texture maps with varying spatial resolutions have been developed in recent years stępień et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 several of the most widely used soil texture products include the global gridded soil information soilgrids with a spatial resolution of 250 m hengl et al 2017 the world soil database hwsd with a spatial resolution of 1 km fao 2012 as well as the global soil dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km developed by the land atmosphere interaction research group at sun yat sen university shangguan et al 2014 these existing digital soil texture datasets thus provide the unprecedented opportunity of obtaining the volumetric ssm content based on satellite observations rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 liu et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition to soil texture vegetation also markedly affects ssm retrieval using most remote sensing based methods since it is a disturbance that would decrease the reflection or radiation signals from the soil component for example it is recognized that the widely employed thermal inertia ti is only feasible over bare or sparsely vegetated conditions veroustraete et al 2011 matsushima et al 2018 liu et al 2020 and various uncertainties have resulted when using passive microwave based ssm retrievals in regions with a high vegetation optical depth liu et al 2011 gevaert et al 2016 sawada et al 2017 it is thus considered that greater research attention should focus on the effects of vegetation rather than soil texture for ssm retrieval with satellite data particularly in areas where digital soil texture data at various spatial resolutions have been released for use in operational applications in a previous study a bare ssm retrieval method was developed to directly obtain the volumetric ssm content based on the diurnal land surface temperature lst leng et al 2014 based on simulations using the common land model colm which has distinct physical foundations the diurnal lst based bare ssm retrieval method was proven to be proficiently independent of soil texture information as such it is superior to previous methods in which soil texture information has generally been required as an auxiliary input to obtain the volumetric ssm content li et al 2021 however the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method was primarily developed from simulated data and it has not been comprehensively evaluated using experimental data at a site scale or using geostationary images at the satellite pixel scale further leng et al 2015 used simulated data to investigate the effect of fractional vegetation coverage fvc and soil texture on ssm retrieval with the diurnal lst based method it was found that the accuracy of ssm retrieval would decrease with the increase of fvc and the proposed method is still feasible when clay content is less than 30 under moderate fvc conditions this is one of the earliest studies to find an initial trade off between the effects of vegetation and soil texture on the original diurnal lst based ssm retrieval and extending the original bare ssm retrieval method to vegetated conditions therefore with the consideration that soil texture remains almost temporally constant at a given location it would be beneficial to further investigate the feasibility of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method in vegetated regions hence the present study was mostly motivated by seeking a trade off between soil texture and the fvc and their impacts on ssm retrieval with the aim of providing a better alternative for use in practice furthermore the present study conducted to make a preliminary assessment of using the proposed method with actual data at both a site scale and satellite pixel scale the remainder of this article is arranged as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data section 3 introduces the materials and methods sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively and section 6 summarizes the study 2 study area and data in this study the us arm an ameriflux site 36 6058 n 97 4888 w 314 m above sea level was selected to investigate the feasibility of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method over cropland fig 1 the primary reason for selecting the us arm site is the availability of unique canopy temperature measurements at a high temporal resolution of 30 min that enable the evaluation of estimated ssm with varying vegetation coverage during the growing season at the site scale according to meteorological records the us arm site covers a region characterized by average annual precipitation and air temperature of 843 mm and 14 76 c respectively and the soil texture is silty loam in the present study meteorological observations including solar radiation wind speed wind direction precipitation relative humidity air temperature and atmospheric pressure with a temporal interval of 30 min obtained over cloud free days in 2018 were collected to conduct colm simulations for the investigation of the efficacy of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method over different amounts of vegetation coverage finally in situ ssm measurements with a temporal interval same as meteorological observations were averaged to the daily ssm to evaluate the estimated ssm at the site scale all ameriflux data were obtained from the ameriflux network datasets https ameriflux lbl gov the remedhus network is located in the douro basin of spain and has been widely used to validate satellite derived ssm products sanchez et al 2012 peng et al 2015 gonzález zamora et al 2019 portal et al 2020 this network was also selected because the mature meteosat second generation msg products are an adequate option for evaluating the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method at the pixel scale fig 1 the remedhus is located in a crop dominated region similar to that of the us arm site in the present study cloud free days from april to october 2015 were selected to estimate ssm at the msg pixel scale with a spatial resolution of 3 km specifically the msg data including lst downward surface shortwave flux dssf and albedo were obtained from the satellite application facility on land surface analysis https landsaf ipma pt en data catalogue and used to estimate ssm because of the lack of actual ssm measurements at the msg pixel scale the smap sentinel 1 soil moisture product with the same spatial resolution of 3 km was preliminarily used to evaluate the estimated results das et al 2019 table 1 provides the location altitude and average temperature and precipitation of the us arm site and remedhus network 3 methods 3 1 estimation of ssm from diurnal lst an elliptical model was developed that followed the diurnal cycles of lst and net surface shortwave radiation nssr under cloud free conditions and the elliptical parameters ellipse center horizontal coordinate ellipse center vertical coordinate semi major axis semi minor axis and rotation angle were found to be sensitive to ssm dynamics based on the simulated data a bare ssm retrieval method was developed as follows 1 ssm m 1 x 0 m 2 y 0 m 3 a m 4 θ m 0 where ssm is the daily average ssm m3m 3 x 0 y 0 a and θ are the ellipse parameters ellipse center horizontal coordinate ellipse center vertical coordinate semi major axis and rotation angle respectively of the elliptical model between the diurnal cycles of lst and nssr and mi i 0 1 2 3 4 are the model coefficients m3 m 3 that vary on a daily basis and depend only on the meteorological conditions of the day to obtain the ellipse parameters the dimensionless lst and nssr were first obtained as follows 2 dt t t t q p q 3 ds t s t k r k where t t is lst k at time t h dt t is dimensionless lst s t is nssr wm 2 at time t h ds t is dimensionless nssr p and q are set as 373 k and 263 k respectively and r and k are set as 1200 w m 2 and 0 w m 2 respectively fig 2 depicts an example of the elliptical relationship and the ellipse parameters between the diurnal cycles of the dimensionless lst and nssr measured at the us arm site on april 28 2018 3 2 land surface model simulation although the superiority of the original diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method is its independence from soil texture it is only applicable for use with bare soil and this markedly constrains the use of the method in practice since natural surfaces are commonly covered with various degrees of vegetation coverages by contrast soil texture remains almost temporally unchanged for a given location and an increasing number of digital soil texture maps at various spatial scales have been produced to assist satellite ssm retrieval therefore it is of great interest to further investigate the effects of vegetation coverage on diurnal lst based ssm retrieval and to finally determine a feasible scheme for retrieving ssm under natural surfaces to achieve this it is necessary to obtain synchronous lst nssr and ssm measurements for different vegetation coverages and soil textures under different atmospheric conditions due to the lack of such datasets with ground observations the physics based numerical simulation is a suitable alternative to deal with this issue zhao et al 2013 guerriero et al 2016 in the present study the colm was selected to obtain synchronous lst nssr and ssm datasets associated with different underlying surfaces and atmospheric conditions data of several key meteorological elements solar radiation downward longwave radiation precipitation air temperature wind speed wind direction air pressure and relative humidity collected in the study area at a temporal interval of 30 min were used to drive the colm simulations specifically to avoid possible freeze thaw conditions data from the period between the 100th and 300th days of the year doy were used in addition meteorological data over cloud free days determined as days on which measured solar radiation showed a regular cosine variation and there was no precipitation during the whole day were selected in the study area fig 3 shows details of the land surface model simulation process used to evaluate diurnal lst based ssm retrieval under different amounts of vegetation coverage the simulation process involved three parts case i for bare soils based on the 12 fao soil types as shown in table 2 this was primarily used to investigate the accuracy of using the bare ssm retrieval method in the present study area case ii was used to explore the influence of vegetation coverage on ssm retrieval with the diurnal lst based method compared to case i and the fvc was set to vary between bare soils and those with moderate coverage between 0 and 0 6 case iii was used to explore the influence of vegetation coverage on the performance of the ssm retrieval method under the actual soil texture in a particular place initialization of the fvc soil texture and ssm in the colm was required prior to producing the simulated datasets specifically the gaussian emulation machine sensitivity analysis gem sa selected along with lp tau sampling method was used to obtain 120 groups of initial random samples with colm input in all three cases saltelli et al 2004 for each sample a unique combination of soil texture ssm ranging from wilting point to field capacity and fvc ranging from 0 to 0 6 was used to represent a natural surface in the present study the wilting point and field capacity are derived from the soil pedotransfer functions by saxton et al 1986 4 results 4 1 performances of ssm retrieval with simulated data as synchronous ground measured lst nssr and ssm with different underlying surfaces and atmospheric conditions are lacking the simulated datasets were used to investigate ssm retrieval via the proposed method in the year 2018 a total number of 39 cloud free days was selected for investigation for each cloud free day the colm was used to generate 120 groups of ellipse parameters and the corresponding ssm based on the simulated results for each day five model coefficients mi i 0 1 2 3 4 were obtained using least squares regression taking the simulated data on april 28 2018 as an example fig 4 shows scatterplots of estimated ssm versus simulated values based on 120 simulations conducted for cases i ii and iii the estimated ssm correlated well with the simulated values with significant r 2 of 0 973 0 959 and 0 996 for cases i ii and iii respectively furthermore in the three cases the rmse was 0 012 m3m 3 0 014 m3m 3 and 0 004 m3m 3 respectively these results show that case iii provided the most accurate results indicating that ssm retrieval based on known soil texture is likely to be superior to that obtained when all soil types are considered the results for case ii were slightly less accurate than those for case i and this could be due to the effects of vegetation nevertheless all three cases showed high ssm retrieval accuracy fig 4 only shows the simulation results for the three cases on an individual day during the study period to illustrate the accuracy of the three cases under different meteorological conditions simulated data from the us arm site for 39 cloud free days in 2018 were evaluated the accuracy of the results is shown in fig 5 the mean r 2 of cases i ii and iii was 0 942 0 922 and 0 972 respectively and the mean rmse was 0 016 m3m 3 0 019 m3m 3 and 0 010 m3m 3 respectively in general the results of the three cases under most conditions provided r 2 values greater than 0 8 and rmse values lower than 0 03 m3m 3 these results therefore indicate that the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method provides relatively highly accurate results with simulated data it is also evident that in almost all simulations case iii provided the best ssm retrieval with the highest and lowest r 2 and rmse respectively which further confirmed that the diurnal lst based method was better able to estimate ssm when the vegetation coverage varied and the soil texture was known in practical applications soil texture can be obtained from ground measurements or digital soil texture maps and it is thus reasonable to assume based on case iii that ssm can be directly estimated using the diurnal lst based method furthermore for most of the investigated the accuracy of case ii results was slightly lower than that of case i and this might have been caused by the varying vegetation coverage considered in case ii in this respect a previous study also preliminarily confirmed that the presence of vegetation decreased the accuracy of ssm retrieval when using the diurnal lst based method leng et al 2015 4 2 validation of ssm retrieval with in situ measurements in the previous section simulated data were used to analyze the performance of the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method to further assess the method ground in situ measurements that had been obtained at the us arm site during the growing season were employed in this respect the canopy temperature and nssr measurements collected on 39 cloud free days at the us arm site were used to obtain the ellipse parameters day by day meteorological observations at the site for each cloud free day were also acquired to drive the colm simulations and to obtain the model coefficients for each individual day finally using the ellipse parameters x 0 y 0 a and θ obtained from site scale measurements and the simulated model coefficients mi i 0 1 2 3 4 for each cloud free day the daily volumetric ssm content was estimated using the diurnal lst based method shown in equation 1 to evaluate the estimated daily volumetric ssm content ground in situ measurements with a temporal resolution of 30 min were first averaged to daily values and then used to validate the estimated ssm fig 6 shows the two datasets for the 39 cloud free days in the three cases and the results show that the accuracy of using in situ measurements in each case followed a similar pattern to that with the simulated results according to the error statistics case iii again provided the best ssm estimates of the three cases with an acceptable rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 and bias of 0 025 m3m 3 this result shows that the diurnal lst based retrieval method can be used to describe ssm dynamics during the growing season when the vegetation coverage varies and the soil texture is known in contrast case ii shows a decreased accuracy with an rmse of 0 091 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 063 m3m 3 these results further confirm that estimating ssm using the diurnal lst based method is generally adequate if the soil texture of a specific geographical location is known the results are thus meaningful because the soil texture of a known region is nearly temporally unchanged thus obtaining of the model coefficients for the diurnal lst based method following the colm simulation in case iii should be preferred as for case i because vegetation conditions were not considered in the colm simulations to obtain the model coefficients for ssm retrieval the estimated ssm exhibited relatively poor accuracy with an rmse of 0 097 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 073 m3m 3 indicating that the bare ssm retrieval method cannot be directly used to obtain ssm over vegetated regions based on the simulated data and ground in situ measurements the present study generally found a scheme of the presences of temporally variable vegetation coverages for a known soil texture to represent the vegetation dynamics for natural surfaces and preliminarily decided case iii as this feasible scheme to obtain the model coefficients for the diurnal lst based method 4 3 preliminary evaluation of msg derived ssm in addition to assessing estimated ssm with in situ measurements a preliminary evaluation of estimated ssm at the pixel scale was also conducted with msg observations as available ground ssm at the coarse spatial resolution of the msg pixel 3 km is lacking the smap sentinel 1 ssm product with the same spatial resolution was used in the evaluation to evaluate the estimated ssm the smap sentinel 1 was first assessed at the remedhus network scale for the entire network a total of 25 days during the study period from april to october 2015 were selected to assess smap sentinel 1 with in situ measurements to guarantee the reliability only the days when all the smap sentinel 1 pixels and site measurements for the remedhus network were available were selected for the assessments fig 7 depicts the comparison between smap sentinel 1 and in situ measurements at the network scale the results showed that there was a considerable correlation between the two ssm datasets r 2 of 0 326 however the use of smap sentinel 1 provided a significant decrease in ssm bias 0 039 m3m 3 compared to the use of in situ measurements moreover the rmse between the two datasets was 0 047 m3m 3 which was mostly attributed to the underestimation to further evaluate the msg derived ssm the smap sentinel 1 data were corrected by the bias obtained at the network scale and a final unbiased rmse of 0 025 m3m 3 was found when comparing the bias corrected smap sentinel 1 data with in situ measurements at network scale fig 8 shows the scatter plots of the msg derived ssm and the corrected smap sentinel 1 product at the pixel where the aws is centered and the 3 3 neighborhood pixels respectively case i is only feasible for use over bare soils whereas the remedhus region is characterized with crops during the study period therefore only the model coefficients for case ii and case iii were considered in the evaluation it is obvious that ssm was significantly overestimated with biases of 0 161 m3m 3 and 0 071 m3m 3 for case ii and case iii respectively for the aws centered pixel moreover the rmses of the two cases were 0 164 m3m 3 and 0 074 m3m 3 similar results were obtained for the 3 3 neighborhood pixels for case iii a fair accuracy with rmse of 0 077 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071m3m 3 can be found whereas the case ii reveals a decreased accuracy with an rmse of 0 153 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 148 m3m 3 these results further confirm the feasibility of diurnal lst based ssm retrieval over vegetated regions when soil texture is known furthermore they also indicate that using the diurnal lst based method is not compatible with full soil types 12 soil types mentioned above and varying vegetation coverage nevertheless the present study still provides a solution for estimating ssm using the diurnal lst method in vegetated regions if soil texture is known given that soil texture mostly remains unchanged for a given pixel although the proposed method for known soil texture is more applicable to vegetated areas than previous methods only the pixel where the aws is centered and the 3 3 neighborhood pixels have been evaluated considering that obtaining of regional ssm is more significant in practice the present study further integrated the msg data and simulated model coefficients in case iii to obtain ssm over the remedhus region fig 9 and fig 10 depict the differences between msg derived ssm and smap sentinel 1 data in the remedhus region on may 27th and june 20th 2015 as well as the distribution of the residuals between the two datasets on the two days the residuals generally follow a normal distribution with an rmse of approximately 0 053 m3m 3 and bias of approximately 0 050 m3m 3 on may 27th similar results can also be found on june 20th where the rmse and bias are approximately 0 033 m3m 3 and 0 028 m3m 3 respectively these results indicate that the proposed ssm retrieval method was still within an acceptable range in the remedhus region when the soil texture is known 5 discussion for satellite ssm retrieval vegetation and soil texture are recognized to be two most significant factors affecting the obtaining of quantitative ssm content with a volumetric unit of m3m 3 especially for optical thermal based methods for example the thermal inertia method is only feasible over bare or sparsely vegetated regions and the relationships between thermal inertia method and ssm would vary with soil texture in addition the widely used triangle trapezoid based methods can only obtain a relative quantity of ssm namely the soil moisture availability m 0 and soil texture information is required to decouple volumetric ssm content from triangle trapezoid derived m 0 li et al 2021 hence except for the developments of universal algorithms for quantitative ssm retrieval under presence of various fvc and soil texture it is also expected to determine a trade off between the effects of these two factors on ssm retrieval thus making ssm retrieval from limited application conditions e g bare or sparsely vegetated region to natural surfaces based on a previously developed method for ssm retrieval over bare soils the present study has investigated the feasibility of the method under vegetated soils with a special emphasis that soil texture would barely change for a fixed location with both in situ measurements at the site scale and satellite data at the pixel scale the present study summarized that the ssm retrieval method from diurnal lst is capable of estimating ssm over vegetated regions with known soil texture nevertheless several main sources of errors should be noted the primary error was related to the discrepancy between simulated and actual data in situ measurements and satellite data as we known the physics based colm was used to obtain lst nssr and ssm data over different underlying surfaces and in differing meteorological conditions due to the lack of available synchronous data however although physics based numerical simulations have been widely used to develop remote sensing retrieval algorithms they provide results based on ideal conditions and this inevitably leads to uncertainties in the present study the physics based colm simulation was used to produce the simulated datasets for the methodology developments of the ssm retrieval method shown in fig 3 in the colm simulation initialization of the underlying surface is through several main factors including vegetation type soil texture ssm and fvc specifically for each factor a reasonable data range was considered in the colm simulation to furthest represent the situations that may occur on the nature surface with the simulated datasets the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method was finally developed nevertheless none of the physics based numerical simulations can completely reflect the reality which may lead to uncertainties for ssm retrieval with ground measurements and satellite observations the significant difference between the performance using the simulated results and actual data also confirmed this issue another possible error relates to the uncertainties of measured data and satellite observations specifically errors relating to ground observation instruments the accuracy of calibration and remote sensing algorithms resulted in evaluation errors directly in the present study for example the canopy temperature observed at the site was used as the lst for the ssm retrieval method and it may have been affected by both the atmospheric temperature and the vegetation structure furthermore scaling issues can also affect the assessments and an obvious underestimation of the smap sentinel 1 product was found over the remedhus network compared to previous studies that have primarily utilized simulated data over bare soils with the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method the present study successfully provided an adequate solution for extending the original method in areas to the situations with moderate vegetation coverage specifically the results of the present study showed that the proposed solution was even more accurate under vegetation conditions compared to when the method was used for bare soils only nevertheless the main disadvantage of the proposed method is that the model coefficients still depend on meteorological conditions and they need to be obtained from complicated numerical simulations day by day which constrains its use in operational applications to this end future investigations should focus on this problem with the aim of figuring out more practical approaches for obtaining the model coefficients another limitation is that the method requires the input of multi temporal data and only geostationary satellites can meet this requirement which decreases the probability of obtaining a complete cloud free pixel series for an individual day however this situation can currently be improved using algorithms dedicated to reconstructing ground information for pixels covered by clouds martins et al 2019 wu et al 2021 specifically the msg has released a new version of all weather lst product in which lst over the cloud pixels were estimated using the principle of surface energy balance martins et al 2019 the all weather lst product provided an unprecedented opportunity to obtain diurnal lst which can be used to estimate ssm with the proposed method however a critical issue behind such all weather lst data is that the gap filled lst over the cloudy pixels maybe only an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst rather than an estimate of the actual cloudy lst duan et al 2017 hence although the formulation of the elliptical relationship between diurnal cycles of lst and nssr for cloud free conditions make the proposed method only applicable for days with no clouds or rain in theory recent advantages on the developments of all weather lst products and other surface properties have provided a potential for extending the proposed method to cloudy conditions nevertheless further investigations are still required to quantify the effects of the gap filled diurnal lst on ssm retrieval with the proposed method except for these it is known that the spatial resolution of geostationary satellite data is commonly coarser than that of onboard polar orbiting satellites nevertheless geostationary satellites at a higher spatial resolution of 2 km such as the himawari 8 and the geostationary operational environmental satellites 16 have been successfully launched which provided a chance to estimate ssm at fine spatial resolution with the proposed method 6 conclusion the present study primarily takes advantage of physics based numerical simulations in situ measurements and satellite data to investigate the use of the diurnal lst based bare ssm retrieval method over vegetated regions the effects of vegetation on ssm retrieval with the original method were explored and adequate ssm values can be estimated using the diurnal lst based method over moderate vegetation coverage with known soil texture this is especially important because soil texture can be obtained from site measurements or digital soil maps and they rarely change temporally specifically the method showed a generally acceptable accuracy with an rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 025 m3m 3 when compared to ground in situ measurements during the entire growing season at a crop site in addition a comparison of the estimated ssm at the msg pixel scale was conducted against the smap sentinel 1 product with the same spatial resolution and the model also provided a fair accuracy with an rmse of 0 074 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071 m3m 3 however due to the lack of sufficient ground measurements under more climate patterns and land cover types the present study only utilized data from a crop site and an ssm network to assess the method therefore more comprehensive evaluations of the method over different landscapes should be conducted in the ongoing work nevertheless the proposed method provided an alternative for the generation of ssm high fine spatial resolution with the upcoming geostationary satellites in future developments credit authorship contribution statement yun jing geng software investigation formal analysis writing original draft pei leng conceptualization methodology resources funding

2392,most current optical thermal based surface soil moisture ssm retrieval methods only utilize the instantaneous measurements made by onboard polar orbit satellites and they require soil texture as prior knowledge to obtain the volumetric ssm content a recent study developed a diurnal land surface temperature lst based ssm retrieval method to directly estimate the volumetric ssm content without the knowledge of soil texture however most subsequent studies have only examined the use of this method on bare soils therefore the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the method over vegetated regions with both experimental data and satellite observations first the impacts of vegetation on ssm retrieval were investigated through physics based common land model simulations and high accuracy with an overall root mean square error rmse of 0 010 m3m 3 was achieved when the underlying surface was covered by moderate fractional vegetation cover from 0 to 0 6 with a given soil texture based on the simulated results the ssm was then estimated using data from an ameriflux site dominated by crops during the growing season in 2018 the results were further verified using in situ measurements and this showed that the estimated ssm correlated well with in situ measurements with an rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 a further evaluation of the meteosat second generation msg derived ssm at the pixel scale was made using the proposed method and the results revealed an overall acceptable accuracy rmse of 0 074 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071 m3m 3 against the smap sentinel 1 ssm product at the same spatial resolution of 3 km data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm is an essential variable participating in the global water cycle and it affects the energy balance between the atmosphere and the earth s surface dorigo et al 2017 liu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in agricultural applications ssm can affect plant water availability and it is the main source of water for most crops martínez fernández et al 2016 zhang and zhou 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition accurate spatiotemporal ssm information can be used to provide early warnings about natural disasters such as droughts floods and landslides liu et al 2016 balti et al 2020 bahramian et al 2021 tangdamrongsub et al 2021 due to its diverse importance many methods have been proposed to obtain ssm with satellite data on various scales li et al 2021 peng et al 2021 over the past few decades it has been widely recognized that remote sensing based ssm retrieval is one of the most efficient ways of obtaining ssm and its spatiotemporal dynamics across regional and global scales li and rodell 2013 vereecken et al 2014 kim et al 2021 peng et al 2021 yan et al 2022 and the research focus to date has mostly been on optical and microwave based ssm retrievals as is known ssm is an indirect variable that should be estimated from direct parameters of remotely sensed measurements however most of the currently available methods can only obtain ssm proxies rather than obtaining the quantitative volumetric ssm content in physical units such as m3m 3 or cm3cm 3 due to the coupling between the volumetric ssm content and soil texture accurate soil texture data are commonly required as an auxiliary prior knowledge to decouple the volumetric ssm content from satellite derived ssm proxies although significant spatial heterogeneity of soil texture can commonly be found over natural surfaces a number of regional or global digital soil texture maps with varying spatial resolutions have been developed in recent years stępień et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 several of the most widely used soil texture products include the global gridded soil information soilgrids with a spatial resolution of 250 m hengl et al 2017 the world soil database hwsd with a spatial resolution of 1 km fao 2012 as well as the global soil dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km developed by the land atmosphere interaction research group at sun yat sen university shangguan et al 2014 these existing digital soil texture datasets thus provide the unprecedented opportunity of obtaining the volumetric ssm content based on satellite observations rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 liu et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2020 li et al 2021 in addition to soil texture vegetation also markedly affects ssm retrieval using most remote sensing based methods since it is a disturbance that would decrease the reflection or radiation signals from the soil component for example it is recognized that the widely employed thermal inertia ti is only feasible over bare or sparsely vegetated conditions veroustraete et al 2011 matsushima et al 2018 liu et al 2020 and various uncertainties have resulted when using passive microwave based ssm retrievals in regions with a high vegetation optical depth liu et al 2011 gevaert et al 2016 sawada et al 2017 it is thus considered that greater research attention should focus on the effects of vegetation rather than soil texture for ssm retrieval with satellite data particularly in areas where digital soil texture data at various spatial resolutions have been released for use in operational applications in a previous study a bare ssm retrieval method was developed to directly obtain the volumetric ssm content based on the diurnal land surface temperature lst leng et al 2014 based on simulations using the common land model colm which has distinct physical foundations the diurnal lst based bare ssm retrieval method was proven to be proficiently independent of soil texture information as such it is superior to previous methods in which soil texture information has generally been required as an auxiliary input to obtain the volumetric ssm content li et al 2021 however the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method was primarily developed from simulated data and it has not been comprehensively evaluated using experimental data at a site scale or using geostationary images at the satellite pixel scale further leng et al 2015 used simulated data to investigate the effect of fractional vegetation coverage fvc and soil texture on ssm retrieval with the diurnal lst based method it was found that the accuracy of ssm retrieval would decrease with the increase of fvc and the proposed method is still feasible when clay content is less than 30 under moderate fvc conditions this is one of the earliest studies to find an initial trade off between the effects of vegetation and soil texture on the original diurnal lst based ssm retrieval and extending the original bare ssm retrieval method to vegetated conditions therefore with the consideration that soil texture remains almost temporally constant at a given location it would be beneficial to further investigate the feasibility of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method in vegetated regions hence the present study was mostly motivated by seeking a trade off between soil texture and the fvc and their impacts on ssm retrieval with the aim of providing a better alternative for use in practice furthermore the present study conducted to make a preliminary assessment of using the proposed method with actual data at both a site scale and satellite pixel scale the remainder of this article is arranged as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data section 3 introduces the materials and methods sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively and section 6 summarizes the study 2 study area and data in this study the us arm an ameriflux site 36 6058 n 97 4888 w 314 m above sea level was selected to investigate the feasibility of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method over cropland fig 1 the primary reason for selecting the us arm site is the availability of unique canopy temperature measurements at a high temporal resolution of 30 min that enable the evaluation of estimated ssm with varying vegetation coverage during the growing season at the site scale according to meteorological records the us arm site covers a region characterized by average annual precipitation and air temperature of 843 mm and 14 76 c respectively and the soil texture is silty loam in the present study meteorological observations including solar radiation wind speed wind direction precipitation relative humidity air temperature and atmospheric pressure with a temporal interval of 30 min obtained over cloud free days in 2018 were collected to conduct colm simulations for the investigation of the efficacy of using the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method over different amounts of vegetation coverage finally in situ ssm measurements with a temporal interval same as meteorological observations were averaged to the daily ssm to evaluate the estimated ssm at the site scale all ameriflux data were obtained from the ameriflux network datasets https ameriflux lbl gov the remedhus network is located in the douro basin of spain and has been widely used to validate satellite derived ssm products sanchez et al 2012 peng et al 2015 gonzález zamora et al 2019 portal et al 2020 this network was also selected because the mature meteosat second generation msg products are an adequate option for evaluating the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method at the pixel scale fig 1 the remedhus is located in a crop dominated region similar to that of the us arm site in the present study cloud free days from april to october 2015 were selected to estimate ssm at the msg pixel scale with a spatial resolution of 3 km specifically the msg data including lst downward surface shortwave flux dssf and albedo were obtained from the satellite application facility on land surface analysis https landsaf ipma pt en data catalogue and used to estimate ssm because of the lack of actual ssm measurements at the msg pixel scale the smap sentinel 1 soil moisture product with the same spatial resolution of 3 km was preliminarily used to evaluate the estimated results das et al 2019 table 1 provides the location altitude and average temperature and precipitation of the us arm site and remedhus network 3 methods 3 1 estimation of ssm from diurnal lst an elliptical model was developed that followed the diurnal cycles of lst and net surface shortwave radiation nssr under cloud free conditions and the elliptical parameters ellipse center horizontal coordinate ellipse center vertical coordinate semi major axis semi minor axis and rotation angle were found to be sensitive to ssm dynamics based on the simulated data a bare ssm retrieval method was developed as follows 1 ssm m 1 x 0 m 2 y 0 m 3 a m 4 θ m 0 where ssm is the daily average ssm m3m 3 x 0 y 0 a and θ are the ellipse parameters ellipse center horizontal coordinate ellipse center vertical coordinate semi major axis and rotation angle respectively of the elliptical model between the diurnal cycles of lst and nssr and mi i 0 1 2 3 4 are the model coefficients m3 m 3 that vary on a daily basis and depend only on the meteorological conditions of the day to obtain the ellipse parameters the dimensionless lst and nssr were first obtained as follows 2 dt t t t q p q 3 ds t s t k r k where t t is lst k at time t h dt t is dimensionless lst s t is nssr wm 2 at time t h ds t is dimensionless nssr p and q are set as 373 k and 263 k respectively and r and k are set as 1200 w m 2 and 0 w m 2 respectively fig 2 depicts an example of the elliptical relationship and the ellipse parameters between the diurnal cycles of the dimensionless lst and nssr measured at the us arm site on april 28 2018 3 2 land surface model simulation although the superiority of the original diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method is its independence from soil texture it is only applicable for use with bare soil and this markedly constrains the use of the method in practice since natural surfaces are commonly covered with various degrees of vegetation coverages by contrast soil texture remains almost temporally unchanged for a given location and an increasing number of digital soil texture maps at various spatial scales have been produced to assist satellite ssm retrieval therefore it is of great interest to further investigate the effects of vegetation coverage on diurnal lst based ssm retrieval and to finally determine a feasible scheme for retrieving ssm under natural surfaces to achieve this it is necessary to obtain synchronous lst nssr and ssm measurements for different vegetation coverages and soil textures under different atmospheric conditions due to the lack of such datasets with ground observations the physics based numerical simulation is a suitable alternative to deal with this issue zhao et al 2013 guerriero et al 2016 in the present study the colm was selected to obtain synchronous lst nssr and ssm datasets associated with different underlying surfaces and atmospheric conditions data of several key meteorological elements solar radiation downward longwave radiation precipitation air temperature wind speed wind direction air pressure and relative humidity collected in the study area at a temporal interval of 30 min were used to drive the colm simulations specifically to avoid possible freeze thaw conditions data from the period between the 100th and 300th days of the year doy were used in addition meteorological data over cloud free days determined as days on which measured solar radiation showed a regular cosine variation and there was no precipitation during the whole day were selected in the study area fig 3 shows details of the land surface model simulation process used to evaluate diurnal lst based ssm retrieval under different amounts of vegetation coverage the simulation process involved three parts case i for bare soils based on the 12 fao soil types as shown in table 2 this was primarily used to investigate the accuracy of using the bare ssm retrieval method in the present study area case ii was used to explore the influence of vegetation coverage on ssm retrieval with the diurnal lst based method compared to case i and the fvc was set to vary between bare soils and those with moderate coverage between 0 and 0 6 case iii was used to explore the influence of vegetation coverage on the performance of the ssm retrieval method under the actual soil texture in a particular place initialization of the fvc soil texture and ssm in the colm was required prior to producing the simulated datasets specifically the gaussian emulation machine sensitivity analysis gem sa selected along with lp tau sampling method was used to obtain 120 groups of initial random samples with colm input in all three cases saltelli et al 2004 for each sample a unique combination of soil texture ssm ranging from wilting point to field capacity and fvc ranging from 0 to 0 6 was used to represent a natural surface in the present study the wilting point and field capacity are derived from the soil pedotransfer functions by saxton et al 1986 4 results 4 1 performances of ssm retrieval with simulated data as synchronous ground measured lst nssr and ssm with different underlying surfaces and atmospheric conditions are lacking the simulated datasets were used to investigate ssm retrieval via the proposed method in the year 2018 a total number of 39 cloud free days was selected for investigation for each cloud free day the colm was used to generate 120 groups of ellipse parameters and the corresponding ssm based on the simulated results for each day five model coefficients mi i 0 1 2 3 4 were obtained using least squares regression taking the simulated data on april 28 2018 as an example fig 4 shows scatterplots of estimated ssm versus simulated values based on 120 simulations conducted for cases i ii and iii the estimated ssm correlated well with the simulated values with significant r 2 of 0 973 0 959 and 0 996 for cases i ii and iii respectively furthermore in the three cases the rmse was 0 012 m3m 3 0 014 m3m 3 and 0 004 m3m 3 respectively these results show that case iii provided the most accurate results indicating that ssm retrieval based on known soil texture is likely to be superior to that obtained when all soil types are considered the results for case ii were slightly less accurate than those for case i and this could be due to the effects of vegetation nevertheless all three cases showed high ssm retrieval accuracy fig 4 only shows the simulation results for the three cases on an individual day during the study period to illustrate the accuracy of the three cases under different meteorological conditions simulated data from the us arm site for 39 cloud free days in 2018 were evaluated the accuracy of the results is shown in fig 5 the mean r 2 of cases i ii and iii was 0 942 0 922 and 0 972 respectively and the mean rmse was 0 016 m3m 3 0 019 m3m 3 and 0 010 m3m 3 respectively in general the results of the three cases under most conditions provided r 2 values greater than 0 8 and rmse values lower than 0 03 m3m 3 these results therefore indicate that the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method provides relatively highly accurate results with simulated data it is also evident that in almost all simulations case iii provided the best ssm retrieval with the highest and lowest r 2 and rmse respectively which further confirmed that the diurnal lst based method was better able to estimate ssm when the vegetation coverage varied and the soil texture was known in practical applications soil texture can be obtained from ground measurements or digital soil texture maps and it is thus reasonable to assume based on case iii that ssm can be directly estimated using the diurnal lst based method furthermore for most of the investigated the accuracy of case ii results was slightly lower than that of case i and this might have been caused by the varying vegetation coverage considered in case ii in this respect a previous study also preliminarily confirmed that the presence of vegetation decreased the accuracy of ssm retrieval when using the diurnal lst based method leng et al 2015 4 2 validation of ssm retrieval with in situ measurements in the previous section simulated data were used to analyze the performance of the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method to further assess the method ground in situ measurements that had been obtained at the us arm site during the growing season were employed in this respect the canopy temperature and nssr measurements collected on 39 cloud free days at the us arm site were used to obtain the ellipse parameters day by day meteorological observations at the site for each cloud free day were also acquired to drive the colm simulations and to obtain the model coefficients for each individual day finally using the ellipse parameters x 0 y 0 a and θ obtained from site scale measurements and the simulated model coefficients mi i 0 1 2 3 4 for each cloud free day the daily volumetric ssm content was estimated using the diurnal lst based method shown in equation 1 to evaluate the estimated daily volumetric ssm content ground in situ measurements with a temporal resolution of 30 min were first averaged to daily values and then used to validate the estimated ssm fig 6 shows the two datasets for the 39 cloud free days in the three cases and the results show that the accuracy of using in situ measurements in each case followed a similar pattern to that with the simulated results according to the error statistics case iii again provided the best ssm estimates of the three cases with an acceptable rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 and bias of 0 025 m3m 3 this result shows that the diurnal lst based retrieval method can be used to describe ssm dynamics during the growing season when the vegetation coverage varies and the soil texture is known in contrast case ii shows a decreased accuracy with an rmse of 0 091 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 063 m3m 3 these results further confirm that estimating ssm using the diurnal lst based method is generally adequate if the soil texture of a specific geographical location is known the results are thus meaningful because the soil texture of a known region is nearly temporally unchanged thus obtaining of the model coefficients for the diurnal lst based method following the colm simulation in case iii should be preferred as for case i because vegetation conditions were not considered in the colm simulations to obtain the model coefficients for ssm retrieval the estimated ssm exhibited relatively poor accuracy with an rmse of 0 097 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 073 m3m 3 indicating that the bare ssm retrieval method cannot be directly used to obtain ssm over vegetated regions based on the simulated data and ground in situ measurements the present study generally found a scheme of the presences of temporally variable vegetation coverages for a known soil texture to represent the vegetation dynamics for natural surfaces and preliminarily decided case iii as this feasible scheme to obtain the model coefficients for the diurnal lst based method 4 3 preliminary evaluation of msg derived ssm in addition to assessing estimated ssm with in situ measurements a preliminary evaluation of estimated ssm at the pixel scale was also conducted with msg observations as available ground ssm at the coarse spatial resolution of the msg pixel 3 km is lacking the smap sentinel 1 ssm product with the same spatial resolution was used in the evaluation to evaluate the estimated ssm the smap sentinel 1 was first assessed at the remedhus network scale for the entire network a total of 25 days during the study period from april to october 2015 were selected to assess smap sentinel 1 with in situ measurements to guarantee the reliability only the days when all the smap sentinel 1 pixels and site measurements for the remedhus network were available were selected for the assessments fig 7 depicts the comparison between smap sentinel 1 and in situ measurements at the network scale the results showed that there was a considerable correlation between the two ssm datasets r 2 of 0 326 however the use of smap sentinel 1 provided a significant decrease in ssm bias 0 039 m3m 3 compared to the use of in situ measurements moreover the rmse between the two datasets was 0 047 m3m 3 which was mostly attributed to the underestimation to further evaluate the msg derived ssm the smap sentinel 1 data were corrected by the bias obtained at the network scale and a final unbiased rmse of 0 025 m3m 3 was found when comparing the bias corrected smap sentinel 1 data with in situ measurements at network scale fig 8 shows the scatter plots of the msg derived ssm and the corrected smap sentinel 1 product at the pixel where the aws is centered and the 3 3 neighborhood pixels respectively case i is only feasible for use over bare soils whereas the remedhus region is characterized with crops during the study period therefore only the model coefficients for case ii and case iii were considered in the evaluation it is obvious that ssm was significantly overestimated with biases of 0 161 m3m 3 and 0 071 m3m 3 for case ii and case iii respectively for the aws centered pixel moreover the rmses of the two cases were 0 164 m3m 3 and 0 074 m3m 3 similar results were obtained for the 3 3 neighborhood pixels for case iii a fair accuracy with rmse of 0 077 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071m3m 3 can be found whereas the case ii reveals a decreased accuracy with an rmse of 0 153 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 148 m3m 3 these results further confirm the feasibility of diurnal lst based ssm retrieval over vegetated regions when soil texture is known furthermore they also indicate that using the diurnal lst based method is not compatible with full soil types 12 soil types mentioned above and varying vegetation coverage nevertheless the present study still provides a solution for estimating ssm using the diurnal lst method in vegetated regions if soil texture is known given that soil texture mostly remains unchanged for a given pixel although the proposed method for known soil texture is more applicable to vegetated areas than previous methods only the pixel where the aws is centered and the 3 3 neighborhood pixels have been evaluated considering that obtaining of regional ssm is more significant in practice the present study further integrated the msg data and simulated model coefficients in case iii to obtain ssm over the remedhus region fig 9 and fig 10 depict the differences between msg derived ssm and smap sentinel 1 data in the remedhus region on may 27th and june 20th 2015 as well as the distribution of the residuals between the two datasets on the two days the residuals generally follow a normal distribution with an rmse of approximately 0 053 m3m 3 and bias of approximately 0 050 m3m 3 on may 27th similar results can also be found on june 20th where the rmse and bias are approximately 0 033 m3m 3 and 0 028 m3m 3 respectively these results indicate that the proposed ssm retrieval method was still within an acceptable range in the remedhus region when the soil texture is known 5 discussion for satellite ssm retrieval vegetation and soil texture are recognized to be two most significant factors affecting the obtaining of quantitative ssm content with a volumetric unit of m3m 3 especially for optical thermal based methods for example the thermal inertia method is only feasible over bare or sparsely vegetated regions and the relationships between thermal inertia method and ssm would vary with soil texture in addition the widely used triangle trapezoid based methods can only obtain a relative quantity of ssm namely the soil moisture availability m 0 and soil texture information is required to decouple volumetric ssm content from triangle trapezoid derived m 0 li et al 2021 hence except for the developments of universal algorithms for quantitative ssm retrieval under presence of various fvc and soil texture it is also expected to determine a trade off between the effects of these two factors on ssm retrieval thus making ssm retrieval from limited application conditions e g bare or sparsely vegetated region to natural surfaces based on a previously developed method for ssm retrieval over bare soils the present study has investigated the feasibility of the method under vegetated soils with a special emphasis that soil texture would barely change for a fixed location with both in situ measurements at the site scale and satellite data at the pixel scale the present study summarized that the ssm retrieval method from diurnal lst is capable of estimating ssm over vegetated regions with known soil texture nevertheless several main sources of errors should be noted the primary error was related to the discrepancy between simulated and actual data in situ measurements and satellite data as we known the physics based colm was used to obtain lst nssr and ssm data over different underlying surfaces and in differing meteorological conditions due to the lack of available synchronous data however although physics based numerical simulations have been widely used to develop remote sensing retrieval algorithms they provide results based on ideal conditions and this inevitably leads to uncertainties in the present study the physics based colm simulation was used to produce the simulated datasets for the methodology developments of the ssm retrieval method shown in fig 3 in the colm simulation initialization of the underlying surface is through several main factors including vegetation type soil texture ssm and fvc specifically for each factor a reasonable data range was considered in the colm simulation to furthest represent the situations that may occur on the nature surface with the simulated datasets the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method was finally developed nevertheless none of the physics based numerical simulations can completely reflect the reality which may lead to uncertainties for ssm retrieval with ground measurements and satellite observations the significant difference between the performance using the simulated results and actual data also confirmed this issue another possible error relates to the uncertainties of measured data and satellite observations specifically errors relating to ground observation instruments the accuracy of calibration and remote sensing algorithms resulted in evaluation errors directly in the present study for example the canopy temperature observed at the site was used as the lst for the ssm retrieval method and it may have been affected by both the atmospheric temperature and the vegetation structure furthermore scaling issues can also affect the assessments and an obvious underestimation of the smap sentinel 1 product was found over the remedhus network compared to previous studies that have primarily utilized simulated data over bare soils with the diurnal lst based ssm retrieval method the present study successfully provided an adequate solution for extending the original method in areas to the situations with moderate vegetation coverage specifically the results of the present study showed that the proposed solution was even more accurate under vegetation conditions compared to when the method was used for bare soils only nevertheless the main disadvantage of the proposed method is that the model coefficients still depend on meteorological conditions and they need to be obtained from complicated numerical simulations day by day which constrains its use in operational applications to this end future investigations should focus on this problem with the aim of figuring out more practical approaches for obtaining the model coefficients another limitation is that the method requires the input of multi temporal data and only geostationary satellites can meet this requirement which decreases the probability of obtaining a complete cloud free pixel series for an individual day however this situation can currently be improved using algorithms dedicated to reconstructing ground information for pixels covered by clouds martins et al 2019 wu et al 2021 specifically the msg has released a new version of all weather lst product in which lst over the cloud pixels were estimated using the principle of surface energy balance martins et al 2019 the all weather lst product provided an unprecedented opportunity to obtain diurnal lst which can be used to estimate ssm with the proposed method however a critical issue behind such all weather lst data is that the gap filled lst over the cloudy pixels maybe only an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst rather than an estimate of the actual cloudy lst duan et al 2017 hence although the formulation of the elliptical relationship between diurnal cycles of lst and nssr for cloud free conditions make the proposed method only applicable for days with no clouds or rain in theory recent advantages on the developments of all weather lst products and other surface properties have provided a potential for extending the proposed method to cloudy conditions nevertheless further investigations are still required to quantify the effects of the gap filled diurnal lst on ssm retrieval with the proposed method except for these it is known that the spatial resolution of geostationary satellite data is commonly coarser than that of onboard polar orbiting satellites nevertheless geostationary satellites at a higher spatial resolution of 2 km such as the himawari 8 and the geostationary operational environmental satellites 16 have been successfully launched which provided a chance to estimate ssm at fine spatial resolution with the proposed method 6 conclusion the present study primarily takes advantage of physics based numerical simulations in situ measurements and satellite data to investigate the use of the diurnal lst based bare ssm retrieval method over vegetated regions the effects of vegetation on ssm retrieval with the original method were explored and adequate ssm values can be estimated using the diurnal lst based method over moderate vegetation coverage with known soil texture this is especially important because soil texture can be obtained from site measurements or digital soil maps and they rarely change temporally specifically the method showed a generally acceptable accuracy with an rmse of 0 078 m3m 3 and a bias of 0 025 m3m 3 when compared to ground in situ measurements during the entire growing season at a crop site in addition a comparison of the estimated ssm at the msg pixel scale was conducted against the smap sentinel 1 product with the same spatial resolution and the model also provided a fair accuracy with an rmse of 0 074 m3m 3 and bias of 0 071 m3m 3 however due to the lack of sufficient ground measurements under more climate patterns and land cover types the present study only utilized data from a crop site and an ssm network to assess the method therefore more comprehensive evaluations of the method over different landscapes should be conducted in the ongoing work nevertheless the proposed method provided an alternative for the generation of ssm high fine spatial resolution with the upcoming geostationary satellites in future developments credit authorship contribution statement yun jing geng software investigation formal analysis writing original draft pei leng conceptualization methodology resources funding

2393,a comprehensive understanding of groundwater dynamics and its interaction with surface water under the influence of agricultural activities is essential for local agriculture ecology and resident in arid regions which is poorly understood in arid oasis desert region in our study with emphasis on a comparison of hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigated and desert non irrigated areas the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction of a typical oasis desert system with a rapid irrigation agriculture development were examined to clarify the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 water samples results showed that cultivated land area increased by 121 8 732 4 km2 during 2000 to 2020 mainly transferring from grassland and bare land groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm with weakly alkaline shallow groundwater had a much higher ec than other water components stable isotopic and ec values of shallow groundwater in the non irrigation areas were much greater than those in the irrigation areas whereas middle groundwater isotopic values were more depleted in the desert than in the oasis shallow groundwater ec value was lower in summer middle groundwater had higher ec in summer streamflow and confined water in the study area are suitable for agricultural irrigation but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation at present the groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by strong evaporation dilution mixing water rock interaction and agricultural drainage groundwater in the irrigation areas was recharged by ephemeral runoff seepage irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow long term development of irrigation agriculture large scale land reclamation irrigation and groundwater pumping in arid region has caused groundwater level decline and salinization with a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water hence decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation carrying out gradual ecological restoration improving water saving efficiency and agricultural drainage system would be the viable method to restore groundwater and maintain the oasis desert ecosystem coexistence in arid regions in the context of climate change keywords stable isotopes hydrochemistry

the largest liquid freshwater resource in the world and is essential to daily life agriculture industry and ecosystems particularly in arid environments due to low precipitation limited river water and high evapotranspiration bouimouass et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhu and zhang 2022 except for climatic factors anthropogenic interventions also have an important effect on the availability and quality of groundwater such as population growth land cover changes river water diversion groundwater overexploitation and pollution omar et al 2021 ahmed et al 2022 in recent 30 years groundwater storage has been decreasing year by year in many regions around the world due to the increased intensity of irrigation mainly from groundwater pumping castellano et al 2019 jia et al 2020 liu et al 2022 irrigated agriculture development cultivated area expansion is crucial to feed the growing population in arid regions however it not only alters the natural water cycle condition in irrigated districts but also introduce chemical substances into the aquifer systems to promote mixing evaporation and hydrochemical reactions zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2022 globally 20 of the irrigation area is now facing groundwater quality deterioration mao et al 2020 and the increased groundwater recharge by irrigation return flow would not completely counteract the negative effect of groundwater overexploitation in some agricultural regions gleeson et al 2012 han et al 2017 this has led to a series of ecological and environment problems such as groundwater level decline and quality deterioration disappearance of surface water bodies and land subsidence posing threats to global water security human health agricultural production safety and regional sustainable development rezaie balf et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 thus it not only causes ecological environment deterioration and water resources shortage but also brings enormous economic losses for agriculture and industry dependence on groundwater van lanen et al 2013 esmaeilbeiki et al 2020 therefore in order to sustainably manage groundwater in arid region it is crucial to understand the impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater quality and quantity and clarify the surface water groundwater conversion mechanism under the natural economic composite system liu et al 2022 the tarim river basin is the largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwest china and is currently suffering from marked human interventions that impact regional groundwater resources such as large scale land reclamation rapid irrigated agriculture development and growing population in the past 20 years chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 agriculture plays an important role in the socioeconomic development which is heavily dependent on irrigation in this region zhang et al 2015 agricultural water consumption has strongly occupied the ecological water resulting the continuous decline of groundwater level in desert areas and serious degradation of desert vegetation especially desert riparian forests wang et al 2021b thus the availability and variability of groundwater resources are crucial to the reginal ecological environment conservation and socio economy sustainability zhang et al 2014a the luntai oasis is a typical oasis desert of the tarim basin where farmland expansion and streamflow diversion for unreasonable irrigation have caused groundwater level rise in the irrigation districts then led to serious secondary salinization of cultivated land threatening the sustainable development of regional agriculture and economy tunsagul et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 in recent years the water saving irrigation has been widespread in the tarim basin especially mulched drip irrigation chen et al 2019 moreover the consumption of chemical fertilizer and groundwater over exploitation due to irrigated agriculture development have increased dramatically within the tarim basin which are reshaping the hydrological regimes and exacerbating the eco environmental problems wang et al 2022b yin et al 2022 there is an urgent need to scientifically understand the groundwater quality regime and its interaction transformation mechanism with surface water so as to provide theoretical foundation for the comprehensive groundwater management and regional water security protection in the tarim basin groundwater hydrochemistry and its evolution mechanisms are critical to understand groundwater recharge and clarify groundwater surface water interaction chen et al 2020 jia et al 2020 based on stable isotope technology geochemical analyses hydrogeochemical modeling remote sensing and traditional field observations e g geochemical geophysical and hydrogeological

yin et al 2021 ahmed et al 2022 singh 2022 generally groundwater hydrochemical components in arid region could be mainly controlled by evaporation atmospheric precipitation flushing and mixing water rock interactions and the irrigation water quality with the influences of natural conditions and human activities e g agricultural irrigation climatic and hydrogeologic conditions extreme climate events pant et al 2018 cao et al 2020 gao et al 2022 the results of global hydrological modeling showed that during 2001 to 2010 the groundwater over extraction exceeded 20 mm a caused by human activities while it was lower 10 mm a caused by climate change liu et al 2022 gao et al 2022 reported that long term irrigation caused the salt imbalance and groundwater salinization and groundwater salinity in irrigated districts increased by 3 83 times therefore both the water quantity balance and salts balance of groundwater should be focused in groundwater management of irrigation areas however understanding the impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater systems could be challenging due to the imperfect groundwater monitoring networks lack of publicly available data and limited knowledge of groundwater process liu et al 2022 yet the differences in groundwater hydrochemistry between irrigated and non irrigated areas and the impacts of long term irrigation on water quality and groundwater surface water interaction are not well understood in arid region particularly in arid oasis desert region of tarim basin geochemical analyses could provide direct indicators of hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality using the chemical compositions of water samples ahmed et al 2022 gao et al 2022 commonly used environmental tracers are major ions and stable water isotopes bouimouass et al 2020 major ions e g chloride could indicate the geochemical evolution and hydraulic connections of groundwater and the mixing process between various groundwater recharge sources because the changes in groundwater flow pathway and recharge rates could lead to noticeable differences in the composition of major ions chenini et al 2010 li et al 2019b stable water isotopes δ 2h and δ 18o serve as ideal tracers for identifying recharge sources and exploring water circulation precipitation surface water and groundwater which are influenced by geographical factors and meteorological conditions zeng et al 2020 ahmed et al 2022 it has been widely applied in groundwater research such as analyzing groundwater recharge and discharge flow and interconnection between the aquifers groundwater surface water connections evaporative effects groundwater mixing fate and transports of pollutants de bondt et al 2018 li et al 2019a they are very crucial for improving groundwater resource management in arid region the luntai oasis was selected as the study area to evaluate groundwater quality and its interaction with surface water in this study we analyzed the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction under the influence of agricultural activities over the luntai oasis using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 water samples the main objectives of our study were i to analyze climate and land use variations in the oasis desert ii to compare the spatiotemporal hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigated and desert non irrigated areas iii to assess irrigation water quality iv to identify groundwater recharge sources and its interaction with surface water and v to clarify the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality with a rapid irrigation agriculture development the results would be helpful for further understanding of groundwater hydrological process in the irrigated oasis desert of arid regions and useful for sustainable groundwater resource management and oasis desert ecosystem maintenance in the context of climate change 2 study area the luntai oasis covers approximately 7 76 103 km2 83 88 85 39 e 41 32 42 14 n located in the middle and lower reaches of the dina river basin lying to the southern foot of tianshan mountains and on the northern edge of tarim basin xinjiang province of china fig 1 a it has an altitude ranging from 868 to 2243 m above sea level from the south to north according to the geomorphologic landscape characteristic the central and western oases and the northern eastern and southern deserts in luntai oasis constitutes an oasis desert ecosystem fig 1a the dina river basin is composed of the dina river yeyungou river cedaya river and yangxia river which originated in the southern tianshan mountains the annual runoff into the oasis is 5 244 108 m3 and the flood season is from may to september accounting for 89 1 of the total fig 2 b in the last 20 years with the increase of agriculture water demand more than 90 of the runoff is diverted into cultivated land for irrigation causing the dried up river and decreased groundwater level within the luntai oasis chen et al 2019 the luntai oasis is characterized by a typical temperate arid continental climate and the average annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation are 11 2 65 4 mm and 1766 2450 mm tunsagul et al 2010 respectively with strong seasonal dynamics fig 2a precipitation exhibits an uneven seasonal distribution in the oasis and more than 70 of the total precipitation occurs from may to september with the peak precipitation in june the seasonal distribution of runoff is closely related to precipitation in the oasis fig 2 the runoff begins to increase significantly with the obvious increase of rain in the wet season from april to september while the runoff decreases sharply in the dry season this indicates that precipitation is the dominant recharge source of runoff and the meltwater also plays an important role in runoff wang et al 2022b in the oasis the main soils are rock soil brown desert soil irrigation silt soil swamp soil and aeolian sand soil with the ph of 7 5 adil et al 2014 the top 10 cm soil layer has the largest salinity within the oasis and soil salinization is serious directly affecting local agricultural and ecological development the luntai oasis is a plain oasis extending along the rivers with relatively flat terrain the quaternary sediments vary gradually from proluvial sediment to alluvial sediment from the north to south fig 1b controlling the spatial distribution patterns of aquifer systems wang et al 2022b the northern part of the luntai oasis is proluvial sediment with a thickness of 50 m deep groundwater level while the southern part is alluvial sediment with a thickness of 40 60 m shallow groundwater level moreover fine sandstone pebbly gravel silty fine sandstone and pebbly sandstone are alternately deposited in the vertical layers forming porous aquifers and aquitards fig 1b and c the structure of aquifers in the oasis exhibits a clear zonation in the horizontal direction and stratification in the vertical direction the aquifer thickness gradually increases from the north to south and the thickness of the second to fifth aquifer at the b borehole in fig 1d is 83 34 142 16 78 43 and 95 10 m respectively wang et al 2022b furthermore the dominated natural plants are some xeromorphic and halophytic species reliance on groundwater including halostachys capsica tamarix spp and phragmites communis fig 1d and e zhang et al 2020 the luntai oasis is dominated by agriculture and the main crops are wheat and cotton in the oasis the forest and fruit industry is an important part of the regional economy and the main artificial economic forests are apricot pear walnut and red date trees which are grown with irrigation by surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2020 in 2020 the bare land grassland cultivated land artificial surface wetland water bodies and forest areas accounted for 62 85 18 84 17 18 0 62 0 25 0 23 and 0 02 respectively of the total area of the luntai oasis 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection surface water and groundwater were collected during three field sampling campaigns between april and november in 2019 within the luntai oasis covering spring april summer august and autumn november a total of 83 samples were collected from streamflow reservoirs and wells including 29 surface water samples 22 shallow groundwater samples 28 middle groundwater samples and 4 deep groundwater samples the locations of water sampling sites were recorded using a gps device and plotted in fig 1a surface water was sampled from the reservoirs and main streams and their tributaries dina river yeyungou river cedaya river and yangxia river in addition groundwater samples were taken from pumped wells irrigation domestic and industrial wells and long term monitoring wells in the oasis the wells are generally classified into shallow groundwater well depth 20 m middle groundwater 20 m well depth 100 m and deep groundwater well depth 100 m based on the hydrogeological conditions wang et al 2013 water samples were filtered at 0 22 μm in situ and collected in 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles and tightly capped then all the samples were sent to laboratory for hydrochemical and isotopic measurement the physical parameters electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature of water samples were measured in the field by a multi parameter

method ion analysis precision was below 1 and all ionic charge balances of water samples were within 10 furthermore liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dlt 100 determined the isotopic abundance ratio of water samples the isotope abundances are expressed as deviations of isotopic ratios 2h 1h and 18o 16o relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in terms of delta δ notation in per million

concentration could affect plant growth thus influencing agricultural production and security li et al 2019b there are numbers of indicators for irrigation water quality assessment such as soluble sodium percentage na residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium adsorption ratio sar and permeability index pi santacruz et al 2017 to assess the suitability of groundwater and surface water for agricultural uses in the luntai oasis three key indicators of na sar and rsc were selected for alkalinity hazard assessment and ec was applied for salinity hazard assessment as well as the wilcox and

luntai oasis during 2000 to 2020 the annual precipitation and air temperature exhibited a decreasing trend with a rate of about 1 5 mm 10a and 0 3 10a from 2000 to 2020 respectively while annual mean ndvi had an increasing trend with a rate of about 0 009 10a over the period moreover the variation trends and amplitudes of these factors exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 3 as shown in fig 3c the ndvi in 12 1 of the study area showed a decreasing trend mainly distributed on the edge of oasis primarily grassland indicating that the vegetation in the desert oasis transition zone has been degraded obviously chen et al 2019 contrarily the ndvi in 61 5 of the study area increased with a rate of 0 0 001 a mainly distributed in desert area primarily bare land indicating that vegetation change in desert area was not obvious the increase rate of ndvi in 26 4 of the luntai oasis was 0 001 a mainly distributed in oasis area primarily cultivated land indicating that farmland expansion in the oasis has significantly improved vegetation greenness yao et al 2022 furthermore air temperature in the whole luntai oasis showed a decreasing trend in the past 20 years with the smallest decrease in the southeastern part and the largest decrease in the northern part fig 3a precipitation in the northeastern part of the study area showed an increasing trend with a small rate while precipitation in the rest of the region exhibited a slight decreasing trend fig 3b the spatial distributions of lulc in the luntain oasis for 2000 2010 and 2020 were prepared fig 4 a c as shown in fig 4 cultivated land and grassland were mainly distributed in the southwest and middle of the oasis the oasis region while bare land was mainly in the north middle and southeast the desert region furthermore fig 4 exhibited the area coverage of various land use types in the luntai oasis during 2000 to 2020 clearly bare land was the dominant land cover type over the last 20 years fig 4d f covering 62 of the oasis area 68 9 68 1 and 62 9 in 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively grassland was second in dominance 22 7 22 9 and 18 8 in 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively followed by cultivated land 7 7 8 4 17 2 in 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively while the total area coverage of other land cover types was not 2 fig 4d f overall during 2000 to 2020 the area of artificial surfaces wetland cultivated land and forest continuously increased as time goes on while the area of bare land and grassland gradually decreased fig 4 compared to other land cover types the area coverage of cultivated land grassland and bare land varied significantly during 2000 to 2020 over the period the largest area change was occurred in cultivated land increasing by 121 8 732 4 km2 between 2000 and 2020 and by 103 5 678 4 km2 between 2010 and 2020 conversely bare land and grassland area decreased markedly between 2000 and 2020 by 8 8 472 9 km2 and 17 2 303 1 km2 respectively it is obvious that the area transfer of cultivated land to other land cover types was few over the past 20 years and the increased cultivated land was mainly transferred from grassland and bare land especially from grassland fig 4d f in contrast during 2000 to 2020 part of grassland was transferred to cultivated land and bare land and the area transfer from bare land to grassland was significantly larger than that from grassland to bare land fig 4f that is the decreased grassland was mainly transferred to cultivated land similarly the decreased bare land was mainly transferred to grassland and cultivated land meanwhile part of grassland was transferred to bare land during 2000 to 2020 fig 4f 4 2 hydrogeochemical patterns in the study area groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm and decreased from the phreatic aquifer to confined aquifer table 2 and fig 5 shallow groundwater and middle groundwater had ec values ranging from 1261 to 49 400 μs cm and from 786 to 2450 μs cm respectively the deep groundwater had ec values slightly lower than the middle groundwater moreover surface water ec ranged from 516 to 4660 μs cm table 2 for the dina streamflow decreases in ec values during wet season correlated with decreases in δ 18o values fig 5a which could be explained by both rain recharge in the mountain area and by high dilution effect bouimouass et al 2020 both streamflow and groundwater in the luntai oasis were generally weakly alkaline with the ph values ranging between 7 57 and 8 07 did not show a noticeable variation furthermore there was no clear difference in dissolved ions content between deep groundwater in the oasis and in the desert the samples of surface water and groundwater in the luntai oasis showed a wide variation of isotopic contents in time and space the values of δ 2h and δ 18o of surface water ranged from 59 0 to 33 1 and from 9 4 to 4 7 respectively and δ 2h and δ 18o of groundwater ranged from 73 2 to 43 4 and from 11 2 to 4 9 respectively table 2 most streamflow and groundwater samples were scattered above the lmwl in nwc local meteoric water line in northwest china δ 2 h 7 6 δ 18 o 5 1 guo et al 2019 and the gmwl global meteoric water line δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 craig 1961 fig 5b surface water in the study area has higher isotopic values δ 18o 7 6 compared with precipitation in the wulumuqi station δ 18o 10 7 data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation and luntai county δ 18o 9 3 wang et al 2016 while has lower isotopes compare with rain in the luntai county δ 18o 7 0 wang et al 2016 fig 5b this implied that the streamflow mainly originated from precipitation in the study area inferred from regional water samples the regression line of surface water was δ 2 h 4 27 δ 18 o 14 18 r2 0 72 n 41 and displayed a similarity with the regression line of shallow groundwater δ 2 h 4 12 δ 18 o 25 31 r2 0 77 n 22 fig 5b compared to precipitation most streamflow samples exhibited an enrichment trend the slopes of these enrichment trends 4 27 for surface water and 4 12 for shallow groundwater were typical of evaporation process in dry conditions taucare et al 2020 which agreed with the arid and semiarid conditions of central asia li et al 2019a furthermore groundwater samples in the irrigation area had isotopic values similar to the surface water in wet season water from riverbank reservoir canal and irrigation fig 5a in which streamflow and groundwater pumping from confined aquifers were used for agricultural irrigation in the study area wang et al 2022b shallow groundwater was more enriched in the non irrigation area desert than in the irrigation area oasis fig 5a this difference in isotopes signatures can be explained by the fact that the shallow groundwater in desert is slightly or not influenced by the streamflow recharge while its recharge would originate from subsurface inflow from the upstream and or recharge by local extreme rainfall infiltration bouimouass et al 2020 the δ 18o values of middle groundwater were 11 2 to 7 7 which were similar to those of the deep groundwater 9 8 to 8 9 table 2 the middle groundwater isotopic values were lower in the desert area than in the oasis area fig 5a the middle and deep groundwater were relatively depleted and deep groundwater had the most depleted stable isotope values among all the samples table 2 fig 6 showed the spatial distributions of ec and δ 18o in surface water and groundwater across the luntai oasis surface water ec progressively increased from the upstream to the downstream following the same process for δ 18o values fig 6a and d the peaks of ec and δ 18o were observed at the plain reservoir 4660 μs cm for ec and 4 7 for δ 18o furthermore the relations between ec and isotopes with agricultural irrigation were also visible in the variations of groundwater ec and δ 18o values fig 5a the ec values of shallow groundwater were lowest in irrigation areas and highest in non irrigation areas fig 6b due to the recharge from streamflow and irrigation water in the oasis area bouimouass et al 2020 conversely δ 18o values of middle groundwater were lowest in the desert area and highest in the oasis area fig 6f which highlighted the presence of recharge contribution from phreatic water wang et al 2022b overall the δ 18o values of shallow groundwater samples did not exhibit a significant spatial variation and the highest values were observed in the plain reservoir 4 9 fig 6e the middle groundwater ec values were lower in the western part than in the eastern part fig 6c seasonal fluctuations of ec and δ 18o could be observed in the surface water and groundwater especially in the oasis area where the interaction between groundwater and surface water was frequent fig 7 this could be mainly attributed to the coupled effects of water sources evaporation and human activities e g agricultural irrigation and drainage guo et al 2019 shallow groundwater ec in seasonal variation mainly agreed with the local streamflow but with smaller fluctuations than the streamflow fig 7a the intra annual distribution of streamflow showed one peak fig 2b corresponded to the main irrigation time for crops between april and october in the study area indicating greater contribution from surface water in shallow groundwater during the irrigation season the lowest recorded ec values for surface water and shallow groundwater corresponded to the flood water in summer with mean ec of 757 and 13 184 μs cm for surface water and shallow groundwater respectively conversely middle groundwater had higher ec values in the summer mean ec of 1464 μs cm than the spring mean ec of 1098 μs cm and autumn mean ec of 1308 μs cm fig 7a generally stable isotope values of samples were more depleted during the summer mean δ 18o of 8 1 8 5 and 9 3 for surface water shallow groundwater and middle groundwater respectively than the autumn and spring mean δ 18o of 7 7 8 1 and 8 2 for surface water shallow groundwater and middle groundwater respectively fig 7b the depleted values of groundwater δ 18o could be due to recharge with river water and melt water from higher elevation li et al 2019a moreover middle groundwater showed larger fluctuations in stable isotope values than those for surface water and shallow groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 irrigation water quality assessment water in the luntai oasis is mainly used for agricultural irrigation 90 of the runoff diverted into irrigation farmland by irrigation network as the tarim basin is a typical agricultural area where agricultural irrigation depends on river water and groundwater chen et al 2019 thus streamflow and groundwater quality directly impact the sustainable development of oasis agriculture shuai et al 2021 sar value represents the capacity of soil to adsorb sodium from agricultural irrigation water and the possibility of soil sodium hazard posed by irrigation water containing high sodium content davraz and özdemir 2014 li et al 2019b in the study area the calculation results indicated that most of the middle and deep groundwater samples fell within zone c3s1 in the ussl diagram and fell in the zone good to permissible in the wilcox diagram fig 8 indicating that confined water in most areas of the oasis desert is suitable for irrigation table 1 all streamflow samples fell in zones c2s1 and c3s1 in the ussl diagram and fell into the zones excellent to good and good to permissible in the wilcox diagram demonstrating the suitability of streamflow for irrigation however some reservoir water was unsuitable for irrigation due to long term strong evaporation in the plain oasis falling in zone c4s2 in the ussl diagram and in the zones doubtful to unsuitable and unsuitable in the wilcox diagram moreover the shallow groundwater was marginally suitable or unsuitable for irrigation sar 10 na 35 and ec 2250 μs cm for most shallow groundwater samples and the possibility of soil sodium hazard is high overall streamflow and confined water in the study area are generally suitable for agricultural irrigation at present and long term use of the water would not induce soil problems and not affect agricultural production li et al 2019b shuai et al 2021 but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation purpose at present due to intense anthropogenic activities and long term use of such phreatic water would induce soil problems and impact agricultural production su et al 2020 thus with a continuous intensification of anthropogenic activities and extreme climatic events water quality protection should be considered seriously in arid oasis desert regions especially groundwater quality guo at al 2019 wang et al 2021b water quality dissolved ions in the luntai oasis is largely controlled by water rock interactions natural processes and anthropogenic influences taucare et al 2020 that is the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals cation exchange and the use of fertilizers and pesticides were the main sources of ca2 hco3 mg2 so4 2 na no3 and cl shuai et al 2021 now we attempt to define the hydrogeochemical reactions and processes that occur along the flow paths the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been widely used to evaluate the natural mechanisms regulating the hydrogeochemical evolution of surface water and groundwater wang et al 2022b as shown in fig 9 a rock weathering was the dominant mechanism controlling the hydrochemical of streamflow and deep groundwater in the study area conversely shallow groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by rock weathering and evaporation and middle groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by rock weathering and human activities this may be due to the different hydrogeological settings and geological formations where different water samples are located which plays a key role in regulation the transformation and circulation of groundwater singh et al 2017 li et al 2019b furthermore the mg2 ca2 versus mg2 na plot was proposed to determine the hydrochemical process of evaporation and soil salt leaching impacting by human activities zhu et al 2011 in our study most shallow groundwater samples were governed by evaporation while rock interaction was the major force governing the chemistry of surface water middle and deep groundwater fig 9b li et al 2019b in addition mineral dissolution and precipitation is an important and common natural process affecting the major solutes in streamflow and groundwater in our study area which is a process of rock weathering zhu et al 2011 li et al 2018 furthermore cations exchange in groundwater is an important process in the hydrogeochemical evolution wu and sun 2016 in this study most shallow and middle groundwater samples and all deep groundwater samples were plotted in the lower left zone of fig 10 a indicating the exchange between na and k in aquifer material with ca2 and mg2 in groundwater reverse cation exchange expressed as eq 8 li et al 2019b shuai et al 2021 we also applied the bivariate diagram between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 to confirm the occurrence of cation exchange fig 10 if cation exchange occurs in the aquifers the slope of the bivariate diagram is close to 1 mukherjee et al 2009 na k cl represents a decrease or increase in na induced by processes excluding halite dissolution while ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 indicates the decrease or increase in ca2 and mg2 by processes excluding the dissolution precipitation of dolomite calcite and gypsum farid et al 2013 li et al 2016 as shown in fig 10b the slope of middle groundwater was 1 011 suggesting that cation exchange was an important process regulating middle groundwater chemistry in the study area su et al 2020 the slope of middle groundwater in august was 1 055 indicating that cation exchange remained a strong process in the confined aquifer in summer fig 10 h the slope of middle groundwater decreased from 0 895 in april to 1 055 in august fig 10g and h suggesting that the influence of cation exchange on confined groundwater chemistry had enhanced during the period conversely the slope of middle groundwater increased from 1 055 in august to 0 964 in november fig 10 h and i suggesting that the effect of cation exchange on confined water chemistry had weakened during the period su et al 2020 moreover the slope of shallow groundwater in april was 1 088 fig 10d indicating that cation exchange remained a strong process in the phreatic aquifer in spring however the effect of cation exchange on phreatic water chemistry was not significant in summer and august in the study area fig 10e and f in addition agriculture activities in the oasis area may also contribute to the no3 and cl contents in soils and groundwater such as fertilizers containing no3 organochlorine pesticides containing cl and rodenticides biddau et al 2019 climent et al 2019 nitrogen compounds in groundwater in agricultural regions are usually from the use of nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea devic et al 2014 urea is a kind of organic nitrogenous fertilizer and is widely used in the oasis agriculture of the tarim basin during the transformation of organic nitrogen fertilizers some inorganic nitrogen is absorbed by crops while a certain amount of residual inorganic nitrogen retains in soil then migrating and entering phreatic water with the infiltration of irrigation water and or precipitation through aeration zone fan 2018 saha et al 2018 shuai et al 2021 reported that most nh4 was retained in topsoil due to the adsorption of aeration zone in the xinzhou basin north china 5 2 groundwater recharge sources groundwater recharge occurs indirectly via ephemeral runoff infiltration through streambeds irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow from mountains in arid basins bresciani et al 2018 the isotopic content of shallow groundwater indicated that phreatic water would be a mixture of water originating from local infiltration and upstream lateral recharge taucare et al 2020 the significant differences in δ 2h and δ 18o values between shallow groundwater and precipitation indicate that the local precipitation has very weak influence on the phreatic water in the arid oasis desert even if in the flood season guo et al 2019 compared with confined water stable isotopic values of shallow groundwater were closer to those of surface water table 2 this suggested that the contribution from surface water streamflow and irrigation water to shallow groundwater mainly occurred in irrigated areas in such arid oasis desert region due to 90 of the streamflow being diverted into cultivated land through irrigation canal fernald et al 2015 chen et al 2019 this confirm that surface water could infiltrate downward to the aquifers and recharge groundwater as irrigation return flow in the oasis furthermore a deviation of shallow groundwater isotopes was observed with the regional streamflow isotopes fig 5b which probably resulting from the fractioning of phreatic evaporation and the evaporation process during surface water infiltration in the arid oasis region ahmed et al 2022 shallow groundwater showed an enrichment process caused by evaporation fig 5 this could be explained by a rapid transfer of runoff from the mountain to plain for agricultural irrigation and then an infiltration of surface water and rain in the oasis area with influence of strong evaporation yin et al 2022 indeed agricultural irrigation canal network is extensive constructed with a high anti seepage capacity field observation and directly conducts runoff into the irrigated district in the tarim basin wang et al 2021b wang et al 2022a moreover the elevation decreases gradually from the mountain front to the desert area thus results that groundwater of the mountain front could flow into the luntai oasis and recharge the aquifers as lateral groundwater flow due to the high hydraulic gradient and good hydrogeological conditions in the study area fig 1 guo et al 2019 in the desert area groundwater recharge might occur locally by focused indirect recharge through geomorphological structures gullies or fractures this could be explained by the intense evaporation scarce rainfall and dried up river in the non irrigated area desert area chen et al 2019 sun et al 2016 reported that precipitation events of 20 mm had no effect on groundwater recharge in the dunhuang oasis of china due to the dry sand thus rainfall can be completely evaporation before it infiltrates and recharges the local groundwater under such arid conditions guo et al 2019 furthermore most middle groundwater in the irrigation areas had more positive δ 18o value fig 5a which highlighted the presence of recharge contribution from phreatic water due to groundwater overextraction for agricultural irrigation zeng et al 2020 wang et al 2022b therefore the stable isotopic analyses demonstrated the role of agricultural activities irrigation canal groundwater overextraction in the recharge of aquifers bouimouass et al 2020 in addition the isotopic content of some middle groundwater samples in desert area were depleted and similar to the deep groundwater fig 5a and would be considered as not recharged by the phreatic water likely due to no groundwater depression con forming within the confined aquifer in desert wang et al 2022a this would indicate a deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer systems ahmed et al 2022 5 3 influence of agricultural activities on groundwater natural groundwater hydrological systems could be altered by anthropogenic activities especially agricultural activities in arid oasis regions bouimouass et al 2020 gao et al 2022 regrading previous findings now we attempt to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities on groundwater in the oasis desert region in the past 20 years large scale land reclamation has occurred in the tarim basin fig 3 and fig 4 which have modified local groundwater quality and quantity chen et al 2019 monthly fluctuations of groundwater level and hydrochemistry with the phreatic aquifers could be observed in the wells especially in the oasis area d1 well fig 11 reflecting the gradual influence of anthropogenic activities on phreatic water level and composition castellano et al 2019 from the dry season to wet season phreatic water level decreased by 0 5 m midstream oasis area with higher water level fluctuations d1 well to 0 1 m downstream desert area d2 well which attested for a variable seasonal recharge of shallow groundwater over the study area fig 11 wang et al 2022b furthermore the increasing trend in salinity and stable isotope values of shallow groundwater from the oasis to desert could be explained by the influence of surface water dilution and strong evaporation fig 6 and fig 11 wang et al 2021b therefore the midstream oasis region irrigated districts received relatively high volumes of streamflow diverted by agricultural irrigation canals during the growing season both the low flow period with high salinity and stable isotopes and the high flow period with low salinity and stable isotopes thus the irrigation leakage generated more groundwater recharge compared with the recharge from streambed leakage due to the dried up river guo et al 2019 bouimouass et al 2020 wang et al 2022a reported that the primary recharge source of shallow groundwater in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin was the surface water infiltration influenced by agricultural activities however the seasonal variations in δ 18o and ec values and groundwater level depth of the shallow groundwater were very small in the desert area during the study period fig 11b which were quite different from the seasonal variations of those for the oasis groundwater fig 11a this could be explained by that the downstream desert only received flood water and lateral groundwater flow wang et al 2013 agriculture irrigation and groundwater pumping have significantly influenced the groundwater composition and storage in the study area according to the previous description agricultural irrigation system has affected the groundwater recharge in arid oasis areas fig 11 generating extended phreatic water recharge than the desert areas via irrigation water leakage meredith and blais 2019 thus irrigation systems are very central to maintaining agricultural production and community stability in semiarid and arid rural regions fernald et al 2015 ochoa et al 2012 and fernald et al 2015 found that canal seepage and irrigation percolation contributed to groundwater recharge in phreatic aquifers through human adapted irrigation systems diverted runoff to the fields could result in focused groundwater recharge along the irrigation ditches during transport rotiroti et al 2019 this irrigation recharge depends on several factors such as soil properties root water extraction patterns irrigation practices irrigation duration and water volumes and groundwater level depth bethune et al 2008 ochoa et al 2012 bouimouass et al 2020 the find sand in the root soil layer of this study area has relatively large water permeability accelerating the infiltration of irrigation water to recharge groundwater fig 11c simultaneously agricultural irrigation has affected the salinity in soils and phreatic water wang et al 2021a irrigation water infiltration could enhance the water rock interactions promote mineral dissolution and migration and bring the residual pesticides and fertilizers into aquifers thus causing groundwater salinization and pollution liu et al 2018 jia et al 2020 conversely agricultural drainage systems could drain part of the shallow groundwater to the downstream desert area leading to the decreasing of groundwater level and salinity to a certain extent thus impeding the soil and groundwater salinization in the irrigation areas castellano et al 2019 wang et al 2021a reported that the total discharge water amount via agricultural discharge systems was 1 65 108 m3 in 1993 over the weigan irrigation oasis of tarim basin with the total salt content of 6 46 105 t where the total salt output was 425 56 105 t during 1993 to 2015 therefore agricultural irrigation practices play key role in the renewal of groundwater resources in arid oasis desert region bouimouass et al 2020 yin et al 2021 this also demonstrated a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water in the arid oasis irrigated areas in our study region because of agricultural irrigation priority confined water is pumped for irrigation during the growing season due to limited streamflow leading to a decreasing groundwater level and even depression con forming within the aquifers fig 11 zeng et al 2020 the depletion of groundwater resources has been observed in many regions of arid and semiarid areas where agricultural irrigation is primarily dependent on river water and groundwater taylor et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 yin et al 2022 an omnipresent issue was that the downstream desert area would be deprived of surface water used for ecosystem similar to the desert area in our study which received very little river water for groundwater recharge due to the dried up river cody 2018 this issue is expected to escalate with farmland expansion increase agricultural production growing population and economic development alongside the depletion of groundwater resources due to groundwater overexploitation wang et al 2021b such combined pressures were leading to serious conflicts over water resources among agriculture resident and ecology gao et al 2022 moreover the decline of groundwater level caused by groundwater overexploitation seriously threatens the natural desert vegetation in arid regions yao et al 2022 chen et al 2019 found that the natural desert riparian forests in the tarim basin have been degraded seriously in recent decades due to oasis expansion and groundwater pumping for irrigation meanwhile middle groundwater salinity was higher than deep groundwater in the oasis area table 2 indicating that confined water was recharge by phreatic water this could be explained by that the depression con formation in confined aquifer due to overexploitation would cause the phreatic water leakage downward to recharge the confined water and the salt migration into the aquifers by groundwater hydraulic gradient zeng et al 2020 this resulted in the saline water fresh water mixing and groundwater environment deterioration and salinization in arid oases wang et al 2021b in the dina river irrigation district the number of electromechanical wells was 230 in 2008 well depth 100 m and the amount of groundwater extraction markedly increased from 0 29 108 m3 in 2008 to 0 85 108 m3 in 2016 of which the proportion of domestic industrial and agricultural water consumption was 8 10 and 82 respectively wang et al 2022b 5 4 implications for groundwater surface water interaction as presented previously in the text groundwater dynamics in the oasis desert area were altered under the impacts of both natural conditions and agricultural activities but the effect of agricultural activities was more profound in the past 20 years such as farmland expansion groundwater pumping agricultural irrigation and drainage yin et al 2021 wang et al 2021b fig 12 summarizes the variations in groundwater surface water interaction processes under the influence of agricultural activities before and after the rapid agriculture development in the oasis desert system of tarim basin before the agriculture development large scale land reclamation river water was an important source for groundwater recharge both in the oasis and desert of tarim basin and there was a close hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water fig 12a during this period near natural recharge conditions irrigated agriculture traditional flood irrigation had limited influence on the hydrological and hydrochemical processes and groundwater surface water interactions were weak groundwater exploitation intensity was small and groundwater level did not change much in the irrigation districts with a relatively high groundwater level fig 12a overall three groundwater recharge processes occurred in the oasis desert system during this period bouimouass et al 2020 i focused recharge by streamflow seepage along streambed river water recharge which contributed to groundwater recharge within the oasis desert during the flood period and non flood period ii recharge by irrigation water leakage irrigation recharge where the recharge region was expansive due to irrigation canals diverting streamflow from the mountains front to irrigated districts iii recharge by lateral groundwater inflow from the mountain moreover groundwater in the desert area was continuously transported to soil surface to supply the evapotranspiration through the root absorption of deep rooted plant which is closely related to groundwater level dynamic plant growth and climate conditions wu et al 2019 during the rapid agriculture development period after 2000 irrigation water was from the river water transfer and groundwater pumping in the oasis desert region leading to a dried up river groundwater depletion and salinization fig 12b wang et al 2021b this has reshaped the soil moisture and groundwater patterns in the oasis and notably altered the groundwater dynamics and water balance han et al 2017 during this period water saving irrigation dominated there is a strong and frequent interaction between groundwater and surface water in the study area groundwater was largely recharged by vertical irrigation water infiltration and lateral groundwater inflow and accompanied by continuous excessive groundwater pumping due to a farmland expansion fig 12b however the increased groundwater recharge via irrigation water leakage could not counteract the negative effect of groundwater overexploitation in the study area thus resulting in a continuous decline of groundwater level even leading to a disconnection of surface water and groundwater systems in the downstream desert area gleeson et al 2012 chen at el 2019 stream recharge was significantly reduced by the high streamflow diversion for irrigation and the amount of irrigation water infiltration reduced significantly from tradition flood irrigation to water saving irrigation which reduced water discharge from the midstream oasis to downstream desert soil moisture content in the desert vadose zone also changed to some extent due to soil temperature gradient and groundwater level fluctuation du et al 2017 furthermore a thickening aeration zone could reduce groundwater recharge by increasing both the aeration zone water storage and the time lag between soil water percolation and groundwater recharge which may increase as continuous groundwater table decline owing to groundwater pumping cao et al 2016 han et al 2017 yin et al 2021 moreover the infiltration pattern of soil moisture altered under water saving irrigation and the rate of groundwater use may exceed its replenishment rate in the arid oasis desert area thus gradually leading to groundwater storage depletion zheng et al 2019 meanwhile during the rapid agriculture development period the total evapotranspiration in the oasis during the growth season increased remarkably with the irrigated agriculture development owing to continuous irrigation however compared with flood irrigation water saving irrigation reduced evapotranspiration significantly in the cultivated land fig 12b zhang et al 2014b this could be explained by the fact that flood irrigation tends to maintain higher soil moisture content than water saving irrigation within the root zone vico and porporato 2010 phreatic evaporation also reduces significantly in the desert due to the sharp decline of groundwater level river water evaporates for a short time before leakage into groundwater thanks to the irrigation canals in addition agricultural irrigation canal system in the oasis has been continuously improved to enhance water use efficiency and reduce seepage losses during river water diversion and the implementation of water saving irrigation in the oasis increased the upper 60 cm depth soil moisture li et al 2016b causing groundwater level rise and soil salinization during the growing season han et al 2017 furthermore part of soil salt and residual pesticides and fertilizers could be transported downward into groundwater via the infiltration water and together with the increase of groundwater salinity caused by intense evaporation in the desert fig 12b this leads to groundwater quality changes e g salinization and even confined water environmental deterioration which seriously threatens desert vegetation mechanisms affecting the above water quality dynamics include the dilution of river water dissolution and leaching of soil salts by infiltration water water rock interaction mixing and evaporative crystallization su et al 2020 marked increasing of salts fertilizers and pesticides in the aeration zone was observed in arid irrigated regions which had partly reached phreatic water and even into confined water mcmahon et al 2006 howden et al 2011 this could be explained by the forming of groundwater depression cone in the confined aquifers due to long term groundwater overexploitation leading to phreatic water leakage downward into confined water that indicates a close hydraulic relationship between phreatic water and confined water yin et al 2021 therefore agricultural drainage systems were built in the oasis to drain salt and reduce groundwater level to some extent obviously the gradual deterioration of local groundwater regimes quantity and quality was the result of excessive large scale land reclamation and groundwater overexploitation associated with irrigation agricultural development in the oasis desert system yin et al 2021 this has caused severe environmental and socioeconomic consequences such as soil degradation deterioration of phreatic water quality and death of native vegetation han et al 2017 in order to manage the degraded groundwater systems and avoid further deterioration decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation amount improving water saving efficiency and carrying out gradual ecological restoration would be the only viable method to restore groundwater level quality and maintain the oasis desert ecosystem coexistence thus ensuring groundwater sustainable utilization and water security in the context of climate change gao et al 2022 liu et al 2022 specifically we propound the following recommendations for sustainable groundwater management in arid regions i the reginal groundwater pumping threshold and critical groundwater level should be determined and groundwater extraction should be reduced to restore the groundwater level groundwater exploitation intensity in the tarim basin has been continuously increased since 2000 due to local policy guidance resulting in regional groundwater level decline and water quality deterioration chen et al 2019 the increased irrigation return flow would primarily enhance the aeration zone water storage rather than groundwater recharge due to the thick aeration zone which prevents any meaningful groundwater level recovery cao et al 2016 ii optimum planting schedules and irrigation schemes water saving irrigation should be explored and implemented to improve agricultural water saving efficiency and achieve highly efficient development of agricultural irrigation in the water limited arid region yin et al 2021 iii agricultural drainage system should be further improvement to enhance the discharge amount of saline groundwater and decrease phreatic water level and salinity in the early 21th century agricultural drainage canal system was constructed and deployed in the oasis region of tarim basin to discharge saline phreatic water through drains and trenches but the current drainage system is not perfect wang et al 2021b iv the area of cultivated land should be restricted and rational allocation of surface water and groundwater resources should be implemented to ensure the water demand of downstream desert vegetation thus gradually restoring ecological systems and enhancing the carbon sequestration of ecological forests liu et al 2022 in recent 20 years the area of oasis desert ecotone in the tarim basin has decreased significantly due to large scale wasteland reclamation and more water was used by agriculture rather than ecological systems chen et al 2019 v the potential effect of climate variability on local hydrological regimes streamflow and groundwater should be evaluated to address the agricultural risks posed by climate change e g snowmelt climate shift from warm dry to warm humid qin et al 2020 the increase of cultivated land area in the tarim basin is closely related to the increasing streamflow and groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 6 conclusions in this study the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction under the influence of agricultural activities in an oasis desert region were examined using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 samples collected in the luntai oasis of tarim basin based on a comparison of the spatiotemporal hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigation areas and desert non irrigation areas the irrigation water quality was assessed through hydrochemical methods and groundwater recharge sources in the oasis and desert areas were identified subsequently the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality were evaluated and then the interaction between groundwater and surface water was analyzed the following conclusions could be drawn i annual mean ndvi increased with time 0 009 per decade during 2000 to 2020 the area of cultivated land increased by 121 8 732 4 km2 during the period which was mainly transferred from grassland and bare land especially from grassland ii groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm and decreased from the phreatic aquifer to confined aquifer with weakly alkaline the river water had a low ec whereas the shallow groundwater had a much higher ec the ec values of shallow groundwater were low in irrigation areas and high in non irrigation areas shallow groundwater was more enriched in the non irrigation area than in the irrigation area conversely the middle groundwater isotopic values were lower in the desert area than in the oasis area the ec values of river water and shallow groundwater were lower in summer middle groundwater had higher ec in summer than that in spring and autumn stable isotope values of water were more depleted during the summer than the autumn and spring iii streamflow and confined water in the study area are generally suitable for agricultural irrigation at present but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation purpose at present groundwater chemistry in the oasis desert was mainly controlled by strong evaporation dilution mixing water rock interaction and agricultural drainage groundwater recharge in the irrigation areas occurred indirectly via ephemeral runoff seepage irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow from mountains whereas the downstream desert only received flood water and lateral groundwater flow indicating a deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer systems iv long term development of irrigation agriculture large scale land reclamation groundwater pumping agricultural irrigation and drainage has caused groundwater level decline and salinization demonstrating a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water in arid oasis irrigated areas a simple conceptual diagram was drawn to depict the variations in groundwater surface water interaction processes associated with the rapid agriculture development impact in the oasis desert system of tarim basin hence in the sustainable groundwater resource management of arid irrigation districts attentions should be paid to both the groundwater quantity and quality salts decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation carrying out gradual ecological restoration improving water saving efficiency and agricultural drainage system would be the only viable method to restore groundwater level quality and maintain the oasis desert ecosystem coexistence in the

2393,a comprehensive understanding of groundwater dynamics and its interaction with surface water under the influence of agricultural activities is essential for local agriculture ecology and resident in arid regions which is poorly understood in arid oasis desert region in our study with emphasis on a comparison of hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigated and desert non irrigated areas the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction of a typical oasis desert system with a rapid irrigation agriculture development were examined to clarify the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 water samples results showed that cultivated land area increased by 121 8 732 4 km2 during 2000 to 2020 mainly transferring from grassland and bare land groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm with weakly alkaline shallow groundwater had a much higher ec than other water components stable isotopic and ec values of shallow groundwater in the non irrigation areas were much greater than those in the irrigation areas whereas middle groundwater isotopic values were more depleted in the desert than in the oasis shallow groundwater ec value was lower in summer middle groundwater had higher ec in summer streamflow and confined water in the study area are suitable for agricultural irrigation but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation at present the groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by strong evaporation dilution mixing water rock interaction and agricultural drainage groundwater in the irrigation areas was recharged by ephemeral runoff seepage irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow long term development of irrigation agriculture large scale land reclamation irrigation and groundwater pumping in arid region has caused groundwater level decline and salinization with a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water hence decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation carrying out gradual ecological restoration improving water saving efficiency and agricultural drainage system

the largest liquid freshwater resource in the world and is essential to daily life agriculture industry and ecosystems particularly in arid environments due to low precipitation limited river water and high evapotranspiration bouimouass et al 2020 jha et al 2020 zhu and zhang 2022 except for climatic factors anthropogenic interventions also have an important effect on the availability and quality of groundwater such as population growth land cover changes river water diversion groundwater overexploitation and pollution omar et al 2021 ahmed et al 2022 in recent 30 years groundwater storage has been decreasing year by year in many regions around the world due to the increased intensity of irrigation mainly from groundwater pumping castellano et al 2019 jia et al 2020 liu et al 2022 irrigated agriculture development cultivated area expansion is crucial to feed the growing population in arid regions however it not only alters the natural water cycle condition in irrigated districts but also introduce chemical substances into the aquifer systems to promote mixing evaporation and hydrochemical reactions zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2022 globally 20 of the irrigation area is now facing groundwater quality deterioration mao et al 2020 and the increased groundwater recharge by irrigation return flow would not completely counteract the negative effect of groundwater overexploitation in some agricultural regions gleeson et al 2012 han et al 2017 this has led to a series of ecological and environment problems such as groundwater level decline and quality deterioration disappearance of surface water bodies and land subsidence posing threats to global water security human health agricultural production safety and regional sustainable development rezaie balf et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 thus it not only causes ecological environment deterioration and water resources shortage but also brings enormous economic losses for agriculture and industry dependence on groundwater van lanen et al 2013 esmaeilbeiki et al 2020 therefore in order to sustainably manage groundwater in arid region it is crucial to understand the impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater quality and quantity and clarify the surface water groundwater conversion mechanism under the natural economic composite system liu et al 2022 the tarim river basin is the largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwest china and is currently suffering from marked human interventions that impact regional groundwater resources such as large scale land reclamation rapid irrigated agriculture development and growing population in the past 20 years chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 agriculture plays an important role in the socioeconomic development which is heavily dependent on irrigation in this region zhang et al 2015 agricultural water consumption has strongly occupied the ecological water resulting the continuous decline of groundwater level in desert areas and serious degradation of desert vegetation especially desert riparian forests wang et al 2021b thus the availability and variability of groundwater resources are crucial to the reginal ecological environment conservation and socio economy sustainability zhang et al 2014a the luntai oasis is a typical oasis desert of the tarim basin where farmland expansion and streamflow diversion for unreasonable irrigation have caused groundwater level rise in the irrigation districts then led to serious secondary salinization of cultivated land threatening the sustainable development of regional agriculture and economy tunsagul et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 in recent years the water saving irrigation has been widespread in the tarim basin especially mulched drip irrigation chen et al 2019 moreover the consumption of chemical fertilizer and groundwater over exploitation due to irrigated agriculture development have increased dramatically within the tarim basin which are reshaping the hydrological regimes and exacerbating the eco environmental problems wang et al 2022b yin et al 2022 there is an urgent need to scientifically understand the groundwater quality regime and its interaction transformation mechanism with surface water so as to provide theoretical foundation for the comprehensive groundwater management and regional water security protection in the tarim basin groundwater hydrochemistry and its evolution mechanisms are critical to understand groundwater recharge and clarify groundwater surface water interaction chen et al 2020 jia et al 2020 based on stable isotope technology geochemical analyses hydrogeochemical modeling remote sensing and traditional field observations e g geochemical geophysical and hydrogeological measurements previous studies in arid region mainly focused on the groundwater quality salinity storage age recharge discharge rates and mechanisms hydrogeochemical evolution hydraulic connections and their responses to natural and anthropogenic factors e g climate variability land cover change water transfer groundwater extraction niyazi et al 2019 sultan et al 2019 su et al 2020 omar et al 2021 yin et al 2021 ahmed et al 2022 singh 2022 generally groundwater hydrochemical components in arid region could be mainly controlled by evaporation atmospheric precipitation flushing and mixing water rock interactions and the irrigation water quality with the influences of natural conditions and human activities e g agricultural irrigation climatic and hydrogeologic conditions extreme climate events pant et al 2018 cao et al 2020 gao et al 2022 the results of global hydrological modeling showed that during 2001 to 2010 the groundwater over extraction exceeded 20 mm a caused by human activities while it was lower 10 mm a caused by climate change liu et al 2022 gao et al 2022 reported that long term irrigation caused the salt imbalance and groundwater salinization and groundwater salinity in irrigated districts increased by 3 83 times therefore both the water quantity balance and salts balance of groundwater should be focused in groundwater management of irrigation areas however understanding the impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater systems could be challenging due to the imperfect groundwater monitoring networks lack of publicly available data and limited knowledge of groundwater process liu et al 2022 yet the differences in groundwater hydrochemistry between irrigated and non irrigated areas and the impacts of long term irrigation on water quality and groundwater surface water interaction are not well understood in arid region particularly in arid oasis desert region of tarim basin geochemical analyses could provide direct indicators of hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality using the chemical compositions of water samples ahmed et al 2022 gao et al 2022 commonly used environmental tracers are major ions and stable water isotopes bouimouass et al 2020 major ions e g chloride could indicate the geochemical evolution and hydraulic connections of groundwater and the mixing process between various groundwater recharge sources because the changes in groundwater flow pathway and recharge rates could lead to noticeable differences in the composition of major ions chenini et al 2010 li et al 2019b stable water isotopes δ 2h and δ 18o serve as ideal tracers for identifying recharge sources and exploring water circulation precipitation surface water and groundwater which are influenced by geographical factors and meteorological conditions zeng et al 2020 ahmed et al 2022 it has been widely applied in groundwater research such as analyzing groundwater recharge and discharge flow and interconnection between the aquifers groundwater surface water connections evaporative effects groundwater mixing fate and transports of pollutants de bondt et al 2018 li et al 2019a they are very crucial for improving groundwater resource management in arid region the luntai oasis was selected as the study area to evaluate groundwater quality and its interaction with surface water in this study we analyzed the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction under the influence of agricultural activities over the luntai oasis using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 water samples the main objectives of our study were i to analyze climate and land use variations in the oasis desert ii to compare the spatiotemporal hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigated and desert non irrigated areas iii to assess irrigation water quality iv to identify groundwater recharge sources and its interaction with surface water and v to clarify the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality with a rapid irrigation agriculture development the results would be helpful for further understanding of groundwater hydrological process in the irrigated oasis desert of arid regions and useful for sustainable groundwater resource management and oasis desert ecosystem maintenance in the context of climate change 2 study area the luntai oasis covers approximately 7 76 103 km2 83 88 85 39 e 41 32 42 14 n located in the middle and lower reaches of the dina river basin lying to the southern foot of tianshan mountains and on the northern edge of tarim basin xinjiang province of china fig 1 a it has an altitude ranging from 868 to 2243 m above sea level from the south to north according to the geomorphologic landscape characteristic the central and western oases and the northern eastern and southern deserts in luntai oasis constitutes an oasis desert ecosystem fig 1a the dina river basin is composed of the dina river yeyungou river cedaya river and yangxia river which originated in the southern tianshan mountains the annual runoff into the oasis is 5 244 108 m3 and the flood season is from may to september accounting for 89 1 of the total fig 2 b in the last 20 years with the increase of agriculture water demand more than 90 of the runoff is diverted into cultivated land for irrigation causing the dried up river and decreased groundwater level within the luntai oasis chen et al 2019 the luntai oasis is characterized by a typical temperate arid continental climate and the average annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation are 11 2 65 4 mm and 1766 2450 mm tunsagul et al 2010 respectively with strong seasonal dynamics fig 2a precipitation exhibits an uneven seasonal distribution in the oasis and more than 70 of the total precipitation occurs from may to september with the peak precipitation in june the seasonal distribution of runoff is closely related to precipitation in the oasis fig 2 the runoff begins to increase significantly with the obvious increase of rain in the wet season from april to september while the runoff decreases sharply in the dry season this indicates that precipitation is the dominant recharge source of runoff and the meltwater also plays an important role in runoff wang et al 2022b in the oasis the main soils are rock soil brown desert soil irrigation silt soil swamp soil and aeolian sand soil with the ph of 7 5 adil et al 2014 the top 10 cm soil layer has the largest salinity within the oasis and soil salinization is serious directly affecting local agricultural and ecological development the luntai oasis is a plain oasis extending along the rivers with relatively flat terrain the quaternary sediments vary gradually from proluvial sediment to alluvial sediment from the north to south fig 1b controlling the spatial distribution patterns of aquifer systems wang et al 2022b the northern part of the luntai oasis is proluvial sediment with a thickness of 50 m deep groundwater level while the southern part is alluvial sediment with a thickness of 40 60 m shallow groundwater level moreover fine sandstone pebbly gravel silty fine sandstone and pebbly sandstone are alternately deposited in the vertical layers forming porous aquifers and aquitards fig 1b and c the structure of aquifers in the oasis exhibits a clear zonation in the horizontal direction and stratification in the vertical direction the aquifer thickness gradually increases from the north to south and the thickness of the second to fifth aquifer at the b borehole in fig 1d is 83 34 142 16 78 43 and 95 10 m respectively wang et al 2022b furthermore the dominated natural plants are some xeromorphic and halophytic species reliance on groundwater including halostachys capsica tamarix spp and phragmites communis fig 1d and e zhang et al 2020 the luntai oasis is dominated by agriculture and the main crops are wheat and cotton in the oasis the forest and fruit industry is an important part of the regional economy and the main artificial economic forests are apricot pear walnut and red date trees which are grown with irrigation by surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2020 in 2020 the bare land grassland cultivated land artificial surface wetland water bodies and forest areas accounted for 62 85 18 84 17 18 0 62 0 25 0 23 and 0 02 respectively of the total area of the luntai oasis 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection surface water and groundwater were collected during three field sampling campaigns between april and november in 2019 within the luntai oasis covering spring april summer august and autumn november a total of 83 samples were collected from streamflow reservoirs and wells including 29 surface water samples 22 shallow groundwater samples 28 middle groundwater samples and 4 deep groundwater samples the locations of water sampling sites were recorded using a gps device and plotted in fig 1a surface water was sampled from the reservoirs and main streams and their tributaries dina river yeyungou river cedaya river and yangxia river in addition groundwater samples were taken from pumped wells irrigation domestic and industrial wells and long

luntai oasis during 2000 to 2020 the annual precipitation and air temperature exhibited a decreasing trend with a rate of about 1 5 mm 10a and 0 3 10a from 2000 to 2020 respectively while annual mean ndvi had an increasing trend with a rate of about 0 009 10a over the period moreover the variation trends and amplitudes of these factors exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 3 as shown in fig 3c the ndvi in 12 1 of the study area showed a decreasing trend mainly distributed on the edge of oasis primarily grassland indicating that the vegetation in the desert oasis transition zone has been degraded obviously chen et al 2019 contrarily the ndvi in 61 5 of the study area increased with a rate of 0 0 001 a mainly distributed in desert area primarily bare land indicating that vegetation change in desert area was not obvious the increase rate of ndvi in 26 4 of the luntai oasis was 0 001 a mainly distributed in oasis area primarily cultivated land indicating that farmland expansion in the oasis has significantly improved vegetation greenness yao et al 2022 furthermore air temperature in the whole luntai oasis showed a decreasing trend in the past 20 years with the smallest decrease in the southeastern part and the largest decrease in the northern part fig 3a precipitation in the northeastern part of the study area showed an increasing trend with a small rate while precipitation in the rest of the region exhibited a slight decreasing trend fig 3b the spatial distributions of lulc in the luntain oasis for 2000 2010 and 2020 were prepared fig 4 a c as shown in fig 4 cultivated land and grassland were mainly distributed in the southwest and middle of the oasis the oasis region while bare land was mainly in the north middle and southeast the desert region furthermore fig 4 exhibited the area coverage of various land use types in the luntai oasis during 2000 to 2020 clearly bare land was the dominant land cover type over the last 20 years fig 4d f

cultivated land and forest continuously increased as time goes on while the area of bare land and grassland gradually decreased fig 4 compared to other land cover types the area coverage of cultivated land grassland and bare land varied significantly during 2000 to 2020 over the period the largest area change was occurred in cultivated land increasing by 121 8 732 4 km2 between 2000 and 2020 and by 103 5 678 4 km2 between 2010 and 2020 conversely bare land and grassland area decreased markedly between 2000 and 2020 by 8 8 472 9 km2 and 17 2 303 1 km2 respectively it is obvious that the area transfer of cultivated land to other land cover types was few over the past 20 years and the increased cultivated land was mainly transferred from grassland and bare land especially from grassland fig 4d f in contrast during 2000 to 2020 part of grassland was transferred to cultivated land and bare land and the area transfer from bare land to grassland was significantly larger than that from grassland to bare land fig 4f that is the decreased grassland was mainly transferred to cultivated land similarly the decreased bare land was mainly transferred to grassland and cultivated land meanwhile part of grassland was transferred to bare land during 2000 to 2020 fig 4f 4 2 hydrogeochemical patterns in the study area groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm and decreased from the phreatic aquifer to confined aquifer table 2 and fig 5 shallow groundwater and middle groundwater had ec values ranging from 1261 to 49 400 μs cm and from 786 to 2450 μs cm respectively the deep groundwater had ec values slightly lower than the middle groundwater moreover surface water ec ranged from 516 to 4660 μs cm table 2 for the dina streamflow decreases in ec values during wet season correlated with decreases in δ 18o values fig 5a which could be explained by both rain recharge in the mountain area and by high dilution effect bouimouass et al 2020 both streamflow and groundwater in the luntai oasis were generally weakly alkaline with the ph values ranging between 7 57 and 8 07 did not show a noticeable variation furthermore there was no clear difference in dissolved ions content between deep groundwater in the oasis and in the desert the samples of surface water and groundwater in the luntai oasis showed a wide variation of isotopic contents in time and space the values of δ 2h and δ 18o of surface water ranged from 59 0 to 33 1 and from 9 4 to 4 7 respectively and δ 2h and δ 18o of groundwater ranged from 73 2 to 43 4 and from 11 2 to 4 9 respectively table 2 most streamflow and groundwater samples were scattered above the lmwl in nwc local meteoric water line in northwest china δ 2 h 7 6 δ 18 o 5 1 guo et al 2019 and the gmwl global meteoric water line δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 craig 1961 fig 5b surface water in the study area has higher isotopic values δ 18o 7 6 compared with precipitation in the wulumuqi station δ 18o 10 7 data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation and luntai county δ 18o 9 3 wang et al 2016 while has lower isotopes compare with rain in the luntai county δ 18o 7 0 wang et al 2016 fig 5b this implied that the streamflow mainly originated from precipitation in the study area inferred from regional water samples the regression line of surface water was δ 2 h 4 27 δ 18 o 14 18 r2 0 72 n 41 and displayed a similarity with the regression line of shallow groundwater δ 2 h 4 12 δ 18 o 25 31 r2 0 77 n 22 fig 5b compared to precipitation most streamflow samples exhibited an enrichment trend the slopes of these enrichment trends 4 27 for surface water and 4 12 for shallow groundwater were typical of evaporation process in dry conditions taucare et al 2020 which agreed with the arid and semiarid conditions of central asia li et al 2019a furthermore groundwater samples in the irrigation area had isotopic values similar to the surface water in wet season water from riverbank reservoir canal and irrigation fig 5a in which streamflow and groundwater pumping from confined aquifers were used for agricultural irrigation in the study area wang et al 2022b shallow groundwater was more enriched in the non irrigation area desert than in the irrigation area oasis fig 5a this difference in isotopes signatures can be explained by the fact that the shallow groundwater in desert is slightly or not influenced by the streamflow recharge while its recharge would originate from subsurface inflow from the upstream and or recharge by local extreme rainfall infiltration bouimouass et al 2020 the δ 18o values of middle groundwater were 11 2 to 7 7 which were similar to those of the deep groundwater 9 8 to 8 9 table 2 the middle groundwater isotopic values were lower in the desert area than in the oasis area fig 5a the middle and deep groundwater were relatively depleted and deep groundwater had the most depleted stable isotope values among all the samples table 2 fig 6 showed the spatial distributions of ec and δ 18o in surface water and groundwater across the luntai oasis surface water ec progressively increased from the upstream to the downstream following the same process for δ 18o values fig 6a and d the peaks of ec and δ 18o were observed at the plain reservoir 4660 μs cm for ec and 4 7 for δ 18o furthermore the relations between ec and isotopes with agricultural irrigation were also visible in the variations of groundwater ec and δ 18o values fig 5a the ec values of shallow groundwater were lowest in irrigation areas and highest in non irrigation areas fig 6b due to the recharge from streamflow and irrigation water in the oasis area bouimouass et al 2020 conversely δ 18o values of middle groundwater were lowest in the desert area and highest in the oasis area fig 6f which highlighted the presence of recharge contribution from phreatic water wang et al 2022b overall the δ 18o values of shallow groundwater samples did not exhibit a significant spatial variation and the highest values were observed in the plain reservoir 4 9 fig 6e the middle groundwater ec values were lower in the western part than in the eastern part fig 6c seasonal fluctuations of ec and δ 18o could be observed in the surface water and groundwater especially in the oasis area where the interaction between groundwater and surface water was frequent fig 7 this could be mainly attributed to the coupled effects of water sources evaporation and human activities e g agricultural irrigation and drainage guo et al 2019 shallow groundwater ec in seasonal variation mainly agreed with the local streamflow but with smaller fluctuations than the streamflow fig 7a the intra annual distribution of streamflow showed one peak fig 2b corresponded to the main irrigation time for crops between april and october in the study area indicating greater contribution from surface water in shallow groundwater during the irrigation season the lowest recorded ec values for surface water and shallow groundwater corresponded to the flood water in summer with mean ec of 757 and 13 184 μs cm for surface water and shallow groundwater respectively conversely middle groundwater had higher ec values in the summer mean ec of 1464 μs cm than the spring mean ec of 1098 μs cm and autumn mean ec of 1308 μs cm fig 7a generally stable isotope values of samples were more depleted during the summer mean δ 18o of 8 1 8 5 and 9 3 for surface water shallow groundwater and middle groundwater respectively than the autumn and spring mean δ 18o of 7 7 8 1 and 8 2 for surface water shallow groundwater and middle groundwater respectively fig 7b the depleted values of groundwater δ 18o could be due to recharge with river water and melt water from higher elevation li et al 2019a moreover middle groundwater showed larger fluctuations in stable isotope values than those for surface water and shallow groundwater 5 discussion 5 1 irrigation water quality assessment water in the luntai oasis is mainly used for agricultural irrigation 90 of the runoff diverted into irrigation farmland by irrigation network as the tarim basin is a typical agricultural area where agricultural irrigation depends on river water and groundwater chen et al 2019 thus streamflow and groundwater quality directly impact the sustainable development of oasis agriculture shuai et al 2021 sar value represents the capacity of soil to adsorb sodium from agricultural irrigation water and the possibility of soil sodium hazard posed by irrigation water containing high sodium content davraz and özdemir 2014 li et al 2019b in the study area the calculation results indicated that most of the middle and deep groundwater samples fell within zone c3s1 in the ussl diagram and fell in the zone good to permissible in the wilcox diagram fig 8 indicating that confined water in most areas of the oasis desert is suitable for irrigation table 1 all streamflow samples fell in zones c2s1 and c3s1 in the ussl diagram and fell into the zones excellent to good and good to permissible in the wilcox diagram demonstrating the suitability of streamflow for irrigation however some reservoir water was unsuitable for irrigation due to long term strong evaporation in the plain oasis falling in zone c4s2 in the ussl diagram and in the zones doubtful to unsuitable and unsuitable in the wilcox diagram moreover the shallow groundwater was marginally suitable or unsuitable for irrigation sar 10 na 35 and ec 2250 μs cm for most shallow groundwater samples and the possibility of soil sodium hazard is high overall streamflow and confined water in the study area are generally suitable for agricultural irrigation at present and long term use of the water would not induce soil problems and not affect agricultural production li et al 2019b shuai et al 2021 but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation purpose at present due to intense anthropogenic activities and long term use of such phreatic water would induce soil problems and impact agricultural production su et al 2020 thus with a continuous intensification of anthropogenic activities and extreme climatic events water quality protection should be considered seriously in arid oasis desert regions especially groundwater quality guo at al 2019 wang et al 2021b water quality dissolved ions in the luntai oasis is largely controlled by water rock interactions natural processes and anthropogenic influences taucare et al 2020 that is the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals cation exchange and the use of fertilizers and pesticides were the main sources of ca2 hco3 mg2 so4 2 na no3 and cl shuai et al 2021 now we attempt to define the hydrogeochemical reactions and processes that occur along the flow paths the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been widely used to evaluate the natural mechanisms regulating the hydrogeochemical evolution of surface water and groundwater wang et al 2022b as shown in fig 9 a rock weathering was the dominant mechanism controlling the hydrochemical of streamflow and deep groundwater in the study area conversely shallow groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by rock weathering and evaporation and middle groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by rock weathering and human activities this may be due to the different hydrogeological settings and geological formations where different water samples are located which plays a key role in regulation the transformation and circulation of groundwater singh et al 2017 li et al 2019b furthermore the mg2 ca2 versus mg2 na plot was proposed to determine the hydrochemical process of evaporation and soil salt leaching impacting by human activities zhu et al 2011 in our study most shallow groundwater samples were governed by evaporation while rock interaction was the major force governing the chemistry of surface water middle and deep groundwater fig 9b li et al 2019b in addition mineral dissolution and precipitation is an important and common natural process affecting the major solutes in streamflow and groundwater in our study area which is a process of rock weathering zhu et al 2011 li et al 2018 furthermore cations exchange in groundwater is an important process in the hydrogeochemical evolution wu and sun 2016 in this study most shallow and middle groundwater samples and all deep groundwater samples were plotted in the lower left zone of fig 10 a indicating the exchange between na and k in aquifer material with ca2 and mg2 in groundwater reverse cation exchange expressed as eq 8 li et al 2019b shuai et al 2021 we also applied the bivariate diagram between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 to confirm the occurrence of cation exchange fig 10 if cation exchange occurs in the aquifers the slope of the bivariate diagram is close to 1 mukherjee et al 2009 na k cl represents a decrease or increase in na induced by processes excluding halite dissolution while ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 indicates the decrease or increase in ca2 and mg2 by processes excluding the dissolution precipitation of dolomite calcite and gypsum farid et al 2013 li et al 2016 as shown in fig 10b the slope of middle groundwater was 1 011 suggesting that cation exchange was an important process regulating middle groundwater chemistry in the study area su et al 2020 the slope of middle groundwater in august was 1 055 indicating that cation exchange remained a strong process in the confined aquifer in summer fig 10 h the slope of middle groundwater decreased from 0 895 in april to 1 055 in august fig 10g and h suggesting that the influence of cation exchange on confined groundwater chemistry had enhanced during the period conversely the slope of middle groundwater increased from 1 055 in august to 0 964 in november fig 10 h and i suggesting that the effect of cation exchange on confined water chemistry had weakened during the period su et al 2020 moreover the slope of shallow groundwater in april was 1 088 fig 10d indicating that cation exchange remained a strong process in the phreatic aquifer in spring however the effect of cation exchange on phreatic water chemistry was not significant in summer and august in the study area fig 10e and f in addition agriculture activities in the oasis area may also contribute to the no3 and cl contents in soils and groundwater such as fertilizers containing no3 organochlorine pesticides containing cl and rodenticides biddau et al 2019 climent et al 2019 nitrogen compounds in groundwater in agricultural regions are usually from the use of nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea devic et al 2014 urea is a kind of organic nitrogenous fertilizer and is widely used in the oasis agriculture of the tarim basin during the transformation of organic nitrogen fertilizers some inorganic nitrogen is absorbed by crops while a certain amount of residual inorganic nitrogen retains in soil then migrating and entering phreatic water with the infiltration of irrigation water and or precipitation through aeration zone fan 2018 saha et al 2018 shuai et al 2021 reported that most nh4 was retained in topsoil due to the adsorption of aeration zone in the xinzhou basin north china 5 2 groundwater recharge sources groundwater recharge occurs indirectly via ephemeral runoff infiltration through streambeds irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow from mountains in arid basins bresciani et al 2018 the isotopic content of shallow groundwater indicated that phreatic water would be a mixture of water originating from local infiltration and upstream lateral recharge taucare et al 2020 the significant differences in δ 2h and δ 18o values between shallow groundwater and precipitation indicate that the local precipitation has very weak influence on the phreatic water in the arid oasis desert even if in the flood season guo et al 2019 compared with confined water stable isotopic values of shallow groundwater were closer to those of surface water table 2 this suggested that the contribution from surface water streamflow and irrigation water to shallow groundwater mainly occurred in irrigated areas in such arid oasis desert region due to 90 of the streamflow being diverted into cultivated land through irrigation canal fernald et al 2015 chen et al 2019 this confirm that surface water could infiltrate downward to the aquifers and recharge groundwater as irrigation return flow in the oasis furthermore a deviation of shallow groundwater isotopes was observed with the regional streamflow isotopes fig 5b which probably resulting from the fractioning of phreatic evaporation and the evaporation process during surface water infiltration in the arid oasis region ahmed et al 2022 shallow groundwater showed an enrichment process caused by evaporation fig 5 this could be explained by a rapid transfer of runoff from the mountain to plain for agricultural irrigation and then an infiltration of surface water and rain in the oasis area with influence of strong evaporation yin et al 2022 indeed agricultural irrigation canal network is extensive constructed with a high anti seepage capacity field observation and directly conducts runoff into the irrigated district in the tarim basin wang et al 2021b wang et al 2022a moreover the elevation decreases gradually from the mountain front to the desert area thus results that groundwater of the mountain front could flow into the luntai oasis and recharge the aquifers as lateral groundwater flow due to the high hydraulic gradient and good hydrogeological conditions in the study area fig 1 guo et al 2019 in the desert area groundwater recharge might occur locally by focused indirect recharge through geomorphological structures gullies or fractures this could be explained by the intense evaporation scarce rainfall and dried up river in the non irrigated area desert area chen et al 2019 sun et al 2016 reported that precipitation events of 20 mm had no effect on groundwater recharge in the dunhuang oasis of china due to the dry sand thus rainfall can be completely evaporation before it infiltrates and recharges the local groundwater under such arid conditions guo et al 2019 furthermore most middle groundwater in the irrigation areas had more positive δ 18o value fig 5a which highlighted the presence of recharge contribution from phreatic water due to groundwater overextraction for agricultural irrigation zeng et al 2020 wang et al 2022b therefore the stable isotopic analyses demonstrated the role of agricultural activities irrigation canal groundwater overextraction in the recharge of aquifers bouimouass et al 2020 in addition the isotopic content of some middle groundwater samples in desert area were depleted and similar to the deep groundwater fig 5a and would be considered as not recharged by the phreatic water likely due to no groundwater depression con forming within the confined aquifer in desert wang et al 2022a this would indicate a deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer systems ahmed et al 2022 5 3 influence of agricultural activities on groundwater natural groundwater hydrological systems could be altered by anthropogenic activities especially agricultural activities in arid oasis regions bouimouass et al 2020 gao et al 2022 regrading previous findings now we attempt to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities on groundwater in the oasis desert region in the past 20 years large scale land reclamation has occurred in the tarim basin fig 3 and fig 4 which have modified local groundwater quality and quantity chen et al 2019 monthly fluctuations of groundwater level and hydrochemistry with the phreatic aquifers could be observed in the wells especially in the oasis area d1 well fig 11 reflecting the gradual influence of anthropogenic activities on phreatic water level and composition castellano et al 2019 from the dry season to wet season phreatic water level decreased by 0 5 m midstream oasis area with higher water level fluctuations d1 well to 0 1 m downstream desert area d2 well which attested for a variable seasonal recharge of shallow groundwater over the study area fig 11 wang et al 2022b furthermore the increasing trend in salinity and stable isotope values of shallow groundwater from the oasis to desert could be explained by the influence of surface water dilution and strong evaporation fig 6 and fig 11 wang et al 2021b therefore the midstream oasis region irrigated districts received relatively high volumes of streamflow diverted by agricultural irrigation canals during the growing season both the low flow period with high salinity and stable isotopes and the high flow period with low salinity and stable isotopes thus the irrigation leakage generated more groundwater recharge compared with the recharge from streambed leakage due to the dried up river guo et al 2019 bouimouass et al 2020 wang et al 2022a reported that the primary recharge source of shallow groundwater in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin was the surface water infiltration influenced by agricultural activities however the seasonal variations in δ 18o and ec values and groundwater level depth of the shallow groundwater were very small in the desert area during the study period fig 11b which were quite different from the seasonal variations of those for the oasis groundwater fig 11a this could be explained by that the downstream desert only received flood water and lateral groundwater flow wang et al 2013 agriculture irrigation and groundwater pumping have significantly influenced the groundwater composition and storage in the study area according to the previous description agricultural irrigation system has affected the groundwater recharge in arid oasis areas fig 11 generating extended phreatic water recharge than the desert areas via irrigation water leakage meredith and blais 2019 thus irrigation systems are very central to maintaining agricultural production and community stability in semiarid and arid rural regions fernald et al 2015 ochoa et al 2012 and fernald et al 2015 found that canal seepage and irrigation percolation contributed to groundwater recharge in phreatic aquifers through human adapted irrigation systems diverted runoff to the fields could result in focused groundwater recharge along the irrigation ditches during transport rotiroti et al 2019 this irrigation recharge depends on several factors such as soil properties root water extraction patterns irrigation practices irrigation duration and water volumes and groundwater level depth bethune et al 2008 ochoa et al 2012 bouimouass et al 2020 the find sand in the root soil layer of this study area has relatively large water permeability accelerating the infiltration of irrigation water to recharge groundwater fig 11c simultaneously agricultural irrigation has affected the salinity in soils and phreatic water wang et al 2021a irrigation water infiltration could enhance the water rock interactions promote mineral dissolution and migration and bring the residual pesticides and fertilizers into aquifers thus causing groundwater salinization and pollution liu et al 2018 jia et al 2020 conversely agricultural drainage systems could drain part of the shallow groundwater to the downstream desert area leading to the decreasing of groundwater level and salinity to a certain extent thus impeding the soil and groundwater salinization in the irrigation areas castellano et al 2019 wang et al 2021a reported that the total discharge water amount via agricultural discharge systems was 1 65 108 m3 in 1993 over the weigan irrigation oasis of tarim basin with the total salt content of 6 46 105 t where the total salt output was 425 56 105 t during 1993 to 2015 therefore agricultural irrigation practices play key role in the renewal of groundwater resources in arid oasis desert region bouimouass et al 2020 yin et al 2021 this also demonstrated a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water in the arid oasis irrigated areas in our study region because of agricultural irrigation priority confined water is pumped for irrigation during the growing season due to limited streamflow leading to a decreasing groundwater level and even depression con forming within the aquifers fig 11 zeng et al 2020 the depletion of groundwater resources has been observed in many regions of arid and semiarid areas where agricultural irrigation is primarily dependent on river water and groundwater taylor et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 yin et al 2022 an omnipresent issue was that the downstream desert area would be deprived of surface water used for ecosystem similar to the desert area in our study which received very little river water for groundwater recharge due to the dried up river cody 2018 this issue is expected to escalate with farmland expansion increase agricultural production growing population and economic development alongside the depletion of groundwater resources due to groundwater overexploitation wang et al 2021b such combined pressures were leading to serious conflicts over water resources among agriculture resident and ecology gao et al 2022 moreover the decline of groundwater level caused by groundwater overexploitation seriously threatens the natural desert vegetation in arid regions yao et al 2022 chen et al 2019 found that the natural desert riparian forests in the tarim basin have been degraded seriously in recent decades due to oasis expansion and groundwater pumping for irrigation meanwhile middle groundwater salinity was higher than deep groundwater in the oasis area table 2 indicating that confined water was recharge by phreatic water this could be explained by that the depression con formation in confined aquifer due to overexploitation would cause the phreatic water leakage downward to recharge the confined water and the salt migration into the aquifers by groundwater hydraulic gradient zeng et al 2020 this resulted in the saline water fresh water mixing and groundwater environment deterioration and salinization in arid oases wang et al 2021b in the dina river irrigation district the number of electromechanical wells was 230 in 2008 well depth 100 m and the amount of groundwater extraction markedly increased from 0 29 108 m3 in 2008 to 0 85 108 m3 in 2016 of which the proportion of domestic industrial and agricultural water consumption was 8 10 and 82 respectively wang et al 2022b 5 4 implications for groundwater surface water interaction as presented previously in the text groundwater dynamics in the oasis desert area were altered under the impacts of both natural conditions and agricultural activities but the effect of agricultural activities was more profound in the past 20 years such as farmland expansion groundwater pumping agricultural irrigation and drainage yin et al 2021 wang et al 2021b fig 12 summarizes the variations in groundwater surface water interaction processes under the influence of agricultural activities before and after the rapid agriculture development in the oasis desert system of tarim basin before the agriculture development large scale land reclamation river water was an important source for groundwater recharge both in the oasis and desert of tarim basin and there was a close hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water fig 12a during this period near natural recharge conditions irrigated agriculture traditional flood irrigation had limited influence on the hydrological and hydrochemical processes and groundwater surface water interactions were weak groundwater exploitation intensity was small and groundwater level did not change much in the irrigation districts with a relatively high groundwater level fig 12a overall three groundwater recharge processes occurred in the oasis desert system during this period bouimouass et al 2020 i focused recharge by streamflow seepage along streambed river water recharge which contributed to groundwater recharge within the oasis desert during the flood period and non flood period ii recharge by irrigation water leakage irrigation recharge where the recharge region was expansive due to irrigation canals diverting streamflow from the mountains front to irrigated districts iii recharge by lateral groundwater inflow from the mountain moreover groundwater in the desert area was continuously transported to soil surface to supply the evapotranspiration through the root absorption of deep rooted plant which is closely related to groundwater level dynamic plant growth and climate conditions wu et al 2019 during the rapid agriculture development period after 2000 irrigation water was from the river water transfer and groundwater pumping in the oasis desert region leading to a dried up river groundwater depletion and salinization fig 12b wang et al 2021b this has reshaped the soil moisture and groundwater patterns in the oasis and notably altered the groundwater dynamics and water balance han et al 2017 during this period water saving irrigation dominated there is a strong and frequent interaction between groundwater and surface water in the study area groundwater was largely recharged by vertical irrigation water infiltration and lateral groundwater inflow and accompanied by continuous excessive groundwater pumping due to a farmland expansion fig 12b however the increased groundwater recharge via irrigation water leakage could not counteract the negative effect of groundwater overexploitation in the study area thus resulting in a continuous decline of groundwater level even leading to a disconnection of surface water and groundwater systems in the downstream desert area gleeson et al 2012 chen at el 2019 stream recharge was significantly reduced by the high streamflow diversion for irrigation and the amount of irrigation water infiltration reduced significantly from tradition flood irrigation to water saving irrigation which reduced water discharge from the midstream oasis to downstream desert soil moisture content in the desert vadose zone also changed to some extent due to soil temperature gradient and groundwater level fluctuation du et al 2017 furthermore a thickening aeration zone could reduce groundwater recharge by increasing both the aeration zone water storage and the time lag between soil water percolation and groundwater recharge which may increase as continuous groundwater table decline owing to groundwater pumping cao et al 2016 han et al 2017 yin et al 2021 moreover the infiltration pattern of soil moisture altered under water saving irrigation and the rate of groundwater use may exceed its replenishment rate in the arid oasis desert area thus gradually leading to groundwater storage depletion zheng et al 2019 meanwhile during the rapid agriculture development period the total evapotranspiration in the oasis during the growth season increased remarkably with the irrigated agriculture development owing to continuous irrigation however compared with flood irrigation water saving irrigation reduced evapotranspiration significantly in the cultivated land fig 12b zhang et al 2014b this could be explained by the fact that flood irrigation tends to maintain higher soil moisture content than water saving irrigation within the root zone vico and porporato 2010 phreatic evaporation also reduces significantly in the desert due to the sharp decline of groundwater level river water evaporates for a short time before leakage into groundwater thanks to the irrigation canals in addition agricultural irrigation canal system in the oasis has been continuously improved to enhance water use efficiency and reduce seepage losses during river water diversion and the implementation of water saving irrigation in the oasis increased the upper 60 cm depth soil moisture li et al 2016b causing groundwater level rise and soil salinization during the growing season han et al 2017 furthermore part of soil salt and residual pesticides and fertilizers could be transported downward into groundwater via the infiltration water and together with the increase of groundwater salinity caused by intense evaporation in the desert fig 12b this leads to groundwater quality changes e g salinization and even confined water environmental deterioration which seriously threatens desert vegetation mechanisms affecting the above water quality dynamics include the dilution of river water dissolution and leaching of soil salts by infiltration water water rock interaction mixing and evaporative crystallization su et al 2020 marked increasing of salts fertilizers and pesticides in the aeration zone was observed in arid irrigated regions which had partly reached phreatic water and even into confined water mcmahon et al 2006 howden et al 2011 this could be explained by the forming of groundwater depression cone in the confined aquifers due to long term groundwater overexploitation leading to phreatic water leakage downward into confined water that indicates a close hydraulic relationship between phreatic water and confined water yin et al 2021 therefore agricultural drainage systems were built in the oasis to drain salt and reduce groundwater level to some extent obviously the gradual deterioration of local groundwater regimes quantity and quality was the result of excessive large scale land reclamation and groundwater overexploitation associated with irrigation agricultural development in the oasis desert system yin et al 2021 this has caused severe environmental and socioeconomic consequences such as soil degradation deterioration of phreatic water quality and death of native vegetation han et al 2017 in order to manage the degraded groundwater systems and avoid further deterioration decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation amount improving water saving efficiency and carrying out gradual ecological restoration would be the only viable method to restore groundwater level quality and maintain the oasis desert ecosystem coexistence thus ensuring groundwater sustainable utilization and water security in the context of climate change gao et al 2022 liu et al 2022 specifically we propound the following recommendations for sustainable groundwater management in arid regions i the reginal groundwater pumping threshold and critical groundwater level should be determined and groundwater extraction should be reduced to restore the groundwater level groundwater exploitation intensity in the tarim basin has been continuously increased since 2000 due to local policy guidance resulting in regional groundwater level decline and water quality deterioration chen et al 2019 the increased irrigation return flow would primarily enhance the aeration zone water storage rather than groundwater recharge due to the thick aeration zone which prevents any meaningful groundwater level recovery cao et al 2016 ii optimum planting schedules and irrigation schemes water saving irrigation should be explored and implemented to improve agricultural water saving efficiency and achieve highly efficient development of agricultural irrigation in the water limited arid region yin et al 2021 iii agricultural drainage system should be further improvement to enhance the discharge amount of saline groundwater and decrease phreatic water level and salinity in the early 21th century agricultural drainage canal system was constructed and deployed in the oasis region of tarim basin to discharge saline phreatic water through drains and trenches but the current drainage system is not perfect wang et al 2021b iv the area of cultivated land should be restricted and rational allocation of surface water and groundwater resources should be implemented to ensure the water demand of downstream desert vegetation thus gradually restoring ecological systems and enhancing the carbon sequestration of ecological forests liu et al 2022 in recent 20 years the area of oasis desert ecotone in the tarim basin has decreased significantly due to large scale wasteland reclamation and more water was used by agriculture rather than ecological systems chen et al 2019 v the potential effect of climate variability on local hydrological regimes streamflow and groundwater should be evaluated to address the agricultural risks posed by climate change e g snowmelt climate shift from warm dry to warm humid qin et al 2020 the increase of cultivated land area in the tarim basin is closely related to the increasing streamflow and groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 6 conclusions in this study the water quality and groundwater surface water interaction under the influence of agricultural activities in an oasis desert region were examined using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 samples collected in the luntai oasis of tarim basin based on a comparison of the spatiotemporal hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis irrigation areas and desert non irrigation areas the irrigation water quality was assessed through hydrochemical methods and groundwater recharge sources in the oasis and desert areas were identified subsequently the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality were evaluated and then the interaction between groundwater and surface water was analyzed the following conclusions could be drawn i annual mean ndvi increased with time 0 009 per decade during 2000 to 2020 the area of cultivated land increased by 121 8 732 4 km2 during the period which was mainly transferred from grassland and bare land especially from grassland ii groundwater ec ranged from 786 to 49 400 μs cm and decreased from the phreatic aquifer to confined aquifer with weakly alkaline the river water had a low ec whereas the shallow groundwater had a much higher ec the ec values of shallow groundwater were low in irrigation areas and high in non irrigation areas shallow groundwater was more enriched in the non irrigation area than in the irrigation area conversely the middle groundwater isotopic values were lower in the desert area than in the oasis area the ec values of river water and shallow groundwater were lower in summer middle groundwater had higher ec in summer than that in spring and autumn stable isotope values of water were more depleted during the summer than the autumn and spring iii streamflow and confined water in the study area are generally suitable for agricultural irrigation at present but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation purpose at present groundwater chemistry in the oasis desert was mainly controlled by strong evaporation dilution mixing water rock interaction and agricultural drainage groundwater recharge in the irrigation areas occurred indirectly via ephemeral runoff seepage irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow from mountains whereas the downstream desert only received flood water and lateral groundwater flow indicating a deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer systems iv long term development of irrigation agriculture large scale land reclamation groundwater pumping agricultural irrigation and drainage has caused groundwater level decline and salinization demonstrating a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water in arid oasis irrigated areas a simple conceptual diagram was drawn to depict the variations in groundwater surface water interaction processes associated with the rapid agriculture development impact in the oasis desert system of tarim basin hence in the sustainable groundwater resource management of arid irrigation districts attentions should be paid to both the groundwater quantity and quality salts decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation carrying out gradual ecological restoration improving water saving efficiency and agricultural drainage system would be the only viable method to restore groundwater level quality and maintain the oasis desert ecosystem coexistence in the

2394,the combination of natural forcing and anthropogenic activities affects the global climate system increasing the frequency of extreme drought events drought events with multi characteristics will have incalculable impacts on ecology human life and socioeconomics however the quantitative impacts of climate change caused by anthropogenic forcing on the droughts over china remains unclear in this study ensemble mean data of seven global climate models from coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 models cmip6 under both natural and anthropogenic forcing experiment and only natural forcing experiment abbreviated as all and nat respectively were used the drought characteristics are identified by applying the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and run theory the quantitative impacts of anthropogenic climate change acc on drought frequency duration intensity affected area over china in the past 54 years 1961 2014 were investigated by comparing the drought characteristics between nat and all on the whole region acc presented anabatic effects on drought such as increasing the frequency enhancing the intensity and prolonging the duration it also increased the area affected by moderate and extreme drought events acc was averagely about 1 47 times more determinative of whether a drought event occurs however the effect of acc on drought characteristics did not show spatial consistency drought in southwest china was showing a significant aggravation trend influenced by acc while droughts in northwest china were presenting a mitigation tendency these associated findings emphasize the regional features of drought affected by acc and could help policy makers to develop mitigation measures keywords anthropogenic climate change natural forcing drought characteristics quantitative impact cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change may cause variations in the characteristics of severe drought events which would be harmful to both natural and society systems at different spatial and temporal scales jaeger et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 there are probably two causes of climate change 1 natural variability in the ocean atmosphere system 2 external drivers that change the radiative balance or other characteristics ipcc 2012 the external drivers here are often referred to as external natural forcing such as volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation and anthropogenic activities such as greenhouse gas emissions land use changes and aerosol emissions stott et al 2010 under the background of climate change the recent frequent extreme events raise the question of whether anthropogenic climate change acc plays an important role in the exacerbation of drought acc causes dramatic shifts in precipitation and temperature min et al 2011 multiple observational datasets and reconstructed data using tree wheels confirm that human activities may have influenced global drought risk as early as the beginning of 20th century marvel et al 2019 for example acc has increased the joint probability of simultaneous warm dry climate diffenbaugh et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 chen and sun 2017 suggested that human activities are the main driver of drought trends in china and natural variability were mainly responsible for the variability of droughts the research of samaniego et al 2018 showed that the increased warming caused by anthropogenic activities has exacerbated soil moisture drought in europe and a warming of 3 c would lead to a 40 increase in the area of drought compared to the paris agreement target of 1 5 c gu et al 2019 also indicated that natural drivers fail to cause significant soil aridification while acc signals are detected in the aridification trend and the co2 emission plays a larger role as acc shows great influence on drought evolution mechanism correspondingly there has been an increase of researches that seek to explore the effects of anthropogenic forcings to the extreme hydro meteorological drought events however previous researches more focused on the effects of acc on drought trends in long term periods chen and sun 2017 specific events diffenbaugh et al 2015 pascale et al 2021 or individual variables min et al 2011 wan et al 2019 the characteristics of droughts are lack of investigation such as drought frequency drought duration drought intensity and drought area these drought characteristics are associated with the potential drought induced damage china was and is suffering from drought risk under the changing environment and its distribution varies from region to region for example despite being located in the humid climate zone exceptional and sustained droughts have hit southwest of china during the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 wang et al 2015 while the climate in northwest of china shows warm and wet tendency peng and zhou 2017 a more detailed and systematic analysis of the acc s effect on drought characteristics in china is therefore necessary multi climate model simulations data are widely used in the drought risk and attribution researches of anthropogenic forcings otto et al 2018 abreu et al 2019 pascale et al 2021 they provide data with sufficient length to allow direct reconstruction of the underlying probability distributions of hydroclimatic extreme events without relying on hypothetical statistical models of extreme events van der wiel et al 2019 and multi model ensemble mean is more representative than any single model in terms of representing acc compared with the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 cmip6 with enrichment climate models and more modeling groups shows reduced biases in drought characteristics which are more likely associated with improvements in the representation of physical processes in climate models hence cmip6 is expected to provide more reliable information on the regional climate response to anthropogenic forcing chen et al 2020 ukkola et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 based on the previous analysis this study aims to answer the following questions by analyzing the outputs from natural forcing and historical experiments of cmip6 1 what are the effects of acc on drought characteristics i e drought frequency duration intensity area over china 2 whether these effects show spatially homogeneous or not 3 what is the likelihood of acc impact the occurrence of drought events over china 2 data and methods 2 1 dataset in order to understand the potential effects of natural and anthropogenic forcing on the changes of drought characteristics over china monthly outputs of seven global climate models gcms simulations table 1 in two experiments from cmip6 were used in this study one is historical experiment which is driven by both external natural and anthropogenic forcings simply referring as all hereafter including greenhouse gases aerosols and changes in land cover use the other is historical natural only experiment which is driven by only external natural forcings simply referring as nat hereafter such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions all these data were based on the first member of each model r1i1p1f1 for all experiments these data including monthly precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average wind speed downward shortwave radiation and relative humidity during 1961 2014 and are archived at the website of the earth system grid federation esgf gateway https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 more information of these models is presented in table 1 in order to reduce the uncertainty for each model the datasets from the seven gcms were first resampled into a common resolution of 0 5 0 5 using a bilinear interpolation procedure and then integrated by using the multi model ensemble mean method massoud et al 2019 only the gridded data in china s mainland were analyzed in this study fig 1 1 x i j 1 k m 1 k x i j m where x i j m means the element of the mth gcm in the grid with longitude i and latitude j k is the number of gcm used in this study x i j is the integrated element high resolution gridded climate dataset of monthly precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg were used in this study as the reference to estimate the performance of the simulated ensembled mean dataset the dataset is one of the most widely used observed climate dataset and is produced by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science ncas at the university of east anglia s climatic research unit cru the calculation of the pet in cru ts4 05 is based on the fao 56 penman monteith method harris et al 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the calculation of spei drought indices are important tools that can be used for the detection monitoring and quantification of drought events the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was employed in this study since the advantages of flexibility of timescale spatial comparability and diversity of input elements vicente serrano et al 2010 three steps were summarized for spei calculation 1 calculating the difference d series of monthly p and pet at different timescales 2 calculating the cumulative distribution function for d series three parameter log logistic function was widely used for describing the d series 3 transforming the cumulative distribution function into a standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 the original formulation of spei suggested use of the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 for estimation of pet however the methods for calculating pet based on temperature thornthwaite 1948 or temperature radiation priestley and taylor 1972 may lead to an overestimation of drought or drying trends the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 incorporates energy balance and aerodynamic theory and is recommended by wmo and fao un as the only standard method for pet assessment calculations in this study we used the penman monteith equation to estimate the pet 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at a given air temperature kpa c rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 d γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa and es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa when calculating pet with monthly data the soil heat flux g cannot be neglected and can be calculated according to the following equation 3 g month i 0 17 t month i 1 t month i 1 if the temperature of i 1th month remains unknown the monthly g can be calculated by the following equation 4 g month i 0 14 t month i t month i 1 where gmonth i indicates the daily g in i month mj m2 day tmonth i 1 tmonth i tmonth i 1 indicate the average temperature of the i 1th ith i 1th month the drought severity can be divided into four degrees table 2 based on the meteorological drought grades issued by the national climate center of china in 2017 the ensembled mean data of monthly p and pet from 7 models in nat and all forcing experiments were used to calculate the corresponding spei series at 12 month timescale which are labeled as spei all and spei nat which can be reflected the annual drought condition the calculation of spei based on the all forcing used the log logistic distribution parameters fitted over the nat forcing climate to compare changes in each drought characteristics relative to the natural forcing after extracting drought frequency drought duration drought intensity and drought events we could separate the effects of anthropogenic activities on drought characteristics and the probability of drought occurrence by comparing the differences between spei all and spei nat the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 the identification of different drought characteristics drought frequency duration intensity and affected area by drought are the main factors in this study to describe the drought characteristics and they are identified as follows drought frequency the fraction of total month with spei less than a given threshold δ to all month series drought duration the number of months between drought initiation and termination time based on the run theory using spei less than δ drought intensity the sum of absolute value that spei less than δ during the drought duration affected area by drought the fraction of drought grids that spei less than δ to all grids within a certain period of time 2 2 3 the calculation of risk ratio in event attribution the change in the occurrence probability of an extreme event can be quantified with the method of risk ratio rr nas 2016 hauser et al 2017 5 rr p 1 p 0 where p 0 is the probability of an event beyond the threshold in the world that might have been in which there were only nat forcing on the climate p1 is the probability in the actual world including natural and anthropogenic forcing all forcing if rr is larger than 1 that means a strong anthropogenic contribution to the occurrence of this event 3 results 3 1 the uncertainty of gcm simulations of p and pet as the spei is the normalization of the difference in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet the capability of gcms to demonstrate droughts better is related to their performance to capture the patterns of p and pet therefore before comparing the drought changes between all and nat forcing experiments we first evaluated the all forcing representation in the gcms for the actual world we took the monthly p and pet series from cru as the reference data and used the kendall correlation coefficient to test whether the gcms from cmip6 could properly captured the temporal and spatial patterns of monthly p and pet over china s mainland for monthly p the high correlation coefficients with values larger than 0 6 between cru and ensemble mean value of cmip6 are generally located in the strip region from southwest to northeast of china while the lower correlation coefficients are mainly concentrated in northwest of china with most grids having correlation coefficients around 0 2 fig 3 a for monthly pet most of the whole china s mainland have high correlation coefficients with values larger than 0 7 except for southwest china and pearl river basin which the values are around 0 5 fig 3b the monthly p and pet between cru and all forcing are showing significant correlations over china more than 98 grids significant level 0 05 during the study period of 1961 2014 the average monthly p and pet in all forcing experiment also show homogeneous spatial distribution with those of cru figure s1 lower p value concentrated in the north of china and higher p value in the south of china especially in the southeast coast the pet over the tibetan plateau and the east of northeastern china is lower and the pet over the northwestern china and the north china plain is higher generally the ensemble mean data of cmip6 show positive and significant correlation with the reference data which suggesting that they could represent the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of monthly p and pet series of china 3 2 the effects of acc on different drought characteristics 3 2 1 drought frequency in fig 4 we present the maps of drought frequency under two forcing experiments taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ the geographic distribution of drought frequency over china is different under nat and all in nat condition the drought frequency was distributed evenly mainly maintain 33 4 for all condition the drought frequency shows significant variations higher frequency concentrated in the east and south of china and lower frequency located in the west and north of china average drought frequency was 48 7 the difference between all and nat forcing indicating that acc has increased the drought frequency in china by 15 3 averagely fig 4d in terms of the spatial distribution acc plays an important role in slowing down the drought frequency in the northwest of china nwc making it decrease by more than 20 compared with nat condition in the regions of northeast of china nec southwest of china swc and tibetan plateau tp the effects of acc enhanced the drought frequency especially in the swc and part of tp where the drought frequency increased by almost 60 fig 4c 3 2 2 drought duration in fig 5 we present the spatial distribution of average drought duration taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ in nat forcing the average drought duration over china is generally maintains at 7 21 months per drought event fig 5a in all forcing condition the drought duration is increased especially in the nec swc and tp fig 5b averagely the drought duration in all forcing is 11 96 months the grids with abnormal value suggesting that droughts in these regions impacted by anthropogenic activities seriously the drought duration difference between all and nat indicating that the drought duration averagely increased by 4 75 months due to acc spatially acc reduced the drought duration in the nwc causing the drought duration decreased by more than 5 months compared to nat climate system fig 5c in the zones of nec swc and tp acc enhanced the drought duration especially in the region of swc where the drought duration increased by about 10 40 months in most grid points 3 2 3 drought intensity in fig 6 we present the maps of average drought intensity over china taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ the average intensity difference between all and nat forcing is 9 74 9 37 for nat and 19 11 for all fig 6d which indicating that the effect of acc has enhanced the intensity of drought events almost twice of that only in nat climate system the obvious aggravation effects of acc on drought intensity are also concentrated in the regions of swc and tp especially in swc where the drought intensity increased by about 25 or more in most grids the drought intensity in nwc is slightly reduced fig 6c this is similar with the patterns of acc s impacts on drought frequency and drought duration 3 2 4 affected area by drought in order to further investigate the effects of acc on the affected area by drought we calculated the ratio of months with different range of drought affected area to total month series under four drought degrees during 1961 2014 and the ratio change was illustrated in fig 7 for light drought the difference of drought affected area is not obvious between nat and all climate system and the affected areas mainly maintain in the range of 10 20 with the ratio of 85 both for nat and all the ratios for drought area 10 and drought area 20 are much less fig 7a the ratios pattern varied with the aggravation of drought in the all condition the ratio of drought affected area 10 is less than that in nat condition while the ratios of drought affected area in the range of 10 20 and area 20 are larger than those in nat condition for example the ratios of drought affected area in the range of 10 20 in all are increased by 35 4 39 5 and 25 7 for moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively fig 7b c d especially the ratio of extreme drought affected area 20 is 12 9 which is increased by 11 2 compared with that under nat forcing affected areas by light and moderate drought are mostly larger than the areas affected by severe and extreme drought however in all condition with the impact of anthropogenic activities the ratio pattern of drought affected area exposed to different drought degrees is changed acc has increased the probability of large area exposed to more severe drought especially to the extreme drought events leading to an increasing risk of more underlying surface exposed to drought conditions 3 3 the likelihood of acc s effects on the occurrence of drought events we calculated the probability of drought events with different severity under nat and all condition during 1961 2014 at gridded scale the risk ratio rr was obtained according to eq 4 and the results are shown in fig 8 using spei 0 5 as drought threshold the grids with rr 1 are mainly distributed in the east of 100 e and the maximum rr is located in beijing tianjin hebei province nec south of china and parts of tp the grids of rr 1 are mainly located in the nwc fig 8a this means that the effects of acc mainly intensify the drought in eastern china while in the west region of 100 e and east region of 35 n the alleviation effect of acc for the drought condition is obvious the mean value of rr is 1 47 suggesting that averagely the likelihood of a drought event spei 0 5 over china is 1 5 times higher in the all forcing system we also illustrated the distribution of rr for different severity drought events in the violin plot fig 8b the extreme value of rr is increasing with the increase of drought severity and the average values are 1 90 2 73 and 4 22 for drought events of spei 1 spei 1 5 and spei 2 respectively the more severe the drought events the higher the likelihood that acc will affect its occurrence as it comes to extreme drought the likelihood even increased to 20 times but the grids area is decreasing with the increase of rr value this indicates that acc has a triggering effect on the occurrence of more severe drought over china but the influence has a limited scope 4 discussion 4 1 the discrepancy impacts of anthropogenic warming and acc on p and pet based on the previous analysis we got a simple and straightforward feeling compared with the nat forcing the drought characteristics such as frequency duration intensity and affected area over china were averagely enhanced in the all forcing acc affected the drought related elements such as temperature humidity precipitation and so on to some extent impacted the drought occurrence through land air coupling the combined effects of natural climate variability and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher temperature accompanied by lower humidity and reduced cloud cover van loon and van lanen 2013 van loon et al 2016 the increase of greenhouse gas emissions limits the escape of long wave radiation resulting in an increase in net surface radiation cook et al 2014 atmospheric aerosol and land use changes may also cause variations of net surface radiation qian 2016 feng et al 2019 this in turn has an effect on moisture escape in addition urbanization effects can also affect changes in temperature precipitation and relative humidity chen et al 2011 the ipcc fifth assessment reported that there was a 95 probability that human activities have contributed to global warming over the past 50 years ipcc 2014 global warming is the most prominent feature of climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause for this warming trend but the combined effect of human activities is not only caused by greenhouse gas emissions but also aerosols and other factors we compared the annual p and pet series over china from the ensemble models under nat ghg aer and all forcings ghg means greenhouse gas forcing aer means aerosol forcing from fig 9 we can see that the ensemble mean value of p and pet in the ghg abbreviated as p ghg and pet ghg and similar in other experiments are all higher than those in nat and all forcing and the annual p ghg shows significant increase tendency p 0 05 with rate of 7 6 mm 10a meanwhile the combined effects of temperature wind speed radiation and humidity lead to the same significant upward trend for pet ghg with the rate of 9 7 mm 10a which is lightly larger than the rate of p ghg this means that ghg may lead the extent of water deficit p pet increased year by year aggravated the drought condition of china the trend of p all and p nat shows decrease tendency and the trend of pet all and pet nat shows increase tendency the linear trends of p all and pet all 0 2 mm 10a and 1 9 mm 10a are higher than nat it implies that acc has both increased the average pet of temperature sensitive and precipitation over china but the increase magnitude in the rise rate of pet 2 2 mm 10a 0 3 mm 10a 1 9 mm 10a is greater than that of p 0 4 mm 10a 0 6 mm 10a 0 2 mm 10a anthropogenic activities caused the increased rate of water scarcity 1 7 mm per decade which is slightly less than that of ghg 2 1 mm 10a this may be related with the effect of aerosol forcing where the annual p aer and pet aer are all showing significant decreasing tendency 8 8 mm 10a and 6 8 mm 10a during the study periods the greenhouse effect reduces the long wave radiation reflected back to the atmosphere from the earth s surface and increases the surface radiation temperature significantly which will undoubtedly increase the water evaporation rate under a certain threshold of warming the precipitation will also increase while the climate effect of aerosols will reduce the radiation reaching the ground then drop the upper tropospheric temperature wang et al 2019 which will offset the warming effect brought by greenhouse gases to some extent for example the gradual increase of anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the northern hemisphere plays a decisive role in the weakening of the asian summer monsoon liu et al 2019a which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of drought over eastern china fig 8 as cox et al 2008 indicated that the decreasing aerosol pollution had increased the amazonian drought risk globally lin et al 2018 suggested that the aerosol emissions reduction would increase p but it has little impact on global aridity due to offsetting effects on pet finally the complex interactions of acc may have mitigated the exacerbation of drought compared with that only caused by global warming 4 2 the effect of acc on climate zones over china based on the aridity index ai which is the ratio of annual p to pet six sub climate zones are divided arid ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 semi humid 0 65 ai 0 8 humid 0 8 ai 1 and very humid ai 1 unep 1993 the distribution pattern of the six sub climate zones is similar between the nat and all forcing figure s2 however the change trends of ai in each sub climate zones show obvious difference fig 10 based on the sen s slope and manner kendall mk trend method the ai values over arid semi arid and dry sub humid zones showing increasing trends during 1961 2014 and the increase rate is higher in all forcing while the ai values over humid and very humid zones represent decreasing tendency and the decreasing area over south of china is larger in all forcing the arid zones over northern china indicate a wetting trend and the humid zones over southern china show a drying trend this is somewhat reinforced by acc with larger grids of significant trends than the nat forcing condition for instance the significant decreasing trend area in very humid zone is extended from swc to sichuan and qinghai provinces for the arid region in the west of 100 e a warming and wetting tend during last decades was also reported by many researches shi et al 2003 li et al 2016 peng and zhou 2017 zhao et al 2020 in the south of tp the arid areas showed a tendency of wetting whereas the humid areas exhibited a trend of drying liu et al 2019b precipitation was the dominant factor for the variations of ai in all climate regions li et al 2019b acc may influence the characteristics of changes in meteorological elements through the land atmosphere complex interactions 4 3 the diversity effect of acc on the drought over different regions of china compared with nat forcing condition the drought characteristics in all forcing climate system were changed and varied in different regions of china as for the swc the droughts were more severe it was reported that relatively higher risk of drought in yunnan was observed during the past 60 years 1951 2012 liu et al 2014 we selected the disaster record of 2009 2010 southwest drought from sep 2009 to apr 2010 as an example the sub figures figure s3 illustrated the evolution of this drought record using the mean spei value within every two months in the nat forcing fig s3a c e g only light and moderate droughts are mainly detected in the south of yunnan province and the north of sichuan province while under the all forcing fig s3b d f h severe and extreme drought events are detected in yunnan guizhou sichuan chongqing and guangxi which are consisted with the report in bulletin of flood and drought disasters in china 2010 http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb zgshzhgb this indicates that the 2009 2010 southwest drought event was driven by external natural forcing superimposed with acc ma et al 2017 indicated that dry and warm meteorological conditions seen during the 2009 autumn drought due to anthropogenic global warming zhang et al 2021 indicated that the emergence time of anthropogenic forcing in extreme drought occurrence and affected area in southeast asian monsoon region occurs around the 1960s for part of tp region which is near the upstream of yarlung zangbo river basin the drought conditions were also deteriorated in all forcing system this is consistent with the result of li et al 2019a the west of tp was reported becoming drier and the drier tendency caused by rising temperature had the highest negative contribution rate for vegetation growth wang et al 2021 combined with the altered precipitation patterns the ecological drought was intensified jiao et al 2021 the drought characteristics over nwc were mitigated in the all forcing climate system this is consistent with the effect of warming and wetting trend in this region based on the spi yang et al 2017 also suggested that the drought condition in northwest of china presented a mitigated trend in order to understand the impact of acc on the drought mitigation of nwc the spei in nat forcing spei nat and in all forcing spei all in the range of 73 25 e 96 26 e 34 25 n 49 25 n were extracted figure s4 shows the change of average monthly spei nat and spei all series the fluctuations of spei series are consistent under the two forcing systems but the spei all curve lies above spei nat which indicates the drought events in all identified by spei are milder than nat condition the nwc is characterized by scarce precipitation and high evaporation during the recent 54 years the change of annual p in the selected area shows an increasing trend under all forcing condition fig s5c which is more obvious than that in nat fig s5a especially after 1990 before 1990 the annual pet series shows stable fluctuating patterns after 1990 the significant increasing trends are detected in nat and all fig s5b d this indicating that the increased precipitation may be the reason for the drought mitigation over nwc during the decades anthropogenic forcing affects the atmospheric circulation both enhance the precipitation and temperature in the west of northwestern china wang et al 2018 the melting of mountain glaciers and the rising of river or lake levels due to global warming and aerosol emissions may have also increased local anthropogenic climate effects ren et al 2016 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of anthropogenic climate change acc on the drought characteristics over china using the ensemble mean dataset from two experiments of cmip6 nat and all forcing during the period of 1961 2014 based on the risk ratio rr method the likelihood of drought occurrence impacted by acc was also analyzed acc enhanced the drought frequency 15 3 drought duration 4 7 months drought intensity 9 74 respectively averagely over china spatially the acc s inverse effects on drought were mainly concentrated in the northwest and southwest of china besides acc has also increased the risk of widespread higher degree drought events over china especially for extreme drought over 54 years the probability of extreme droughts affected area 20 in all forcing has increased by 11 2 compared with that in nat acc has increased the occurrence likelihood of drought events spei 0 5 almost 1 5 times than nat forcing over china the more severe the drought event the greater the impact of acc on its likelihood of occurrence the results presented in this study highlighted the potential effects of acc in the changes of drought characteristic over china drought events in most regions of china are associated with acc especially in the northwest and southwest of china which reflecting the combined complex effects of natural variability and anthropogenic activities on drought

2394,the combination of natural forcing and anthropogenic activities affects the global climate system increasing the frequency of extreme drought events drought events with multi characteristics will have incalculable impacts on ecology human life and socioeconomics however the quantitative impacts of climate change caused by anthropogenic forcing on the droughts over china remains unclear in this study ensemble mean data of seven global climate models from coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 models cmip6 under both natural and anthropogenic forcing experiment and only natural forcing experiment abbreviated as all and nat respectively were used the drought characteristics are identified by applying the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and run theory the quantitative impacts of anthropogenic climate change acc on drought frequency duration intensity affected area over china in the past 54 years 1961 2014 were investigated by comparing the drought characteristics between nat and all on the whole region acc presented anabatic effects on drought such as increasing the frequency enhancing the intensity and prolonging the duration it also increased the area affected by moderate and extreme drought events acc was averagely about 1 47 times more determinative of whether a drought event occurs however the effect of acc on drought characteristics did not show spatial consistency drought in southwest china was showing a significant aggravation trend influenced by acc while droughts in northwest china were presenting a mitigation tendency these associated findings emphasize the regional features of drought affected by acc and could help policy makers to develop mitigation measures keywords anthropogenic climate change natural forcing drought characteristics quantitative impact cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change may cause variations in the characteristics of severe drought events which would be harmful to both natural and society systems at different spatial and temporal scales jaeger et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 there are probably two causes of climate change 1 natural variability in the ocean atmosphere system 2 external drivers that change the radiative balance or other characteristics ipcc 2012 the external drivers here are often referred to as external natural forcing such as volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation and anthropogenic activities such as greenhouse gas emissions land use changes and aerosol emissions stott et al 2010 under the background of climate change the recent frequent extreme events raise the question of whether anthropogenic climate change acc plays an important role in the exacerbation of drought acc causes dramatic shifts in precipitation and temperature min et al 2011 multiple observational datasets and reconstructed data using tree wheels confirm that human activities may have influenced global drought risk as early as the beginning of 20th century marvel et al 2019 for example acc has increased the joint probability of simultaneous warm dry climate diffenbaugh et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 chen and sun 2017 suggested that human activities are the main driver of drought trends in china and natural variability were mainly responsible for the variability of droughts the research of samaniego et al 2018 showed that the increased warming caused by anthropogenic activities has exacerbated soil moisture drought in europe and a warming of 3 c would lead to a 40 increase in the area of drought compared to the paris agreement target of 1 5 c gu et al 2019 also indicated that natural drivers fail to cause significant soil aridification while acc signals are detected in the aridification trend and the co2 emission plays a larger role as acc shows great influence on drought evolution mechanism correspondingly there has been an increase of researches that seek to explore the effects of anthropogenic forcings to the extreme hydro meteorological drought events however previous researches more focused on the effects of acc on drought trends in long term periods chen and sun 2017 specific events diffenbaugh et al 2015 pascale et al 2021 or individual variables min et al 2011 wan et al 2019 the characteristics of droughts are lack of investigation such as drought frequency drought duration drought intensity and drought area these drought characteristics are associated with the potential drought induced damage china was and is suffering from drought risk under the changing environment and its distribution varies from region to region for example despite being located in the humid climate zone exceptional and sustained droughts have hit southwest of china during the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 wang et al 2015 while the climate in northwest of china shows warm and wet tendency peng and zhou 2017 a more detailed and systematic analysis of the acc s effect on drought characteristics in china is therefore necessary multi climate model simulations data are widely used in the drought risk and attribution researches of anthropogenic forcings otto et al 2018 abreu et al 2019 pascale et al 2021 they provide data with sufficient length to allow direct reconstruction of the underlying probability distributions of hydroclimatic extreme events without relying on hypothetical statistical models of extreme events van der wiel et al 2019 and multi model ensemble mean is more representative than any single model in terms of representing acc compared with the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 cmip6 with enrichment climate models and more modeling groups shows reduced biases in drought characteristics which are more likely associated with improvements in the representation of physical processes in climate models hence cmip6 is expected to provide more reliable information on the regional climate response to anthropogenic forcing chen et al 2020 ukkola et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 based on the previous analysis this study aims to answer the following questions by analyzing the outputs from natural forcing and historical experiments of cmip6 1 what are the effects of acc on drought characteristics i e drought frequency duration intensity area over china 2 whether these effects show spatially homogeneous or not 3 what is the likelihood of acc impact the occurrence of drought events over china 2 data and methods 2 1 dataset in order to understand the potential effects of natural and anthropogenic forcing on the changes of drought characteristics over china monthly outputs of seven global climate models gcms simulations table 1 in two experiments from cmip6 were used in this study one is historical experiment which is driven by both external natural and anthropogenic forcings simply referring as all hereafter including greenhouse gases aerosols and changes in land cover use the other is historical natural only experiment which is driven by only external natural forcings simply referring as nat hereafter such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions all these data were based on the first member of each model r1i1p1f1 for all experiments these data including monthly precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average wind speed downward shortwave radiation and relative humidity during 1961 2014 and are archived at the website of the earth system grid federation esgf gateway https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 more information of these models is presented in table 1 in order to reduce the uncertainty for each model the datasets from the seven gcms were first resampled into a common resolution of 0 5 0 5 using a bilinear interpolation procedure and then integrated by using the multi model ensemble mean method massoud et al 2019 only the gridded data in china s mainland were analyzed in this study fig 1 1 x i j 1 k m 1 k x i j m where x i j m means the element of the mth gcm in the grid with longitude i and latitude j k is the number of gcm used in this study x i j is the integrated element high resolution gridded climate dataset of monthly precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg were used in this study as the reference to estimate the performance of the simulated ensembled mean dataset the dataset is one of the most widely used observed climate dataset and is produced by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science ncas at the university of east anglia s climatic research unit cru the calculation of the pet in cru ts4 05 is based on the fao 56 penman monteith method harris et al 2020 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the calculation of spei drought indices are important tools that can be used for the detection monitoring and quantification of drought events the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was employed in this study since the advantages of flexibility of timescale spatial comparability and diversity of input elements vicente serrano et al 2010 three steps were summarized for spei calculation 1 calculating the difference d series of monthly p and pet at different timescales 2 calculating the cumulative distribution function for d series three parameter log logistic function was widely used for describing the d series 3 transforming the cumulative distribution function into a standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 the original formulation of spei suggested use of the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 for estimation of pet however the methods for calculating pet based on temperature thornthwaite 1948 or temperature radiation priestley and taylor 1972 may lead to an overestimation of drought or drying trends the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 incorporates energy balance and aerodynamic theory and is recommended by wmo and fao un as the only standard method for pet assessment calculations in this study we used the penman monteith equation to estimate the pet 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at a given air temperature kpa c rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 d γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa and es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa when calculating pet with monthly data the soil heat flux g cannot be neglected and can be calculated according to the following equation 3 g month i 0 17 t month i 1 t month i 1 if the temperature of i 1th month remains unknown the monthly g can be calculated by the following equation 4 g month i 0 14 t month i t month i 1 where gmonth i indicates the daily g in i month mj m2 day tmonth i 1 tmonth i tmonth i 1 indicate the average temperature of the i 1th ith i 1th month the drought severity can be divided into four degrees table 2 based on the meteorological drought grades issued by the national climate center of china in 2017 the ensembled mean data of monthly p and pet from 7 models in nat and all forcing experiments were used to calculate the corresponding spei series at 12 month timescale which are labeled as spei all and spei nat which can be reflected the annual drought condition the calculation of spei based on the all forcing used the log logistic distribution parameters fitted over the nat forcing climate to compare changes in each drought characteristics relative to the natural forcing after extracting drought frequency drought duration drought intensity and drought events we could separate the effects of anthropogenic activities on drought characteristics and the probability of drought occurrence by comparing the differences between spei all and spei nat the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 the identification of different drought characteristics drought frequency duration intensity and affected area by drought are the main factors in this study to describe the drought characteristics and they are identified as follows drought frequency the fraction of total month with spei less than a given threshold δ to all month series drought duration the number of months between drought initiation and termination time based on the run theory using spei less than δ drought intensity the sum of absolute value that spei less than δ during the drought duration affected area by drought the fraction of drought grids that spei less than δ to all grids within a certain period of time 2 2 3 the calculation of risk ratio in event attribution the change in the occurrence probability of an extreme event can be quantified with the method of risk ratio rr nas 2016 hauser et al 2017 5 rr p 1 p 0 where p 0 is the probability of an event beyond the threshold in the world that might have been in which there were only nat forcing on the climate p1 is the probability in the actual world including natural and anthropogenic forcing all forcing if rr is larger than 1 that means a strong anthropogenic contribution to the occurrence of this event 3 results 3 1 the uncertainty of gcm simulations of p and pet as the spei is the normalization of the difference in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet the capability of gcms to demonstrate droughts better is related to their performance to capture the patterns of p and pet therefore before comparing the drought changes between all and nat forcing experiments we first evaluated the all forcing representation in the gcms for the actual world we took the monthly p and pet series from cru as the reference data and used the kendall correlation coefficient to test whether the gcms from cmip6 could properly captured the temporal and spatial patterns of monthly p and pet over china s mainland for monthly p the high correlation coefficients with values larger than 0 6 between cru and ensemble mean value of cmip6 are generally located in the strip region from southwest to northeast of china while the lower correlation coefficients are mainly concentrated in northwest of china with most grids having correlation coefficients around 0 2 fig 3 a for monthly pet most of the whole china s mainland have high correlation coefficients with values larger than 0 7 except for southwest china and pearl river basin which the values are around 0 5 fig 3b the monthly p and pet between cru and all forcing are showing significant correlations over china more than 98 grids significant level 0 05 during the study period of 1961 2014 the average monthly p and pet in all forcing experiment also show homogeneous spatial distribution with those of cru figure s1 lower p value concentrated in the north of china and higher p value in the south of china especially in the southeast coast the pet over the tibetan plateau and the east of northeastern china is lower and the pet over the northwestern china and the north china plain is higher generally the ensemble mean data of cmip6 show positive and significant correlation with the reference data which suggesting that they could represent the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of monthly p and pet series of china 3 2 the effects of acc on different drought characteristics 3 2 1 drought frequency in fig 4 we present the maps of drought frequency under two forcing experiments taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ the geographic distribution of drought frequency over china is different under nat and all in nat condition the drought frequency was distributed evenly mainly maintain 33 4 for all condition the drought frequency shows significant variations higher frequency concentrated in the east and south of china and lower frequency located in the west and north of china average drought frequency was 48 7 the difference between all and nat forcing indicating that acc has increased the drought frequency in china by 15 3 averagely fig 4d in terms of the spatial distribution acc plays an important role in slowing down the drought frequency in the northwest of china nwc making it decrease by more than 20 compared with nat condition in the regions of northeast of china nec southwest of china swc and tibetan plateau tp the effects of acc enhanced the drought frequency especially in the swc and part of tp where the drought frequency increased by almost 60 fig 4c 3 2 2 drought duration in fig 5 we present the spatial distribution of average drought duration taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ in nat forcing the average drought duration over china is generally maintains at 7 21 months per drought event fig 5a in all forcing condition the drought duration is increased especially in the nec swc and tp fig 5b averagely the drought duration in all forcing is 11 96 months the grids with abnormal value suggesting that droughts in these regions impacted by anthropogenic activities seriously the drought duration difference between all and nat indicating that the drought duration averagely increased by 4 75 months due to acc spatially acc reduced the drought duration in the nwc causing the drought duration decreased by more than 5 months compared to nat climate system fig 5c in the zones of nec swc and tp acc enhanced the drought duration especially in the region of swc where the drought duration increased by about 10 40 months in most grid points 3 2 3 drought intensity in fig 6 we present the maps of average drought intensity over china taking spei 0 5 as the threshold δ the average intensity difference between all and nat forcing is 9 74 9 37 for nat and 19 11 for all fig 6d which indicating that the effect of acc has enhanced the intensity of drought events almost twice of that only in nat climate system the obvious aggravation effects of acc on drought intensity are also concentrated in the regions of swc and tp especially in swc where the drought intensity increased by about 25 or more in most grids the drought intensity in nwc is slightly reduced fig 6c this is similar with the patterns of acc s impacts on drought frequency and drought duration 3 2 4 affected area by drought in order to further investigate the effects of acc on the affected area by drought we calculated the ratio of months with different range of drought affected area to total month series under four drought degrees during 1961 2014 and the ratio change was illustrated in fig 7 for light drought the difference of drought affected area is not obvious between nat and all climate system and the affected areas mainly maintain in the range of 10 20 with the ratio of 85 both for nat and all the ratios for drought area 10 and drought area 20 are much less fig 7a the ratios pattern varied with the aggravation of drought in the all condition the ratio of drought affected area 10 is less than that in nat condition while the ratios of drought affected area in the range of 10 20 and area 20 are larger than those in nat condition for example the ratios of drought affected area in the range of 10 20 in all are increased by 35 4 39 5 and 25 7 for moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively fig 7b c d especially the ratio of extreme drought affected area 20 is 12 9 which is increased by 11 2 compared with that under nat forcing affected areas by light and moderate drought are mostly larger than the areas affected by severe and extreme drought however in all condition with the impact of anthropogenic activities the ratio pattern of drought affected area exposed to different drought degrees is changed acc has increased the probability of large area exposed to more severe drought especially to the extreme drought events leading to an increasing risk of more underlying surface exposed to drought conditions 3 3 the likelihood of acc s effects on the occurrence of drought events we calculated the probability of drought events with different severity under nat and all condition during 1961 2014 at gridded scale the risk ratio rr was obtained according to eq 4 and the results are shown in fig 8 using spei 0 5 as drought threshold the grids with rr 1 are mainly distributed in the east of 100 e and the maximum rr is located in beijing tianjin hebei province nec south of china and parts of tp the grids of rr 1 are mainly located in the nwc fig 8a this means that the effects of acc mainly intensify the drought in eastern china while in the west region of 100 e and east region of 35 n the alleviation effect of acc for the drought condition is obvious the mean value of rr is 1 47 suggesting that averagely the likelihood of a drought event spei 0 5 over china is 1 5 times higher in the all forcing system we also illustrated the distribution of rr for different severity drought events in the violin plot fig 8b the extreme value of rr is increasing with the increase of drought severity and the average values are 1 90 2 73 and 4 22 for drought events of spei 1 spei 1 5 and spei 2 respectively the more severe the drought events the higher the likelihood that acc will affect its occurrence as it comes to extreme drought the likelihood even increased to 20 times but the grids area is decreasing with the increase of rr value this indicates that acc has a triggering effect on the occurrence of more severe drought over china but the influence has a limited scope 4 discussion 4 1 the discrepancy impacts of anthropogenic warming and acc on p and pet based on the previous analysis we got a simple and straightforward feeling compared with the nat forcing the drought characteristics such as frequency duration intensity and affected area over china were averagely enhanced in the all forcing acc affected the drought related elements such as temperature humidity precipitation and so on to some extent impacted the drought occurrence through land air coupling the combined effects of natural climate variability and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher temperature accompanied by lower humidity and reduced cloud cover van loon and van lanen 2013 van loon et al 2016 the increase of greenhouse gas emissions limits the escape of long wave radiation resulting in an increase in net surface radiation cook et al 2014 atmospheric aerosol and land use changes may also cause variations of net surface radiation qian 2016 feng et al 2019 this in turn has an effect on moisture escape in addition urbanization effects can also affect changes in temperature precipitation and relative humidity chen et al 2011 the ipcc fifth assessment reported that there was a 95 probability that human activities have contributed to global warming over the past 50 years ipcc 2014 global warming is the most prominent feature of climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause for this warming trend but the combined effect of human activities is not only caused by greenhouse gas emissions but also aerosols and other factors we compared the annual p and pet series over china from the ensemble models under nat ghg aer and all forcings ghg means greenhouse gas forcing aer means aerosol forcing from fig 9 we can see that the ensemble mean value of p and pet in the ghg abbreviated as p ghg and pet ghg and similar in other experiments are all higher than those in nat and all forcing and the annual p ghg shows significant increase tendency p 0 05 with rate of 7 6 mm 10a meanwhile the combined effects of temperature wind speed radiation and humidity lead to the same significant upward trend for pet ghg with the rate of 9 7 mm 10a which is lightly larger than the rate of p ghg this means that ghg may lead the extent of water deficit p pet increased year by year aggravated the drought condition of china the trend of p all and p nat shows decrease tendency and the trend of pet all and pet nat shows increase tendency the linear trends of p all and pet all 0 2 mm 10a and 1 9 mm 10a are higher than nat it implies that acc has both increased the average pet of temperature sensitive and precipitation over china but the increase magnitude in the rise rate of pet 2 2 mm 10a 0 3 mm 10a 1 9 mm 10a is greater than that of p 0 4 mm 10a 0 6 mm 10a 0 2 mm 10a anthropogenic activities caused the increased rate of water scarcity 1 7 mm per decade which is slightly less than that of ghg 2 1 mm 10a this may be related with the effect of aerosol forcing where the annual p aer and pet aer are all showing significant decreasing tendency 8 8 mm 10a and 6 8 mm 10a during the study periods the greenhouse effect reduces the long wave radiation reflected back to the atmosphere from the earth s surface and increases the surface radiation temperature significantly which will undoubtedly increase the water evaporation rate under a certain threshold of warming the precipitation will also increase while the climate effect of aerosols will reduce the radiation reaching the ground then drop the upper tropospheric temperature wang et al 2019 which will offset the warming effect brought by greenhouse gases to some extent for example the gradual increase of anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the northern hemisphere plays a decisive role in the weakening of the asian summer monsoon liu et al 2019a which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of drought over eastern china fig 8 as cox et al 2008 indicated that the decreasing aerosol pollution had increased the amazonian drought risk globally lin et al 2018 suggested that the aerosol emissions reduction would increase p but it has little impact on global aridity due to offsetting effects on pet finally the complex interactions of acc may have mitigated the exacerbation of drought compared with that only caused by global warming 4 2 the effect of acc on climate zones over china based on the aridity index ai which is the ratio of annual p to pet six sub climate zones are divided arid ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 semi humid 0 65 ai 0 8 humid 0 8 ai 1 and very humid ai 1 unep 1993 the distribution pattern of the six sub climate zones is similar between the nat and all forcing figure s2 however the change trends of ai in each sub climate zones show obvious difference fig 10 based on the sen s slope and manner kendall mk trend method the ai values over arid semi arid and dry sub humid zones showing increasing trends during 1961 2014 and the increase rate is higher in all forcing while the ai values over humid and very humid zones represent decreasing tendency and the decreasing area over south of china is larger in all forcing the arid zones over northern china indicate a wetting trend and the humid zones over southern china show a drying trend this is somewhat reinforced by acc with larger grids of significant trends than the nat forcing condition for instance the significant decreasing trend area in very humid zone is extended from swc to sichuan and qinghai provinces for the arid region in the west of 100 e a warming and wetting tend during last decades was also reported by many researches shi et al 2003 li et al 2016 peng and zhou 2017 zhao et al 2020 in the south of tp the arid areas showed a tendency of wetting whereas the humid areas exhibited a trend of drying liu et al 2019b precipitation was the dominant factor for the variations of ai in all climate regions li et al 2019b acc may influence the characteristics of changes in meteorological elements through the land atmosphere complex interactions 4 3 the diversity effect of acc on the drought over different regions of china compared with nat forcing condition the drought characteristics in all forcing climate system were changed and varied in different regions of china as for the swc the droughts were more severe it was reported that relatively higher risk of drought in yunnan was observed during the past 60 years 1951 2012 liu et al 2014 we selected the disaster record of 2009 2010 southwest drought from sep 2009 to apr 2010 as an example the sub figures figure s3 illustrated the evolution of this drought record using the mean spei value within every two months in the nat forcing fig s3a c e g only light and moderate droughts are mainly detected in the south of yunnan province and the north of sichuan province while under the all forcing fig s3b d f h severe and extreme drought events are detected in yunnan guizhou sichuan chongqing and guangxi which are consisted with the report in bulletin of flood and drought disasters in china 2010 http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb zgshzhgb this indicates that the 2009 2010 southwest drought event was driven by external natural forcing superimposed with acc ma et al 2017 indicated that dry and warm meteorological conditions seen during the 2009 autumn drought due to anthropogenic global warming zhang et al 2021 indicated that the emergence time of anthropogenic forcing in extreme drought occurrence and affected area in southeast asian monsoon region occurs around the 1960s for part of tp region which is near the upstream of yarlung zangbo river basin the drought conditions were also deteriorated in all forcing system this is consistent with the result of li et al 2019a the west of tp was reported becoming drier and the drier tendency caused by rising temperature had the highest negative contribution rate for vegetation growth wang et al 2021 combined with the altered precipitation patterns the ecological drought was intensified jiao et al 2021 the drought characteristics over nwc were mitigated in the all forcing climate system this is consistent with the effect of warming and wetting trend in this region based on the spi yang et al 2017 also suggested that the drought condition in northwest of china presented a mitigated trend in order to understand the impact of acc on the drought mitigation of nwc the spei in nat forcing spei nat and in all forcing spei all in the range of 73 25 e 96 26 e 34 25 n 49 25 n were extracted figure s4 shows the change of average monthly spei nat and spei all series the fluctuations of spei series are consistent under the two forcing systems but the spei all curve lies above spei nat which indicates the drought events in all identified by spei are milder than nat condition the nwc is characterized by scarce precipitation and high evaporation during the recent 54 years the change of annual p in the selected area shows an increasing trend under all forcing condition fig s5c which is more obvious than that in nat fig s5a especially after 1990 before 1990 the annual pet series shows stable fluctuating patterns after 1990 the significant increasing trends are detected in nat and all fig s5b d this indicating that the increased precipitation may be the reason for the drought mitigation over nwc during the decades anthropogenic forcing affects the atmospheric circulation both enhance the precipitation and temperature in the west of northwestern china wang et al 2018 the melting of mountain glaciers and the rising of river or lake levels due to global warming and aerosol emissions may have also increased local anthropogenic climate effects ren et al 2016 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of anthropogenic climate change acc on the drought characteristics over china using the ensemble mean dataset from two experiments of cmip6 nat and all forcing during the period of 1961 2014 based on the risk ratio rr method the likelihood of drought occurrence impacted by acc was also analyzed acc enhanced the drought frequency 15 3 drought duration 4 7 months drought intensity 9 74 respectively averagely over china spatially the acc s inverse effects on drought were mainly concentrated in the northwest and southwest of china besides acc has also increased the risk of widespread higher degree drought events over china especially for extreme drought over 54 years the probability of extreme droughts affected area 20 in all forcing has increased by 11 2 compared with that in nat acc has increased the occurrence likelihood of drought events spei 0 5 almost 1 5 times than nat forcing over china the more severe the drought event the greater the impact of acc on its likelihood of occurrence the results presented in this study highlighted the potential effects of acc in the changes of drought characteristic over china drought events in most regions of china are associated with acc especially in the northwest and southwest of china which reflecting the combined complex effects of natural variability and anthropogenic activities on drought
