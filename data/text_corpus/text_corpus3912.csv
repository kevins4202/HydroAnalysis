focused on the photocatalytic generation of carbon centered radicals in the presence of oxalate formate ketones or alcohols for contaminant degradation however little attention has been paid to the contribution of spontaneously formed ars to reductively degrade pollutants in the ps activation system during free radical quenching studies and related mechanism and control factors in this process are poorly understood due to extensive use of quenching studies in the identification of types of radical in the advanced oxidation processes such as fenton or ps activation fang et al 2013b 2017a highlighting the contribution of ars to pollutant degradation is important to identify the types of radicals in quenching reactions particularly for some halogenated pollutants this is because the reactivity of ars towards target contaminants can influence the efficiency of contaminant degradation and ultimately affect the results of distinguishing the types of free radical in quenching studies the main objectives of this study were 1 to identify the formation of ars in the radical quenching process with alcohols in the ps activation process and 2 to examine the contribution of ars to contaminant degradation and the related mechanism in the ps heat alcohol system the selected compounds were based on their reactivity toward so4 oh and ars trichloroacetic acid tca was selected as the probe for both so4 oh and ars since it was easily degraded via both reduction and oxidation processes mora et al 2009 phenol and carbon tetrachloride were chosen as probes for so4 oh and ars respectively epr and reducing radical quenching studies were used to detect the free radicals generated during the ps heat process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals trichloroacetic acid 99 phenol 99 carbon tetrachloride 99 sodium persulfate ethanol and tba were obtained at analytical grade from chinese national medicines corporation ltd china deionized water with a resistivity of 18 mω cm 1 was used to prepare the aqueous solutions 2 2 experimental procedure the experiments were conducted in 9 0 ml brown bottles containing 5 0 ml of reaction solution appropriate volumes of the contaminant tca ccl4 or phenol alcohol etoh or tba and ps were sequentially added to achieve the optimal reactant concentrations control experiments without alcohol were performed in parallel to initiate the reaction the temperature of the bottles was raised to 50 c using a thermostatic bath all experiments were conducted in triplicate at fixed time intervals the bottles were removed from the bath and cooled to 0 c by placing them immediately in iced water to quench the reactions the initial ph in all experiments was left unadjusted for experiments under anaerobic conditions before its use the deionized water was purged with argon for 30 min until a dissolved oxygen do concentration lower than 0 10 mg l was reached the anaerobic experiments were performed in an anaerobic cabinet atmosphere 80 nitrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 10 hydrogen electrotek england the degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh system under o2 limited conditions was conducted in 9 0 ml brown bottles with headspace free to prevent the exchange of o2 between air and water 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol tca and ps were analyzed using an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 palo alto california usa the concentration of ccl4 was measured with a gas chromatograph gc agilent 7820 equipped with a ni63 electron capture detection system the

details for analysis are presented in text s1 the dissolved o2 in the solution was analyzed by a dissolved oxygen meter seven2go pro s9 zurich switzerland a ph ion meter thermo orion 5 star massachusetts usa equipped with a ph electrode thermo 911600 was used to monitor solution ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of trichloroacetic acid in a ps alcohol system fig 1 a shows that 80 of tca was degraded with ps only within 24 h at 50 c under an aerobic condition while only 5 or 11 of the initial tca content was removed in the presence of 200 mm etoh or 200 mm tba respectively the results indicated that so4 and oh were responsible for the oxidative degradation of tca in the ps system and that the addition of etoh and tba quenched the so4 and oh radicals thus inhibiting tca degradation it has been reported that thermally activated ps gives rise to the formation of so4 eq 3 mora et al 2009 which further reacts with oh or h2o to form oh eqs 1 and 2 and both so4 and oh accounted for the degradation of contaminants fang et al 2013c zhu et al 2016 du et al 2017 but in the presence of alcohols the scavenging of so4 and oh could produce ars via the following reactions liang and su 2009 3 s 2 o 8 2 heat 2s o 4 4 s o 4 c h 3 c h 2 oh ch c h 3 oh s o 4 2 h 1 6 7 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 5 s o 4 c h 3 3 coh ch 2 ch 3 2 coh s o 4 2 h 4 9 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 6 o h c h 2 c h 3 oh ch c h

however tca degradation was insignificant in the ps alcohol o2 system the most possible reason is that ars are typical reducing radicals 23 42 which may react with dissolved o2 first in the reaction system to further test this hypothesis the degradation of tca was evaluated in a ps alcohol system in an anoxic condition fig 1b as expected tca was efficiently degraded in those conditions and 76 and 41 of tca was degraded in the presence of etoh and tba respectively these values are in line with the one obtained in the system without quenchers 80 the results confirm that ars are the dominant radicals contributing to tca degradation in the absence of o2 furthermore etoh was more efficient in enhancing tca degradation than tba this effect was considered to be linked with the marked variation of the concentration and reactivity of ars in this process and will be discussed in more detail in the following sections 3 2 identification of main radicals for tca degradation under anaerobic condition 3 2 1 epr and free radical quenching studies fig 2 a shows a significant epr signal with intensity of 1 2 2 1 in the ps heat system which was assigned to dmpo oh while there is no signal relative to dmpo so4 was observed although dmpo so4 had been reported to coexist with dmpo oh in the previous epr studies wei et al 2017 these results were probably due to a conversion of so4 to oh under the relatively high temperature 50 c conditions adopted in the present experiment furthermore the epr signal of dmpo oh was usually significant higher than that of dmpo so4 due to relatively stronger trapping ability of dmpo for oh wei et al 2017 consequently epr signal of dmpo so4 was not significant in the present study the signal of dmpo oh was greatly reduced with the addition of etoh while a new dmpo adduct signal was formed with peak intensity ratios of 1 1 1 1 1 1 fig 2a that are characteristic of dmpo chch3oh as can be determined from their hyperfine splitting constants ah 22 7 g an 15 7 g fang et al 2013b the results indicated that so4 and oh could induce the formation of etoh radical in the presence of etoh there are quick reactions between ars and ccl4 because ccl4 is a good electron scavenger gonzalez et al 2007 to directly examine the reductive degradation of tca with ars ccl4 was added in the ps etoh n2 system the tca degradation rate decreased rapidly from 76 to 12 with the addition of ccl4 200 mm fig 2b these results indicated that ccl4 inhibited tca degradation with etoh radical and further confirm that etoh radical was the dominant reactive species under anaerobic conditions 3 2 2 effects of ars on ps decomposition during tca degradation in the ps alcohol systems the electron transfer ability of ars 38 43 favors their reaction with ps resulting in different ps decomposition rates the decomposition rate of ps was 12 without alcohols while it increased to 19 and 44 in the presence of 200 mm tba and 200 mm etoh under aerobic conditions respectively fig 3 a in the absence of o2 the decomposition of ps was increased from 19 to 23 or 44 85 with tba or etoh respectively fig 3b these results further confirm that ars can enhance ps decomposition in this study etoh radical could promote ps decomposition via the following reactions 8 ch c h 3 oh s 2 o 8 2 c h 3 cho s o 4 s o 4 2 h 9 ch c h 3 oh o 2 c h 3 cho h o 2 the etoh radical transfers electrons to ps inducing the radical chain reactions eq 8 briefly the consumption of one molecule of etoh radical produces one molecule of so4 which further reacts with etoh to produce another molecule of etoh radical eq 4 resulting in a significant increased decomposition of ps in the presence of o2 the reaction between etoh radical and o2 eq 9 terminates the chain reactions popov et al 2010 and thus decreases ps consumption as evidenced by the fact that the decomposition of ps decreased from 85 to 44 in the ps etoh system when substituting n2 purging with o2 fig 3b this conclusion is also supported by the free radical quenching studies fig 3c as a quencher of etoh radical ccl4 also inhibited ps decomposition the decomposition of ps reduced from 85 to 20 in the ps etoh n2 system in the presence of ccl4 furthermore etoh had a stronger enhancement effect on ps decomposition than tba in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions this is due to the fact that the second order reaction rate constants of so4 with etoh 1 6 7 1 107 m 1 s 1 was markedly greater than that with tba 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 liang and su 2009 and thus more etoh radical was produced to enhance ps decomposition the decomposition of ps usually decreases solution ph eq 10 the solution ph decreased from 2 88 to 2 30 in the presence of o2 without etoh in ps heat but decreased to 2 06 in the presence of etoh fig s1a under anaerobic conditions the solution ph decreased to 2 01 in ps alone and to 1 85 in ps etoh fig s1b similar results were also observed in the ps tba system the ph changes were consistent with the ps decomposition eq 10 and further suggested the important role of ars 10 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 4s o 4 2 o 2 4 h these combined experimental results confirmed that ars were indeed formed and not only accounted for tca degradation in the absence of o2 but also induced the radical chain reactions which influenced ps decomposition and radical conversion in the ps alcohol system 3 3 contribution of ars to ccl4 degradation in ps alcohol ccl4 can be easily reductive degraded 40 which can be used to further evaluate the reduction ability of ars in ps alcohol the results showed that ccl4 was completely degraded within 8 0 h in the ps etoh n2 system fig 4 a while only 7 of ccl4 was degraded in the ps etoh o2 system after 24 h fig s2 similarly a 70 ccl4 degradation was observed in the ps tba n2 system after 24 h fig 4a while its degradation was insignificant in the ps tba o2 system fig s2 the concentration of released cl during the reductive degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh n2 system was also detected fig 4b shows that the concentration of cl increased to 1 14 mm after 8 0 h in which ccl4 was degraded the cl concentration remained stable when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h indicating that the reductive degradation of ccl4 caused the release of cl trichloromethane chcl3 was the dominant product of ccl4 in the reductive degradation under anaerobic conditions fig s3a interestingly tetrachloroethene c2cl4 was also formed which was resulted from two electron reduction of ccl4 by the etoh radical to formed ccl2 and ccl2 then recombined to yield c2cl4 gonzalez et al 2007 however no product was detected under aerobic conditions fig s3b these results indicated that ars could degrade ccl4 under anaerobic conditions but o2 would quench ar radicals furthermore it was also observed that 75 of ccl4 was degraded in the ps n2 system while it was not degraded in the ps o2 system the most probable reason was that s2o8 was formed in the reaction between oh so4 and s2o8 2 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 with oh and 6 3 105 m 1 s 1 with so4 fang et al 2017b according to the reaction scheme in the absence of alcohols eqs 11 and 12 it has been reported that s2o8 exhibits the ability to reduce metal ions such as fe iii liu et al 2016a b and thus s2o8 would be the dominant species in ccl4 degradation s2o8 could also initiate the free radical chain reactions via eq 13 which could be quenched by o2 under aerobic conditions however the generation of s2o8 in the reactions of eqs 11 and 12 hardly occurred in the presence of 200 mm alcohol because the reaction rate constant between oh so4 and the alcohol 107 109 m 1 s 1 was significantly higher than that with the ps ion therefore s2o8 was not the dominant radical in ccl4 degradation in the ps alcohol n2 system 11 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 s o 4 2 12 o h s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 o h 13 s 2 o 8 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o s o 4 s o 4 2 2hs o 5 2 h 14 4 s 2 o 8 o 2 6 h 2 o 8hs o 5 4 h the decomposition of ps was also investigated all of ps was decomposed within 8 0 h in the ps etoh n2 system while a 20 decomposition was achieved in the presence of o2 fig 5 these results further suggest that o2 is an effective quencher for ars radical inhibiting ps decomposition by terminating the radical chain reactions as observed in the study of tca degradation fig 3a a significant difference was instead noticed with regards to the effects of ccl4 which did inhibit ps decomposition and quench the ars as had been observed in the ps etoh n2 systems this difference is attributable to the relatively low concentration of ccl4 used in the second set of experiments 1 0 mm furthermore 90 of ccl4 was degraded within 4 0 h and the decomposition of ps was markedly accelerated after 4 0 h confirming that ps decomposition occurred predominantly through the ars mediated radical chain reactions in the absence of quenchers in the presence of tba the decomposition differences of ps between aerobic and anaerobic conditions became insignificant probably due to the lower formation rate of ars resulting from the low reaction rate constant between tba and so4 thus both o2 and ccl4 could quench ars and inhibit ps decomposition meanwhile the changes of solution ph were consistent with the rates of ps decomposition fig s4 3 4 the degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh system under o2 limited condition as discussed earlier ars were quenched by o2 and the contaminant could not be reductively degraded under aerobic conditions although dissolved o2 was consumed during the reactions proceeded it was constantly supplied to the system through the exchange between air and water therefore the role of o2 should be further clarified in this process to make the reaction more environmentally relevant the reaction was carried out in a sealed bottle with headspace free and the solution was air saturated only 8 of the ccl4 was degraded in ps etoh within 2 0 h but the degree of degradation increased sharply to 60 after 4 0 h and to 94 after 6 0 h fig 6 a the results suggest that the degradation of ccl4 was initially slow but then increased as the degradation proceeded the concentration of do decreased dramatically from 7 56 mg l to 1 86 mg l 0 94 mg l and 0 12 mg l after reaction for 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 h respectively fig 6a the results were consistent with the observations in ccl4 degradation which had shown that most of ccl4 degradation occurred after 2 0 h and the concentration of do decreased less than 0 94 mg l this may be explained in terms of the effect of o2 on quenching of etoh radical and inhibition of ccl4 at the beginning of the reaction on the other hand the reaction between etoh and ccl4 became significant as o2 was consumed which resulted in the rapid degradation of ccl4 as the reaction proceeded these results suggested that do concentration greatly impacted the reductive degradation of ccl4 by ars the concentration of do also affected the decomposition of ps which occurred at a low rate at the beginning of the reaction and then at a higher rate after the do was removed fig s5 furthermore increasing the concentration of oh so4 by increasing ps concentration during the heat activation also increases the concentration of etoh radicals and the consumption rate of do the concentration of do decreased rapidly from 7 56 to 0 18 mg l with 100 mm ps after 20 min of reaction fig 6b correspondingly the extent of ccl4 degradation rapidly increased from 0 to 56 and 97 after 20 min and 60 min reactions respectively it is concluded that ars especially the etoh radical can consume do more importantly etoh radical could further degrade ccl4 after the complete consumption of o2 these combined experimental results indicated that the contribution of ars in the degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons organochlorine pesticides and nitrobenzene should be considered under o2 limited conditions in free radical quenching studies during ps activation 3 5 the role of ars in phenol degradation in the ps alcohol system fig 7 a shows that 56 of phenol was degraded within 24 h with 10 mm ps while only 7 phenol was degraded with the addition of 200 mm etoh under aerobic conditions the presence of tba had only a slight influence on phenol degradation which indicated that so4 was the predominant radical for phenol degradation under aerobic conditions since the reaction rate of so4 with phenol was much higher than that with tba similar results were found under anaerobic conditions and tba had only a slight effect on phenol degradation while etoh inhibited phenol degradation fig 7b these results indicated that ars cannot degrade phenols in a ps alcohol system in the absence of o2 because the phenols are not degraded via a reduction process 4 conclusions in this study the formation and contribution of ars to different model pollutants were systematically evaluated in free radical quenching studies during ps activation it was found that ars were indeed formed in the quenching experiments and their contribution to contaminant degradation was dependent on the properties of the contaminant and on do concentration for contaminants such as tca and ccl4 which were easily degraded by reduction processes the ars were the dominant radicals in their degradation under anaerobic or o2 limited conditions while they were quenched by o2 and had only a slight ability to degrade contaminants under aerobic conditions for contaminants such as phenol which can be easily degraded by oxidative radicals but not reductive radicals and thus ars could not degrade phenol furthermore ars can not only degrade tca and ccl4 but also induce the radical chain reaction and accelerated the decomposition of ps under anaerobic conditions the findings of this study provide a novel method for the dehalogenation of pollutants during ps activation the results also indicated that the feasibility of using alcohols as quenchers to identify the dominant reactive species for the degradation of halogenated pollutants during ps activation should be reconsidered acknowledgements this work was supported by

bath and cooled to 0 c by placing them immediately in iced water to quench the reactions the initial ph in all experiments was left unadjusted for experiments under anaerobic conditions before its use the deionized water was purged with argon for 30 min until a dissolved oxygen do concentration lower than 0 10 mg l was reached the anaerobic experiments were performed in an anaerobic cabinet atmosphere 80 nitrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 10 hydrogen electrotek england the degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh system under o2 limited conditions was conducted in 9 0 ml brown bottles with headspace free to prevent the exchange of o2 between air and water 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol tca and ps were analyzed using an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 palo alto california usa the concentration of ccl4 was measured with a gas chromatograph gc agilent 7820 equipped with a ni63 electron capture detection system the degradation products of ccl4 were analyzed with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms varian cp 3800 saturn 2200 palo alto california usa after headspace sampling the concentrations of chloride

details for analysis are presented in text s1 the dissolved o2 in the solution was analyzed by a dissolved oxygen meter seven2go pro s9 zurich switzerland a ph ion meter thermo orion 5 star massachusetts usa equipped with a ph electrode thermo 911600 was used to monitor solution ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of trichloroacetic acid in a ps alcohol system fig 1 a shows that 80 of tca was degraded with ps only within 24 h at 50 c under an aerobic condition while only 5 or 11 of the initial tca content was removed in the presence of 200 mm etoh or 200 mm tba respectively the results indicated that so4 and oh were responsible for the oxidative degradation of tca in the ps system and that the addition of etoh and tba quenched the so4 and oh radicals thus inhibiting tca degradation it has been reported that thermally activated ps gives rise to the formation of so4 eq 3 mora et al 2009 which further reacts with oh or h2o to form oh eqs 1 and 2 and both so4 and oh accounted for the degradation of contaminants fang et al 2013c zhu et al 2016 du et al 2017 but in the presence of alcohols the scavenging of so4 and oh could produce ars via the following reactions liang and su 2009 3 s 2 o 8 2 heat 2s o 4 4 s o 4 c h 3 c h 2 oh ch c h 3 oh s o 4 2 h 1 6 7 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 5 s o 4 c h 3 3 coh ch 2 ch 3 2 coh s o 4 2 h 4 9 1 10 5 m 1 s 1 6 o h c h 2 c h 3 oh ch c h

however tca degradation was insignificant in the ps alcohol o2 system the most possible reason is that ars are typical reducing radicals 23 42 which may react with dissolved o2 first in the reaction system to further test this hypothesis the degradation of tca was evaluated in a ps alcohol system in an anoxic condition fig 1b as expected tca was efficiently degraded in those conditions and 76 and 41 of tca was degraded in the presence of etoh and tba respectively these values are in line with the one obtained in the system without quenchers 80 the results confirm that ars are the dominant radicals contributing to tca degradation in the absence of o2 furthermore etoh was more efficient in enhancing tca degradation than tba this effect was considered to be linked with the marked variation of the concentration and reactivity of ars in this process and will be discussed in more detail in the following sections 3 2 identification of main radicals for tca degradation under anaerobic condition 3 2 1 epr and free radical quenching studies fig 2 a shows a significant epr signal with intensity of 1 2 2 1 in the ps heat system which was assigned to dmpo oh while there is no signal relative to dmpo so4 was observed although dmpo so4 had been reported to coexist with dmpo oh in the previous epr studies wei et al 2017 these results were probably due to a conversion of so4 to oh under the relatively high temperature 50 c conditions adopted in the present experiment furthermore the epr signal of dmpo oh was usually significant higher than that of dmpo so4 due to relatively stronger trapping ability of dmpo for oh wei et al 2017 consequently epr signal of dmpo so4 was not significant in the present study the signal of dmpo oh was greatly reduced with the addition of etoh while a new dmpo adduct signal was formed with peak intensity ratios of 1 1 1 1 1 1 fig 2a that are characteristic of dmpo chch3oh as can be determined from their hyperfine splitting constants ah 22 7 g an 15 7 g fang et al 2013b the results indicated that so4 and oh could induce the formation of etoh radical in the presence of etoh there are quick reactions between ars and ccl4 because ccl4 is a good electron scavenger gonzalez et al 2007 to directly examine the reductive degradation of tca with ars ccl4 was added in the ps etoh n2 system the tca degradation rate decreased rapidly from 76 to 12 with the addition of ccl4 200 mm fig 2b these results indicated that ccl4 inhibited tca degradation with etoh radical and further confirm that etoh radical was the dominant reactive species under anaerobic conditions 3 2 2 effects of ars on ps decomposition during tca degradation in the ps alcohol systems the electron transfer ability of ars 38 43 favors their reaction with ps resulting in different ps decomposition rates the decomposition rate of ps was 12 without alcohols while it increased to 19 and 44 in the presence of 200 mm tba and 200 mm etoh under aerobic conditions respectively fig 3 a in the absence of o2 the decomposition of ps was increased from 19 to 23 or 44 85 with tba or etoh respectively fig 3b these results further confirm that ars can enhance ps decomposition in this study etoh radical could promote ps decomposition via the following reactions 8 ch c h 3 oh s 2 o 8 2 c h 3 cho s o 4 s o 4 2 h 9 ch c h 3 oh o 2 c h 3 cho h o 2 the etoh radical transfers electrons to ps inducing the radical chain reactions eq 8 briefly the consumption of one molecule of etoh radical produces one molecule of so4 which further reacts with etoh to produce another molecule of etoh radical eq 4 resulting in a significant increased decomposition of ps in the presence of o2 the reaction between etoh radical and o2 eq 9 terminates the chain reactions popov et al 2010 and thus decreases ps consumption as evidenced by the fact that the decomposition of ps decreased from 85 to 44 in the ps etoh system when substituting n2 purging with o2 fig 3b this conclusion is also supported by the free radical quenching studies fig 3c as a quencher of etoh radical ccl4 also inhibited ps decomposition the decomposition of ps reduced from 85 to 20 in the ps etoh n2 system in the presence of ccl4 furthermore etoh had a stronger enhancement effect on ps decomposition than tba in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions this is due to the fact that the second order reaction rate constants of so4 with etoh 1 6 7 1 107 m 1 s 1 was markedly greater than that with tba 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 liang and su 2009 and thus more etoh radical was produced to enhance ps decomposition the decomposition of ps usually decreases solution ph eq 10 the solution ph decreased from 2 88 to 2 30 in the presence of o2 without etoh in ps heat but decreased to 2 06 in the presence of etoh fig s1a under anaerobic conditions the solution ph decreased to 2 01 in ps alone and to 1 85 in ps etoh fig s1b similar results were also observed in the ps tba system the ph changes were consistent with the ps decomposition eq 10 and further suggested the important role of ars 10 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 4s o 4 2 o 2 4 h these combined experimental results confirmed that ars were indeed formed and not only accounted for tca degradation in the absence of o2 but also induced the radical chain reactions which influenced ps decomposition and radical conversion in the ps alcohol system 3 3 contribution of ars to ccl4 degradation in ps alcohol ccl4 can be easily reductive degraded 40 which can be used to further evaluate the reduction ability of ars in ps alcohol the results showed that ccl4 was completely degraded within 8 0 h in the ps etoh n2 system fig 4 a while only 7 of ccl4 was degraded in the ps etoh o2 system after 24 h fig s2 similarly a 70 ccl4 degradation was observed in the ps tba n2 system after 24 h fig 4a while its degradation was insignificant in the ps tba o2 system fig s2 the concentration of released cl during the reductive degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh n2 system was also detected fig 4b shows that the concentration of cl increased to 1 14 mm after 8 0 h in which ccl4 was degraded the cl concentration remained stable when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h indicating that the reductive degradation of ccl4 caused the release of cl trichloromethane chcl3 was the dominant product of ccl4 in the reductive degradation under anaerobic conditions fig s3a interestingly tetrachloroethene c2cl4 was also formed which was resulted from two electron reduction of ccl4 by the etoh radical to formed ccl2 and ccl2 then recombined to yield c2cl4 gonzalez et al 2007 however no product was detected under aerobic conditions fig s3b these results indicated that ars could degrade ccl4 under anaerobic conditions but o2 would quench ar radicals furthermore it was also observed that 75 of ccl4 was degraded in the ps n2 system while it was not degraded in the ps o2 system the most probable reason was that s2o8 was formed in the reaction between oh so4 and s2o8 2 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 with oh and 6 3 105 m 1 s 1 with so4 fang et al 2017b according to the reaction scheme in the absence of alcohols eqs 11 and 12 it has been reported that s2o8 exhibits the ability to reduce metal ions such as fe iii liu et al 2016a b and thus s2o8 would be the dominant species in ccl4 degradation s2o8 could also initiate the free radical chain reactions via eq 13 which could be quenched by o2 under aerobic conditions however the generation of s2o8 in the reactions of eqs 11 and 12 hardly occurred in the presence of 200 mm alcohol because the reaction rate constant between oh so4 and the alcohol 107 109 m 1 s 1 was significantly higher than that with the ps ion therefore s2o8 was not the dominant radical in ccl4 degradation in the ps alcohol n2 system 11 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 s o 4 2 12 o h s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 8 o h 13 s 2 o 8 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o s o 4 s o 4 2 2hs o 5 2 h 14 4 s 2 o 8 o 2 6 h 2 o 8hs o 5 4 h the decomposition of ps was also investigated all of ps was decomposed within 8 0 h in the ps etoh n2 system while a 20 decomposition was achieved in the presence of o2 fig 5 these results further suggest that o2 is an effective quencher for ars radical inhibiting ps decomposition by terminating the radical chain reactions as observed in the study of tca degradation fig 3a a significant difference was instead noticed with regards to the effects of ccl4 which did inhibit ps decomposition and quench the ars as had been observed in the ps etoh n2 systems this difference is attributable to the relatively low concentration of ccl4 used in the second set of experiments 1 0 mm furthermore 90 of ccl4 was degraded within 4 0 h and the decomposition of ps was markedly accelerated after 4 0 h confirming that ps decomposition occurred predominantly through the ars mediated radical chain reactions in the absence of quenchers in the presence of tba the decomposition differences of ps between aerobic and anaerobic conditions became insignificant probably due to the lower formation rate of ars resulting from the low reaction rate constant between tba and so4 thus both o2 and ccl4 could quench ars and inhibit ps decomposition meanwhile the changes of solution ph were consistent with the rates of ps decomposition fig s4 3 4 the degradation of ccl4 in the ps etoh system under o2 limited condition as discussed earlier ars were quenched by o2 and the contaminant could not be reductively degraded under aerobic conditions although dissolved o2 was consumed during the reactions proceeded it was constantly supplied to the system through the exchange between air and water therefore the role of o2 should be further clarified in this process to make the reaction more environmentally relevant the reaction was carried out in a sealed bottle with headspace free and the solution was air saturated only 8 of the ccl4 was degraded in ps etoh within 2 0 h but the degree of degradation increased sharply to 60 after 4 0 h and to 94 after 6 0 h fig 6 a the results suggest that the degradation of ccl4 was initially slow but then increased as the degradation proceeded the concentration of do decreased dramatically from 7 56 mg l to 1 86 mg l 0 94 mg l and 0 12 mg l after reaction for 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 h respectively fig 6a the results were consistent with the observations in ccl4 degradation which had shown that most of ccl4 degradation occurred after 2 0 h and the concentration of do decreased less than 0 94 mg l this may be explained in terms of the effect of o2 on quenching of etoh radical and inhibition of ccl4 at the beginning of the reaction on the other hand the reaction between etoh and ccl4 became significant as o2 was consumed which resulted in the rapid degradation of ccl4 as the reaction proceeded these results suggested that do concentration greatly impacted the reductive degradation of ccl4 by ars the concentration of do also affected the decomposition of ps which occurred at a low rate at the beginning of the reaction and then at a higher rate after the do was removed fig s5 furthermore increasing the concentration of oh so4 by increasing ps concentration during the heat activation also increases the concentration of etoh radicals and the consumption rate of do the concentration of do decreased rapidly from 7 56 to 0 18 mg l with 100 mm ps after 20 min of reaction fig 6b correspondingly the extent of ccl4 degradation rapidly increased from 0 to 56 and 97 after 20 min and 60 min reactions respectively it is concluded that ars especially the etoh radical can consume do more importantly etoh radical could further degrade ccl4 after the complete consumption of o2 these combined experimental results indicated that the contribution of ars in the degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons organochlorine pesticides and nitrobenzene should be considered under o2 limited conditions in free radical quenching studies during ps activation 3 5 the role of ars in phenol degradation in the ps alcohol system fig 7 a shows that 56 of phenol was degraded within 24 h with 10 mm ps while only 7 phenol was degraded with the addition of 200 mm etoh under aerobic conditions the presence of tba had only a slight influence on phenol degradation which indicated that so4 was the predominant radical for phenol degradation under aerobic conditions since the reaction rate of so4 with phenol was much higher than that with tba similar results were found under anaerobic conditions and tba had only a slight effect on phenol degradation while etoh inhibited phenol degradation fig 7b these results indicated that ars cannot degrade phenols in a ps alcohol system in the absence of o2 because the phenols are not degraded via a reduction process 4 conclusions in this study the formation and contribution of ars to different model pollutants were systematically evaluated in free radical quenching studies during ps activation it was found that ars were indeed formed in the quenching experiments and their contribution to contaminant degradation was dependent on the properties of the contaminant and on do concentration for contaminants such as tca and ccl4 which were easily degraded by reduction processes the ars were the dominant radicals in their degradation under anaerobic or o2 limited conditions while they were quenched by o2 and had only a slight ability to degrade contaminants under aerobic conditions for contaminants such as phenol which can be easily degraded by oxidative radicals but not reductive radicals and thus ars could not degrade phenol furthermore ars can not only degrade tca and ccl4 but also induce the radical chain reaction and accelerated the decomposition of ps under anaerobic conditions the findings of this study provide a novel method for the dehalogenation of pollutants during ps activation the results also indicated that the feasibility of using alcohols as quenchers to identify the dominant reactive species for the degradation of halogenated pollutants during ps activation should be reconsidered acknowledgements this work was supported by

19561,microcystins are the most commonly occurring cyanotoxins and have been extensively studied across the globe in the present study a strongly basic anion exchange resin was employed to investigate the removal of microcystin lr mclr one of the most toxic microcystin variants factors influencing the uptake behavior included the mclr and resin concentrations resin dosage and natural organic matter nom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution of source water nom equivalent background concentration ebc was employed to evaluate the competitive uptake between nom and mclr the experimental data were compared with different mathematical and physical models and pore diffusion was determined as the rate limiting step the resin dose solute concentration ratio played a key role in the mclr uptake process and mclr removal was attributed primarily to electrostatic attractions charge density and molecular weight distribution of the background nom fractions played a major role in mclr removal at lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below where a competitive uptake was observed due to the limited exchange sites further evidences of pore blockage and site reduction were also observed in the presence of humics and larger molecular weight organic fractions where a four fold reduction in the mclr uptake was observed comparable results were obtained for laboratory studies on synthetic laboratory water and surface water under similar conditions given their excellent performance and low cost anion exchange resins are expected to

that complex interactions between warming climate change in rainfall patterns and nutrient cycling in aquatic environment are driving these blooms paerl and paul 2012 cyanobacterial toxins which are released from algal biomass have become a serious environmental and health hazard due to their potential in contaminating drinking recreational and agricultural water resources although numerous types of cyanotoxins have been identified microcystins are the most frequently occurring class of cyanotoxins graham et al 2010 microcystin lr mclr one of the most toxic and frequently detected microcystin

conventional water treatment have a limited ability to eliminate extracellular toxins chow et al 1999 the effectiveness of chemical oxidants such as chlorine or ozone is hindered by the presence of natural organic matter nom inorganic ions and other water constituents rodríguez et al 2007 furthermore the risk of cell lysis and release of intracellular toxins may require additional treatment in addition the presence of nom including algal organic matter produced during blooms influences the removal of cyanobacterial metabolites zamyadi et al 2015 these challenges present the need for alternative treatment technologies capable of cost effective removal of algal toxins nom in aquatic environments is considered to be the main competitor for organic micropollutants and algal toxin removals through adsorption based processes pelekani and snoeyink 1999 quinlivan et al 2005 nom is usually present at concentrations mg l much higher than those of toxins and micropollutants μg l resulting in competition for sorption sites two major mechanisms could contribute to this phenomenon pore blockage and direct competition for active sites both of which are related to the source water

operation scale up or down capabilities small footprint and relatively low cost compared to alternative treatment processes however the applicability of ion exchange resins as a potential pre treatment of algae impacted waters has not received much attention complex competition mechanisms between nom and micropollutants have been proposed and verified over the past few decades to help water treatment processionals select effective activated carbons pelekani and snoeyink 1999 the equivalent background concentration ebc model which derives from the ideal adsorption solution theory iast is one of the most commonly used method for understanding the competitive uptake between nom and micropollutans such as mib geosmin and atrazine on activated carbon ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have been performed to investigate the competitive uptake of nom and microcystin lr on strongly basic ix resins using the ebc model this research was conducted to investigate the efficiency of strongly basic ion exchange resins purolite a860 for the removal of mclr inorganic ions as well as three reference nom isolates spiked in synthetic aqueous matrices the influence of operating parameters such as ph and contact time on the adsorption capacity of the resin was also studied the competitive uptake between nom fractions and mclr were evaluated using the ebc method moreover the impact of nom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution on the uptake of mclr was investigated in this study

uptake of mclr in the presence of different nom fractions was investigated to provide an understanding of the capacity and efficacy of the resin a860 for mclr removal from different water matrices further studies were performed at lower resin concentrations in order to investigate competitive behavior and therefore the selected dosages were well below the commercial operational dosages which are as high as 4500 mg l 20 ml l kabsch korbutowicz et al 2008 the doc removal followed the order srnom srha plfa i e in the order of the increasing charge density of these respective fractions fig 1 a for 1000 mg l 4 5 ml l resin dosage previous studies have indicated that charge density and molecular weight distribution of nom play key roles in the uptake process by ix resins bazri et al 2016a bazri and mohseni 2016 however for lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below the lower charge density fraction plfa 700 da 6 meq g c shows higher doc removal in comparison to srha 1500 da 8 meq g c which might be due to the blockage of resin pores and channels caused by higher molecular weight srha fractions bazri and mohseni 2016 the removal of mclr in the presence and absence of nom fractions after 24 h of contact time is depicted in fig 1 b it can be seen that the toxin uptake improved with increasing resin dosage from 10 mg l to 1000 mg l 0 05 ml l to 4 5 ml l for all investigated water matrices this is in agreement with previous studies where the availability of higher surface area and more active sites at higher resin concentrations resulted in greater contaminant uptake dixit et al 2018 to evaluate the competitive nom uptake resin dosages of 10 50 200 500 and 1000 mg l corresponding to an approximate dose ratio of 1 1 5 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 meq meq resin contaminants were tested it can be observed that mclr uptake is significantly affected by the presence of nom fractions in the water matrix especially at lower resin dosages i e 200 mg l 1 meq ml and below for instance at the lowest resin dosage of 10 mg l with an initial srnom of 3 mg c l toxin uptake was reduced twofold from 80 in di water to approximately 40 in particular nom fractions with higher charge densities can impact the uptake of cyanotoxins and micropollutants through competitive uptake mechanisms higher mclr removal was observed in the presence of a lower charge density fraction plfa as compared to other nom fractions with the same initial doc concentration 3 mg c l for all the investigated resin dosages below 200 mg l presence of highly charged srnom decreased the toxin removal from 80 in di water to approximately 40 50 and 70 at resin dosages of 10 mg l 50 mg l and 200 mg l 0 05 ml l 0 23 ml l and 0 91 ml l respectively moreover the difference in mclr removal in presence of different nom fractions is quite evident at lower resin dosages for instance it can be observed that at a resin dosage of 10 mg l 0 05 ml l approximately 40 mclr is removed in presence of srnom and 58 mclr is removed in presence of plfa which is a lower charge density fraction p 0 05 thus it can be concluded that increasing the charge density of organic fraction leads to a decrease in toxin uptake at lower resin dosages however as illustrated in fig 1 a and b for all the 3 nom matrices srha srnom and plfa the mclr removal was 99 at a dosage of 1000 mg l 4 5 ml l and the difference between the mclr removal in presence of different nom fractions at 1000 mg l dosage was not statistically significant p 0 05 noteworthy at dosages of 500 mg l and 1000 mg l 2 3 ml l and 4 5 ml l the ratio of exchangeable resin sites to the total contaminant milli equivalents meq meq was 10 1 and above resin charge density 0 8 meq ml therefore at higher resin dosages in presence of excess exchange sites the competitive effect was not evident evidence of pore restrictions and pore blockage was observed in the presence of higher molecular weight fraction organics i e srha where the toxin removal decreased by eight folds from 80 in di water to approximately 10 at a dosage of 10 mg l this is also evident from the doc reduction where dosages 500 mg l were required to obtain 99 mclr and 80 doc reduction even though the exchange sites are approximately 50 times more abundant than the total contaminant concentration meq the pore restriction and blockage by higher molecular weight fractions leads to a significant reduction in the actual number of exchange sites mergen et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 further evidence of pore blocking is also observed in presence of srha as depicted in fig 2 c here the lc ocd reveal that the removal of organic compounds from srha is significantly lower than srnom at similar resin dosages the mercury porosimetery tests on the resin see si table a 2 reveals that micropores 2 nm occupy approximately 25 of the resin pore volume mesopores 2 50 nm occupy 55 and the remaining 20 of the pore volume is macropores 50 nm the median pore diameter of the resin is approximately 6 nm with an average pore diameter of 7 2 nm indicating a high presence of primary mesopores 2 8 nm connected to micropores 2 nm through inner pores and channels it has been well documented by previous studies that the uptake of organic molecules involves diffusion through inner pores and channels of the resin and a similar behavior can be expected for mclr bazri et al 2016a 2016b at any given angle the possible length of mclr molecule is in the range of 2 94 nm to 1 4 nm sathishkumar et al 2010 therefore the mclr molecule has the capacity of accessing some of the resin micropores and the majority of resin mesopores median 6 nm the hydrodynamic diameter of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa a compound with an apparent average molecular weight of 1070 da was reported in the range of 0 8 nm 5 8 nm with the majority of fractions 4 nm and an average diameter of 2 nm determined through ultraviolet uv flouroscence fl detection wells 2015 therefore certain srfa fractions block the resin micropores but the majority of the resin mesopores 6 nm pores will not be blocked by srfa since its maximum dimension is 5 8 nm srnom with an average molecular weight of 1030 da is expected to exhibit a similar hydrodynamic diameter however it can be assumed that the higher molecular weight fractions of srha 2000 da 40 of initial doc according to lc ocd are capable of blocking the resin micropores and most of the resin mesopores thereby resulting in the lower observed removal of mclr and doc thus the competitive uptake of mclr is not only dependent upon the charge density of the background nom fraction but also and more importantly on the nom molecular weight distribution in experiments evaluating mclr removal in nom free waters more than 80 removal co 100 μg mclr l is observed in di water for all the resin dosages tested 10 50 200 500 and 1000 mg l moreover the toxin uptake capacity could reach as high as approximately 3800 μg g resin dosage 10 mg l for all the investigated conditions the highest tested dosage of 1000 mg l achieved more than 99 mclr removal and more than 80 doc reduction ix treatment provided a final mclr concentration of 0 2 μg l a value well below health canada guideline of 1 5 μg l and the epa standard of 0 3 μg l health canada 2016 usepa 2015 therefore a complete toxin elimination is expected from source water at commercial dosages which are two to five times higher than the investigated dosages moreover our previous studies have indicated that the resin exhibits excellent performance over multiple loading cycles with nom rich waters especially when regenerated after 2000 bed volumes bv of operation dixit et al 2018 thus ix process exhibits a great potential for practical applications targeting the removal of algal toxins and nom from bloom laden waters 3 2 isotherm studies in order to investigate the distribution of mclr molecules on the resin and obtain the theoretical adsorption capacity adsorption isotherm results were fitted to the freundlich model qe kf ce 1 n parameters are provided in table 1 the high values of regression coefficients obtained for all the matrices indicate that equilibrium isotherms were well described by the freundlich model fig 2 a the synergistic adsorption mechanisms of hydrophobic effects cation π bonding and π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions between the organic contaminants influence the uptake of mclr onto the resin and incline the system towards heterogeneous adsorption the 1 n values for all the water matrices were in the range of 0 6 0 9 indicating weak interactions between the resin and mclr dada et al 2012 as the charge density of background nom increased in the source waters the values of 1 n decreased slightly from 0 63 to 0 51 the most important effect was observed on the values of k f which declined from 28 mg g l mg 1 n in buffered mq water to 2 8 mg g l mg 1 n in the presence of plfa 3 mg c l increasing the charge density by testing srnom further decreased k f from 2 8 to 0 6 approximately a 5 fold decrease similarly using srha a higher molecular weight nom fraction further decreased the k f from 2 8 to 0 5 approximately a 6 fold decrease to further clarify the nom effect the equivalent background compound ebc method was used and the ebc parameters kebc 1 nebc and coebc were determined as previously described newcombe et al 2002 the ebc model has been used in the past to predict the adsorption isotherms of competing compounds under known isotherms of the target compound in presence and absence of nom ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 the multicomponent interactions are predicted using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast described below where k ebc and 1 n ebc are the freundlich single solute isotherm parameters for ebc and k m and 1 n m are single solute isotherm parameters for the micropollutant coebc was determined using the following equations 3 1 c m e q m e q m e q e b c e n m q m e n e b c q e b c e n m k m n m 3 2 c e b c e q e b c e q m e q e b c e n m q m e n e b c q e b c e n m k m n e b c the 1 n ebc was held constant at 0 60 and the obtained ebc concentrations of respective compounds coebc in μmol l are summarized in table 1 the values of c oebc were found to be in the order srnom plfa srha approximately 0 23 μmol l of srnom a higher charge density fraction 10 meq g c competes with mclr for the active sites while it is 0 16 μmol l for plfa 6 8 meq g c a 1 5 fold decrease in the concentration of competing compounds therefore it can be observed that the concentration of competing compounds increases with increasing charge density in the present study the authors have presented the cebc values in μmol l while studies by other researchers with activated carbon have often reported cebc values in mg l with a hypothesis that the compounds with similar shape and size are the most competitive for active sites ebie et al 2001 the hypothesis is true for studies with activated carbon since it is very well established that micropollutants are sorbed in pores of similar sizes on activated carbon ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 however sorption on ix resins is majorly based on electrostatic sorption rather than hydrophobic therefore there is a high possibility that small nom molecules say 0 5 nm can get sorbed into larger micropores 2 nm mesopores 20 nm or even marcopores 50 nm since the resin surface is highly charged 0 8 meq ml consequently using 1000 da mclr 995 da as the definition of competition might be incorrect for ix resins nevertheless for comparison the cebc values for srnom plfa and srha were determined based on the assumption of 1000 da as the molecular weight of competing compounds the calculated values for srnom plfa and srha were 0 12 mg l 0 08 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively noteworthy the c ebc concentrations are 5 of the initial nom concentration 3 mg c l of these respective compounds therefore only a small fraction of the total organic compounds present in the solution compete with mclr for active sites the ebc modelling results for srnom and plfa were in good agreement with literature findings where competitive concentrations of 10 of initial doc have been reported for geosmin mib and atrazine cook et al 2001 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 however there were few discrepancies with the higher molecular weight fraction srha increasing molecular weight of nom fractions resulted in a decrease in the concentration of competing compounds where only 0 09 μmol l srha the compound with the highest average molecular weight distribution 1520 da competed with mclr for active sites a 2 5 fold decrease compared to srnom 0 23 μmol l 1030 da this is in contradiction to the observed experimental results depicted in fig 1 b where lower toxin removal is observed in presence of srha this discrepancy originates from the lack of knowledge about the particular nom component which accounts for the majority of competitive effect and its adsorption characteristics the crucial components of the nom might not show the same behavior as the bulk of the nom and the use of bulk parameters such as doc might be inappropriate under these circumstances newcombe et al 2002 the nom from plfa data not shown 500 da 1200 da and srnom were less diverse majorly 600 2000 da fig 2 b than srha 500 da 4000 da fig 2 c selection of bulk doc as the isotherm of competing compound in a diverse nom background for srha might have resulted in the discrepancy for the aforementioned reasons further reductions in the removal of mclr in presence of srha can be attributed to pore blocking which has been discussed in details in earlier sections majorly since the ebc modelling does not incorporate pore blocking as a competitive mechanism newcombe et al 2002 based on observed results it can be concluded that the ebc model does not provide a comprehensive answer to the competitive uptake on ix resins majorly in presence of diverse and higher molecular weight nom fractions nevertheless it provides a good estimate of competition under certain nom matrices therefore it can be concluded that the competition arises mostly from the differences in the charge densities of the respective nom fractions as determined by the ebc modelling which is in agreement with literature findings on nom uptake in absence of pore blocking phenomenon arias paic et al 2016 bazri and mohseni 2016 3 3 kinetic studies as depicted in fig 3 a a rapid uptake of around 60 removal was achieved within 5 min with the initial toxin concentration of 25 μg l in di water whereas 60 of mclr was removed after 60 min in the presence of different nom fractions rapid diffusion into the resin pores and availability of large number of vacant sites might have resulted in this initial rapid uptake in nom free water bazri and mohseni 2016 in general the 60 min toxin uptake followed the order mclr di mclr plfa mclr srnom mclr srha the experimental data were fitted to a pseudo first order kinetics a pseudo second order kinetics and the intraparticle diffusion models to further investigate the mclr removal process table 2 the highest k 1 and k 2 values were observed in the absence of nom for all the investigated conditions overall the pseudo second order kinetics model was found to provide the best fit to the data refer to fig 3 a and 3 b as observed earlier the charge density and molecular weight distribution of nom also play vital roles in the uptake of contaminants by the ix process the pseudo second order kinetics rate constant i e k 2 plfa was nearly 1 5 fold greater than k 2 mclr plfa this observation can be attributed to the steeper concentration gradient of plfa molecules initial concentration plfa 3 mg c l in comparison to 25 μg mclr l resulting in a faster diffusion of the smaller molecular weight plfa molecules 700 da vs 995 da into the inner pores and channels of the resin resulting in a competitive uptake zhang et al 2014 increasing the charge density by using srnom 1 4 fold increase resulted in a further decrease of the pseudo second order rate constant value k 2 mclr srnom 1 3 fold decrease nom characteristics also influence the mclr equilibrium loading pseudo second order q e values the observed q e values for mclr decreased from approximately 130 μg g in di water to approximately 100 μg g in the presence of srnom table 2 as depicted in fig 3 a and b more than 40 of doc was reduced for both plfa and srnom water matrix during the first 30 min of operation the q e values obtained for nom fractions were orders of magnitude higher than the values for mclr indicating a large coverage of resin sites for instance the q e value for plfa surface concentration was approximately 6500 μg g 1 8 10 2 meq meq in comparison to that for the mclr concentration of approximately 100 μg g 3 10 5 meq meq table 2 a nom fraction with higher molecular weight fractions srha 1 5 fold increase in average molecular weight reduced the q e values to approximately 50 μg g 1 5 10 5 meq meq a two fold decrease noteworthy as observed in table 2 here the uptake of competing nom compounds was approximately 3800 μg g 1 4 10 2 meq meq which was approximately 1 5 fold lower than the doc uptake capacities observed in the presence of lower molecular weight fractions 1400 da for srha vs 1030 da for srnom and 700 da for plfa supporting the previous arguments made on evidences of pore blockage in the presence of larger molecules most of the resin macropores and primary mesopores are blocked by the uptake of charged bulky organic groups resulting in underutilization of smaller sized mesopore volume and the associated surface area of the resin ebie et al 2001 the intraparticle diffusion model ipd was used to examine the impact of film diffusion and intra particle diffusion mechanism described on the basis of eq 3 3 weber and morris 1963 3 3 qt kid t1 2 where q t is the time dependent adsorbate concentration on the resin μg g k id is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant μg g min1 2 and t is the contact time the calculated values of k id were 13 1 12 8 and 7 3 μg g min1 2 for di water plfa and srnom with 25 μg l initial mclr concentration respectively in the presence of background srha the value of k id was reduced further to 4 1 μg g min1 2 according to the model assumptions the plot of qt vs t1 2 should be linear if intra particle diffusion is involved in the process hu et al 2015 the r2 values of the intra particle diffusion model for all conditions tested listed in table 2 are high 0 9 indicating that intra particle diffusion is involved in the uptake process the rate controlling step was further investigated using the dimensionless biot number bi which is the ratio of internal mass transfer i e pore diffusion to external mass transfer i e film diffusion resistances ko et al 2001 3 4 b i k f r p d p e where k f cm s is the external mass transfer coefficient kf df δ and df cm2 s is the film diffusion coefficient and d pe cm2 s is effective pore diffusion coefficient δ is film thickness 10 3 cm according to helfferich 1965 parameters were estimated by fitting the pore diffusion pdm and film diffusion modelling fdm equations to the kinetic data using nonlinear optimization schemes as reported elsewhere bazri and mohseni 2016 resin beads were assumed to be spherical with an average radius r p of 375 μm resin size range reported by the manufacturer rp 150 600 μm the bi 1 indicates film diffusion as the rate limiting step where bi 1 shows pore diffusion to be the rate limiting step the biot numbers for mclr in di water are 1 for initial mclr concentrations of 25 μg l and below at a resin dosage of 200 mg l and below fig 3 c meq meq of 4 10 8 and below the biot numbers obtained for mclr in the presence of plfa srha and srnom were 59 61 and 70 respectively indicating the uptake kinetics is controlled primarily by intraparticle diffusion in the presence of nom fractions the uptake of nom fractions was also controlled by intraparticle diffusion bi 500 for all tested conditions with an initial resin dosage of 200 mg l 0 9 ml l note that in nom free waters both intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion govern the mclr removal process bi 1 in the presence of plfa and srnom about 50 reduction in toxin removal was observed after 20 min of contact time with 30 reduction in the doc and uv254 absorbing compounds increasing the contact time to 60 min further resulted in 70 reduction in mclr with approximately 55 doc reduction therefore it can be concluded that in the presence of smaller molecular weight and highly charged compounds increasing the contact time or increasing the resin dosage can improve the toxin uptake however for srha increasing the contact time did not improve the toxin and doc removal to a significant extent due to excessive pore blockage produced by higher molecular weight fractions therefore for matrices with higher molecular weight nom fractions an increase in resin dosage would be a better option as opposed to increasing the contact time it should be noted that a significant portion of the doc and uv254 absorbing compounds is also removed by the resin which can favor the performance of downstream oxidation processes hence ix could simultaneously remove mclr as well as serve as pretreatment for downstream oxidative processes 3 4 comparative study with eagle lake surface water the effectiveness of the resin with natural waters was investigated using the raw and treated waters from the eagle lake el water treatment plant city of west vancouver canada the treated water underwent treatment involving 50 μm screening followed by coagulation poly aluminum chloride low dose 20 mg l and sodium hydroxide 25 flocculation and ultra filtration uf membrane treatment the raw surface water had a doc of 3 2 mg l and a ph 7 0 0 3 with 5 mg l sulphate ions the rationale for the selection of this specific water source was that it was an actual drinking water source with nom whose characteristics were similar to the organic fractions that were used previously in the laboratory studies srnom and the el raw water nom had similar molecular weight distributions with an averages of 1030 da and 1050 da respectively size exclusion chromatography data not shown p 0 05 similarly plfa and el uf treated water nom had average molecular weights of 680 da and 700 da respectively data not shown p 0 05 further there was no statistical difference p 0 05 in the mclr uptake on changing the source water ph from ph 4 to ph 7 however there was a consistent decrease in the doc uptake p 0 05 in the ph 4 80 doc removal to ph 7 70 doc removal range see si figure a 1 the pseudo second order kinetic parameters and removals measured after 60 min of contact time at a dosage of 200 mg l are presented in table 3 comparative results were obtained for the laboratory and surface water samples for instance the pseudo second order q e values for mclr uptake from el uf and plfa were approximately 112 and 117 μg g respectively the kinetic rate constants for these aqueous matrices were also not statistically different p 0 05 in el raw water a lower mclr uptake was observed in comparison to that for the srnom matrix this difference can be explained by the fact that the raw water had 5 mg l of sulphate which was reduced to 1 2 mg l after 60 min of operation a 75 decrease sulphates are well known for their competition with nom for active sites ates and incetan 2013 consequently only 63 mclr and 38 doc removals were obtained in the el water a 1 2 fold decrease compared to srnom with same initial doc as a reference the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant values for mclr decreased 4 folds in di water spiked with 5 mg l sulphate ions without nom data not shown while it decreased only by 1 5 fold with 5 mg c l background srnom in absence of sulphates data not shown at low sulphate concentrations 1 mg l as in the case of el uf filtered water a high correlation between the laboratory and surface water results were observed these results show that the resins are effective for the removal of mclr in the presence of nom and inorganic compounds from surface waters also the results from laboratory scale experiments are comparable to those from the surface water 4 conclusion ix effectively removed mclr and doc from aqueous matrices and a dosage of 1000 mg l 4 ml l was sufficient to get the initial toxin concentration of 100 μg l below the who guideline of 1 μg l for all investigated dosages nom loading on the ix resin reduced the mclr uptake capacity from approximately 3800 μg g to 800 μg g film diffusion was deteremined to be the rate controlling step in nom free water in presence of nom fractions the removal kinetics are controlled by internal pore diffusion charge density and molecular weight distribution of the nom matrix impacted the resin performance the latter being the most influencing factor at lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below the lower molecular weight charged nom fractions 1000 da compete with the mclr molecules for active sites in the interior of the resin while the larger molecular weight compounds reduce the available active sites by pore blocakge the mclr and doc removal performance remained 70 in the ph 4 to ph 7 range furthermore addition of inorganic ions like sulphates reduce the toxin uptake at a given resin dosage finally comparable results are obtained for laboratory studies on synthetic laboratory water and surface water as long as the nom chracteristics and sulphate concentrations were similar further studies should assess the resin performance over multiple treatment cycles toxic brine

19561,microcystins are the most commonly occurring cyanotoxins and have been extensively studied across the globe in the present study a strongly basic anion exchange resin was employed to investigate the removal of microcystin lr mclr one of the most toxic microcystin variants factors influencing the uptake behavior included the mclr and resin concentrations resin dosage and natural organic matter nom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution of source water nom equivalent background concentration ebc was employed to evaluate the competitive uptake between nom and mclr the experimental data were compared with different mathematical and physical models and pore diffusion was determined as the rate limiting step the resin dose solute concentration ratio played a key role in the mclr uptake process and mclr removal was attributed primarily to electrostatic attractions charge density and molecular weight distribution of the background nom fractions played a major role in mclr removal at lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below where a competitive uptake was observed due to the limited exchange sites further evidences of pore blockage and site reduction were also observed in the presence of humics and larger molecular weight organic fractions where a four fold reduction in the mclr uptake was observed comparable results were obtained for laboratory studies on synthetic laboratory water and surface water under similar conditions given their excellent performance and low cost anion exchange resins are expected to present promising potentials for applications involving the removal of removal of algal toxins and nom from surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion exchange microcystins natural organic matter humic acid pore blockage 1 introduction the occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms and lake eutrophication has increased globally over the past two decades scientific studies highlight that complex interactions between warming climate change in rainfall patterns and nutrient cycling in aquatic environment are driving these blooms paerl and paul 2012 cyanobacterial toxins which are released from algal biomass have become a serious environmental and health hazard due to their potential in contaminating drinking recreational and agricultural water resources although numerous types of cyanotoxins have been identified microcystins are the most frequently occurring class of cyanotoxins graham et al 2010 microcystin lr mclr one of the most toxic and frequently detected microcystin is regulated by a health canada guideline of 1 5 μg l and a provisional who guideline value of 1 μg l falconer and humpage 2005 removal of cyanotoxins from water is an important challenge since conventional water treatment have a limited ability to eliminate extracellular toxins chow et al 1999 the effectiveness of chemical oxidants such as chlorine or ozone is hindered by the presence of natural organic matter nom inorganic ions and other water constituents rodríguez et al 2007 furthermore the risk of cell lysis and release of intracellular toxins may require additional treatment in addition the presence of nom including algal organic matter produced during blooms influences the removal of cyanobacterial metabolites zamyadi et al 2015 these challenges present the need for alternative treatment technologies capable of cost effective removal of algal toxins nom in aquatic environments is considered to be the main competitor for organic micropollutants and algal toxin removals through adsorption based processes pelekani and snoeyink 1999 quinlivan et al 2005 nom is usually present at concentrations mg l much higher than those of toxins and micropollutants μg l resulting in competition for sorption sites two major mechanisms could contribute to this phenomenon pore blockage and direct competition for active sites both of which are related to the source water and adsorbents characteristics ando et al 2010 adsorption based processes using carbon based adsorbents sathishkumar et al 2010 clays couto et al 2013 and iron oxide nanoparticles lee and walker 2011 have been previously tested for removing microcystins however problems with high nom competition adsorbent regeneration and design of adsorbents with desired surface chemistry properties remain an important challenge for their commercial application anionic ion exchange ix resins offer a promising and cost effective alternative for removing nom from natural waters containing high dissolved organic carbon doc levels arias paic et al 2016 mergen et al 2008 application of anionic ion exchange ix process to nom removal has received considerable attention because of its effectiveness ease of operation scale up or down capabilities small footprint and relatively low cost compared to alternative treatment processes however the applicability of ion exchange resins as a potential pre treatment of algae impacted waters has not received much attention complex competition mechanisms between nom and micropollutants have been proposed and verified over the past few decades to help water treatment processionals select effective activated carbons pelekani and snoeyink 1999 the equivalent background concentration ebc model which derives from the ideal adsorption solution theory iast is one of the most commonly used method for understanding the competitive uptake between nom and micropollutans such as mib geosmin and atrazine on activated carbon ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have been performed to investigate the competitive uptake of nom and microcystin lr on strongly basic ix resins using the ebc model this research was conducted to investigate the efficiency of strongly basic ion exchange resins purolite a860 for the removal of mclr inorganic ions as well as three reference nom isolates spiked in synthetic aqueous matrices the influence of operating parameters such as ph and contact time on the adsorption capacity of the resin was also studied the competitive uptake between nom fractions and mclr were evaluated using the ebc method moreover the impact of nom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution on the uptake of mclr was investigated in this study subsequently the kinetics of uptake were studied to analyze the rate controlling steps of mclr removal using anionic ix finally a comparative study was performed with a natural surface water to relate the uptake of mclr with the one observed in synthetic water using various reference nom isolates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dry microcystin lr 1 mg powder was purchased from enzo

triplicate experiments were performed for every experimental condition a control sample that included contaminant solution without resin was included and all the samples were analyzed in triplicates 2

uptake of mclr in the presence of different nom fractions was investigated to provide an understanding of the capacity and efficacy of the resin a860 for mclr removal from different water matrices further studies were performed at lower resin concentrations in order to investigate competitive behavior and therefore the selected dosages were well below the commercial operational dosages which are as high as 4500 mg l 20 ml l kabsch korbutowicz et al 2008 the doc removal followed the order srnom srha plfa i e in the order of the increasing charge density of these respective fractions fig 1 a for 1000 mg l 4 5 ml l resin dosage previous studies have indicated that charge density and molecular weight distribution of nom play key roles in the uptake process by ix resins bazri et al 2016a bazri and mohseni 2016 however for lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below the lower charge density fraction plfa 700 da 6 meq g c shows higher doc removal in comparison to srha 1500 da 8 meq g c which might be due to the blockage of resin pores and channels caused by higher molecular weight srha fractions bazri and mohseni 2016 the removal of mclr in the presence and absence of nom fractions after 24 h of contact time is depicted in fig 1 b it can be seen that the toxin uptake improved with increasing resin dosage from 10 mg l to 1000 mg l 0 05 ml l to 4 5 ml l for all investigated water matrices this is in agreement with previous studies where the availability of higher surface area and more active sites at higher resin concentrations resulted in greater contaminant uptake dixit et al 2018 to evaluate the competitive nom uptake resin dosages of 10 50 200 500 and 1000 mg l corresponding to an approximate dose ratio of 1 1 5 1 20 1 50 1 and 100 1 meq meq resin contaminants were tested it can be observed that mclr uptake is significantly affected by the presence of nom fractions in the water matrix especially at lower resin dosages i e 200 mg l 1 meq ml and below for instance at the lowest resin dosage of 10 mg l with an initial srnom of 3 mg c l toxin uptake was reduced twofold from 80 in di water to approximately 40 in particular nom fractions with higher charge densities can impact the uptake of cyanotoxins and micropollutants through competitive uptake mechanisms higher mclr removal was observed in the presence of a lower charge density fraction plfa as compared to other nom fractions with the same initial doc concentration 3 mg c l for all the investigated resin dosages below 200 mg l presence of highly charged srnom decreased the toxin removal from 80 in di water to approximately 40 50 and 70 at resin dosages of 10 mg l 50 mg l and 200 mg l 0 05 ml l 0 23 ml l and 0 91 ml l respectively moreover the difference in mclr removal in presence of different nom fractions is quite evident at lower resin dosages for instance it can be observed that at a resin dosage of 10 mg l 0 05 ml l approximately 40 mclr is removed in presence of srnom and 58 mclr is removed in presence of plfa which is a lower charge density fraction p 0 05 thus it can be concluded that increasing the charge density of organic fraction leads to a decrease in toxin uptake at lower resin dosages however as illustrated in fig 1 a and b for all the 3 nom matrices srha srnom and plfa the mclr removal was 99 at a dosage of 1000 mg l 4 5 ml l and the difference between the mclr removal in presence of different nom fractions at 1000 mg l dosage was not statistically significant p 0 05 noteworthy at dosages of 500 mg l and 1000 mg l 2 3 ml l and 4 5 ml l the ratio of exchangeable resin sites to the total contaminant milli equivalents meq meq was 10 1 and above resin charge density 0 8 meq ml therefore at higher resin dosages in presence of excess exchange sites the competitive effect was not evident evidence of pore restrictions and pore blockage was observed in the presence of higher molecular weight fraction organics i e srha where the toxin removal decreased by eight folds from 80 in di water to approximately 10 at a dosage of 10 mg l this is also evident from the doc reduction where dosages 500 mg l were required to obtain 99 mclr and 80 doc reduction even though the exchange sites are approximately 50 times more abundant than the total contaminant concentration meq the pore restriction and blockage by higher molecular weight fractions leads to a significant reduction in the actual number of exchange sites mergen et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 further evidence of pore blocking is also observed in presence of srha as depicted in fig 2 c here the lc ocd reveal that the removal of organic compounds from srha is significantly lower than srnom at similar resin dosages the mercury porosimetery tests on the resin see si table a 2 reveals that micropores 2 nm occupy approximately 25 of the resin pore volume mesopores 2 50 nm occupy 55 and the remaining 20 of the pore volume is macropores 50 nm the median pore diameter of the resin is approximately 6 nm with an average pore diameter of 7 2 nm indicating a high presence of primary mesopores 2 8 nm connected to micropores 2 nm through inner pores and channels it has been well documented by previous studies that the uptake of organic molecules involves diffusion through inner pores and channels of the resin and a similar behavior can be expected for mclr bazri et al 2016a 2016b at any given angle the possible length of mclr molecule is in the range of 2 94 nm to 1 4 nm sathishkumar et al 2010 therefore the mclr molecule has the capacity of accessing some of the resin micropores and the majority of resin mesopores median 6 nm the hydrodynamic diameter of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa a compound with an apparent average molecular weight of 1070 da was reported in the range of 0 8 nm 5 8 nm with the majority of fractions 4 nm and an average diameter of 2 nm determined through ultraviolet uv flouroscence fl detection wells 2015 therefore certain srfa fractions block the resin micropores but the majority of the resin mesopores 6 nm pores will not be blocked by srfa since its maximum dimension is 5 8 nm srnom with an average molecular weight of 1030 da is expected to exhibit a similar hydrodynamic diameter however it can be assumed that the higher molecular weight fractions of srha 2000 da 40 of initial doc according to lc ocd are capable of blocking the resin micropores and most of the resin mesopores thereby resulting in the lower observed removal of mclr and doc thus the competitive uptake of mclr is not only dependent upon the charge density of the background nom fraction but also and more importantly on the nom molecular weight distribution in experiments evaluating mclr removal in nom free waters more than 80 removal co 100 μg mclr l is observed in di water for all the resin dosages tested 10 50 200 500 and 1000 mg l moreover the toxin uptake capacity could reach as high as approximately 3800 μg g resin dosage 10 mg l for all the investigated conditions the highest tested dosage of 1000 mg l achieved more than 99 mclr removal and more than 80 doc reduction ix treatment provided a final mclr concentration of 0 2 μg l a value well below health canada guideline of 1 5 μg l and the epa standard of 0 3 μg l health canada 2016 usepa 2015 therefore a complete toxin elimination is expected from source water at commercial dosages which are two to five times higher than the investigated dosages moreover our previous studies have indicated that the resin exhibits excellent performance over multiple loading cycles with nom rich waters especially when regenerated after 2000 bed volumes bv of operation dixit et al 2018 thus ix process exhibits a great potential for practical applications targeting the removal of algal toxins and nom from bloom laden waters 3 2 isotherm studies in order to investigate the distribution of mclr molecules on the resin and obtain the theoretical adsorption capacity adsorption isotherm results were fitted to the freundlich model qe kf ce 1 n parameters are provided in table 1 the high values of regression coefficients obtained for all the matrices indicate that equilibrium isotherms were well described by the freundlich model fig 2 a the synergistic adsorption mechanisms of hydrophobic effects cation π bonding and π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions between the organic contaminants influence the uptake of mclr onto the resin and incline the system towards heterogeneous adsorption the 1 n values for all the water matrices were in the range of 0 6 0 9 indicating weak interactions between the resin and mclr dada et al 2012 as the charge density of background nom increased in the source waters the values of 1 n decreased slightly from 0 63 to 0 51 the most important effect was observed on the values of k f which declined from 28 mg g l mg 1 n in buffered mq water to 2 8 mg g l mg 1 n in the presence of plfa 3 mg c l increasing the charge density by testing srnom further decreased k f from 2 8 to 0 6 approximately a 5 fold decrease similarly using srha a higher molecular weight nom fraction further decreased the k f from 2 8 to 0 5 approximately a 6 fold decrease to further clarify the nom effect the equivalent background compound ebc method was used and the ebc parameters kebc 1 nebc and coebc were determined as previously described newcombe et al 2002 the ebc model has been used in the past to predict the adsorption isotherms of competing compounds under known isotherms of the target compound in presence and absence of nom ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 the multicomponent interactions are predicted using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast described below where k ebc and 1 n ebc are the freundlich single solute isotherm parameters for ebc and k m and 1 n m are single solute isotherm parameters for the micropollutant coebc was determined using the following equations 3 1 c m e q m e q m e q e b c e n m q m e n e b c q e b c e n m k m n m 3 2 c e b c e q e b c e q m e q e b c e n m q m e n e b c q e b c e n m k m n e b c the 1 n ebc was held constant at 0 60 and the obtained ebc concentrations of respective compounds coebc in μmol l are summarized in table 1 the values of c oebc were found to be in the order srnom plfa srha approximately 0 23 μmol l of srnom a higher charge density fraction 10 meq g c competes with mclr for the active sites while it is 0 16 μmol l for plfa 6 8 meq g c a 1 5 fold decrease in the concentration of competing compounds therefore it can be observed that the concentration of competing compounds increases with increasing charge density in the present study the authors have presented the cebc values in μmol l while studies by other researchers with activated carbon have often reported cebc values in mg l with a hypothesis that the compounds with similar shape and size are the most competitive for active sites ebie et al 2001 the hypothesis is true for studies with activated carbon since it is very well established that micropollutants are sorbed in pores of similar sizes on activated carbon ebie et al 2001 matsui et al 2012 however sorption on ix resins is majorly based on electrostatic sorption rather than hydrophobic therefore there is a high possibility that small nom molecules say 0 5 nm can get sorbed into larger micropores 2 nm mesopores 20 nm or even marcopores 50 nm since the resin surface is highly charged 0 8 meq ml consequently using 1000 da mclr 995 da as the definition of competition might be incorrect for ix resins nevertheless for comparison the cebc values for srnom plfa and srha were determined based on the assumption of 1000 da as the molecular weight of competing compounds the calculated values for srnom plfa and srha were 0 12 mg l 0 08 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively noteworthy the c ebc concentrations are 5 of the initial nom concentration 3 mg c l of these respective compounds therefore only a small fraction of the total organic compounds present in the solution compete with mclr for active sites the ebc modelling results for srnom and plfa were in good agreement with literature findings where competitive concentrations of 10 of initial doc have been reported for geosmin mib and atrazine cook et al 2001 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 however there were few discrepancies with the higher molecular weight fraction srha increasing molecular weight of nom fractions resulted in a decrease in the concentration of competing compounds where only 0 09 μmol l srha the compound with the highest average molecular weight distribution 1520 da competed with mclr for active sites a 2 5 fold decrease compared to srnom 0 23 μmol l 1030 da this is in contradiction to the observed experimental results depicted in fig 1 b where lower toxin removal is observed in presence of srha this discrepancy originates from the lack of knowledge about the particular nom component which accounts for the majority of competitive effect and its adsorption characteristics the crucial components of the nom might not show the same behavior as the bulk of the nom and the use of bulk parameters such as doc might be inappropriate under these circumstances newcombe et al 2002 the nom from plfa data not shown 500 da 1200 da and srnom were less diverse majorly 600 2000 da fig 2 b than srha 500 da 4000 da fig 2 c selection of bulk doc as the isotherm of competing compound in a diverse nom background for srha might have resulted in the discrepancy for the aforementioned reasons further reductions in the removal of mclr in presence of srha can be attributed to pore blocking which has been discussed in details in earlier sections majorly since the ebc modelling does not incorporate pore blocking as a competitive mechanism newcombe et al 2002 based on observed results it can be concluded that the ebc model does not provide a comprehensive answer to the competitive uptake on ix resins majorly in presence of diverse and higher molecular weight nom fractions nevertheless it provides a good estimate of competition under certain nom matrices therefore it can be concluded that the competition arises mostly from the differences in the charge densities of the respective nom fractions as determined by the ebc modelling which is in agreement with literature findings on nom uptake in absence of pore blocking phenomenon arias paic et al 2016 bazri and mohseni 2016 3 3 kinetic studies as depicted in fig 3 a a rapid uptake of around 60 removal was achieved within 5 min with the initial toxin concentration of 25 μg l in di water whereas 60 of mclr was removed after 60 min in the presence of different nom fractions rapid diffusion into the resin pores and availability of large number of vacant sites might have resulted in this initial rapid uptake in nom free water bazri and mohseni 2016 in general the 60 min toxin uptake followed the order mclr di mclr plfa mclr srnom mclr srha the experimental data were fitted to a pseudo first order kinetics a pseudo second order kinetics and the intraparticle diffusion models to further investigate the mclr removal process table 2 the highest k 1 and k 2 values were observed in the absence of nom for all the investigated conditions overall the pseudo second order kinetics model was found to provide the best fit to the data refer to fig 3 a and 3 b as observed earlier the charge density and molecular weight distribution of nom also play vital roles in the uptake of contaminants by the ix process the pseudo second order kinetics rate constant i e k 2 plfa was nearly 1 5 fold greater than k 2 mclr plfa this observation can be attributed to the steeper concentration gradient of plfa molecules initial concentration plfa 3 mg c l in comparison to 25 μg mclr l resulting in a faster diffusion of the smaller molecular weight plfa molecules 700 da vs 995 da into the inner pores and channels of the resin resulting in a competitive uptake zhang et al 2014 increasing the charge density by using srnom 1 4 fold increase resulted in a further decrease of the pseudo second order rate constant value k 2 mclr srnom 1 3 fold decrease nom characteristics also influence the mclr equilibrium loading pseudo second order q e values the observed q e values for mclr decreased from approximately 130 μg g in di water to approximately 100 μg g in the presence of srnom table 2 as depicted in fig 3 a and b more than 40 of doc was reduced for both plfa and srnom water matrix during the first 30 min of operation the q e values obtained for nom fractions were orders of magnitude higher than the values for mclr indicating a large coverage of resin sites for instance the q e value for plfa surface concentration was approximately 6500 μg g 1 8 10 2 meq meq in comparison to that for the mclr concentration of approximately 100 μg g 3 10 5 meq meq table 2 a nom fraction with higher molecular weight fractions srha 1 5 fold increase in average molecular weight reduced the q e values to approximately 50 μg g 1 5 10 5 meq meq a two fold decrease noteworthy as observed in table 2 here the uptake of competing nom compounds was approximately 3800 μg g 1 4 10 2 meq meq which was approximately 1 5 fold lower than the doc uptake capacities observed in the presence of lower molecular weight fractions 1400 da for srha vs 1030 da for srnom and 700 da for plfa supporting the previous arguments made on evidences of pore blockage in the presence of larger molecules most of the resin macropores and primary mesopores are blocked by the uptake of charged bulky organic groups resulting in underutilization of smaller sized mesopore volume and the associated surface area of the resin ebie et al 2001 the intraparticle diffusion model ipd was used to examine the impact of film diffusion and intra particle diffusion mechanism described on the basis of eq 3 3 weber and morris 1963 3 3 qt kid t1 2 where q t is the time dependent adsorbate concentration on the resin μg g k id is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant μg g min1 2 and t is the contact time the calculated values of k id were 13 1 12 8 and 7 3 μg g min1 2 for di water plfa and srnom with 25 μg l initial mclr concentration respectively in the presence of background srha the value of k id was reduced further to 4 1 μg g min1 2 according to the model assumptions the plot of qt vs t1 2 should be linear if intra particle diffusion is involved in the process hu et al 2015 the r2 values of the intra particle diffusion model for all conditions tested listed in table 2 are high 0 9 indicating that intra particle diffusion is involved in the uptake process the rate controlling step was further investigated using the dimensionless biot number bi which is the ratio of internal mass transfer i e pore diffusion to external mass transfer i e film diffusion resistances ko et al 2001 3 4 b i k f r p d p e where k f cm s is the external mass transfer coefficient kf df δ and df cm2 s is the film diffusion coefficient and d pe cm2 s is effective pore diffusion coefficient δ is film thickness 10 3 cm according to helfferich 1965 parameters were estimated by fitting the pore diffusion pdm and film diffusion modelling fdm equations to the kinetic data using nonlinear optimization schemes as reported elsewhere bazri and mohseni 2016 resin beads were assumed to be spherical with an average radius r p of 375 μm resin size range reported by the manufacturer rp 150 600 μm the bi 1 indicates film diffusion as the rate limiting step where bi 1 shows pore diffusion to be the rate limiting step the biot numbers for mclr in di water are 1 for initial mclr concentrations of 25 μg l and below at a resin dosage of 200 mg l and below fig 3 c meq meq of 4 10 8 and below the biot numbers obtained for mclr in the presence of plfa srha and srnom were 59 61 and 70 respectively indicating the uptake kinetics is controlled primarily by intraparticle diffusion in the presence of nom fractions the uptake of nom fractions was also controlled by intraparticle diffusion bi 500 for all tested conditions with an initial resin dosage of 200 mg l 0 9 ml l note that in nom free waters both intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion govern the mclr removal process bi 1 in the presence of plfa and srnom about 50 reduction in toxin removal was observed after 20 min of contact time with 30 reduction in the doc and uv254 absorbing compounds increasing the contact time to 60 min further resulted in 70 reduction in mclr with approximately 55 doc reduction therefore it can be concluded that in the presence of smaller molecular weight and highly charged compounds increasing the contact time or increasing the resin dosage can improve the toxin uptake however for srha increasing the contact time did not improve the toxin and doc removal to a significant extent due to excessive pore blockage produced by higher molecular weight fractions therefore for matrices with higher molecular weight nom fractions an increase in resin dosage would be a better option as opposed to increasing the contact time it should be noted that a significant portion of the doc and uv254 absorbing compounds is also removed by the resin which can favor the performance of downstream oxidation processes hence ix could simultaneously remove mclr as well as serve as pretreatment for downstream oxidative processes 3 4 comparative study with eagle lake surface water the effectiveness of the resin with natural waters was investigated using the raw and treated waters from the eagle lake el water treatment plant city of west vancouver canada the treated water underwent treatment involving 50 μm screening followed by coagulation poly aluminum chloride low dose 20 mg l and sodium hydroxide 25 flocculation and ultra filtration uf membrane treatment the raw surface water had a doc of 3 2 mg l and a ph 7 0 0 3 with 5 mg l sulphate ions the rationale for the selection of this specific water source was that it was an actual drinking water source with nom whose characteristics were similar to the organic fractions that were used previously in the laboratory studies srnom and the el raw water nom had similar molecular weight distributions with an averages of 1030 da and 1050 da respectively size exclusion chromatography data not shown p 0 05 similarly plfa and el uf treated water nom had average molecular weights of 680 da and 700 da respectively data not shown p 0 05 further there was no statistical difference p 0 05 in the mclr uptake on changing the source water ph from ph 4 to ph 7 however there was a consistent decrease in the doc uptake p 0 05 in the ph 4 80 doc removal to ph 7 70 doc removal range see si figure a 1 the pseudo second order kinetic parameters and removals measured after 60 min of contact time at a dosage of 200 mg l are presented in table 3 comparative results were obtained for the laboratory and surface water samples for instance the pseudo second order q e values for mclr uptake from el uf and plfa were approximately 112 and 117 μg g respectively the kinetic rate constants for these aqueous matrices were also not statistically different p 0 05 in el raw water a lower mclr uptake was observed in comparison to that for the srnom matrix this difference can be explained by the fact that the raw water had 5 mg l of sulphate which was reduced to 1 2 mg l after 60 min of operation a 75 decrease sulphates are well known for their competition with nom for active sites ates and incetan 2013 consequently only 63 mclr and 38 doc removals were obtained in the el water a 1 2 fold decrease compared to srnom with same initial doc as a reference the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant values for mclr decreased 4 folds in di water spiked with 5 mg l sulphate ions without nom data not shown while it decreased only by 1 5 fold with 5 mg c l background srnom in absence of sulphates data not shown at low sulphate concentrations 1 mg l as in the case of el uf filtered water a high correlation between the laboratory and surface water results were observed these results show that the resins are effective for the removal of mclr in the presence of nom and inorganic compounds from surface waters also the results from laboratory scale experiments are comparable to those from the surface water 4 conclusion ix effectively removed mclr and doc from aqueous matrices and a dosage of 1000 mg l 4 ml l was sufficient to get the initial toxin concentration of 100 μg l below the who guideline of 1 μg l for all investigated dosages nom loading on the ix resin reduced the mclr uptake capacity from approximately 3800 μg g to 800 μg g film diffusion was deteremined to be the rate controlling step in nom free water in presence of nom fractions the removal kinetics are controlled by internal pore diffusion charge density and molecular weight distribution of the nom matrix impacted the resin performance the latter being the most influencing factor at lower resin dosages 200 mg l 1 ml l and below the lower molecular weight charged nom fractions 1000 da compete with the mclr molecules for active sites in the interior of the resin while the larger molecular weight compounds reduce the available active sites by pore blocakge the mclr and doc removal performance remained 70 in the ph 4 to ph 7 range furthermore addition of inorganic ions like sulphates reduce the toxin uptake at a given resin dosage finally comparable results are obtained for laboratory studies on synthetic laboratory water and surface water as long as the nom chracteristics and sulphate concentrations were similar further studies should assess the resin performance over multiple treatment cycles toxic brine

19562,legionella pneumophila has been detected in reclaimed water used for spray irrigation of turfgrass in public parks and golf courses this study determined the risks of infection from exposure to various levels of legionella in reclaimed waters considering the method of spray application and the duration and frequency of exposure evaluation of these factors resulted in a risk of infection greater than 1 10 000 for several scenarios when the number of legionella in the reclaimed water exceeded 1000 colony forming units cfu per ml most current guidelines for control of legionella in distribution systems recommend that increased monitoring or remedial action be taken when legionella levels exceed 1000 to 10 000 cfu ml based upon our risk assessment these guidelines seem appropriate for reclaimed water systems where spray irrigation is practiced graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella reclaimed water risk assessment 1 introduction legionella is a water based opportunistic pathogen found naturally in freshwater environments including rivers and lakes in addition it can be found in municipal water supply distribution systems and reclaimed waters leoni et al 2005 ajibode et al 2013 legionellosis commonly known as legionnaires disease frequently results from infection with the bacterium legionella pneumophila the disease includes a serious sometimes lethal form of pneumonia and the less serious pontiac fever that results in self limiting flu like illness despite the fact that many cases are likely unreported or undiagnosed recent estimates are that legionnaires disease accounts for between 3 and 6 of community acquired pneumonia that occur in the united kingdom and united states each year moore et al 2015 the disease typically occurs following inhalation of droplets or aerosols containing legionella bacteria that are deposited in the lungs droplets range in size from five to 100 μm which normally only travel a few feet in the air osterholm et al 2015 in contrast true aerosols are 5 μm and can travel greater distances through the air thus aerosols released from water sources such as spas or sprayed mists used for cooling are potential routes of exposure to legionella water based pathogens including legionella are frequently found in reclaimed waters in a recent study ajibode et al 2013 detected legionella spp in 40 of 432 samples of all samples collected from a reclaimed water distribution system from two utilities in the southwest usa over a one year period in some samples legionella concentrations reached 228 000 100 ml in arid regions reclaimed wastewaters are commonly used for landscape irrigation of parks golf courses playgrounds and home lawns metcalf and eddy inc 2003 spray or sprinkler irrigation being the method of application of choice for grass lawns this creates an opportunity for the aerosolization of legionella and subsequent exposure by inhalation to assess this potential route of transmission we applied quantitative microbial risk assessment haas et al 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 quantitative microbial risk assessment the risk assessment paradigm involves four basic steps hazard identification exposure assessment dose response and risk characterization however there are uncertainties associated with each of these steps when assessing the public health risk from legionella whiley et al 2014 this is particularly true for assessing the exposure to legionella via reclaimed water since exposure via spray irrigation will not only depend on the concentration of legionella in the reclaimed water but also the size of the droplets or aerosols produced during irrigation the distance from the spray source and the duration of exposure 2 1 1 dose response to date there have been no studies conducted with humans to develop a dose response model for legionella however there have been studies done on animals that provide surrogate dose response data most of the animal studies conducted to evaluate the effects of inhalation exposure of legionella have used the guinea pig cavia porcellus as the common testing animal model to predict the effects on humans based on comparative in vitro macrophage studies and cell mediated immunology on multiple animal species guinea pigs were found to be the most suitable animal model for human risk assessment of legionella pneumophila kliment 1973 deposition of aerosols 5 μm in the alveolar macrophages spaces of both guinea pigs and humans resulted in the same response to legionella pneumophila thus the guinea pig which shares with humans a susceptibility to lung infection with l pneumophila is an excellent animal model for the study of legionnaires disease kliment 1973 berendt et al 1980 davis et al 1982 breiman and horwitz 1987 thus data from these studies have been used to assess the infectivity of various doses of legionella armstrong and haas 2007 2008 for exposure in our study we considered a number of factors including the potential concentrations of legionella within reclaimed water which we obtained from a previous study conducted in our laboratory ajibode et al 2013 when guinea pigs are exposed to aerosols of l pneumophila they develop a pneumonic illness characterized by fever weight loss and labored respirations that sometimes results in death this syndrome resembles legionnaires disease in humans berendt et al 1980 baskerville et al 1981 breiman and horwitz 1987 berendt et al 1980 carried out experiments to determine the infectivity and lethality of exposure to l pneumophila using guinea pigs muller et al 1983 repeated the dose response experiments except that they anesthetized the guinea pigs after exposure to l pneumophila and tested their lungs and spines for infection breiman and horwitz 1987 exposed guinea pigs to aerosols generated by a pump that projected a suspension of l pneumophila into the air for 30 min by examining the lungs of the animals after sacrifice the number of l pneumophila inhaled and retained by the animals was determined allowing for the effects of specific numbers of inhaled legionella on the animals to be determined based on an analysis of these studies we used the muller et al 1983 experimental dataset in this current study to develop the dose response model since their experiment predicted infections when the guinea pigs were sacrificed before mortality and hence these data better represented the infection dose rather than mortality this is the same dataset that was used by armstrong and haas 2007 maximum likelihood estimates mle were used to fit the measured data to exponential and beta poisson statistical models the exponential model is expressed as equation 1 1 r 1 e x p k d where r is the probability of risk of infection r esponse decimal k is the infectivity per viable l pneumophila concentration inhaled and retained cfu d is the d ose of viable l pneumophila that is inhaled and retained cfu the beta poisson model can be estimated by equation 2 in which α and β are constants and r is again the probability of risk of infection 2 r 1 1 d β α for both models the solver routine in microsoft excel program microsoft inc redmond wa was used to optimize the models by varying the k value in equation 1 and α and β in equation 2 here the objective was to maximize likelihood given the observed and the expected probability of infection a likelihood ratio test was used to assess model fit the null hypothesis test states that there is no statistically significant difference between the observed and the expected probability values for the respective dose the research hypothesis assumes that there is a significant statistical difference in at least one observed and expected probability value for the respective dose the test statistic used is the χ2 the rejection region of the null hypothesis is defined based on rejection area of 0 05 and a degree of freedom dose group minus1 and the exponential and the dose group minus 2 the test statistics for both models were equal as shown in fig 1 which means that equation 1 with k 0 058836 or equation 2 with α 1 13 107 and β 1 98 108 can be used thus both the exponential and beta poison does response models predict the same probality of infection for the same dose fig 2 shows the dose response model for inhaled l pneumophila cfu data represent both the exponential and the beta poison dose response models as shown in equations 3 and 4 both equations give the same probability of infection for similar doses armstrong and haas 2007 concluded that these two models are appropriate for low doses exposures for mechanistic reason for l pneumophila our assessment confirmed their results and we used the exponential model in our study 3

spray particles or droplets of variable size the size of water droplets is critical for determining the distance that the droplets will be transported through the air and as predicted by stoke s law the smaller the droplet size the further the droplets will be transported in addition as the size of spray droplets decrease their numbers increase and the potential for drift also increases overall the characteristics of sprinkler nozzle such as type fan angle orifice size and sprinkler operational pressure all influence droplet size kinkaid et al 1996 measured droplet size for different sprinkler nozzles with different configurations and different operational pressures using a laser optical method they derived an exponential function with parameters that are measurable to define droplet size distribution the function is shown as equation 5 below 5 p v 100 1 e x p 0 693 d d 50 n where d droplet diameter mm p v percent of total discharge in drops smaller than d d 50 volume mean drop diameter mm n dimensionless exponent using equation 5 to determine percent of total discharge by 75 different sprinkler types and configurations in drops less than d 10 μm and using the parameters provided by kinkaid et al 1996 yields a list of 75 values that can be used to determine the percent of total discharge by the sprinkler system of drops smaller than 10 μm the bootstrapping routine in the r language r core team 2013 with 100 000 iterations was used to determine the statistical distribution of the aerosol particles generated fig 3 the average distribution of total discharge by the sprinkler system with drops smaller than 10 μm was 0 01572 and the 95 confidence interval ci was 0 0116 0 0220 2 2 2 drift distance due to wind wolf et al 2013 sprayed water at 206 8 kilo pascal 30 pounds per square inch pressure and measured water droplet drift distances as a function of droplet size with relative humidity of 75 temperature of 23 9 c 75 f and wind speed of 2 235 m per second 5 mile per hour humidity and temperature will affect droplet size over distance depending on the distant traveled ordinary linear regression was performed on the data in table 1 and

19562,legionella pneumophila has been detected in reclaimed water used for spray irrigation of turfgrass in public parks and golf courses this study determined the risks of infection from exposure to various levels of legionella in reclaimed waters considering the method of spray application and the duration and frequency of exposure evaluation of these factors resulted in a risk of infection greater than 1 10 000 for several scenarios when the number of legionella in the reclaimed water exceeded 1000 colony forming units cfu per ml most current guidelines for control of legionella in distribution systems recommend that increased monitoring or remedial action be taken when legionella levels exceed 1000 to 10 000 cfu ml based upon our risk assessment these guidelines seem appropriate for reclaimed water systems where spray irrigation is practiced graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella reclaimed water risk assessment 1 introduction legionella is a water based opportunistic pathogen found naturally in freshwater environments including rivers and lakes in addition it can be found in municipal water supply distribution systems and reclaimed waters leoni et al 2005 ajibode et al 2013 legionellosis commonly known as legionnaires disease frequently results from infection with the bacterium legionella pneumophila the disease includes a serious sometimes lethal form of pneumonia and the less serious pontiac fever that results in self limiting flu like illness despite the fact that many cases are likely unreported or undiagnosed recent estimates are that legionnaires disease accounts for between 3 and 6 of community acquired pneumonia that occur in the united kingdom and united states each year moore et al 2015 the disease typically occurs following inhalation of droplets or aerosols containing legionella bacteria that are deposited in the lungs droplets range in size from five to 100 μm which normally only travel a few feet in the air osterholm et al 2015 in contrast true aerosols are 5 μm and can travel greater distances through the air thus aerosols released from water sources such as spas or sprayed mists used for cooling are potential routes of exposure to legionella water based pathogens including legionella are frequently found in reclaimed waters in a recent study ajibode et al 2013 detected legionella spp in 40 of 432 samples of all samples collected from a reclaimed water distribution system from two utilities in the southwest usa over a one year period in some samples legionella concentrations reached 228 000 100 ml in arid regions reclaimed wastewaters are commonly used for landscape irrigation of parks golf courses playgrounds and home lawns metcalf and eddy inc 2003 spray or sprinkler irrigation being the method of application of choice for grass lawns this creates an opportunity for the aerosolization of legionella and subsequent exposure by inhalation to assess this potential route of transmission we applied quantitative microbial risk assessment haas et al 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 quantitative microbial risk assessment the risk assessment paradigm involves four basic steps hazard identification exposure assessment dose response and risk characterization however there are uncertainties associated with each of these steps when assessing the public health risk from legionella whiley et al 2014 this is particularly true for assessing the exposure to legionella via reclaimed water since exposure via spray irrigation will not only depend on the concentration of legionella in the reclaimed water but also the size of the droplets or aerosols produced during irrigation the distance from the spray source and the duration of exposure 2 1 1 dose response to date there have been no studies conducted with humans to develop a dose response model for legionella however there have been studies done on animals that provide surrogate dose response data most of the animal studies conducted to evaluate the effects of inhalation exposure of legionella have used the guinea pig cavia porcellus as the common testing animal model to predict the effects on humans based on comparative in vitro macrophage studies and cell mediated immunology on multiple animal species guinea pigs were found to be the most suitable animal model for human risk assessment of legionella pneumophila kliment 1973 deposition of aerosols 5 μm in the alveolar macrophages spaces of both guinea pigs and humans resulted in the same response to legionella pneumophila thus the guinea pig which shares with humans a susceptibility to lung infection with l pneumophila is an excellent animal model for the study of legionnaires disease kliment 1973 berendt et al 1980 davis et al 1982 breiman and horwitz 1987 thus data from these studies have been used to assess the infectivity of various doses of legionella armstrong and haas 2007 2008 for exposure in our study we considered a number of factors including the potential concentrations of legionella within reclaimed water which we obtained from a previous study conducted in our laboratory ajibode et al 2013 when guinea pigs are exposed to aerosols of l pneumophila they develop a pneumonic illness characterized by fever weight loss and labored respirations that sometimes results in death this syndrome resembles legionnaires disease in humans berendt et al 1980 baskerville et al 1981 breiman and horwitz 1987 berendt et al 1980 carried out experiments to determine the infectivity and lethality of exposure to l pneumophila using guinea pigs muller et al 1983 repeated the dose response experiments except that they anesthetized the guinea pigs after exposure to l pneumophila and tested their lungs and spines for infection breiman and horwitz 1987 exposed guinea pigs to aerosols generated by a pump that projected a suspension of l pneumophila into the air for 30 min by examining the lungs of the animals after sacrifice the number of l pneumophila inhaled and retained by the animals was determined allowing for the effects of specific numbers of inhaled legionella on the animals to be determined based on an analysis of these studies we used the muller et al 1983 experimental dataset in this current study to develop the dose response model since their experiment predicted infections when the guinea pigs were sacrificed before mortality and hence these data better represented the infection dose rather than mortality this is the same dataset that was used by armstrong and haas 2007 maximum likelihood estimates mle were used to fit the measured data to exponential and beta poisson statistical models the exponential model is expressed as equation 1 1 r 1 e x p k d where r is the probability of risk of infection r esponse decimal k is the infectivity per viable l pneumophila concentration inhaled and retained cfu d is the d ose of viable l pneumophila that is inhaled and retained cfu the beta poisson model can be estimated by equation 2 in which α and β are constants and r is again the probability of risk of infection 2 r 1 1 d β α for both models the solver routine in microsoft excel program microsoft inc redmond wa was used to optimize the models by varying the k value in equation 1 and α and β in equation 2 here the objective was to maximize likelihood given the observed and the expected probability of infection a likelihood ratio test was used to assess model fit the null hypothesis test states that there is no statistically significant difference between the observed and the expected probability values for the respective dose the research hypothesis assumes that there is a significant statistical difference in at least one observed and expected probability value for the respective dose the test statistic used is the χ2 the rejection region of the null hypothesis is defined based on rejection area of 0 05 and a degree of freedom dose group minus1 and the exponential and the dose group minus 2 the test statistics for both models were equal as shown in fig 1 which means that equation 1 with k 0 058836 or equation 2 with α 1 13 107 and β 1 98 108 can be used thus both the exponential and beta poison does response models predict the same probality of infection for the same dose fig 2 shows the dose response model for inhaled l pneumophila cfu data represent both the exponential and the beta poison dose response models as shown in equations 3 and 4 both equations give the same probability of infection for similar doses armstrong and haas 2007 concluded that these two models are appropriate for low doses exposures for mechanistic reason for l pneumophila our assessment confirmed their results and we used the exponential model in our study 3

spray particles or droplets of variable size the size of water droplets is critical for determining the distance that the droplets will be transported through the air and as predicted by stoke s law the smaller the droplet size the further the droplets will be transported in addition as the size of spray droplets decrease their numbers increase and the potential for drift also increases overall the characteristics of sprinkler nozzle such as type fan angle orifice size and sprinkler operational pressure all influence droplet size kinkaid et al 1996 measured droplet size for different sprinkler nozzles with different configurations and different operational pressures using a laser optical method they derived an exponential function with parameters that are measurable to define droplet size distribution the function is shown as equation 5 below 5 p v 100 1 e x p 0 693 d d 50 n where d droplet diameter mm p v percent of total discharge in drops smaller than d d 50 volume mean drop diameter mm n dimensionless exponent using equation 5 to determine percent of total discharge by 75 different sprinkler types and configurations in drops less than d 10 μm and using the parameters provided by kinkaid et al 1996 yields a list of 75 values that can be used to determine the percent of total discharge by the sprinkler system of drops smaller than 10 μm the bootstrapping routine in the r language r core team 2013 with 100 000 iterations was used to determine the statistical distribution of the aerosol particles generated fig 3 the average distribution of total discharge by the sprinkler system with drops smaller than 10 μm was 0 01572 and the 95 confidence interval ci was 0 0116 0 0220 2 2 2 drift distance due to wind wolf et al 2013 sprayed water at 206 8

overall higher percentage of impervious cover 6 5 or greater developed or agricultural land table 1 2 2 water sample collection and analysis from 1999 to 2013 typically bi monthly water samples were collected from each of the 31 monitoring stations in the 20 rivers by massdep s strategic monitoring and assessment for river basin teams smart program staff generally there was one monitoring station for each river however for larger rivers such as the nashua and ware rivers one or more stations were added to address anticipated changes in water quality associated with major sources of pollutants to minimize spatial correlation within a river with multiple sampling stations only data from the downstream most station were analyzed legendre and fortin 1989 chang 2008 sprague and lorenz 2009 grab

patton and kryskalla 2003 tp samples were collected in plastic bottles preserved with acid and stored in a cooler with ice before being transported to massdep s environmental laboratory the william x wall experimental station wes for analysis tp concentration was analyzed with the orthophosphate in the alkaline persulfate digestion method patton and kryskalla 2003 the method detection limit mdl was 0 005 mg l half of the mdl was used in the statistical analyses when the tp concentration was below the mdl although it is the observed tp concentrations and other biological indicators that are analyzed to determine the presence or absence of significant impacts on water quality massachusetts department of environmental protection 2016 a trend analysis was also conducted on the flow adjusted tp concentrations because these values can provide insight into the effects of changes in streamflow and climate on in stream nutrient concentrations sprague and lorenz 2009 viviano et al 2014 2017

et al 2000 liang et al 2014 stow et al 2015 wan et al 2017 2 3 environmental protection and conservation projects data collection many water pollution control actions have been enacted in massachusetts since the 1972 clean water act that may have resulted in reduced nutrient concentrations in surface waters pollution abatement programs include the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits for waste water treatment plants wwtp and other point source discharges the massachusetts division of ecological restoration der habitat restoration projects the implementation of the u s department of agriculture s natural resource conservation service nrcs best management practices and the us environmental protection agency s epa 319 federal grant program for non point source mitigation projects additional actions include key legislative vehicles such as the wetlands 1972 and rivers 1996 protection acts these programs and practices have had varied effects on the tp levels in each river surveyed as point sources such as wwtps can be major sources of tp in any given river watershed information on wwtp effluent pollutant limits and facility treatment upgrades and other industrial discharges were included in this study because of their potentially significant impact on downstream tp concentration the massachusetts der has implemented numerous projects in the smart watersheds that may have reduced the concentrations of tp the nrcs has completed the most projects to reduce pollutants many of which are directly related to preserving forests for silviculture the epa s 319 project grants directed by massdep may also contribute to tp reductions in these rivers the locations of wwtp and industrial surface water discharges as well as massachusetts der restoration projects were provided by massdep gis and der respectively commonwealth of massachusetts 2016a nrcs data were collected from the nrcs agricultural control projects massachusetts department of environmental protection 2013 these location data formed the basis of a functional map indicating the potential sources of tp inputs and reductions this map was instrumental in identifying the potential impacts of the many and varied protection and restoration activities on the measured tp reductions in the massachusetts rivers in this study 2 4 statistical analysis the typically bi monthly data collected for the 20 rivers were used to examine the long term trend of tp concentrations since kolmogorov smirnov tests demonstrated that tp concentrations for each river were not normally distributed p 0 01 the nonparametric kendall s correlation was used to examine whether there was any trend in tp from 1999 to 2013 for each river zar 1996 kendall s tau b is a nonparametric measure of association based on the number of concordances and discordances in paired observations concordance occurs when paired observations vary together and discordance occurs when paired observations vary differently analysis of covariance ancova was used to examine the difference in tp concentrations between the least and highly impacted rivers within the study time period 1999 2013 all tests used the significance level of α 0 05 and high significance level of α 0 01 and these statistics were performed using sas version 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc principal component analysis pca was used to examine the relationship between tp reduction delta p the difference between the annual mean tp concentration at the beginning and of monitoring of each river and the landuse parameters in the contributing watershed i e development natural land and impervious surface coverage pca was also used to elucidate the potential association between delta p and restoration activities pca was performed using primer version 6 primer e multivariate statistics for ecologists albany auckland new zealand since these environmental variables were not expressed in the same scale all variables were normalized i e the values for each variable have their mean subtracted and are divided by their standard deviation before pca was conducted 3 results 3 1 long term trend of tp concentrations in central massachusetts rivers at the beginning of this project 1999 2000 the median observed tp for the central massachusetts rivers sampled was 0 045 mg l at the end of the project 2013 the median tp concentration had decreased to 0 019 mg l in 2000 the average tp in 9 of the 20 rivers was greater than 0 05 mg l and in 6 of these the average tp exceeded 0 1 mg l by 2013 the average tp of only 3 rivers exceeded 0 05 mg l and none was greater than 0 1 mg l the kendall s correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant trend of tp concentration reduction in 18 out of the 20 rivers while in two rivers the swift and the west rivers they did not table 2 the mean tp reduction rate for the 18 rivers was 58 4 ranging from 29 8 to 82 8 during the survey period a comparable trend was observed when analyses were conducted on flow adjusted tp concentrations kendall s correlation coefficients in the two methods are presented in table 2 pca demonstrates that the rivers categorized as least impacted exhibited smaller reductions in tp concentrations fig 2 indeed ancova analysis results fig 3 mirrored the pca results i e a significantly faster rate of tp decline was measured in highly impacted rivers kendall correlation coefficient 0 215 p 0 0001 while the decline rate in the least impacted rivers was slightly lower kendall correlation coefficient 0 181 p 0 0001 the analyses also showed that the difference in tp reduction between the two types of rivers highly and least impacted was highly significant ancova f2 1449 115 29 p 0 0001 fig 3 3 2 link between the decline of tp concentration and environmental restoration activities the many clean water act related conservation practices and projects the lower effluent limits established in wwtp and other discharge permits and the epa 319 and other grant projects have highly likely resulted in significantly lower tp concentrations in rivers in central massachusetts figs 4 and 5 in total there are 8986 nrcs project 37 epa 319 projects 46 wwtp facilities 61 other discharges mainly industrial point sources and 8 der habitat restoration projects within these river basins table 3 generally more nutrient management and conservation projects were found in watersheds with greater human disturbance fig 4 and table 3 for example there were no epa 319 projects and fewer wwtps in the seven least impacted river basins pca analysis indicated more epa 319 projects wwtp and other discharge permits in the watersheds of rivers with higher rates of tp decline i e delta p fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 decline of tp concentrations and nutrient management actions the trends in tp concentrations in 18 of the 20 central massachusetts rivers studied are decreasing slightly to moderately trends show that some of the rivers have larger fluctuations in tp concentrations than others as shown in figs 2 and 3 the reduction of tp in rivers with the greatest anthropogenic impacts categorized as highly impacted was more significant since reductions in tp concentrations were also detected in most of the least impacted rivers however slight other conditions could be impacting nutrient levels in these watersheds such as changing landuse or climate given that massachusetts has a rapidly growing population 6 3 million in 2000 to 6 5 million in 2010 which represents an increase in potential sources of tp the expected result is an increase in tp levels thus the decline of tp concentrations quantified in the study is likely to have resulted from reductions in anthropogenic sources of phosphorus such as advances in wastewater treatment as well as other changes in point and non point source management practices figs 4 and 5 in particular the highly impacted central massachusetts rivers exhibited greater reductions in tp concentrations while least impacted rivers had smaller tp reductions as shown by the greater rates of decline in highly impacted rivers correlation coefficients in table 2 and pca result in fig 2 ancova analysis showed similar results fig 3 more conservation and restoration activities occurred in the highly impacted rivers and their watersheds figs 4 and 5 and table 3 the only two rivers without significant declines in tp concentrations were categorized as least impacted i e the swift and west rivers and low tp concentrations were consistently measured in these rivers throughout the 14 year study period usgs also reported decreasing tp concentrations in the assabet river from 2008 to 2014 savoie et al 2016 and the blackstone river from 1979 to 2015 savoie et al 2017 major treatment plant upgrants and numerous restoration activities were undertaken in these watersheds in those decades although the united states has largely controlled sewage discharges and has acted to constrain fertilizer run off in recent decades to protect relatively pristine waters and restore deteriorated waterbodies haygarth et al 2014 powers et al 2016 a recent report on streams and lakes especially those oligotrophic streams including a few from massachusetts in the conterminous u s showed increasing tp concentrations from 2000 to 2014 stoddard et al 2016 these authors suggested that the rising tp in undeveloped catchment areas cannot be entirely attributed to either point or common non point sources of phosphorus another project that targeted midwest and northeast lakes demonstrated that there had been no significant change in tp concentrations in the massachusetts lakes studied and concluded that water quality in midwest and northeast lakes had neither degraded nor improved significantly despite large management efforts and environmental changes over recent decades oliver et al 2017 contrary to these results our long term study suggests that management of point and non point sources of pollution in massachusetts rivers especially those categorized as highly impacted in this study fig 5 has been measurably effective in improving water quality the study also found that these significant reductions in stream phosphorus occurred despite the increased anthropogenic sources associated with the concurrent increase in population and development in the study area numerous sources hve reported that cultural nutrient inputs to u s streams changed significantly during the last three decades of the 20th century raike et al 2003 smith and schindler 2009 zhang et al 2013 kreiling and houser 2016 wang et al 2016 advances in wastewater treatment and state wide phosphate detergent bans have greatly reduced municipal point sources of nutrients to streams litke 1999 beginning in the mid 1990s public water suppliers in massachusetts added phosphate to the treatment train to prevent pipe corrosion this phosphorus usually ends up in wastewater treatment plants diffuse non point sources of nutrients including fertilizer and fossil fuel emissions have varied considerably since the 1980s soil conservation and government sponsored retirements of farmland and other conservation projects such as the epa 319 grants nrcs and state agencies also have combined to reduce non point source nutrient pollution sometimes a more comprehensive management strategy is needed to better address nutrient enrichment for example in upper austrian rivers phosphorus concentrations are increasing despite considerable improvements in enhanced phosphorus removal from wastewater and through implementation of an agriculture environmental program increases result from changes in land use and cultivated crop types to offset increases due to erosion driven emissions zessner et al 2016 in addition monitoring is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different environmental protection activities the clean water act section 106 grant program for example is designed to enchant monitoring programs and provide valid reports on water conditions and section 106 is generally used for funding state environmental program staff salaries developing tmdls updating water quality standards and enforce permits in massachusetts the annual investment from the us epa for section 106 is about 3 2 million and the cost for major water protection and restoration programs is around 248 million a year although no similar long term tp data have been collected from surface waters in western and eastern massachusetts it is likely that tp concentrations in the majority of massachusetts rivers may also be declining due to the same factors and sources described for the central massachusetts rivers in this article fig 4 although protection and restoration efforts are ongoing many rivers continue to be impaired by nutrients and other stressors and additional work is needed to further improve water quality in massachusetts 4 2 upgrade of wwtps and other point source dischargers discharges from wwtps can have the greatest influence on instream tp levels controlling anthropogenic eutrophication in freshwater by reducing point sources of tp is one of the greatest success stories in managing eutrophic waters schindler 2006 as exemplified by the significant reduction of tp loads to the assabet river in the present study there are no municipal wwtp discharges to the swift river above the study area one of the only two rivers without a significant tp reduction trend table 2 there are 145 wwtps in massachusetts with npdes permits that specify effluent limits or require monitoring for phosphorus nitrogen or both approximately 90 of these wwtps represent major sources of nutrients to receiving waters the epa s tmdl total maximum daily load program is developing target ambient tp concentrations as well as best available technology bat varying from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l for phosphorus removal since 1991 the npdes permit program has directed clean water state revolving fund srf grants for construction of wastewater collection and treatment plant infrastructure commonwealth of massachusetts 2016b this program and its predecessor construction grants program represent the largest single financial commitment to clean water in massachusetts and is estimated to have leveraged well over 7 billion from 1968 to 2010 the massachusetts clean water srf is estimated to fund about 259 million a year in water quality infrastructure projects table 4 other npdes discharges include point sources from industries such as power generation fish hatcheries paper mills manufacturing and others as shown in fig 5 advances in wastewater treatment is one of the major drivers behind the significant decline of tp concentrations in central massachusetts rivers one example is the assabet river which is designated as capable of providing and supporting habitat for fish and other aquatic wildlife and for primary and secondary contact recreation however massdep listed it as impaired primarily for nutrients and organic enrichment in 1998 the federal clean water act requires the restoration of impaired water bodies through the development of tmdls which identify the maximum amount of a pollutant that can be discharged to a water body while still meeting water quality standards after comprehensive investigations massdep identified phosphorus was the cause of the impairment and issued a tmdl in 2004 for total phosphorus entering the assabet river from direct treated wastewater discharges and indirect discharges massdep worked with the municipalities contributing wastewater to the four wwtps discharging to the assabet river westborough marlborough hudson and maynard to upgrade their facilities for phosphorus removal technologies adopted by these wwtps included aquadaf bluepro comag and actiflo with costs ranging from 4 million to 25 million the tp loads have been reduced by more than 90 from these wwtps to the assabet river since 1998 u s epa 2015b as a result the tp concentrations in the assabet river have declined significantly fig 6 and table 2 the massachusetts wastewater srf is estimated about 259 million a year table 4 4 3 projects funded by the epa 319 grant program the united states congress annually appropriates funds under section 319 of the clean water act to assist states in implementing their approved non point source nps programs the 319 program focuses on controlling nps pollution by funding implementation projects the awards provide financial support for states programs te regulate the major categories of nps pollution and for protecting or improving nps threatened or impaired water resources in massachusetts projects built to address nonpoint sources of pollution to surface waters such as stormwater runoff have been designed mainly to reduce tp levels either directly or indirectly for example some of the 319 projects have targeted recurring algal blooms in freshwaters which are usually a direct result of elevated tp concentrations the massachusetts nonpoint source management program plan was created to better deal with non point source pollution by establishing several objectives these include to identify and expand opportunities to accomplish and leverage work by private state local and federal partners to restore impaired waters reduce nonpoint source pollutants and mitigate the effects of climate change to protect unimpaired high quality and threatened waters through planning education program coordination and the implementation of climate ready best management practices bmps to monitor waters for nonpoint source impairments and improvements to prioritize actions measure success and increase program efficacy and to encourage the restoration of water quality through education capacity building and building new partnerships since 1998 the 319 nps program has provided 63 million in grant funding table 4 leveraging millions of dollars in matching funds for projects that prioritize implementation of bmps and public education programs to remediate water quality impairments and meet beneficial uses in massachusetts the epa 319 projects are positively associated with the reduction of tp in different rivers fig 5 however post restoration nutrient loading data for specific projects are generally unavailable as this type of monitoring is no longer required within the scope of work of each grant 4 4 activities by der and nrcs ma der statewide projects include wetland restorations and dam removals which both affect water and habitat quality in surface waters der s efforts bring clean water recreation opportunities healthy commercial fisheries and other ecosystem services to the citizens of massachusetts by prioritizing ecosystems der emphasizes restoring ecological processes rather than specific habitats by focusing implementation at the watershed scale der staff identify the most detrimental stressors in the larger watershed context and coordinate restoration actions to improve conditions us nrcs conducts outreach and awards grants targeting the management of crops and grazing waste and riparian buffers many of them are nutrient bmp projects which could lead to reductions in pollutants especially phosphorus the majority of nrcs projects focus on land conservation protecting farms and forests and the appropriate application of fertilizers which often contain phosphorous with the implementation of bmps including the minimization of fertilizer use there will be a decline of tp inputs in the watershed massachusetts also coordinates with nrcs to provide incentives through the federal farm bill to encourage farms to use bmps nrcs targets impaired waters as one of the major areas of restoration through mechanisms such as the environmental quality incentive program eqip eqip highly prioritizes projects designed to address tmdl recommendations in 2010 approximately 12 16 million in eqip funds were available to address water quality goals over the past several years eqip funds have addressed these goals throughout the commonwealth through the application of structural and non structural agricultural bmps the impacts on tp reduction from these der projects and nrcs bmps are not as significant as the 319 projects and npdes regulations fig 5 the time lag between dam removal or bmp implementation and nutrient reduction in the surface water may be a key reason for example no significant nutrient reduction in the yahara lakes in madison wisconsin was found after four decades of bmp activities lathrop and carpenter 2014 it is estimated that the expected time lag for these lakes to recover was over 250 years following watershed wide nutrient reductions rissman and carpenter 2015 many of the nrcs projects for example are related to silvicultural land conservation and a long period of time may pass before signs of water quality improvement can be measured 5 conclusion the tp concentrations in 18 of the 20 rivers in central massachusetts have declined since 1999 and the tp reduction was more significant in rivers with greater anthropogenic inputs than those less impacted by human activities fig 3 the reduction of tp in these rivers is mainly associated with advancements in wastewater treatment and implementation of non point source best management practices the declining ambient water phosphorus concentrations have resulted in reduced phosphorus loading to downstream waterbodies from these rivers especially those highly impacted rivers fig 7 some smaller declines in surface water tp concentrations have also occurred in least impacted central massachusetts rivers which may be attributed to changes in land use and or climate changes that are difficult to measure in the 14 year time frame of the study long term nutrient monitoring of ambient waters is critical in quantifying the effectiveness of environmental protection and environmental restoration

19563,over the last century nutrient concentrations in streams rivers lakes and ponds have increased substantially in the united states elevated phosphorus levels are a concern due to their ability to cause changes in freshwater ecosystems that are detrimental to humans and wildlife in the present study long term trends in total phosphorus tp concentrations from 20 rivers in central massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 were investigated kendall s correlation coefficients were used to demonstrate that 18 of the 20 rivers had significant reductions in tp concentrations p 0 05 a similar trend was found when flow adjusted tp concentrations were analyzed at the beginning of monitoring activities the average tp concentration in 9 of the 20 rivers was greater than 0 05 mg l and 6 of these 9 rivers contained tp concentrations greater than 0 1 mg l about fifteen years later only 3 rivers contained tp greater than 0 05 mg l and none had concentrations 0 1 mg l tp decreases were greater in rivers with more anthropogenic inputs principal component analysis pca revealed that the decline of tp in these massachusetts streams is likely the result of advancements in wastewater treatment and

environments eutrophication related water quality policy in the united states and europe is directed primarily toward phosphorus control for freshwater ecosystems smith et al 2006 and reference therein in the nutrient poor glaciated areas of north central and northeastern united states phosphorus is the nutrient most often limiting and easiest to control in fresh waters and in massachusetts phosphorus is the nutrient most often targeted in controlling eutrophication mattson and godfrey 1994 mattson 2015 even in cases where nitrogen is found to be limiting in freshwater eutrophic conditions are usually caused by excessive anthropogenic phosphorus inputs and the remedy is not to regulate nitrogen but rather to reduce anthropogenic phosphorus sources until the latter is again

water quality impairments department of environmental protection 2011 in the present study our goal was to examine the trend of total phosphorus concentrations in 20 rivers in central massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 and identify management activities within these river basins to assess their potential effectiveness on phosphorus mitigation 2 methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on 20 rivers

data collected from the 1970 s to 1990 s by massdep and under its previous name the department of environmental quality engineering or deqe was used in the original station selection process to tentatively label each stream as least or highly impacted for the purposes of this analysis least impacted refers to streams with minimal anthropogenic disturbance e g urbanization industrial commercial development major transportation corridors and highly impacted refers to those affected by several significant sources of pollution massachusetts department of environmental protection 2008 seven of the rivers in the study were categorized least impacted based on the higher percentage of natural i e undisturbed land the remaining 13 rivers were categorized as highly impacted with an overall higher percentage of impervious cover 6 5 or greater developed or agricultural land table 1 2 2 water sample collection and analysis from 1999 to 2013 typically bi monthly water samples were collected from each of the 31 monitoring stations in the 20 rivers by massdep s strategic monitoring and assessment for river basin teams smart program staff generally there was one monitoring station for each river however for larger rivers such as the nashua and ware rivers one or more stations were added to address anticipated changes in water quality associated with major sources of pollutants to minimize spatial correlation within a river with multiple sampling stations only data from the downstream most station were analyzed legendre and fortin 1989 chang 2008 sprague and lorenz 2009 grab

et al 2000 liang et al 2014 stow et al 2015 wan et al 2017 2 3 environmental protection and conservation projects data collection many water pollution control actions have been enacted in massachusetts since the 1972 clean water act that may have resulted in reduced nutrient concentrations in surface waters pollution abatement programs include the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits for waste water treatment plants wwtp and other point source discharges the massachusetts division of ecological restoration der habitat restoration projects the implementation of the u s department of agriculture s natural resource conservation service nrcs best management practices and the us environmental protection agency s epa 319 federal grant program for non point source mitigation projects additional actions include key legislative vehicles such as the wetlands 1972 and rivers 1996 protection acts these programs and practices have had varied effects on the tp levels in each river surveyed as point sources such as wwtps can be major sources of tp in any given river watershed information on wwtp effluent pollutant limits and facility treatment upgrades and other industrial discharges were included in this study because of their potentially significant impact on downstream tp concentration the massachusetts der has implemented numerous projects in the smart watersheds that may have reduced the concentrations of tp the nrcs has completed the most projects to reduce pollutants many of which are directly related to preserving forests for silviculture the epa s 319 project grants directed by massdep may also contribute to tp reductions in these rivers the locations of wwtp and industrial surface water discharges as well as massachusetts der restoration projects were provided by massdep gis and der respectively commonwealth of massachusetts 2016a nrcs data were collected from the nrcs agricultural control projects massachusetts department of environmental protection 2013 these location data formed the basis of a functional map indicating the potential sources of tp inputs and reductions this map was instrumental in identifying the potential impacts of the many and varied protection and restoration activities on the measured tp reductions in the massachusetts rivers in this study 2 4 statistical analysis the typically bi monthly data collected for the 20 rivers were used to examine the long term trend of tp concentrations since kolmogorov smirnov tests demonstrated that tp concentrations for each river were not normally distributed p 0 01 the nonparametric kendall s correlation was used to examine whether there was any trend in tp from 1999 to 2013 for each river zar 1996 kendall s tau b is a nonparametric measure of association based on the number of concordances and discordances in paired observations concordance occurs when paired observations vary together and discordance occurs when paired observations vary differently analysis of covariance ancova was used to examine the difference in tp concentrations between the least and highly impacted rivers within the study time period 1999 2013 all tests used the significance level of α 0 05 and high significance level of α 0 01 and these statistics were performed using sas version 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc principal component analysis pca was used to examine the relationship between tp reduction delta p the difference between the annual mean tp concentration at the beginning and of monitoring of each river and the landuse parameters in the contributing watershed i e development natural land and impervious surface coverage pca was also used to elucidate the potential association between delta p and restoration activities pca was performed using primer version 6 primer e multivariate statistics for ecologists albany auckland new zealand since these environmental variables were not expressed in the same scale all variables were normalized i e the values for each variable have their mean subtracted and are divided by their standard deviation before pca was conducted 3 results 3 1 long term trend of tp concentrations in central massachusetts rivers at the beginning of this project 1999 2000 the median observed tp for the central massachusetts rivers sampled was 0 045 mg l at the end of the project 2013 the median tp concentration had decreased to 0 019 mg l in 2000 the average tp in 9 of the 20 rivers was greater than 0 05 mg l and in 6 of these the average tp exceeded 0 1 mg l by 2013 the average tp of only 3 rivers exceeded 0 05 mg l and none was greater than 0 1 mg l the kendall s correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant trend of tp concentration reduction in 18 out of the 20 rivers while in two rivers the swift and the west rivers they did not table 2 the mean tp reduction rate for the 18 rivers was 58 4 ranging from 29 8 to 82 8 during the survey period a comparable trend was observed when analyses were conducted on flow adjusted tp concentrations kendall s correlation coefficients in the two methods are presented in table 2 pca demonstrates that the rivers categorized as least impacted exhibited smaller reductions in tp concentrations fig 2 indeed ancova analysis results fig 3 mirrored the pca results i e a significantly faster rate of tp decline was measured in highly impacted rivers kendall correlation coefficient 0 215 p 0 0001 while the decline rate in the least impacted rivers was slightly lower kendall correlation coefficient 0 181 p 0

the decline of tp concentration and environmental restoration activities the many clean water act related conservation practices and projects the lower effluent limits established in wwtp and other discharge permits and the epa 319 and other grant projects have highly likely resulted in significantly lower tp concentrations in rivers in central massachusetts figs 4 and 5 in total there are 8986 nrcs project 37 epa 319 projects 46 wwtp facilities 61 other discharges mainly industrial point sources and 8 der habitat restoration projects within these river basins table 3 generally more nutrient management and conservation projects were found in watersheds with greater human disturbance fig 4 and table 3 for example there were no epa 319 projects and fewer wwtps in the seven least impacted river basins pca analysis indicated more epa 319 projects wwtp and other discharge permits in the watersheds of rivers with higher rates of tp decline i e delta p fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 decline of tp concentrations and nutrient management actions the trends in tp concentrations in 18 of the 20 central massachusetts rivers studied are decreasing slightly to moderately trends show that some of the rivers have larger fluctuations in tp concentrations than others as shown in figs 2 and 3 the reduction of tp in rivers with the greatest anthropogenic impacts categorized as highly impacted was more significant since reductions in tp concentrations were also detected in most of the least impacted rivers however slight other conditions could be impacting nutrient levels in these watersheds such as changing landuse or climate given that massachusetts has a rapidly growing population 6 3 million in 2000 to 6 5 million in 2010 which represents an increase in potential sources of tp the expected result is an increase in tp levels thus the decline of tp concentrations quantified in the study is likely to have resulted from reductions in anthropogenic sources of phosphorus such as advances in wastewater treatment as well as other changes in point and non point source management practices figs 4 and 5 in particular the highly impacted central massachusetts rivers exhibited greater reductions in tp concentrations while least impacted rivers had smaller tp reductions as shown by the greater rates of decline in highly impacted rivers correlation coefficients in table 2 and pca result in fig 2 ancova analysis showed similar results fig 3 more conservation and restoration activities occurred in the highly impacted rivers and their watersheds figs 4 and 5 and table 3 the only two rivers without significant declines in tp concentrations were categorized as least impacted i e the swift and west rivers and low tp concentrations were consistently measured in these rivers throughout the 14 year study period usgs also reported decreasing tp concentrations in the assabet river from 2008 to 2014 savoie et al 2016 and the blackstone river from 1979 to 2015 savoie et al 2017 major treatment plant upgrants and numerous restoration activities were undertaken in these watersheds in those decades although the united states has largely controlled sewage discharges and has acted to constrain fertilizer run off in recent decades to protect relatively pristine waters and restore deteriorated waterbodies haygarth et al 2014 powers et al 2016 a recent report on streams and lakes especially those oligotrophic streams including a few from massachusetts in the conterminous u s showed increasing tp concentrations from 2000 to 2014 stoddard et al 2016 these authors suggested that the rising tp in undeveloped catchment areas cannot be entirely attributed to either point or common non point sources of phosphorus another project that targeted midwest and northeast lakes demonstrated that there had been no significant change in tp concentrations in the massachusetts lakes studied and concluded that water quality in midwest and northeast lakes had neither degraded nor improved significantly despite large management efforts and environmental changes over recent decades oliver et al 2017 contrary to these results our long term study suggests that management of point and non point sources of pollution in massachusetts rivers especially those categorized as highly impacted in this study fig 5 has been measurably effective in improving water quality the study also found that these significant reductions in stream phosphorus occurred despite the increased anthropogenic sources associated with the concurrent increase in population and development in the study area numerous sources hve reported that cultural nutrient inputs to u s streams changed significantly during the last three decades of the 20th century raike et al 2003 smith and schindler 2009 zhang et al 2013 kreiling and houser 2016 wang et al 2016 advances in wastewater treatment and state wide phosphate detergent bans have greatly reduced municipal point sources of nutrients to streams litke 1999 beginning in the mid 1990s public water suppliers in massachusetts added phosphate to the treatment train to prevent pipe corrosion this phosphorus usually ends up in wastewater treatment plants diffuse non point sources of nutrients including fertilizer and fossil fuel emissions have varied considerably since the 1980s soil conservation and government sponsored retirements of farmland and other conservation projects such as the epa 319 grants nrcs and state agencies also have combined to reduce non point source nutrient pollution sometimes a more comprehensive management strategy is needed to better address nutrient enrichment for example in upper austrian rivers phosphorus concentrations are increasing despite considerable improvements in enhanced phosphorus removal from wastewater and through implementation of an agriculture environmental program increases result from changes in land use and cultivated crop types to offset increases due to erosion driven emissions zessner et al 2016 in addition monitoring is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different environmental protection activities the clean water act section 106 grant program for example is designed to enchant monitoring programs and provide valid reports on water conditions and section 106 is generally used for funding state environmental program staff salaries developing tmdls updating water quality standards and enforce permits in massachusetts the annual investment from the us epa for section 106 is about 3 2 million and the cost for major water protection and restoration programs is around 248 million a year although no similar long term tp data have been collected from surface waters in western and eastern massachusetts it is likely that tp concentrations in the majority of massachusetts rivers may also be declining due to the same factors and sources described for the central massachusetts rivers in this article fig 4 although protection and restoration efforts are ongoing many rivers continue to be impaired by nutrients and other stressors and additional work is needed to further improve water quality in massachusetts 4 2 upgrade of wwtps and other point source dischargers discharges from wwtps can have the greatest influence on instream tp levels controlling anthropogenic eutrophication in freshwater by reducing point sources of tp is one of the greatest success stories in managing eutrophic waters schindler 2006 as exemplified by the significant reduction of tp loads to the assabet river in the present study there are no municipal wwtp discharges to the swift river above the study area one of the only two rivers without a significant tp reduction trend table 2 there are 145 wwtps in massachusetts with npdes permits that specify effluent limits or require monitoring for phosphorus nitrogen or both approximately 90 of these wwtps represent major sources of nutrients to receiving waters the epa s tmdl total maximum daily load program is developing target ambient tp concentrations as well as best available technology bat varying from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l for phosphorus removal since 1991 the npdes permit program has directed clean water state revolving fund srf grants for construction of wastewater collection and treatment plant infrastructure commonwealth of massachusetts 2016b this program and its predecessor construction grants program represent the largest single financial commitment to clean water in massachusetts and is estimated to have leveraged well over 7 billion from 1968 to 2010 the massachusetts clean water srf is estimated to fund about 259 million a year in water quality infrastructure projects table 4 other npdes discharges include point sources from industries such as power generation fish hatcheries paper mills manufacturing and others as shown in fig 5 advances in wastewater treatment is one of the major drivers behind the significant decline of tp concentrations in central massachusetts rivers one example is the assabet river which is designated as capable of providing and supporting habitat for fish and other aquatic wildlife and for primary and secondary contact recreation however massdep listed it as impaired primarily for nutrients and organic enrichment in 1998 the federal clean water act requires the restoration of impaired water bodies through the development of tmdls which identify the maximum amount of a pollutant that can be discharged to a water body while still meeting water quality standards after comprehensive investigations massdep identified phosphorus was the cause of the impairment and issued a tmdl in 2004 for total phosphorus entering the assabet river from direct treated wastewater discharges and indirect discharges massdep worked with the municipalities contributing wastewater to the four wwtps discharging to the assabet river westborough marlborough hudson and maynard to upgrade their facilities for phosphorus removal technologies adopted by these wwtps included aquadaf bluepro comag and actiflo with costs ranging from 4 million to 25 million the tp loads have been reduced by more than 90 from these wwtps to the assabet river since 1998 u s epa 2015b as a result the tp concentrations in the assabet river have declined significantly fig 6 and table 2 the massachusetts wastewater srf is estimated about 259 million a year table 4 4 3 projects funded by the epa 319 grant program the united states congress annually appropriates funds under section 319 of the clean water act to assist states in implementing their approved non point source nps programs the 319 program focuses on controlling nps pollution by funding implementation projects the awards provide financial support for states programs te regulate the major categories of nps pollution and for protecting or improving nps threatened or impaired water resources in massachusetts projects built to address nonpoint sources of pollution to surface waters such as stormwater runoff have been designed mainly to reduce tp levels either directly or indirectly for example some of the 319 projects have targeted recurring algal blooms in freshwaters which are usually a direct result of elevated tp concentrations the massachusetts nonpoint source management program plan was created to better deal with non point source pollution by establishing several objectives these include to identify and expand opportunities to accomplish and leverage work by private state local and federal partners to restore impaired waters reduce nonpoint source pollutants and mitigate the effects of climate change to protect unimpaired high quality and threatened waters through planning education program coordination and the implementation of climate ready best management practices bmps to monitor waters for nonpoint source impairments and improvements to prioritize actions measure success and increase program efficacy and to encourage the restoration of water quality through education capacity building and building new partnerships since 1998 the 319 nps program has provided 63 million in grant funding table 4 leveraging millions of dollars in matching funds for projects that prioritize implementation of bmps and public education programs to remediate water quality impairments and meet beneficial uses in massachusetts the epa 319 projects are positively associated with the reduction of tp in different rivers fig 5 however post restoration nutrient loading data for specific projects are generally unavailable as this type of monitoring is no longer required within the scope of work of each grant 4 4 activities by der and nrcs ma der statewide projects include wetland restorations and dam removals which both affect water and habitat quality in surface waters der s efforts bring clean water recreation opportunities healthy commercial fisheries and other ecosystem services to the citizens of massachusetts by prioritizing ecosystems der emphasizes restoring ecological processes rather than specific habitats by focusing implementation at the watershed scale der staff identify the most detrimental stressors in the larger watershed context and coordinate restoration actions to improve conditions us nrcs conducts outreach and awards grants targeting the management of crops and grazing waste and riparian buffers many of them are nutrient bmp projects which could lead to reductions in pollutants especially phosphorus the majority of nrcs projects focus on land conservation protecting farms and forests and the appropriate application of fertilizers which often contain phosphorous with the implementation of bmps including the minimization of fertilizer use there will be a decline of tp inputs in the watershed massachusetts also coordinates with nrcs to provide incentives through the federal farm bill to encourage farms to use bmps nrcs targets impaired waters as one of the major areas of restoration through mechanisms such as the environmental quality incentive program eqip eqip highly prioritizes projects designed to address tmdl recommendations in 2010 approximately 12 16 million in eqip funds were available to address water quality goals over the past several years eqip funds have addressed these goals throughout the commonwealth through the application of structural and non structural agricultural bmps the impacts on tp reduction from these der projects and nrcs bmps are not as significant as the 319 projects and npdes regulations fig 5 the time lag between dam removal or bmp implementation and nutrient reduction in the surface water may be a key reason for example no significant nutrient reduction in the yahara lakes in madison wisconsin was found after four decades of bmp activities lathrop and carpenter 2014 it is estimated that the expected time lag for these lakes to recover was over 250 years following watershed wide nutrient reductions rissman and carpenter 2015 many of the nrcs projects for example are related to silvicultural land conservation and a long period of time may pass before signs of water quality improvement can be measured 5 conclusion the tp concentrations in 18 of the 20 rivers in central massachusetts have declined since 1999 and the tp reduction was more significant in rivers with greater anthropogenic inputs than those less impacted by human activities fig 3 the reduction of tp in these rivers is mainly associated with advancements in wastewater treatment and implementation of non point source best management practices the declining ambient water phosphorus concentrations have resulted in reduced phosphorus loading to downstream waterbodies from these rivers especially those highly impacted rivers fig 7 some smaller declines in surface water tp concentrations have also occurred in least impacted central massachusetts rivers which may be attributed to changes in land use and or climate changes that are difficult to measure in the 14 year time frame of the study long term nutrient monitoring of ambient waters is critical in quantifying the effectiveness of environmental protection and environmental restoration

19564,modern water distribution systems wdss are often controlled by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and programmable logic controllers plcs which manage their operation and maintain a reliable water supply as such and with the cyber layer becoming a central component of wds operations these systems are at a greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks this paper offers a model based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of wdss combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically based rules alone the results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving the best known performance when tested on the data published in the battle of the attack detection algorithms batadal competition http www batadal net keywords cyber physical systems water distribution systems event detection methodology model based fault detection cyber attacks 1 introduction modern critical infrastructures are often controlled by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and programmable logic controllers plcs which manage their operation these systems which combine physical processes with cyber networking are defined as cyber physical systems lee 2008 the past few years have witnessed the emergence of cyber physical systems in different components of the water supply sector such as the water distribution system rasekh et al 2016 water supply reservoirs bobat et al 2015 and treatment plants spellman 2013 while cyber physical systems make water supply management efficient and reliable they also expose the system to cyber physical attacks indeed the threat of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure systems e g electricity communication transportation and water networks is becoming a major concern rasekh et al 2016 in water distribution systems wdss in particular these can range from stealing consumer data to damaging equipment causing water shortages or degrading water quality slay and miller 2008 as such cyber physical attacks on wdss can exert economic public health and environmental impacts which makes them attractive targets for terrorism and cyberwarfare lewis 2002 horta 2007 dakin et al 2009 according to the united states industrial control systems cyber emergency response team several cyber physical attacks have already occurred against the united states water sector ics cert 2016 it is thus important to develop cyberattack detection methodologies for wdss if we are to minimize the systems vulnerability and limit the attacks potential damages unlike wdss several studies have considered the issue of cyber security in power grids early studies of cyber security in these systems have focused on communication standards ericsson 2010 in different components such as the metering infrastructure cleveland 2008 and the scada system yang et al 2006 more recently new approaches have been developed which also consider the interaction between the physical power system and the cyber infrastructure xie et al 2010 kosut et al 2010a b c kim and poor 2011 liu et al 2011 hug and giampapa 2012 giani et al 2013 liu et al 2015 more specifically these studies focused on investigating the attack mechanisms of false data injection in the context of power system state estimation the state estimation problem is a critical stage for ensuring optimal and reliable real time operation of the power grid liu et al 2015 state estimation is the process of estimating unknown state variables in a power grid based on the real time measurements of system variables such as flow measurements and bus voltage measurements false data injection attacks involve situations where an attacker can inject false data into the measurements such as to lead to an incorrect system state estimation which in turn leads to false operational decisions and system failures yuan et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 have shown that operational decisions that were based on incorrect power flow data as a result of false data injection attack can lead to an uneconomic operation and manipulation of the electricity market xie et al 2010 negrete pincetic et al 2009 esmalifalak et al 2013 as well as to system failures liu et al 2015 in this respect liu et al 2015 designed a framework for identifying a set of lines that could be overloaded due to false data injections and which should be strictly monitored to ensure the reliability and safety of power systems along the same lines bobba et al 2010 derived a lower bound for the number of meters which should be ensured as attack free in order to prevent the manipulation of the state estimation procedure the most relevant studies to our work are kosut et al 2010a b c which focused on the detection problem associated with false data injection in this respect kosut et al 2010a developed computationally efficient heuristics for detecting false data attacks against state estimators while kosut et al 2010b developed a bayesian framework for the same purpose kosut et al 2010c suggested a graph theoretic approach for detecting false data injections which targets the state estimation procedure still and unlike our study these previous studies only consider false data injection attacks in the context of the state estimation procedure which is a critical stage in modern power grids as opposed to the rich literature on power grids cyber security only a limited number of studies have considered the cyberattack problem in wdss amin et al 2013a b perelman and amin 2014 taormina et al 2017 amin et al 2013a b consider automated open canal networks that are characterized by unpressurized and tree like layout for this reason the approach suggested by amin et al 2013a b cannot be applied to pressurized and looped wdss perelman and amin 2014 introduced a network interdiction model for simulating attacks on wdss which considers both energy and water balance making it potentially applicable to a pressurized looped network however their work did not consider the attack detection problem their objective was merely to assess the network s vulnerability to attacks more specifically the problem is formulated as an attacker defender model in which the attackers attempt to minimize the satisfied demand by removing one pipe at a time from the network this was the only type of attack scenario considered while the operator attempts to maximize the satisfied demand taormina et al 2017 developed the epanetcpa toolbox that allows the simulation of a wide range of attack scenarios more specifically this toolbox utilizes the epanet hydraulic engine usepa 2013 to simulate the physical system as well as a cyber module that simulates the system s cyber components e g sensors plcs and scadas the tool was used for simulating six different attack scenarios on different wds components as such and like perelman and amin 2014 taormina et al 2017 focus on simulating cyber attacks rather than on developing detection systems for the identification of attack scenarios in light of the above there exists a lack of analytical tools designed for addressing the cyber attack detection problem with respect to wdss at this point it is important to note the differences between the cyberattack detection problem and the physical attack detection problem in wdss unlike the former the latter has been widely studied in the context of contamination event detection systems eds arad et al 2013 housh and ostfeld 2015 more specifically the difference between the two problems can be seen as being associated with three issues 1 temporal resolution the contamination event durations and detection time considered in the eds literature are usually longer than those considered in the cyberattack problem for example because the number of water quality monitoring stations is limited the time between the contamination injection until it reaches the monitoring station is considered the minimum i e best detection time 2 spatial resolution the algorithms in the eds literature often monitors a limited number of water quality monitoring stations while in the cyberattack problem the algorithm monitors the signals from all the cyber components that are spatially distributed throughout the network 3 attack concealment i e alteration of several indicators in order to hide the attack cyberattack problems consider the possibility of attack concealment while eds literature does not consider the possibility of concealment the two problems are nonetheless similar in the sense that both contamination event detection systems and the cyberattack detection problem can be formulated as a fault detection fd problem where a fault is defined as abnormal system behavior a fd problem involves the monitoring of a system with a view to identifying when a fault has occurred generally speaking there are two approaches that can be taken to resolve it namely signal processing based fd and model based fd the former infers faults directly from sensor readings while the latter employs a simulation model as a reference model in order to analyze the discrepancy between sensor readings and reference values gertler 1998 most contamination event detection systems follow the signal processing based fd approach but the results of our recent work housh and ohar 2017a suggest that the model based approach outperformed classical signal based approaches when applied to contamination event detection systems in wdss the present study offers a model based fd methodology that utilizes a physically based water hydraulics simulation model epanet for detecting cyberattacks on wdss the model based approach is based on the generation of residuals from a reference model which are then evaluated by a threshold based classification method in order to distinguish between faulty and normal behaviors while the process of the model based approach is similar across different disciplines e g power grids kosek and gehrke 2016 smart buildings weimer et al 2013 communication network faults cheung et al 2007 and automotive systems freeman et al 2013 the main focus in the development of such fault detection approaches lies in the construction of the reference model and in the design of the residual classification algorithm amin et al 2013a b for example considered a model based cyberattack detection methodology for a relatively simple system of cascaded gravity flow canals while the study offered hereunder considers general pressurized and looped wdss indeed the development of a model based detection for such wdss introduces challenges which were not addressed in amin et al 2013a b as we will demonstrate in the next section furthermore certain detection problems in looped wdss require the design of different model based approaches perez et al 2014 and meseguer et al 2014 for example developed a model based approach for leakage detection and localization that cannot be applied to our problem since the network demand data associated with the present study are unobservable it is worth noting that an earlier version of the proposed cyber attack detection system housh and ohar 2017b competed in the battle of cyber attack detection algorithms taormina et al 2016 organized during the 2017 annual congress of the environmental water resources institute ewri of the american society of civil engineers asce the proposed algorithm was announced as the first place winner it is also important to mention that unlike our model based algorithm the other algorithms in the competition were signal based algorithms in which sensor readings were analyzed by statistical and or machine learning methods with a view to inferring dataset anomalies the reader is referred to batadal 2016 for further information about the battle itself 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement the problem statement is as follows given an attack free dataset of hourly scada readings dataset 1 and a dataset of hourly scada readings with labeled cyberattacks dataset 2 develop a detection mechanism which maximizes detection reliability while minimizing detection time and the amount of false alarms the scada readings include records for the flow rate the inlet and outlet pressure and the status of every pump in every pumping station as well as the system tanks water levels 2 2 model based detection method our cyber attack detection system cds relies on a physically based simulation model for obtaining reference values pertaining to normal system operation conditions we used the epanet hydraulic simulator to simulate the wds hydraulics the idea is to use the error existing between the epanet simulated values and the scada readings to infer abnormal system behavior as such it is important to rely on a well calibrated simulation model or it will be difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal errors first the attack free dataset dataset 1 is used in order to produce normal errors which are expected in the system due to the differences between the model and the actual wds next the simulated attack dataset dataset 2 is used in order to produce errors between the model and the scada readings this comparison between normal errors and the errors produced in the presence of attacks allows the inference of outliers that are used as indicators of a potential cyberattack while the framework described above is straightforward it nonetheless introduces several challenges the major challenge lies in the fact that the epanet simulator is a demand driven simulator meaning that it requires the demands for all system nodes in order to simulate the system s hydraulics given that demand is not an observable variable in the problem i e it is not measured the system demands must be estimated before using epanet with this in mind we suggest a three phase approach 1 estimating the demand on the basis of partial scada records of water quantity measurements i e flow and tank levels 2 simulating the hydraulics on the basis of the estimated demand 3 calculating and classifying the errors between the scada readings the simulated values let us define the scada records at time t as the set h and the subset of the records which correspond to water quantity variables i e flows and tanks levels at time t as the set d then given an operator f to estimate demand d f q and using epanet as an operator g which converts the demand to system hydraulic variables ℋ g d we obtain eq 1 1 h h g d g f q where h is the actual scada readings and h are simulated values for the scada readings eq 1 holds under normal operation conditions however the equality is not maintained when there is a manipulation in any element of the rhs the lhs or both sides of the equation in such cases the error between the two sides is used as an indicator for a cyberattack event three possible cyberattack scenarios can be detected in this context case 1 only the scada measurements used for the demand estimation i e quantity variables are altered by an attack in this case the epanet model will produce wrong pressure values and yield high errors when compared to pressure scada readings a wrong off pump status signal in one demand zone for example will cause an underestimation of demand and as a result an overestimation of pressure in the rhs of eq 1 case 2 only the pressure measurements are altered by the attacker in this case the demand estimation will be accurate and epanet will produce pressures which are close to the real pressures rhs of eq 1 but which still differ from the wrong scada readings lhs of eq 1 case 3 all scada readings are altered in such a case the demand estimation will be wrong however the epanet pressure values will still accord with the system s physics hydraulics major errors will thus be observed between the epanet pressures and the scada pressures unless the attacker changes the pressure according to the network s physical properties the implementation of the process described in eq 1 is summarized in fig 1 as can be seen the scada quantity variables flows tank levels and pump statuses are used for estimating the demands in the network which are then simulated by epanet in order to formulate the simulated reference values of the system hydraulics i e flows tank levels pump statuses and pressures the error vectors are then calculated based on these reference values and classified into normal and abnormal operation conditions 2 3 demand estimation model the demand estimation model is primarily based on solving the network flow problem without accounting for system pressure in other words it is meant for solving the network s water balance problem however unlike the classical network flow problem where demands are given and link flows are unknown the demands here are unknown while the flows are given for a subset of links the system should thus satisfy the water balance as described in eq 2 at each time step 2 a t q t q t δ v t where a t is the network incidence matrix q t is a vector of the flow in the network s links q t is a vector of the demand in the network s nodes and δ v t is a vector of the water volume change in the network s tanks given the district metering areas dmas it is possible to parametrize the demand in the network s nodes according to dma demands this parametrization yields a mass balance model as given in eq 3 the parametrization matrix δ is a mapping matrix between the dmas demands and the network s nodal demands as such it has a row for each node and a column for each dma each row has one non zero element which is equal to the fraction of the node s demand from its corresponding dma demand 3 a t q t δ d t δ v t where δ is the parametrization matrix with given coefficients and d t is a vector of the dmas demand in hours t τ o n o f f where τ o n o f f is the subset of hours with pump status switches eq 3 yields a unique solution for demand vector d t that is given scada values for a subset of q t i e flow in pumps and a storage change from the tanks scada readings it is possible to obtain unique values for d t when t τ o n o f f the obtained d t is an estimation of dma demands under the assumption that the pump flow at the beginning of the time step i e 1 hour is constant along this time step for hours t τ o n o f f the flow in the system links is not given in the scada records this is because the actual times where the pump switch status is not reported for example if a pump begins the hour with an on status and is turned off after 5 min then assuming a positive flow along the entire hour will lead to an overestimation of the dmas demand nevertheless it is still possible to use the pumps control rules in order to predict the switch points by linking the pump flow with the tank water levels according to the specified control rules we formulate a mixed integer linear program milp model to estimate dma demands when t τ o n o f f the milp formulation is necessary because of the discontinuous pump control rules the milp model assumes a constant hourly demand and a 15 min integration time step where the pumps statuses are determined on the basis of the control rules at the end of each integration time step in this respect two distinct cases must be singled out the first is when a pump turns on during the hour and the second is when a pump turns off during the hour the milp formulation given in eq 4 covers these two cases as well as the no switches case where t τ o n o f f 4 min ω 1 t v t 4 v t e n d 1 ω 1 t y t 5 s t e n d subject to c 1 v t i v t i 1 a t q t i δ d t 0 25 i 1 4 c 2 p t j p t 0 j j j t o f f c 3 p t j p t e n d j j j t

hour t with the elements v t i k for tank k v t 0 v t e n d are scada values for the volumes at the beginning and end of the hour respectively s t 0 s t e n d are vectors of scada values for the pump statuses at the beginning and end of the hour respectively with the elements s t 0 j and s t e n d j p t 0 j p t e n d j are scada values for pump j s flow rate at the beginning and end of the hour respectively p t j is pump j s flow rate at time t a t is the network incidence matrix q t i is a vector of link flows with the elements q t i l for link l δ is a given transformation matrix from dma demands to nodal demands d t is a vector of dma demands y t i j are binary variables which take a value of 1 if pump j is on during quarter i m is a large scalar value v j v j are tank volumes which trigger pump j on and off respectively ω is a weighting factor j l is the pump connected to link l j t o f f is the set of pumps switched off during time t j t o n is the set of pumps switched on during time t j ˆ t o f f j ˆ t o n is the set of pumps which did not switch status during time t and j k is the pump controlled by tank k the optimization problem in eq 4 is a milp problem which results in the demand values for all dmas note that the absolute values in the objective function can be easily transformed into linear constraints the first constraint represents the water balance in the tanks over the course of 1 h at 0 25 h time steps constraints 2 4 consider the non zero flow values during any hour while constraint 5 represents all the pump operation combinations assuming a status change can only occur at the end of each quarter hour constraints 6 7 guarantee that any pump will only be triggered on or off once during the hour constraint 9 represents the control rules and governing volumes for each pump tank pair for example when v t i k v j k the value will be y t i 1 j k 0 in order to satisfy the constraint and thus pump j k will be turned off during the next quarter of the hour constraint 6 in turn guarantees that it will be turned off during the remainder of the hour it is worth noting that the estimation method described above is based solely on the network water balance at each time step and thus does not require the demand s statistical properties moreover the demand estimation methodology is scalable to large networks i e the size of the milp does not increase significantly because 1 the milp is formulated for each time step independently meaning that extended simulation has no impact on its size 2 the milp is formulated on the dma scale i e an aggregated scale meaning that the size of the problem is a function of the number of dmas not a function of the number of pipes and nodes the milp will thus be tractable in large networks since the number of dmas is significantly smaller than number of nodes 2 4 error classification the demands derived from the milp model are used as an input for an epanet simulation such as to produce reference values for the system s hydraulics i e pump flows status pressures and tank levels these reference values are then used for generating errors between the model and scada readings we first generate the errors in the training dataset i e dataset 1 which represents the no attack normal operation of the system the different components errors are then analyzed in order to calculate thresholds for normal over and under estimation errors i e positive and negative errors these thresholds are then used for defining outliers in the error vectors we follow a multilevel approach in which we record the thresholds for different moving average values of training dataset error that is to say given the error vector e i for hydraulic components e g flow valve pressure sensor or tank it becomes possible to calculate moving averages with 0 k lags for each hydraulic component i thus producing k 1 error vectors e i k k 0 k we then define two error thresholds as the α and 1 α percentiles for each of these error vectors which are in turn defined as e i k and e i k respectively these thresholds will then be used for identifying outliers in datasets which include cyberattacks i e dataset 2 to declare an outlier at time t with moving average lag k we require that at least δ 1 hydraulic components experience an outlier however the declaration of an event from the system requires that at least δ 2 out of the k 1 moving averages outliers are flagged an outlier in hydraulic component i and moving average lag k is declared if the error at time t e i t k is below e i k or above e i k as such this outlier s identification process produces k 1 i outlier vectors o i k with the element o i t k being 1 if time t of hydraulic component i and moving average lag k is an outlier with o i t k being zero otherwise eq 5 5 o i t k 1 i f e i t k e i k o r e i t k e i k 0 e l s e given the outliers values at time t o i t k i k it is necessary to define a decision rule that would declare an alarm based on the obtained outlier values for the purposes of the present study this decision rule is defined in eqs 6 and 7 6 b t k 1 i f i 1 i o i t k δ 1 0 e l s e 7 a t 1 i f k 0 k b t k δ 2 0 e l s e where a t is the value of the alarm at time t which takes a value of one if an alarm is declared and zero otherwise b t k is an auxiliary variable used for defining a t and δ 1 δ 2 are parameters which should be calibrated in order to optimize system performance the decision rule in eq 6 indicates that we require at least δ 1 hydraulic components to experience an outlier error i e the definition of b t k if we are to declare an alarm at time t with moving average lag k on the other hand at least δ 2 out of the k 1 moving average alarms need to be flagged i e the definition of a t if we are to declare a system alarm fig 2 demonstrates the alarm identification process for an illustrative example with four hydraulic components while setting k 2 δ 1 2 and δ 2 3 given the error vectors e i i 1 4 and the thresholds e i k e i k i k which are obtained from the α 0 01 and 1 α 0 99 percentiles of the attack free dataset the alarms identification process is summarized in fig 2 since k 2 the four given error vectors are used for building the moving average errors for lags 0 2 and thus creating 12 error vectors i e four for each moving average as can also be seen in fig 2 the outlier identification process which defines the three binary vectors b k k 0 2 is based on δ 1 2 in other words we require two hydraulic component outliers in order to define an outlier from moving average lag k in moving average lag 1 at time 1278 for example the errors of component 2 and component 4 exceed the error thresholds and thus b 1 it has a value of 1 at time 1278 the alarm identification process is based on δ 2 3 which implies that at least three moving average outliers should be declared in order to raise an alarm this condition is satisfied at time 1278 where the three vectors b k k 0 2 have a value of one 2 5 pre solve procedure in addition to the model based analysis a pre solve procedure is performed in order to check the scada input data for times in which there is a contradiction in the physical rules parameters between the scada data and specific elements in the analyzed network this procedure does not depend on the demand derivation and on the epanet simulation and thus in a sense is deterministic the occurrence of an event can thus be declared with a high degree of reliability in cases of physical rule violations the pre solve procedure includes three simple checks a do the reported pump or valve statuses fit the reported flows if the pump status is reported as off for example then the flow should be zero an alarm is declared if this is not the case b does the reported tank level meet the tank s physical boundaries c does the pump s operation point the pump head and flow fall on the pump s characteristic curve more specifically since it is possible to calculate the pump s head given the inlet and the outlet pressure in each pump station this head should fall on the pump s characteristic curve for the reported flow rate an alarm is declared if this is not the case the alarms declared during the pre solve procedure are added to the alarms indicator a t in other words a t 1 if at time t the answer to one or more of the above three questions is no 2 6 calibration we used enumeration in the calibration phase in order to determine the optimal values of α δ 1 δ 2 which maximize a performance measure that accounts for the true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr and average detection time adt as defined in eq 8 in this enumeration procedure we first discretize the three parameters within a predetermined range to create a 3d grid and then evaluate the classification performance in each grid point the grid point with the best performance is selected as possessing the best values for the three parameters of the classification methodology it should be noted that this calibration process is performed only after the errors are generated as such the calibration problem will always include three parameters regardless of wds network size meaning that the calibration problem is solvable by the enumeration procedure even when a large scale network is analyzed 8 η ω 1 t p r ω 2 t n r ω 3 η a d t where η is the overall cds performance measure ω i i 1 3 are weighting factors and η a d t is the adt performance measure which scales the adt to a 0 1 range similar to the tpr and tnr measures the tpr and the tnr are defined in eqs 9 and 10 9 t p r t p t p f n 10 t n r t n t n f p where tp is true positive alarms that is the number of times the system was under an attack that was recognized by the algorithm fn is false negative alarms that is the number of times where the algorithm failed to detect that the system was under attack tn is true negative alarms that is the number of times the algorithm identified situations in which the system was not under attack correctly and fp is false positive alarms that is the number of times in which the algorithm generated an alarm incorrectly because the system was not actually under attack the detection time of the j th event d t j is defined as in batadal 2016 by using the difference between the time t a j s at which an alarm is raised and the time t e j s at which the event started if the event was not detected we set d t j as the event duration δ t j as given in eq 11 11 d t j min t a j s t e j s δ t j the adt performance measure η a d t is thus as defined in eq 12 12 η a d t 1 1 n e j 1 n e d t j δ t j where n e is the total number of events η a d t ranges between 0 and 1 with η a d t 1 representing an ideal case in which all events are immediately detected and η a d t 0 representing the worst possible performance where none of the events are detected 3 application the cds proposed above has been implemented on the data published in the battle of the attack detection algorithms batadal competition batadal 2016 the competition considers the c town wds layout and hourly scada readings from each of the five pumping stations and seven tanks as well as one flow control valve fig 3 the scada readings include records for the flow rate the inlet and outlet pressure and the status of each pump in every pumping station as well as the system tanks water levels the batadal data included three datasets a dataset 1 which includes readings from 12 months before the installation of cyber physical devices e g devices with telemetric capabilities such as pressure readings tank level sensors etc as such it is guaranteed to be attack free and can be used for studying normal system operations b dataset 2 which includes readings from approximately 6 months after the installation of the cyber physical devices this dataset includes attacks which were discovered by the operators and thus these attacks are labeled attacks c dataset 3 which includes readings from 3 months of labeled attacks datasets 1 2 were used for the system calibration while dataset 3 was used to test its performance the attacks in datasets 2 3 were simulated using the epanetcpa toolbox taormina et al 2017 3 1 results the developed cds was coded using matlab and begins with a pre solve procedure which includes three simple checks for the violation of trivial physical conditions as detailed in the previous section in order to demonstrate the pre solve procedure let us examine the operation points of pump 10 as shown in fig 4 the figure shows the pump head calculated as the difference between the outlet and the inlet pressure versus the pump flow rate under normal conditions any point should fall on the pump s characteristic curve fig 4 shows that the points for times 2028 2051 do not correspond to the characteristic curve and thus indicate abnormal scada readings which violate the laws of physics applicable to the pump and indeed the system was in fact under attack as described by the second attack in table 1 during the aforementioned time points 2028 2051 the cds begins the actual model based detection after the pre solve procedure as shown in fig 1 the model based methodology relies on estimated demands derived from the milp model in order to produce reference values for the system s normal behavior as such the quality of these reference values depends on the accuracy of the estimated demands the milp program was formulated using yalmip toolbox lofberg 2004 where cplex 12 6 1 international buisness machines 2014 was used as the optimization problem solver as explained previously the milp is formulated for each time step independently as such it is a small size milp 43 continuous variables and 60 binary variables which is solved efficiently average cpu time 0 25 s on i7 4700mq cpu 2 4 ghz machine using the original demand patterns which are not observable to our detection methodology fig 5 presents the performance of the demand estimation methodology with respect to the five dmas and with respect to the total demand of the c town network fig 3 the results show the histograms of the relative errors for the six estimated dma demands when using dataset 1 all estimation errors have near zero mean and a standard deviation of up to 0 3 demonstrating the accuracy of the demand estimation methodology by relying on dataset 1 and dataset 2 and after applying the demand estimation methodology and calculating the error vectors it becomes possible to calibrate cds parameters α δ 1 and δ 2 against a dataset with labeled attacks with this in mind our calibration phase employed batadal competition dataset 2 which includes seven attacks as detailed in table 1 we then determined the optimal values for the three parameters which maximize the cds s overall performance η where k 9 these optimal values are 0 2 and 2 for α δ 1 and δ 2 respectively and using them produces a system performance score of η 0 97 on dataset 2 as can be seen in the calibration result illustrated in fig 6 the cds captured all seven of the attacks detailed in table 1 during the calibration phase but at the cost of three false alarms still the value of η which is very close to 1 indicates that near perfect performance is obtained in the calibration phase because these false alarms are very short and do not exert a significant impact on the performance measure we further tested the methodology by applying the cds on dataset 3 which also includes seven attacks as detailed in table 2 this dataset is provided in batadal 2016 for testing purposes and thus was not used in the cds s development or calibration according to table 2 there is an attack during time 298 367 which impacts tank t3 and pump 4 s operation in dma 3 fig 7 presents the data readings for tank 3 and pump 4 with the readings during event time in red however fig 7 alone is insufficient for distinguishing any abnormal behavior during the attack through the mere examination of these readings nevertheless and since the proposed cds examines all readings simultaneously for violations of physical behavior and or operation rules the cds is still capable of detecting that there is something wrong with the readings at these points in time fig 8 presents the outliers from the tanks and pressure sensors for different moving average lags note we only show 4 out of the 10 moving average lags 0 9 each of the subfigures in fig 8 shows the different hydraulic components on the y axis that is tanks 1 7 pumps 1 11 and pressure sensors 1 12 the blue stamps are added when an outlier is obtained in one of the components signals the results show that several components in different lags were able to detect the attacks for example the third event was detected by many components in moving average lags 0 9 nevertheless some attacks were better captured in the large moving average lags for example the first event is detected by two components in moving average lags 0 and 1 but by five components in moving average lags 8 and 9 our error classification methodology requires one outlier vector from each moving average lag eq 6 this outlier s vector is obtained by requiring δ 1 2 components to violate the thresholds for example the outliers in moving average lag 0 between times 0 1500 will not give rise to an outlier in moving average lag 0 indicator b t 0 because only one component flagged an outlier at each time instance the events identification process uses the moving average outliers b t k to raise an alarm for a cyber attack event more specifically an alarm is raised if at least δ 2 2 moving average outliers are found as such and since none of b t k k 0 9 t 0 1500 is flagged no alarm is raised in the course of times 0 1500 fig 9 presents the algorithm s performance for the calibrated values δ 1 2 and δ 2 2 the results show that the alarms i e aggregation of the pre solve and the model based procedure were capable of detecting all the labeled events with one false positive and an overall performance of η 0 99 the pre solve procedure was able to capture some of the events too as also shown in fig 9 the third event for example was detected by the pre solve procedure because the scada reading during this period did not pass the third check that is to say the pumps pressure difference and flow rate did not fall on the pump s characteristic curve in a manner akin to the case presented in fig 4 nevertheless since the pre solve procedure cannot indicate events such as tank levels altering or events with good concealment it is not recommended as a standalone procedure in such case it will yield poor performance of tpr 0 25 tnr 1 since the pre solve has no fp and overall score of η 0 81 3 2 sensitivity analysis in order to examine the sensitivity of the algorithm to errors in the demand estimation we have added a normally distributed noise to the estimated dmas demand which are obtained from the milp model the sensitivity of the cds is examined in fig 10 which presents the performance of the model based model for different levels of noise we have considered three level of noise which are normally distributed around zero with different level of coefficient of variation cv the results show only minor deterioration even in relatively high cv values this robust performance is attributed to the fact that the calibration procedure is performed after the demand estimation thus if high uncertainty is expected in the demand estimates the calibration procedure can tune the thresholds of the cds to account for this high uncertainty the performance index η is 0 98 0 97 0 96 for cv of 0 05 0 15 0 25 respectively 4 conclusions the present study offered a model based fd methodology which utilizes a physically based water hydraulics simulation model epanet for detecting cyberattacks on wdss the method utilizes a three phase approach in which 1 the demand is estimated based on part of the scada readings 2 a hydraulic model is used for checking whether the scada s hydraulic data corresponds to the estimated demand 3 a multilevel classification approach is then implemented in order to classify the obtained errors into outlier and normal errors the results show that the proposed methodology was able to raise a timely alarm for all the labeled simulated cyberattack events however the results presented herein assumed unrealistically perfectly calibrated hydraulic model thus the only source of uncertainty was the network demand data which was not provided in batadal datasets a more generalized case would require us to account for the uncertainty in the calibration of an imperfect model as well as for other sources of uncertainty such as sensor noise thus future research should examine the required calibration s goodness of fit and its impact on the detection algorithm s performance acknowledgments this research was made possible by the

19564,modern water distribution systems wdss are often controlled by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and programmable logic controllers plcs which manage their operation and maintain a reliable water supply as such and with the cyber layer becoming a central component of wds operations these systems are at a greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks this paper offers a model based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of wdss combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically based rules alone the results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving the best known performance when tested on the data published in the battle of the attack detection algorithms batadal competition http www batadal net keywords cyber physical systems water distribution systems event detection methodology model based fault detection cyber attacks 1 introduction modern critical infrastructures are often controlled by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and programmable logic controllers plcs which manage their operation these systems which combine physical processes with cyber networking are defined as cyber physical systems lee 2008 the past few years have witnessed the emergence of cyber physical systems in different components of the water supply sector such as the water distribution system rasekh et al 2016 water supply reservoirs bobat et al 2015 and treatment plants spellman 2013 while cyber physical systems make water supply management efficient and reliable they also expose the system to cyber physical attacks indeed the threat of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure systems e g electricity communication transportation and water networks is becoming a major concern rasekh et al 2016 in water distribution systems wdss in particular these can range from stealing consumer data to damaging equipment causing water shortages or degrading water quality slay and miller 2008 as such cyber physical attacks on wdss can exert economic public health and environmental impacts which makes them attractive targets for terrorism and cyberwarfare lewis 2002 horta 2007 dakin et al 2009 according to the united states industrial control systems cyber emergency response team several cyber physical attacks have already occurred against the united states water sector ics cert 2016 it is thus important to develop cyberattack detection methodologies for wdss if we are to minimize the systems vulnerability and limit the attacks potential damages unlike wdss several studies have considered the issue of cyber security in power grids early studies of cyber security in these systems have focused on communication standards ericsson 2010 in different components such as the metering infrastructure cleveland 2008 and the scada system yang et al 2006 more recently new approaches have been developed which also consider the interaction between the physical power system and the cyber infrastructure xie et al 2010 kosut et al 2010a b c kim and poor 2011 liu et al 2011 hug and giampapa 2012 giani et al 2013 liu et al 2015 more specifically these studies focused on investigating the attack mechanisms of false data injection in the context of power system state estimation the state estimation problem is a critical stage for ensuring optimal and reliable real time operation of the power grid liu et al 2015 state estimation is the process of estimating unknown state variables in a power grid based on the real time measurements of system variables such as flow measurements and bus voltage measurements false data injection attacks involve situations where an attacker can inject false data into the measurements such as to lead to an incorrect system state estimation which in turn leads to false operational decisions and system failures yuan et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 have shown that operational decisions that were based on incorrect power flow data as a result of false data injection attack can lead to an uneconomic operation and manipulation of the electricity market xie et al 2010 negrete pincetic et al 2009 esmalifalak et al 2013 as well as to system failures liu et al 2015 in this respect liu et al 2015 designed a framework for identifying a set of lines that could be overloaded due to false data injections and which should be strictly monitored to ensure the reliability and safety of power systems along the same lines bobba et al 2010 derived a lower bound for the number of meters which should be ensured as attack free in order to prevent the manipulation of the state estimation procedure the most relevant studies to our work are kosut et al 2010a b c which focused on the detection problem associated with false data injection in this respect kosut et al 2010a developed computationally efficient heuristics for detecting false data attacks against state estimators while kosut et al 2010b developed a bayesian framework for the same purpose kosut et al 2010c suggested a graph theoretic approach for detecting false data injections which targets the state estimation procedure still and unlike our study these previous studies only consider false data injection attacks in the context of the state estimation procedure which is a critical stage in modern power grids as opposed to the rich literature on power grids cyber security only a limited number of studies have considered the cyberattack problem in wdss amin et al 2013a b perelman and amin 2014 taormina et al 2017 amin et al 2013a b consider automated open canal networks that are characterized by unpressurized and tree like layout for this reason the approach suggested by amin et al 2013a b cannot be applied to pressurized and looped wdss perelman and amin 2014 introduced a network interdiction model for simulating attacks on wdss which considers both energy and water balance making it potentially applicable to a pressurized looped network however their work did not consider the attack detection problem their objective was merely to assess the network s vulnerability to attacks more specifically the problem is formulated as an attacker defender model in which the attackers attempt to minimize the satisfied demand by removing one pipe at a time from the network this was the only type of attack scenario considered while the operator attempts to maximize the satisfied demand taormina et al 2017 developed the epanetcpa toolbox that allows the simulation of a wide range of attack scenarios more specifically this toolbox utilizes the epanet hydraulic engine usepa 2013 to simulate the physical system as well as a cyber module that simulates the system s cyber components e g sensors plcs and scadas the tool was used for simulating six different attack scenarios on different wds components as such and like perelman and amin 2014 taormina et al 2017 focus on simulating cyber attacks rather than on developing detection systems for the identification of attack scenarios in light of the above there exists a lack of analytical tools designed for addressing the cyber attack detection problem with respect to wdss at this point it is important to note the differences between the cyberattack detection problem and the physical attack detection problem in wdss unlike the former the latter has been widely studied in the context of contamination event detection systems eds arad et al 2013 housh and ostfeld 2015 more specifically the difference between the two problems can be seen as being associated with three issues 1 temporal resolution the contamination event durations and detection time considered in the eds literature are usually longer than those considered in the cyberattack problem for example because the number of water quality monitoring stations is limited the time between the contamination injection until it reaches the monitoring station is considered the minimum i e best detection time 2 spatial resolution the algorithms in the eds literature often monitors a limited number of water quality monitoring stations while in the cyberattack problem the algorithm monitors the signals from all the cyber components that are spatially distributed throughout the network 3 attack concealment i e alteration of several indicators in order to hide the attack cyberattack problems consider the possibility of attack concealment while eds literature does not consider the possibility of concealment the two problems are nonetheless similar in the sense that both contamination event detection systems and the cyberattack detection problem can be formulated as a fault detection fd problem where a fault is defined as abnormal system behavior a fd problem involves the monitoring of a system with a view to identifying when a fault has occurred generally speaking there are two approaches that can be taken to resolve it namely signal processing based fd and model based fd the former infers faults directly from sensor readings while the latter employs a simulation model as a reference model in order to analyze the discrepancy between sensor readings and reference values gertler 1998 most contamination event detection systems follow the signal processing based fd approach but the results of our recent work housh and ohar 2017a suggest that the model based approach outperformed classical signal based approaches when applied to contamination event detection systems in wdss the present study offers a model based fd methodology that utilizes a physically based water hydraulics simulation model epanet for detecting cyberattacks on wdss the model based approach is based on the generation of residuals from a reference model which are then evaluated by a threshold based classification method in order to distinguish between faulty and normal behaviors while the process of the model based approach is similar across different disciplines e g power grids kosek and gehrke 2016 smart buildings weimer et al 2013 communication network faults cheung et al 2007 and automotive systems freeman et al 2013 the main focus in the development of such fault detection approaches lies in the construction of the reference model and in the design of the residual classification algorithm amin et al 2013a b for example considered a model based cyberattack detection methodology for a relatively simple system of cascaded gravity flow canals while the study offered hereunder considers general pressurized and looped wdss indeed the development of a model based detection for such wdss introduces challenges which were not addressed in amin et al 2013a b as we will demonstrate in the next section furthermore certain detection problems in looped wdss require the design of different model based approaches perez et al 2014 and meseguer et al 2014 for example developed a model based approach for leakage detection and localization that cannot be applied to our problem since the network demand data associated with the present study are unobservable it is worth noting that an earlier version of the proposed cyber attack detection system housh and ohar 2017b competed in the battle of cyber attack detection algorithms taormina et al 2016 organized during the 2017 annual congress of the environmental water resources institute ewri of the american society of civil engineers asce the proposed algorithm was announced as the first place winner it is also important to mention that unlike our model based algorithm the other algorithms in the competition were signal based algorithms in which sensor readings were analyzed by statistical and or machine learning methods with a view to inferring dataset anomalies the reader is referred to batadal 2016 for further information about the battle itself 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement the problem statement is as follows given an attack free dataset of hourly scada readings dataset 1 and a dataset of hourly scada readings with labeled cyberattacks dataset 2 develop a detection mechanism which maximizes detection reliability while minimizing detection time and the amount of false alarms the scada readings include records for the flow rate the inlet and outlet pressure and the status of every pump in every pumping station as well as the system tanks water levels 2 2 model based detection method our cyber attack detection system cds relies on a physically based simulation model for obtaining reference values pertaining to normal system operation conditions we used the epanet hydraulic simulator to simulate the wds hydraulics the idea is to use the error existing between the epanet simulated values and the scada readings to infer abnormal system behavior as such it is important to rely on a well calibrated simulation model or it will be difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal errors first the attack free dataset dataset 1 is used in order to produce normal errors which are expected in the system due to the differences between the model and the actual wds next the simulated attack dataset dataset 2 is used in order to produce errors between the model and the scada readings this comparison between normal errors and the errors produced in the presence of attacks allows the inference of outliers that are used as indicators of a potential cyberattack while the framework described above is straightforward it nonetheless introduces several challenges the major challenge lies in the fact that the epanet simulator is a demand driven simulator meaning that it requires the demands for all system nodes in order to simulate the system s hydraulics given that demand is not an observable variable in the problem i e it is not measured the system demands must be estimated before using epanet with this in mind we suggest a three phase approach 1 estimating the demand on the basis of partial scada records of water quantity measurements i e flow and tank levels 2 simulating the hydraulics on the basis of the estimated demand 3 calculating and classifying the errors between the scada readings the simulated values let us define the scada records at time t as the set h and the subset of the records which correspond to water quantity variables i e flows and tanks levels at time t as the set d then given an operator f to estimate demand d f q and using epanet as an operator g which converts the demand to system hydraulic variables ℋ g d we obtain eq 1 1 h h g d g f q where h is the actual scada readings and h are simulated values for the scada readings eq 1 holds under normal operation conditions however the equality is not maintained when there is a manipulation in any element of the rhs the lhs or both sides of the equation in such cases the error between the two sides is used as an indicator for a cyberattack event three possible cyberattack scenarios can be detected in this context case 1 only the scada measurements used for the demand estimation i e quantity variables are altered by an attack in this case the epanet model will produce wrong pressure values and yield high errors when compared to pressure scada readings a wrong off pump status signal in one demand zone for example will cause an underestimation of demand and as a result an overestimation of pressure in the rhs of eq 1 case 2 only the pressure measurements are altered by the attacker in this case the demand estimation will be accurate and epanet will produce pressures which are close to the real pressures rhs of eq 1 but which still differ from the wrong scada readings lhs of eq 1 case 3 all scada readings are altered in such a case the demand estimation will be wrong however the epanet pressure values will still accord with the system s physics hydraulics major errors will thus be observed between the epanet pressures and the scada pressures unless the attacker changes the pressure according to the network s physical properties the implementation of the process described in eq 1 is summarized in fig 1 as can be seen the scada quantity variables flows tank levels and pump statuses are used for estimating the demands in the network which are then simulated by epanet in order to formulate the simulated reference values of the system hydraulics i e flows tank levels pump statuses and pressures the error vectors are then calculated based on these reference values and classified into normal and abnormal operation conditions 2 3 demand estimation model the demand estimation model is primarily based on solving the network flow problem without accounting for system pressure in other words it is meant for solving the network s water balance problem however unlike the classical network flow problem where demands are given and link flows are unknown the demands here are unknown while the flows are given for a subset of links the system should thus satisfy the water balance as described in eq 2 at each time step 2 a t q t q t δ v t where a t is the network incidence matrix q t is a vector of the flow in the network s links q t is a vector of the demand in the network s nodes and δ v t is a vector of the water volume change in the network s tanks given the district metering areas dmas it is possible to parametrize the demand in the network s nodes according to dma demands this parametrization yields a mass balance model as given in eq 3 the parametrization matrix δ is a mapping matrix between the dmas demands and the network s nodal demands as such it has a row for each node and a column for each dma each row has one non zero element which is equal to the fraction of the node s demand from its corresponding dma demand 3 a t q t δ d t δ v t where δ is the parametrization matrix with given coefficients and d t is a vector of the dmas demand in hours t τ o n o f f where τ o n o f f is the subset of hours with pump status switches eq 3 yields a unique solution for demand vector d t that is given scada values for a subset of q t i e flow in pumps and a storage change from the tanks scada readings it is possible to obtain unique values for d t when t τ o n o f f the obtained d t is an estimation of dma demands under the assumption that the pump flow at the beginning of the time step i e 1 hour is constant along this time step for hours t τ o n o f f the flow in the system links is not given in the scada records this is because the actual times where the pump switch status is not reported for example if a pump begins the hour with an on status and is turned off after 5 min then assuming a positive flow along the entire hour will lead to an overestimation of the dmas demand nevertheless it is still possible to use the pumps control rules in order to predict the switch points by linking the pump flow with the tank water levels according to the specified control rules we formulate a mixed integer linear program milp model to estimate dma demands when t τ o n o f f the milp formulation is necessary because of the discontinuous pump control rules the milp model assumes a constant hourly demand and a 15 min integration time step where the pumps statuses are determined on the basis of the control rules at the end of each integration time step in this respect two distinct cases must be singled out the first is when a pump turns on during the hour and the second is when a pump turns off during the hour the milp formulation given in eq 4 covers these two cases as well as the no switches case where t τ o n o f f 4 min ω 1 t v t 4 v t e n d 1 ω 1 t y t 5 s t e n d subject to c 1 v t i v t i 1 a t q t i δ d t 0 25 i 1 4 c 2 p t j p t 0 j j j t o f f c 3 p t j p t e n d j j j t

hour t with the elements v t i k for tank k v t 0 v t e n d are scada values for the volumes at the beginning and end of the hour respectively s t 0 s t e n d are vectors of scada values for the pump statuses at the beginning and end of the hour respectively with the elements s t 0 j and s t e n d j p t 0 j p t e n d j are scada values for pump j s flow rate at the beginning and end of the hour respectively p t j is pump j s flow rate at time t a t is the network incidence matrix q t i is a vector of link flows with the elements q t i l for link l δ is a given transformation matrix from dma demands to nodal demands d t is a vector of dma demands y t i j are binary variables which take a value of 1 if pump j is on during quarter i m is a large scalar value v j v j are tank volumes which trigger pump j on and off respectively ω is a weighting factor j l is the pump connected to link l j t o f f is the set of pumps switched off during time t j t o n is the set of pumps switched on during time t j ˆ t o f f j ˆ t o n is the set of pumps which did not switch status during time t and j k is the pump controlled by tank k the optimization problem in eq 4 is a milp problem which results in the demand values for all dmas note that the absolute values in the objective function can be easily transformed into linear constraints the first constraint represents the water balance in the tanks over the course of 1 h at 0 25 h time steps constraints 2 4 consider the non zero flow values during any hour while constraint 5 represents all the pump operation combinations assuming a status change can only occur at the end of each quarter hour constraints 6 7 guarantee that any pump will only be triggered on or off once during the hour constraint 9 represents the control rules and governing volumes for each pump tank pair for example when v t i k v j k the value will be y t i 1 j k 0 in order to satisfy the constraint and thus pump j k will be turned off during the next quarter of the hour constraint 6 in turn guarantees that it will be turned off during the remainder of the hour it is worth noting that the estimation method described above is based solely on the network water balance at each time step and thus does not require the demand s statistical properties moreover the demand estimation methodology is scalable to large networks i e the size of the milp does not increase significantly because 1 the milp is formulated for each time step independently meaning that extended simulation has no impact on its size 2 the milp is formulated on the dma scale i e an aggregated scale meaning that the size of the problem is a function of the number of dmas not a function of the number of pipes and nodes the milp will thus be tractable in large networks since the number of dmas is significantly smaller than number of nodes 2 4 error classification the demands derived from the milp model are used as an input for an epanet simulation such as to produce reference values for the system s hydraulics i e pump flows status pressures and tank levels these reference values are then used for generating errors between the model and scada readings we first generate the errors in the training dataset i e dataset 1 which represents the no attack normal operation of the system the different components errors are then analyzed in order to calculate thresholds for normal over and under estimation errors i e positive and negative errors these thresholds are then used for defining outliers in the error vectors we follow a multilevel approach in which we record the thresholds for different moving average values of training dataset error that is to say given the error vector e i for hydraulic components e g flow valve pressure sensor or tank it becomes possible to calculate moving averages with 0 k lags for each hydraulic component i thus producing k 1 error vectors e i k k 0 k we then define two error thresholds as the α and 1 α percentiles for each of these error vectors which are in turn defined as e i k and e i k respectively these thresholds will then be used for identifying outliers in datasets which include cyberattacks i e dataset 2 to declare an outlier at time t with moving average lag k we require that at least δ 1 hydraulic components experience an outlier however the declaration of an event from the system requires that at least δ 2 out of the k 1 moving averages outliers are flagged an outlier in hydraulic component i and moving average lag k is declared if the error at time t e i t k is below e i k or above e i k as such this outlier s identification process produces k 1 i outlier vectors o i k with the element o i t k being 1 if time t of hydraulic component i and moving average lag k is an outlier with o i t k being zero otherwise eq 5 5 o i t k 1 i f e i t k e i k o r e i t k e i k 0 e l s e given the outliers values at time t o i t k i k it is necessary to define a decision rule that would declare an alarm based on the obtained outlier values for the purposes of the present study this decision rule is defined in eqs 6 and 7 6 b t k 1 i f i 1 i o i t k δ 1 0 e l s e 7 a t 1 i f k 0 k b t k δ 2 0 e l s e where a t is the value of the alarm at time t which takes a value of one if an alarm is declared and zero otherwise b t k is an auxiliary variable used for defining a t and δ 1 δ 2 are parameters which should be calibrated in order to optimize system performance the decision rule in eq 6 indicates that we require at least δ 1 hydraulic components to experience an outlier error i e the definition of b t k if we are to declare an alarm at time t with moving average lag k on the other hand at least δ 2 out of the k 1 moving average alarms need to be flagged i e the definition of a t if we are to declare a system alarm fig 2 demonstrates the alarm identification process for an illustrative example with four hydraulic components while setting k 2 δ 1 2 and δ 2 3 given the error vectors e i i 1 4 and the thresholds e i k e i k i k which are obtained from the α 0 01 and 1 α 0 99 percentiles of the attack free dataset the alarms identification process is summarized in fig 2 since k 2 the four given error vectors are used for building the moving average errors for lags 0 2 and thus creating 12 error vectors i e four for each moving average as can also be seen in fig 2 the outlier identification process which defines the three binary vectors b k k 0 2 is based on δ 1 2 in other words we require two hydraulic component outliers in order to define an outlier from moving average lag k in moving average lag 1 at time 1278 for example the errors of component 2 and component 4 exceed the error thresholds and thus b 1 it has a value of 1 at time 1278 the alarm identification process is based on δ 2 3 which implies that at least three moving average outliers should be declared in order to raise an alarm this condition is satisfied at time 1278 where the three vectors b k k 0 2 have a value of one 2 5 pre solve procedure in addition to the model based analysis a pre solve procedure is performed in order to check the scada input data for times in which there is a contradiction in the physical rules parameters between the scada data and specific elements in the analyzed network this procedure does not depend on the demand derivation and on the epanet simulation and thus in a sense is deterministic the occurrence of an event can thus be declared with a high degree of reliability in cases of physical rule violations the pre solve procedure includes three simple checks a do the reported pump or valve statuses fit the reported flows if the pump status is reported as off for example then the flow should be zero an alarm is declared if this is not the case b does the reported tank level meet the tank s physical boundaries c does the pump s operation point the pump head and flow fall on the pump s characteristic curve more specifically since it is possible to calculate the pump s head given the inlet and the outlet pressure in each pump station this head should fall on the pump s characteristic curve for the reported flow rate an alarm is declared if this is not the case the alarms declared during the pre solve procedure are added to the alarms indicator a t in other words a t 1 if at time t the answer to one or more of the above three questions is no 2 6 calibration we used enumeration in the calibration phase in order to determine the optimal values of α δ 1 δ 2 which maximize a performance measure that accounts for the true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr and average detection time adt as defined in eq 8 in this enumeration procedure we first discretize the three parameters within a predetermined range to create a 3d grid and then evaluate the classification performance in each grid point the grid point with the best performance is selected as possessing the best values for the three parameters of the classification methodology it should be noted that this calibration process is performed only after the errors are generated as such the calibration problem will always include three parameters regardless of wds network size meaning that the calibration problem is solvable by the enumeration procedure even when a large scale network is analyzed 8 η ω 1 t p r ω 2 t n r ω 3 η a d t where η is the overall cds performance measure ω i i 1 3 are weighting factors and η a d t is the adt performance measure which scales the adt to a 0 1 range similar to the tpr and tnr measures the tpr and the tnr are defined in eqs 9 and 10 9 t p r t p t p f n 10 t n r t n t n f p where tp is true positive alarms that is the number of times the system was under an attack that was recognized by the algorithm fn is false negative alarms that is the number of times where the algorithm failed to detect that the system was under attack tn is true negative alarms that is the number of times the algorithm identified situations in which the system was not under attack correctly and fp is false positive alarms that is the number of times in which the algorithm generated an alarm incorrectly because the system was not actually under attack the detection time of the j th event d t j is defined as in batadal 2016 by using the difference between the time t a j s at which an alarm is raised and the time t e j s at which the event started if the event was not detected we set d t j as the event duration δ t j as given in eq 11 11 d t j min t a j s t e j s δ t j the adt performance measure η a d t is thus as defined in eq 12 12 η a d t 1 1 n e j 1 n e d t j δ t j where n e is the total number of events η a d t ranges between 0 and 1 with η a d t 1 representing an ideal case in which all events are immediately detected and η a d t 0 representing the worst possible performance where none of the events are detected 3 application the cds proposed above has been implemented on the data published in the battle of the attack detection algorithms batadal competition batadal 2016 the competition considers the c town wds layout and hourly scada readings from each of the five pumping stations and seven tanks as well as one flow control valve fig 3 the scada readings include records for the flow rate the inlet and outlet pressure and the status of each pump in every pumping station as well as the system tanks water levels the batadal data included three datasets a dataset 1 which includes readings from 12 months before the installation of cyber physical devices e g devices with telemetric capabilities such as pressure readings tank level sensors etc as such it is guaranteed to be attack free and can be used for studying normal system operations b dataset 2 which includes readings from approximately 6 months after the installation of the cyber physical devices this dataset includes attacks which were discovered by the operators and thus these attacks are labeled attacks c dataset 3 which includes readings from 3 months of labeled attacks datasets 1 2 were used for the system calibration while dataset 3 was used to test its performance the attacks in datasets 2 3 were simulated using the epanetcpa toolbox taormina et al 2017 3 1 results the developed cds was coded using matlab and begins with a pre solve procedure which includes three simple checks for the violation of trivial physical conditions as detailed in the previous section in order to demonstrate the pre solve procedure let us examine the operation points of pump 10 as shown in fig 4 the figure shows the pump head calculated as the difference between the outlet and the inlet pressure versus the pump flow rate under normal conditions any point should fall on the pump s characteristic curve fig 4 shows that the points for times 2028 2051 do not correspond to the characteristic curve and thus indicate abnormal scada readings which violate the laws of physics applicable to the pump and indeed the system was in fact under attack as described by the second attack in table 1 during the aforementioned time points 2028 2051 the cds begins the actual model based detection after the pre solve procedure as shown in fig 1 the model based methodology relies on estimated demands derived from the milp model in order to produce reference values for the system s normal behavior as such the quality of these reference values depends on the accuracy of the estimated demands the milp program was formulated using yalmip toolbox lofberg 2004 where cplex 12 6 1 international buisness machines 2014 was used as the optimization problem solver as explained previously the milp is formulated for each time step independently as such it is a small size milp 43 continuous variables and 60 binary variables which is solved efficiently average cpu time 0 25 s on i7 4700mq cpu 2 4 ghz machine using the original demand patterns which are not observable to our detection methodology fig 5 presents the performance of the demand estimation methodology with respect to the five dmas and with respect to the total demand of the c town network fig 3 the results show the histograms of the relative errors for the six estimated dma demands when using dataset 1 all estimation errors have near zero mean and a standard deviation of up to 0 3 demonstrating the accuracy of the demand estimation methodology by relying on dataset 1 and dataset 2 and after applying the demand estimation methodology and calculating the error vectors it becomes possible to calibrate cds parameters α δ 1 and δ 2 against a dataset with labeled attacks with this in mind our calibration phase employed batadal competition dataset 2 which includes seven attacks as detailed in table 1 we then determined the optimal values for the three parameters which maximize the cds s overall performance η where k 9 these optimal values are 0 2 and 2 for α δ 1 and δ 2 respectively and using them produces a system performance score of η 0 97 on dataset 2 as can be seen in the calibration result illustrated in fig 6 the cds captured all seven of the attacks detailed in table 1 during the calibration phase but at the cost of three false alarms still the value of η which is very close to 1 indicates that near perfect performance is obtained in the calibration phase because these false alarms are very short and do not exert a significant impact on the performance measure we further tested the methodology by applying the cds on dataset 3 which also includes seven attacks as detailed in table 2 this dataset is provided in batadal 2016 for testing purposes and thus was not used in the cds s development or calibration according to table 2 there is an attack during time 298 367 which impacts tank t3 and pump 4 s operation in dma 3 fig 7 presents the data readings for tank 3 and pump 4 with the readings during event time in red however fig 7 alone is insufficient for distinguishing any abnormal behavior during the attack through the mere examination of these readings nevertheless and since the proposed cds examines all readings simultaneously for violations of physical behavior and or operation rules the cds is still capable of detecting that there is something wrong with the readings at these points in time fig 8 presents the outliers from the tanks and pressure sensors for different moving average lags note we only show 4 out of the 10 moving average lags 0 9 each of the subfigures in fig 8 shows the different hydraulic components on the y axis that is tanks 1 7 pumps 1 11 and pressure sensors 1 12 the blue stamps are added when an outlier is obtained in one of the components signals the results show that several components in different lags were able to detect the attacks for example the third event was detected by many components in moving average lags 0 9 nevertheless some attacks were better captured in the large moving average lags for example the first event is detected by two components in moving average lags 0 and 1 but by five components in moving average lags 8 and 9 our error classification methodology requires one outlier vector from each moving average lag eq 6 this outlier s vector is obtained by requiring δ 1 2 components to violate the thresholds for example the outliers in moving average lag 0 between times 0 1500 will not give rise to an outlier in moving average lag 0 indicator b t 0 because only one component flagged an outlier at each time instance the events identification process uses the moving average outliers b t k to raise an alarm for a cyber attack event more specifically an alarm is raised if at least δ 2 2 moving average outliers are found as such and since none of b t k k 0 9 t 0 1500 is flagged no alarm is raised in the course of times 0 1500 fig 9 presents the algorithm s performance for the calibrated values δ 1 2 and δ 2 2 the results show that the alarms i e aggregation of the pre solve and the model based procedure were capable of detecting all the labeled events with one false positive and an overall performance of η 0 99 the pre solve procedure was able to capture some of the events too as also shown in fig 9 the third event for example was detected by the pre solve procedure because the scada reading during this period did not pass the third check that is to say the pumps pressure difference and flow rate did not fall on the pump s characteristic curve in a manner akin to the case presented in fig 4 nevertheless since the pre solve procedure cannot indicate events such as tank levels altering or events with good concealment it is not recommended as a standalone procedure in such case it will yield poor performance of tpr 0 25 tnr 1 since the pre solve has no fp and overall score of η 0 81 3 2 sensitivity analysis in order to examine the sensitivity of the algorithm to errors in the demand estimation we have added a normally distributed noise to the estimated dmas demand which are obtained from the milp model the sensitivity of the cds is examined in fig 10 which presents the performance of the model based model for different levels of noise we have considered three level of noise which are normally distributed around zero with different level of coefficient of variation cv the results show only minor deterioration even in relatively high cv values this robust performance is attributed to the fact that the calibration procedure is performed after the demand estimation thus if high uncertainty is expected in the demand estimates the calibration procedure can tune the thresholds of the cds to account for this high uncertainty the performance index η is 0 98 0 97 0 96 for cv of 0 05 0 15 0 25 respectively 4 conclusions the present study offered a model based fd methodology which utilizes a physically based water hydraulics simulation model epanet for detecting cyberattacks on wdss the method utilizes a three phase approach in which 1 the demand is estimated based on part of the scada readings 2 a hydraulic model is used for checking whether the scada s hydraulic data corresponds to the estimated demand 3 a multilevel classification approach is then implemented in order to classify the obtained errors into outlier and normal errors the results show that the proposed methodology was able to raise a timely alarm for all the labeled simulated cyberattack events however the results presented herein assumed unrealistically perfectly calibrated hydraulic model thus the only source of uncertainty was the network demand data which was not provided in batadal datasets a more generalized case would require us to account for the uncertainty in the calibration of an imperfect model as well as for other sources of uncertainty such as sensor noise thus future research should examine the required calibration s goodness of fit and its impact on the detection algorithm s performance acknowledgments this research was made possible by the
