21805,the operational requirements for naval and research vessels have seen an increasing demand for quieter ships either to comply with the ship operational requirements or to minimize the influence of shipping noise on marine life the radiated noise of a ship is estimated during the design stage by measurements with a scale model generally realized in a tunnel or a depressurized tank dga hydrodynamics owns its cavitation tunnel with low background noise that allows such measurements nowadays a low background noise of the whole facility is not sufficient to perform an accurate acoustic measurement improving our knowledge about the acoustic response of the facility is then required to assess the relationship between the measurements and the noise radiated by a propeller for example the confined geometry of the test section imposes particular boundary conditions to the acoustic propagation and a reverberation like behaviour the acoustic response of the facility is then disturbed compared to a free field configuration this particular acoustic behaviour makes the absolute estimate of the underwater radiated noise power very difficult a possibility to overcome this problem could be the use of an appropriated model coupled with the modal propagation theory following this approach a method to estimate both modal magnitudes and wall impedance is proposed in this paper and confronted to experimental results keywords demodulation wall impedance cavitation tunnel 1 introduction numerous studies have been performed since many years with the aim to improve our understanding of underwater radiated noise induced by a propeller military reasons as well as impacts on marine fauna have motivated several institutes to study noise generation by vessels even if the help of computational fluid dynamics cfd is a way to predict the noise level emitted by a vessel see testa et al 2017 experimental approaches like measurements in cavitation tunnel with a scaled model is nowadays preferred because its reliability ittc 2017 other experimental facilities deal with the same goals in depressurized tank with others acoustical effects as reverberation and motion of the model inside the facility see for example lafeber et al 2015 the performance of such measurements to predict the underwater noise levels at full scale is strongly linked to our knowledge of the facility and our capability to take into account its acoustic response during the analysis from an acoustical point of view the useful section of a cavitation tunnel looks like a duct filled with water even if the acoustic propagation in duct is well known by acousticians this topic is still subject of research with the aim to develop more applicable models and or to take into account more details as a particular flow or specific geometries actually since several decades different experiments have been performed inside ducts in air with or without flow abom 1989 dalmont 2001 schultz et al 2006 boucheron 2017 with the aim to decompose the acoustic field into several modes that propagate several methods dedicated to the estimate of complex magnitude of propagative modes have been proposed and used with success in cases without flow and high acoustic levels the goal is generally to decompose the acoustic field and to estimate the absorption performance of a given liner recently such experiments have been performed with the presence of a mean flow in air in a wind tunnel suzuki and day 2015 another application of such approach is described by xin et al 2018 to estimate the impedance of a duct termination or also to combine vibrations of the duct with the acoustic propagation inside as done for example by pagneux and aurégan 1998 the problem in our configuration is slightly different the estimate of the acoustic noise level of an acoustic source in a cavitation tunnel is generally performed with the help of several hydrophones close to the source to be measured see section 3 further the proximity of sensors close to the source is needed to improve the signal to noise ratio and also regarding the reverberation of the facility as explained by briançon marjollet et al 2013 and tani et al 2015a this configuration is classically used with transfer functions to correct the results obtained for different experimental features as directivity of sensors reverberation or resonance inside the tunnel see for example boucheron 2019a high deviation of transfer functions could be observed experimentally when the location of the acoustic source is slightly shifted tani et al 2015b corrections made by the transfer function are then highly sensitive to the accuracy of measurements and location of the source the reason generally admitted by the community is that the near field imposed by the source is dependent on its location and on the decomposition of the field into propagative evanescent waves the closer to an anti node of a given mode the source the more important the complex magnitude of this mode boucheron 2017 hynninen et al 2017 in consequence we have to manage both modes that propagate and modes that decay in the vicinity of the source which generally leads the existing iterative methods to diverge due to their high sensitivity to discrepancies in parallel to theoretical studies acousticians are looking for measuring each mode magnitude expressed in complex plane that is including the phase information to describe the whole acoustic field in the duct several methods have been developed in particular cases like hard wall boundary conditions this could be done experimentally in rectangular case see schultz et al 2006 suzuki and day 2015 or circular cases abom 1989 dalmont 2001 as examples these techniques could be employed successfully to manage the radiation impedance of a given duct end stage or to measure absorption of a liner disposed inside the duct as performed by pagneux et al 1996 for example several numerical methods have also been developed to deduce the liner impedance of a duct with mean flow as done by jones et al 2005 the impedance of the duct walls in air applications are taken to be so large that the hypothesis of a very small admittance holds however in cavitation tunnel the infinite impedance hypothesis for the duct walls has to be called into question due to the relative impedance z mat z water between propagation medium water and wall material indeed denoting ϱ for density and c 0 for celerity in a medium the impedance ϱ c 0 ratio between water and stainless steel is about 30 which remains a high value but for perspex material used for cavitation tunnel windows the ratio is around 2 modifications due to the presence of this finite impedance at wall are important and need to be managed gingerly this key point in our configuration is taken into account in the proposed method and discussed during the analysis of the results obtained experimentally in our cavitation tunnel the inverse problem considered here consists of retrieving both modal magnitudes and impedance features the paper is structured in five sections the next one describes the modal acoustic theory whereas the third section presents the proposed demodulation method the fourth section is dedicated to the results obtained with simulation performed to characterize the main features of the demodulation algorithm and to assess its reliability conditions the last part presents the facility used to get experimental data finally results are presented and discussed after which the conclusions are given 2 modal propagation the acoustic field inside a duct could be described by the modal propagation theory presented in the next paragraph the application of modal theory to the finite impedance case is presented thereafter 2 1 modal propagation model in a perfect rectangular duct 1 1 this duct shape has been chosen because the shape of the two test sections of our cavitation tunnel the gth as described later all the theory could be adapted to the circular shape with the help of bessel functions which modify the modal shape functions ψ m n y z see morse and ingard 1968 for example the solution of helmholtz equation that describes the acoustic propagation could be expressed as a superposition of several modes according to morse and ingard 1968 bruneau 1998 and munjal 2014 the acoustic pressure p inside the duct could be expressed as 1 p x y z t m n ψ m n y z a m n e j k x m n x b m n e j k x m n x e j ω t ω being the angular frequency j 1 k ω c 0 is the wavenumber and c 0 is the celerity in the considered medium here k x m n is the axial wavenumber associated with the mode m n m respectively n is the mode number on y dimension respectively z dimension eq 1 shows that propagation is considered in both downstream and upstream directions the coefficients a m n respectively b m n are the complex magnitudes associated with the upstream respectively downstream direction of propagation if hard wall conditions are considered the wave equation leads to modal shapes ψ m n expressed by 2 ψ m n y z cos m π y l y cos n π z l z here l y and l z are the different lengths of the section for a square section l y l z introducing these equations in the general helmholtz equation we obtain the classical dispersion equation for rectangular duct 3 k x m n ω c 0 2 m π l y 2 n π l z 2 this axial wavenumber is important in propagation because its value reveals the ability of a mode to propagate for such a propagating mode k x m n has to be real for a given frequency this is only possible for a limiting number of modes increasing the mode order m or n makes k x m n decreasing and becoming imaginary the limiting value k x m n 0 determines the cut off frequency f m n c given by f m n c c 0 2 m l y 2 n l z 2 for a given mode m n only frequencies higher than f m n c can propagate other modes denoted by a wavenumber purely imaginary are called evanescent and no acoustic energy is propagating within this mode all these equations are available so long as hard wall conditions could be considered in other cases the modal shapes are different this adaptation is presented in the following 2 2 finite impedance model the model presented straight above should be adapted to the finite impedance conditions the global solution for the acoustic pressure inside the duct eq 1 is still available we consider then here a finite value of the impedance at the wall in order to compute the modal shape functions ψ m n z y z the modifications of the boundary conditions modify in return the acoustic propagation features the complex wall impedance z w links the acoustic pressure at wall with the normal acoustic velocity if we run the x axis of propagation along the central line of the duct the boundary condition for the wall on y direction the same equation holds for the z direction could be written as morse and ingard 1968 p y y l y 2 j k z w p y l y 2 in this case the modal shapes should not be expressed by eq 2 but by see morse and ingard 1968 4 ψ m n z y z cs m q m y l y cs n q n z l z where cs m q m x cos π q m x when m 0 2 4 sin π q m x when m 1 3 5 the boundary conditions are then used to compute the tangential propagation constant q m y by solving the transcendental eigen equations boucheron 2019a 5 π q m y 2 tan π q m y 2 j 2 k l y z w for m even π q m y 2 cot π q m y 2 j 2 k l y z w for m odd these equations do not admit analytical solution even if for very small admittance more precisely if the quantity k l z w 1 approximated solutions exist therefore numerical solutions of these equations are required in our case a newton raphson method has been employed here to solve these equations a paragraph is dedicated to this problem in section 3 5 the global values for the axial wavenumber could then be computed with the following dispersion equation 6 k x m n 2 ω c 0 2 π q m y l y 2 π q n z l z 2 this theory explained briefly here shows that the demodulation process is drastically more complex with finite impedance because the modal shape is impedance dependent we can compare basically the demodulation method to the mathematical process of the estimation of coordinates of given points in a 2d plane mathematically this process is simply achieved with a scalar projection the pressure measurements in the demodulation technique are the equivalent of the points and the modal shapes are the equivalent of the mathematical base used to define the 2d space in the case of an infinite value for the impedance assumed at the wall the base is fully defined the method consists of projecting the measurements onto the base in our case because the impedance is unknown the base has to be estimated simultaneously to the coordinates of the points that is why a direct method is not possible and an iterative process could be a way to overcome this problem moreover all quantities involved in the theory are complex this point is important because we have to deal with complex wavenumber for each mode indeed with hard wall conditions the dispersion equation eq 3 leads to pure real wavenumber for propagating modes or pure imaginary modes for evanescent modes if we are interested of acoustic propagation far away from acoustic sources evanescent modes could be neglected because they exist only in the near field of the source and are decreasing rapidly with distance with an exponential decay behaviour in the case of a finite impedance with real and imaginary part this is never the case because all wavenumbers are complex with real and imaginary part that is to say that all modes are decaying modes 2 2 with an imaginary part of the wavenumber non equals to zero only the decaying modes are physically realistic the growing modes are not physically a solution notice that on the other side of a source let say x 0 or x 0 the propagation constant are reversed a growing mode for x 0 becomes a decaying mode for x 0 because the sign in the exponential argument changes the demodulation method proposed in the next section tries to manage these aspects 3 demodulation method and impedance estimate the modal decomposition consists of finding the different magnitudes a m n and b m n of an experimental data set this method developed several decades ago is sensitive to experimental errors the problem is generally ill conditioned and could produce huge discrepancies for the results due to the experimental deviations one way to perform the inversion is to separate the problem in real and imaginary values as proposed by schultz et al 2006 this method has been explored recently in cavitation tunnel by boucheron 2017 and is extended here to the case of wall with finite impedance the principle consists of measuring the acoustic pressure p complex magnitudes with sensors at different locations in the duct for a given frequency the acoustic field could be decomposed using the global expression of eq 1 with the appropriated shape from eq 4 the method described here is based on an iterative process due to the impossibility to estimate both the modal shapes and the amplitudes as explained just above in order to initialize the process we perform a demodulation step with an infinite impedance see paragraph 3 1 for the description of this step we obtain complex magnitudes a m n and b m n then the iterative process starts the two important steps are described in section 3 2 for the impedance estimation step and section 3 3 for the complex magnitudes of each mode 3 1 step 1 complex magnitudes estimate for hard wall case this step is formally the same as the demodulation method proposed by schultz et al 2006 and used in boucheron 2017 for the cavitation tunnel case with n hydrophones this step can be modelled by the following equation p m x p 1 p 2 p n m 11 m 12 m 1 p m 21 m n 1 m n p x 1 x 2 x p the unknown vector x is composed of the different coefficients a m n and b m n the number of demodulated modes p is the number of all couple of numbers m n that correspond to the modes that are to be taken into account the rectangular matrix m is composed of modal shape coefficients ψ m n y z according to eq 2 applied to the location of each sensor used in the process these coefficients are complex and make the matrix m ill conditioned boucheron 2017 schultz et al 2006 one way to perform the inversion of matrix m is to separate the problem in real and imaginary values as proposed by schultz et al 2006 the problem is then re written as 7 p m x re p im p re m im m im m re m re x im x the inversion of the matrix m is then solved using a truncated singular value decomposition this technique is usually more robust to noise and gets the benefit to allow limiting the number of singular values used for the matrix inversion if necessary indeed the singular value decomposition of matrix m is expressed by m u σ v t where u and v are unitary orthogonal matrices and σ is the diagonal matrix of singular values sorted by magnitude finally the estimated solution for the inverse problem is obtained from 8 x v σ 1 u t p the three matrices v σ 1 and u t could be r rank limited if necessary see hansen 1998 the matrix σ is diagonal and its inverse σ 1 is also a diagonal matrix composed of inverse singular values the different complex magnitudes are then combined with the different terms of x this method employed on experimental case by boucheron 2017 gives acceptable results even if sometimes important discrepancies remain between the model and the measurements it appears that the limitation of the matrix rank does not improve the demodulation process but it only selects the more energetic modes the discrepancies observed between the model obtained by demodulation and the measurements could be explained mainly by an inappropriate model due to the impedance of wall but also due to the limited accuracy of the experimental measurements it is the reason to develop a method to take into account the wall impedance in the process the chart of this initializing step is summarized by the algorithm 1 3 2 step 2 complex impedance estimate this step is devoted to the estimate of the impedance of the wall according to the fact that we try to converge towards the solution we suppose that the initial step is close to the solution in this step we assume that complex magnitudes a m n and b m n are input the algorithm is based on newton raphson method adapted for non linear case for convenience the impedance z w is expressed in terms of admittance β w divided also in real part and imaginary part as β w 1 z w ξ w j σ w the unknown vector b of the algorithm is then composed of real part ξ and imaginary part σ of the admittance for each wall namely 9 b ξ y σ y ξ z σ z the relationship used in the iterative newton raphson process with relaxation coefficient denoted by λ fixed at 0 5 for all this study is then expressed as 10 b k 1 b k λ j b k 1 f b k ξ y σ y ξ z σ z k 1 ξ y σ y ξ z σ z k λ f 1 ξ y f n ξ y f 1 σ y f n σ y f 1 ξ z f n ξ z f 1 σ z f n σ z 1 f 1 b k f n b k with the definition of the function f b the newton raphson definition function whose roots are researched 11 f b k p m b k f 1 b k f n b k p 1 p n m 11 m 14 m n 1 m n 4 ξ y σ y ξ z σ z the function f b makes the comparison between the measurements p and the optimized model m b k notice that the term m b k is used to comply with the mathematical definition of the newton raphson method in practice this term is evaluated simply by the eqs 1 4 5 and 6 the derivatives of the function used in the definition of the jacobian matrix are given in appendix the global chart of this algorithm could be summarized by the algorithm 2 3 3 step 3 demodulation method finite impedance case this last step assumes that the impedance estimate is correct then the principle is the same as the first step except that we have to deal with complex quantities decaying modes have to be managed cautiously because of diverging magnitude when we estimate the acoustic pressure close to the source due to the exponential behaviour of their magnitudes if a small difference far from the source is attributed to a decaying mode its magnitude will be considerably increased thus some relaxation parameters are introduced to converge slowly towards a solution and not diverging rapidly the global chart of this step is given in algorithm 3 the management of evanescent and decaying modes is the following for highly decayed modes and necessarily the evanescent ones if they exist the evaluation of mode is done only in the half space containing the decaying behaviour not the diverging behaviour that is to say that only the decaying shape of the mode is taken into account see the previous footnote moreover in the demodulation process the discrepancies between the model and the measurements are shared into different modes in order to converge on the solution small quantities could be allocated to evanescent modes or decaying modes due to the exponential behaviour of this decay magnitude a m n or b m n could be very high this aspect is avoided in the algorithm by forcing the amplitude of modes that are diverging to be zero in the half space of their exponential behaviour such rules are not restricting enough to ensure the amplitude not diverging in the particular case when the source is in the considered volume the amplitude of each decaying mode could be diverging due to discrepancies between the model at a given step and the measurements if the method tends to increase considerably the magnitude of a given mode let say ten times the maximum absolute value of pressure then this amplitude is set to zero 3 4 global chart of the method the whole method is then presented and discussed in this paragraph the global chart is described in the algorithm 4 the core of the method is a loop inside the while statement it consists of alternatively estimating the impedance with algorithm 2 and the complex magnitudes with the algorithm 3 in addition these magnitudes are slightly relaxed to prevent high jump in solution that could make the method diverging the relaxation coefficient λ 2 is fixed to 0 8 for all the tests investigated in this study after each process an evaluation of the discrepancies between the present model and measurements is made the average error and the standard deviation are computed and recorded as explained previously the decaying modes are managed with a brutal law forcing a mode to be zero if the pressure magnitude is too high such rule is required to manage decaying modes but is obviously not acceptable if the mode is present in order to be sure to consider most of the possibilities the algorithm is used with a chaotic principle regularly some discrepancies with the help of an added noise are imposed to modal amplitudes or to impedance values alternatively this process is used in order to compel the algorithm considering numerous combinations and to introduce some complex amplitude which could be not considered in previous steps see discussion in boucheron 2019a b two noise distributions have been used for disturbing a m n b m n or z w the normal distribution has been employed for the magnitude of the parameter and the uniform distribution for its phase the first steps of the method are particularly concerned by this behaviour because the initial step is provided by the demodulation assuming an infinite impedance at the walls then all the modes propagate and all the transverse acoustic wavenumber are real if no evanescent modes are considered in the problem thus the impedance step is then firstly used with perfect propagating modes only since the third step all quantities are complex and could converge to ensure convergence of such process relaxation parameters of both methods the one for impedance and the other one for modal magnitudes are introduced and have to be set cautiously consequently one of the drawback of such method is the need of numerous steps to be sure to converge against a solution 3 5 transcendental eigen equation solutions the specific step of solving one of the two transcendental eq 5 is here considered this latter is rewritten with new variable g defined by q m 2 j g and separating real part to imaginary part as g 1 2 ν m j 1 2 μ m which gives g tanh π g j h e j φ for m even g coth π g j h e j φ for m odd h e j φ β k l y 2 π the principle of the method is based on a newton raphson method with a relaxation coefficient indeed the solution of these equations in complex plane is easy because a lot of solutions exist but tricky if a particular mode is researched which is our case the initial value used as an input for the method is given by the infinite impedance solution to ensure the algorithm not converging on a solution with another number a small coefficient of relaxation is imposed for running the method λ 0 2 the fig 1 presents an example of the method process for both modes 0 and 1 for a given configuration the complex plane is represented with ν and μ reported on each axis contour plots representing h are plotted moreover background colour is coded with the phase value cold colours for negative phases and hot colours for positive phases contour lines are also represented with phase values every 10 the initial value infinite impedance case imposed to the method is located on the vertical axis the numerical method is stopped when an accuracy better than 10 15 is reached which is done in a maximum of dozen steps for all configuration tested in the present study fig 2 presents the convergence of the method for two computations on the same graph the line with circles respectively with squares represents the path used by the method for the z y z z respectively fixed at a different value from z y to exhibit the difference in behaviour between the initial step at left of each figure and the matched value the same case has been investigated with a relaxation coefficient of 0 7 at left and 0 2 at right as expected the method converges will a small number of steps for the higher relaxation coefficient the two solutions obtained for the z y case are the same conversely for the z z case the solutions are different due to a jump in the complex plane this jump is mainly due to the shape of the derivative functions and the large gap between each step that is to say that for a given order m of a mode the algorithm gives a solution of another mode another n because this step of the whole algorithm is dedicated to be run blindly that is without graphical check of convergence the relaxation coefficient has been adjusted to a lower value 0 2 for all the computations performed even if simulations with a coefficient of 0 5 has presented no jump in our tests 3 6 accuracy estimate a detail with great importance in the algorithm proposed is the estimate of the accuracy this estimate is performed at each step of the whole algorithm in order to detect the best fit between the model and the measurements one of the problems is here to give a germane variable depicting the accuracy of the model the difference between two complex magnitudes is a distance in complex plane as depicted by fig 3 let consider that the exact value is the point p m in fig 3 three different situations are considered for the estimated value namely p 1 p 2 and p 3 in the first case p 1 no phase shift is present but only a magnitude difference between the two points for the case p 3 the discrepancy between model and measurement is composed only by a shift in phase the case p 2 combines phase and magnitude differences basically the difference between all these points and the measured one could be estimated by the simple distance between each pair of points in the magnitude estimate process the difference between amplitude and phase difference must be differentiated the distance in case 1 could be expressed in pascal because it is real pressure in case 3 the magnitude in pressure is the same and there is no difference between the estimated and the measured one the distance is only due to a shift that is to say a delay between the two points physically if we refer to a hydrophone measurement it corresponds to an error in sensitivity for case 1 and in phase response for case 3 in order to be able to trade off this difference we define the accuracy of a model in complex plane by the criterion c defined with the two distance measurements p a and p a φ according to the following equations p a p m p i p a φ p m p i c m p a n p a φ m n the two integer coefficients m and n have to be chosen in order to focus on error in magnitude or in phase the variable c is a criterion evolving between two limits for a pure amplitude difference the value will be p a φ and for a pure phase difference the value will be p a φ n m n we can then realize a trade off of differences depending on hydrophone features in this study the couple m n 3 1 has been chosen 4 simulation the proposed method for acoustic demodulation with a simultaneous estimate of the wall impedances has been tested with simulated data the principle consists mainly of fixing complex magnitudes of several modes and impedance value with these values using the above equations the acoustic field could be computed inside the whole test section of the tunnel therefore choosing positions of sensors allows the computation of the complex magnitudes of the acoustic pressure these pressures are in return used by the method and results compared with the exact values results of the proposed algorithm applied to simulated data are presented in the following sections 4 1 demodulation different cases have been simulated to test the performances of the proposed method the configuration is the one the small test section of our cavitation tunnel with 31 sensors located at the wall along the test section of the tunnel the description is detailed further for an infinite impedance at the walls the first cut off frequency is estimated around 650 hz simulations have been performed at 1000 hz four different modes could propagate at this frequency in the case of a finite impedance at the walls all modes are decaying and numerous modes could appear table 1 presents the acoustic features of the first simulation and the results obtained by the algorithm for a case with high impedance and small reactance without noise that is considering those sensors are perfect the simulation has been conducted with 2000 steps fig 4 shows the convergence obtained by the algorithm for this first case it shows clearly that even if the results fit very well to the simulated data there are obtained after around 600 steps of the method it could be also observed that the different spikes on fig 4 denote the steps with added noise to amplitude or to impedance the accuracy obtained at the first step corresponds to the accuracy of the infinite impedance model fig 5 presents an evolution of the gain obtained at different steps during the process from the first point infinite impedance case to the optimal case each data from an individual sensor is represented in terms of difference between the exact value and the value estimated by the model in the complex plane this difference is expressed with magnitude and phase complex variables and presented in polar form to extend the scale a logarithm function is applied on magnitude with a reference chosen not to get negative values for the amplitude the first point is depicted by black triangles all others data are colour coded the cold colours represent the first steps and hot colours represent the last steps the red one being the optimal step found by the method ideally the last points depicted in red should be in the centre of the polar diagram the closer to centre the point the better accuracy of the complex magnitude estimate it could be observed that rapidly the method converges against the centre of the diagram the different points are spread over phase with approximatively the same accuracy for the same colour the difference in terms of amplitude between the triangles and the red points is the improvement of the method taking into account the finite impedance of the walls it could be summarized defining the gain factor by g g z g opt with 12 g z 20 log 10 δ p z and g o p t 20 log 10 δ p opt δ p z being the average of pressure differences at impedance z this gain is expressed in decibel and represents the improvement provided by the method obviously this gain is expected to be high for simulated data without noise and a hydrophone antenna adapted to the problem in this case it could be evaluated to 130 db moreover on fig 5 are represented the evolutions of five individual sensors with black lines only five to not overload the figure it could be observed that the first steps of the method reach rapidly a solution adjusting both magnitude and phase lines are crossing over the whole complex plane after this step the method is able to increase the gain by adjusting mainly the magnitude and maintaining the phase shift constant the lines are converging against zero along a radius during the last steps both amplitude and phase are adjusted this behaviour is linked to the fact that progressively the impedance phase is also adjusted by the method and close to the exact one associated to the convergence of the method the result in terms of acoustic field is represented in fig 6 three maps superimposed are represented each map represents the acoustic field at three walls as if the test section was flattened and seen from an upper view the upper wall is not represented for convenience the sensors are flush mounted and consequently at wall position they are represented by big circles the colour of the map and the circles is coded as a function of the real part of the acoustic pressure its scale is given by the colour bar at the right of the three figures the objective of the method is then to produce an acoustic field that fits with the data provided by sensor the map has to fit with circles each map is computed with the eq 1 with the complex magnitude of each mode provided by each method on the left of fig 6 are represented the results from the infinite impedance case in the middle the present method and at the right the exact acoustic field simulated it could be observed that even if the impedance is quite high the assumption of infinite impedance reach to discrepancies and the method is not able to converge on the solution this is due mainly to the fact that the wall impedance modify the axial wavenumber and also the shape of each mode which make the initial method failing to get great accuracy the solution proposed by our method fig 6 b succeeds to be very close to the exact values which is in accordance with the results given in table 1 4 2 sensitivity to noise to test the sensitivity of the method to noise several data sets have been created two kinds of noise have been generated with different amplitudes the first kind of noise n1 is a noise following a normal distribution with adjustable standard deviation n σ this noise could be added to sensor magnitude sensitivity of a real hydrophone is known generally with an accuracy of around 1 db this could generate in reality some discrepancies between the real acoustic field and the measured one moreover the response delay of each hydrophone could generate phase shift this could be simulated by imposing noise in phase to the simulated data it is represented by the second kind of noise n2 following a uniform distribution on a given phase range u d φ the acoustic features of the case simulated with noise are given in table 2 as an example fig 7 presents the acoustic fields obtained from the data sets corrupted with a noise of 0 5 db in magnitude the results in terms of modal magnitudes and impedance are given in table 3 it could be pointed out that the acoustic field estimated from the infinite impedance case is not so far from the exact case even if the impedance is lower than the case 1 the discrepancies visible on the acoustic field at left are erased on acoustic maps in the centre that makes the map estimated from the new technique comparable to the exact case the reconstructed field with the new method is very similar to the exact one however even if the global behaviour of the acoustic field estimated is great the results obtained by the method observed in detail reveal some errors the global magnitude and phase of the propagating modes presented in table 3 are globally well estimated by the method all these modes are propagating more precisely they are slightly decaying excepted the mode 1 1 which is highly decaying the imaginary part of the propagative constant is higher than the real part the different axial wavenumbers the exact values and the computed ones for the case 2 are represented in table 4 the presence of high decaying mode is probably one of the reasons of the difficulties for the method to converge on exact values see discussion in section 3 the estimated impedance values are close to the exact ones for the real part but the estimates of the imaginary part are inaccurate the propagating or slightly decaying modes are more stable than highly decaying modes consequently they are more easily estimated whereas the evanescent or highly decaying modes are more fickle and makes the convergence chaotic the error on wavenumber for this mode is higher than other discrepancies that make the estimate of modal magnitude very tricky 4 3 influence of hydrophone location arrangement in practice it is not always easy to dispose a hydrophone at a given location notably in cavitation tunnel for which structural considerations impose location constrains it is then important to consider a feasible hydrophone arrangement in order to appreciate the possibilities of the proposed method generally a cavitation tunnel test section see section 5 is composed of rigid structure in metal with interchangeable windows for an experimental configuration instrumented windows with different sensors are set up on the test section the position of sensors is then constrained by the windows locations the extreme case consists of locating all the sensors very close to each other this case is known to be not optimal especially for low frequency demodulation method is sensitive to phase error consequently another hydrophones configuration has been investigated with exactly the same acoustic parameters frequency noise etc according to the gth capabilities see paragraph 5 for more details the convergence of the demodulation process is presented in fig 8 the performance is globally the same as the first configuration except for the number of steps required to reach the same accuracy as it could be observed on fig 8 the method needs numerous steps around 4000 which has to be compared to the 500 steps in configuration 1 only the geometrical localization of sensors has been changed between these two cases which demonstrates that this parameter is important the magnitude convergence depicted in fig 9 shows the same behaviour for the convergence than the previous situation with the regular hydrophone locations the associated acoustic fields are represented in fig 10 the acoustic field obtained with the infinite impedance method is not close to the exact one in return the acoustic field estimated by the present method seems very close to the exact field simulated shown in fig 10 c even if the input data are corrupted with some additive noise the results obtained by the method converge close to the exact field that is worth to emphasize this result is important because it assesses the interest of the method to estimate both the complex magnitude of modes and the wall impedances from a general point of view main performances of the method remain constant between first and second configuration excepted for the number of steps required to obtain the same accuracy this could be due to the fact that the first step is carried out by the infinite impedance model which is more far away from the exact solution the convergence is slower for all the configurations this is due to the imposed relaxation coefficient which tries to limit the convergence but ensures a not diverging method differences observed at a given step during the process are smaller in the second configuration due to proximity of the sensors that imposes in return a little correction weighted with the relaxation coefficient which probably makes the method less efficient in convergence 4 4 gain and impedance the global behaviour of the method against noise is summarized in fig 11 each curve represents the gain of the method computed with eq 12 as a function of the noise magnitude added to the data set the gain is defined here by the difference between the infinite impedance result and the matched impedance one as evoked in section 4 1 several configurations are represented red diamonds are representing the curves for configuration using only the noise added to the magnitude i e no phase noise has been used blue circles curves represent the configuration with both added noise in magnitude and phase noise with an average of 10 amplitude error purple squares curves represent the configuration with an average of 60 amplitude error on phase hydrophones arrangement of configuration 1 is represented by bold line whereas configuration is plotted with dashed line the vertical bars that are rather small represent the standard deviation of the results obtained with 10 different data sets generated with the same noise features for convenience the abscissa of the second configuration have been slightly right shifted in order to not superimpose the points that is to say that the real noise magnitudes added were exactly 0 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 db as it could be expected all the curves are decreasing with increasing noise magnitude for the case with additional phase noise the gain is lower with higher noise which could be also expected an important point is to observe that the gain obtained decreases rapidly with noise from very high accuracy without noise the 100 db value is probably linked to the computer software floating point accuracy increasing noise in phase or in magnitude leads to decrease gain of the method combined noise produces the same behaviour for the method the global result in acoustic pressure is a good point but is not sufficient to appreciate the capabilities of the method indeed the acoustic pressure fields presented above are the main result but the method provides also an estimate of the acoustic impedance at walls fig 12 presents the results for these impedance estimates each colour corresponds to a given level of noise from cold colours 0 db to hot ones 1 5 db for the red fig 12 a presents the results for the first hydrophone configuration whereas fig 12 b is the results for the second configuration as expected high level of noise produces errors of impedance estimate without noise the method converges on exact values of impedance see the zoom in complex plane for each impedance with small noise the star represents the exact value of simulated data all the dark blue dots are superimposed with this exact value it could be observed even with small magnitude of noise the estimated impedance departs from the exact one with a not inconsiderable shift 0 2 db produces around 20 error on impedance first configuration obtains however better results in accuracy than second configuration 5 experimental set up a specific experiment has been performed in our cavitation tunnel in order to test the proposed demodulation method firstly we present our large cavitation tunnel and the experimental set up of the experiment 5 1 the large cavitation tunnel since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown in fig 13 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing for high visibility on the model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m 1 14 m 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m 1 35 m 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity is continuously variable v 0 20 m s 1 for the small test section and v 0 12 m s 1 for the large test section see lecoffre et al 1987 for more details on gth the pressure inside the tunnel is also adjustable in p 5 500 kpa for both test sections moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example the gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown in fig 14 the gth has been designed in order to offer the possibility to perform acoustic measurements inside the two test sections the perfect knowledge of acoustic behaviour of such test sections is primordial to increase measurement accuracy among all different details of such a measurement this communication deals with the propagation model that can be used in post processing techniques classically an acoustic measurement in gth is performed with two different kinds of hydrophone as presented in fig 15 streamline hydrophones can be used inside the flow as well as flush mounted hydrophones at a window streamline hydrophones present the advantage to escape the boundary layer attached to each window and then to be non disturbed by the pseudo noise of this boundary layer the flush mounted hydrophone can be used more easily and is not susceptible to generate cavitation for example to estimate the noise radiated by a propeller measurements are performed in the presence of a mean flow and with a complete scale model the development of an acoustic propagation model with flow is still today a challenging topic in particular conditions as exposed by a rectangular test section filled with water flow boucheron 2016 here modal theory is investigated without flow 5 2 experimental set up an experiment has been performed in the small test section of the gth the measurement apparatus is depicted in fig 16 the main measurement section is located at the fifth window from the right of fig 16 twenty six flush mounted hydrophones depicted by black circles have been positioned on the three faces of the test section the two side windows and the floor window these hydrophones are complemented with two streamline hydrophones close to the measurement area and 3 other hydrophones in sections of windows 1 4 and 7 due to this hydrophones arrangement only the first four modes on a dimension could be estimated modes of order 0 1 2 and 3 plane mode being 0 0 hydrophones are piezo electrical sensors with pre amplifier stages an amplifier provides a sine signal at 1 khz to an acoustic source located at different locations along the tunnel a synchronized acquisition system has been used to record all channels at a sampling frequency of 200 khz moreover two accelerometers have been used coupled with the hydrophones located at the first and fourth windows as noticed previously gth has the specificity to be able to switch from a test section to the other one closing doors that enable such possibility have been used here to investigate the acoustic response of the test section with and without these doors fig 17 shows the sketch of gth for the two configurations tested in configuration 1 the acoustic source is located upstream the test section in the elbow section of the tunnel in configuration 2 the test section is closed by the doors of gth it limits the acoustic domain tested for this configuration the acoustic source location is located at the entrance of the test section for each configuration the acoustic source radiates continuous sine signals via a dedicated amplifier data acquisition starts after a couple of seconds in order to be sure that the standing behaviour is established results of these measurements are presented in the following paragraph 6 results this section is dedicated to the results obtained by the demodulation method using the impedance estimate step the global algorithm 4 has been used for different configurations of measurements here nine different modes are estimated that is to say 9 different values of a m n and 9 values for b m n among these modes for the case with an infinite impedance at the walls 4 modes propagate and 5 are evanescent previous results have already been published in boucheron 2017 where an equivalent absorption coefficient of the end of the test section has been estimated acoustically the following paragraph presents the acoustic field results obtained from experimental data whereas paragraph 6 2 is dedicated to impedance results 6 1 demodulation fig 18 presents the acoustic field inside the test section for the configuration with the source in the elbow of the tunnel configuration 1 it could be observed that the infinite case fails to fit the measurements data the present algorithm improves the estimate and makes the measurements closer to the model the elbow where the source is located is situated at the left of the estimated acoustic field for negative x the presence of decaying modes at the entrance of the section could be the reason of such a modal division indeed if modes of high order are generated near the source they could propagate against the test section the section restriction between the source and the test section see fig 14 inhibits the propagation of higher modes and makes them evanescent or highly decaying this behaviour could be observed along the test section axis on fig 18 b the results for the same experimental parameters but with the source located inside the closed test section are given in fig 19 the differences between hydrophones measurements and model estimate are tiny in both cases although the resulting acoustic fields are totally different contrary to the former case no decaying mode is present in this configuration which is probably due to the absence of the converging part of the tunnel the fully different acoustic fields are revealing the sensitivity of acoustic demodulation to experimental errors as noticed in the previous section for the simulation the results obtained by each method with or without impedance estimate are really concerned by these errors the hydrophone configuration in experimental case is far to be optimal and makes the measurements errors due to accuracy of the material or and to signal processing estimate from data at the origin of most of the difficulties for converging nevertheless a gain eq 12 of around 5 db is observed for all configurations investigated 6 2 impedance estimate as noticed in the previous paragraph dedicated to simulations the impedance estimate with the proposed method is highly sensitive to errors from data however comparison between measurements from experimental data and estimate from the present method could be investigated as evoked previously two accelerometers have been used glued to hydrophones measuring acceleration and acoustic pressure at the same location should provide estimation for the impedance by the following equation expressed in fourier domain z ω j ω ft p ft γ with p the wall pressure provided by hydrophone γ the normal acceleration provided by accelerometer and ft the fourier transform this estimate is corrupted by several phenomena the acceleration integration seems not to be the main problem for high sampled data if the estimate is not done at high frequency more important is the response of each sensor the hydrophone being a piezo electric device it is not insensitive to acceleration that is to say that the acoustic pressure provided by such hydrophone is not pure acoustic pressure if the hydrophone is moving table 5 gives the results obtained for the different impedance estimates the two left columns give the results of measurements by the sensor couple hydrophone accelerometer the estimate has been made in fourier domain at the given frequency of the measurement differences between the y and z impedance could be explained by the tunnel configuration the roof wall is not equipped with windows which makes the effective impedance in this direction different from the y one the comparison between the results of configuration 1 is quite good contrary to those of configuration 2 the reactance estimate in the second configuration seems to be higher than in first one which is a problem to convergence for the demodulation all these values have to be compared to the material impedance of the different walls of the tunnel recalled at the end of table 5 the perspex windows have an acoustic impedance of around 2 whereas the rigid structure of the tunnel made in stainless has an acoustic impedance around 31 moreover the relative impedance between perspex and air is high and could also disturb the effective impedance inside the duct the test section being a sequence of perspex windows regularly spaced by steel stiffeners the effective impedance should be a particular value comprise into these two values the impedance estimated by the present method is expected to be directly comparable to this effective impedance this is not the case and the estimate obtained by the method is lower in first configuration and close to the perspex one in the second one in return the measured impedance is a local measurement it signifies that it is not the effective averaged impedance but the response of the window location of the hydrophone or more precisely the impedance of the hydrophone material close to the one of water that is 1 0 thereby it could be concluded that the estimated impedance by the proposed method seems to give a good order of magnitude of impedance even if the exact value cannot be estimated with great accuracy 7 conclusion in this paper a new demodulation processing technique in rectangular test section with complex magnitude and wall impedance estimated is addressed this method is based on modal acoustic theory in ducts with wall impedance the theory is briefly recalled and allows presenting the difficulties of the problem a new method for demodulation in this particular case is then proposed it is based on different algorithms solving successively the transcendental equations of dispersion and the two inverse problems for the estimation of the impedance and the complex magnitudes of modes simulated data have been generated to test the performances of the method with success it has been found that the method converges on exact values of both modal amplitudes and impedance to obtain this accuracy it has been necessary to help the method with particular attention to decaying modes and to regularly impose a noise step which compel the method to investigate others modal configurations this point has been found important for results obtained by the method the main drawback associated to this particular aspect of numerical method is the slowness of the process this slowness is also increased when the hydrophones arrangement is non optimal which can be encountered in real measurements moreover data corrupted with different kinds of noise to simulate accuracy of real hydrophones have been generated results obtained in this configuration show that the method is very sensitive to noise phase errors seem to be more critical than magnitude errors for the behaviour of the method the hydrophone arrangement has not been found influential on results except for the fastness of the method a regular arrangement makes the method more efficient finally the method presented in this paper has been applied to measurements in a cavitation tunnel results obtained by the method are satisfactory regarding the expected accuracy the comparison is tricky because particular aspects of measurements but the order of magnitude of results provided by the method is satisfactory it has to be noticed that such a method could be applied for frequencies up to several khz in our case the limitation is due to the number of modes that are to be taken into account this number is linked to the number of sensors available and their positions along the test section it requires roughly twice sensors than the number of modes investigated future works should be conducted to improve the proposed algorithm on accuracy especially to make the method less sensitive to noise other works should be done to take into account more numerous modes and also to improve the management of the decaying modes in particular when the source is close to the measurement area where are located the sensors the acoustic field could be affected by numerous decaying modes even for low frequencies as discussed by boucheron 2017 and hynninen et al 2017 in the vicinity of the source all the modes exist most of them are highly damped as long as you depart for the source location and could be neglected but you will have to manage much more modes than the cut off theory predicts in duct this aspect prevents the method from being used very close to a source without particular precautions other works could be dedicated for example to combine the demodulation method with the use of a denoising technique approach see amaill et al 2018 blacodon 2011 hald 2017 2019 dinsenmeyer et al 2019 for example to enhance the accuracy of the results or also to design an appropriated shape of an array to improve the

21805,the operational requirements for naval and research vessels have seen an increasing demand for quieter ships either to comply with the ship operational requirements or to minimize the influence of shipping noise on marine life the radiated noise of a ship is estimated during the design stage by measurements with a scale model generally realized in a tunnel or a depressurized tank dga hydrodynamics owns its cavitation tunnel with low background noise that allows such measurements nowadays a low background noise of the whole facility is not sufficient to perform an accurate acoustic measurement improving our knowledge about the acoustic response of the facility is then required to assess the relationship between the measurements and the noise radiated by a propeller for example the confined geometry of the test section imposes particular boundary conditions to the acoustic propagation and a reverberation like behaviour the acoustic response of the facility is then disturbed compared to a free field configuration this particular acoustic behaviour makes the absolute estimate of the underwater radiated noise power very difficult a possibility to overcome this problem could be the use of an appropriated model coupled with the modal propagation theory following this approach a method to estimate both modal magnitudes and wall impedance is proposed in this paper and confronted to experimental results keywords demodulation wall impedance cavitation tunnel 1 introduction numerous studies have been performed since many years with the aim to improve our understanding of underwater radiated noise induced by a propeller military reasons as well as impacts on marine fauna have motivated several institutes to study noise generation by vessels even if the help of computational fluid dynamics cfd is a way to predict the noise level emitted by a vessel see testa et al 2017 experimental approaches like measurements in cavitation tunnel with a scaled model is nowadays preferred because its reliability ittc 2017 other experimental facilities deal with the same goals in depressurized tank with others acoustical effects as reverberation and motion of the model inside the facility see for example lafeber et al 2015 the performance of such measurements to predict the underwater noise levels at full scale is strongly linked to our knowledge of the facility and our capability to take into account its acoustic response during the analysis from an acoustical point of view the useful section of a cavitation tunnel looks like a duct filled with water even if the acoustic propagation in duct is well known by acousticians this topic is still subject of research with the aim to develop more applicable models and or to take into account more details as a particular flow or specific geometries actually since several decades different experiments have been performed inside ducts in air with or without flow abom 1989 dalmont 2001 schultz et al 2006 boucheron 2017 with the aim to decompose the acoustic field into several modes that propagate several methods dedicated to the estimate of complex magnitude of propagative modes have been proposed and used with success in cases without flow and high acoustic levels the goal is generally to decompose the acoustic field and to estimate the absorption performance of a given liner recently such experiments have been performed with the presence of a mean flow in air in a wind tunnel suzuki and day 2015 another application of such approach is described by xin et al 2018 to estimate the impedance of a duct termination or also to combine vibrations of the duct with the acoustic propagation inside as done for example by pagneux and aurégan 1998 the problem in our configuration is slightly different the estimate of the acoustic noise level of an acoustic source in a cavitation tunnel is generally performed with the help of several hydrophones close to the source to be measured see section 3 further the proximity of sensors close to the source is needed to improve the signal to noise ratio and also regarding the reverberation of the facility as explained by briançon marjollet et al 2013 and tani et al 2015a this configuration is classically used with transfer functions to correct the results obtained for different experimental features as directivity of sensors reverberation or resonance inside the tunnel see for example boucheron 2019a high deviation of transfer functions could be observed experimentally when the location of the acoustic source is slightly shifted tani et al 2015b corrections made by the transfer function are then highly sensitive to the accuracy of measurements and location of the source the reason generally admitted by the community is that the near field imposed by the source is dependent on its location and on the decomposition of the field into propagative evanescent waves the closer to an anti node of a given mode the source the more important the complex magnitude of this mode boucheron 2017 hynninen et al 2017 in consequence we have to manage both modes that propagate and modes that decay in the vicinity of the source which generally leads the existing iterative methods to diverge due to their high sensitivity to discrepancies in parallel to theoretical studies acousticians are looking for measuring each mode magnitude expressed in complex plane that is including the phase information to describe the whole acoustic field in the duct several methods have been developed in particular cases like hard wall boundary conditions this could be done experimentally in rectangular case see schultz et al 2006 suzuki and day 2015 or circular cases abom 1989 dalmont 2001 as examples these techniques could be employed successfully to manage the radiation impedance of a given duct end stage or to measure absorption of a liner disposed inside the duct as performed by pagneux et al 1996 for example several numerical methods have also been developed to deduce the liner impedance of a duct with mean flow as done by jones et al 2005 the impedance of the duct walls in air applications are taken to be so large that the hypothesis of a very small admittance holds however in cavitation tunnel the infinite impedance hypothesis for the duct walls has to be called into question due to the relative impedance z mat z water between propagation medium water and wall material indeed denoting ϱ for density and c 0 for celerity in a medium the impedance ϱ c 0 ratio between water and stainless steel is about 30 which remains a high value but for perspex material used for cavitation tunnel windows the ratio is around 2 modifications due to the presence of this finite impedance at wall are important and need to be managed gingerly this key point in our configuration is taken into account in the proposed method and discussed during the analysis of the results obtained experimentally in our cavitation tunnel the inverse problem considered here consists of retrieving both modal magnitudes and impedance features the paper is structured in five sections the next one describes the modal acoustic theory whereas the third section presents the proposed demodulation method the fourth section is dedicated to the results obtained with simulation performed to characterize the main features of the demodulation algorithm and to assess its reliability conditions the last part presents the facility used to get experimental data finally results are presented and discussed after which the conclusions are given 2 modal propagation the acoustic field inside a duct could be described by the modal propagation theory presented in the next paragraph the application of modal theory to the finite impedance case is presented thereafter 2 1 modal propagation model in a perfect rectangular duct 1 1 this duct shape has been chosen because the shape of the two test sections of our cavitation tunnel the gth as described later all the theory could be adapted to the circular shape with the help of bessel functions which modify the modal shape functions ψ m n y z see morse and ingard 1968 for example the solution of helmholtz equation that describes the acoustic propagation could be expressed as a superposition of several modes according to morse and ingard 1968 bruneau 1998 and munjal 2014 the acoustic pressure p inside the duct could be expressed as 1 p x y z t m n ψ m n y z a m n e j k x m n x b m n e j k x m n x e j ω t ω being the angular frequency j 1 k ω c 0 is the wavenumber and c 0 is the celerity in the considered medium here k x m n is the axial wavenumber associated with the mode m n m respectively n is the mode number on y dimension respectively z dimension eq 1 shows that propagation is considered in both downstream and upstream directions the coefficients a m n respectively b m n are the complex magnitudes associated with the upstream respectively downstream direction of propagation if hard wall conditions are considered the wave equation leads to modal shapes ψ m n expressed by 2 ψ m n y z cos m π y l y cos n π z l z here l y and l z are the different lengths of the section for a square section l y l z introducing these equations in the general helmholtz equation we obtain the classical dispersion equation for rectangular duct 3 k x m n ω c 0 2 m π l y 2 n π l z 2 this axial wavenumber is important in propagation because its value reveals the ability of a mode to propagate for such a propagating mode k x m n has to be real for a given frequency this is only possible for a limiting number of modes increasing the mode order m or n makes k x m n decreasing and becoming imaginary the limiting value k x m n 0 determines the cut off frequency f m n c given by f m n c c 0 2 m l y 2 n l z 2 for a given mode m n only frequencies higher than f m n c can propagate other modes denoted by a wavenumber purely imaginary are called evanescent and no acoustic energy is propagating within this mode all these equations are available so long as hard wall conditions could be considered in other cases the modal shapes are different this adaptation is presented in the following 2 2 finite impedance model the model presented straight above should be adapted to the finite impedance conditions the global solution for the acoustic pressure inside the duct eq 1 is still available we consider then here a finite value of the impedance at the wall in order to compute the modal shape functions ψ m n z y z the modifications of the boundary conditions modify in return the acoustic propagation features the complex wall impedance z w links the acoustic pressure at wall with the normal acoustic velocity if we run the x axis of propagation along the central line of the duct the boundary condition for the wall on y direction the same equation holds for the z direction could be written as morse and ingard 1968 p y y l y 2 j k z w p y l y 2 in this case the modal shapes should not be expressed by eq 2 but by see morse and ingard 1968 4 ψ m n z y z cs m q m y l y cs n q n z l z where cs m q m x cos π q m x when m 0 2 4 sin π q m x when m 1 3 5 the boundary conditions are then used to compute the tangential propagation constant q m y by solving the transcendental eigen equations boucheron 2019a 5 π q m y 2 tan π q m y 2 j 2 k l y z w for m even π q m y 2 cot π q m y 2 j 2 k l y z w for m odd these equations do not admit analytical solution even if for very small admittance more precisely if the quantity k l z w 1 approximated solutions exist therefore numerical solutions of these equations are required in our case a newton raphson method has been employed here to solve these equations a paragraph is dedicated to this problem in section 3 5 the global values for the axial wavenumber could then be computed with the following dispersion equation 6 k x m n 2 ω c 0 2 π q m y l y 2 π q n z l z 2 this theory explained briefly here shows that the demodulation process is drastically more complex with finite impedance because the modal shape is impedance dependent we can compare basically the demodulation method to the mathematical process of the estimation of coordinates of given points in a 2d plane mathematically this process is simply achieved with a scalar projection the pressure measurements in the demodulation technique are the equivalent of the points and the modal shapes are the equivalent of the mathematical base used to define the 2d space in the case of an infinite value for the impedance assumed at the wall the base is fully defined the method consists of projecting the measurements onto the base in our case because the impedance is unknown the base has to be estimated simultaneously to the coordinates of the points that is why a direct method is not possible and an iterative process could be a way to overcome this problem moreover all quantities involved in the theory are complex this point is important because we have to deal with complex wavenumber for each mode indeed with hard wall conditions the dispersion equation eq 3 leads to pure real wavenumber for propagating modes or pure imaginary modes for evanescent modes if we are interested of acoustic propagation far away from acoustic sources evanescent modes could be neglected because they exist only in the near field of the source and are decreasing rapidly with distance with an exponential decay behaviour in the case of a finite impedance with real and imaginary part this is never the case because all wavenumbers are complex with real and imaginary part that is to say that all modes are decaying modes 2 2 with an imaginary part of the wavenumber non equals to zero only the decaying modes are physically realistic the growing modes are not physically a solution notice that on the other side of a source let say x 0 or x 0 the propagation constant are reversed a growing mode for x 0 becomes a decaying mode for x 0 because the sign in the exponential argument changes the demodulation method proposed in the next section tries to manage these aspects 3 demodulation method and impedance estimate the modal decomposition consists of finding the different magnitudes a m n and b m n of an experimental data set this method developed several decades ago is sensitive to experimental errors the problem is generally ill conditioned and could produce huge discrepancies for the results due to the experimental deviations one way to perform the inversion is to separate the problem in real and imaginary values as proposed by schultz et al 2006 this method has been explored recently in cavitation tunnel by boucheron 2017 and is extended here to the case of wall with finite impedance the principle consists of measuring the acoustic pressure p complex magnitudes with sensors at different locations in the duct for a given frequency the acoustic field could be decomposed using the global expression of eq 1 with the appropriated shape from eq 4 the method described here is based on an iterative process due to the impossibility to estimate both the modal shapes and the amplitudes as explained just above in order to initialize the process we perform a demodulation step with an infinite impedance see paragraph 3 1 for the description of this step we obtain complex magnitudes a m n and b m n then the iterative process starts the two important steps are described in section 3 2 for the impedance estimation step and section 3 3 for the complex magnitudes of each mode 3 1 step 1 complex magnitudes estimate for hard wall case this step is formally the same as the demodulation method proposed by schultz et al 2006 and used in boucheron 2017 for the cavitation tunnel case with n hydrophones this step can be modelled by the following equation p m x p 1 p 2 p n m 11 m 12 m 1 p m 21 m n 1 m n p x 1 x 2 x p the unknown vector x is composed of the different coefficients a m n and b m n the number of demodulated modes p is the number of all couple of numbers m n that correspond to the modes that are to be taken into account the rectangular matrix m is composed of modal shape coefficients ψ m n y z according to eq 2 applied to the location of each sensor used in the process these coefficients are complex and make the matrix m ill conditioned boucheron 2017 schultz et al 2006 one way to perform the inversion of matrix m is to separate the problem in real and imaginary values as proposed by schultz et al 2006 the problem is then re written as 7 p m x re p im p re m im m im m re m re x im x the inversion of the matrix m is then solved using a truncated singular value decomposition this technique is usually more robust to noise and gets the benefit to allow limiting the number of singular values used for the matrix inversion if necessary indeed the singular value decomposition of matrix m is expressed by m u σ v t where u and v are unitary orthogonal matrices and σ is the diagonal matrix of singular values sorted by magnitude finally the estimated solution for the inverse problem is obtained from 8 x v σ 1 u t p the three matrices v σ 1 and u t could be r rank limited if necessary see hansen 1998 the matrix σ is diagonal and its inverse σ 1 is also a diagonal matrix composed of inverse singular values the different complex magnitudes are then combined with the different terms of x this method employed on experimental case by boucheron 2017 gives acceptable results even if sometimes important discrepancies remain between the model and the measurements it appears that the limitation of the matrix rank does not improve the demodulation process but it only selects the more energetic modes the discrepancies observed between the model obtained by demodulation and the measurements could be explained mainly by an inappropriate model due to the impedance of wall but also due to the limited accuracy of the experimental measurements it is the reason to develop a method to take into account the wall impedance in the process the chart of this initializing step is summarized by the algorithm 1 3 2 step 2 complex impedance estimate this step is devoted to the estimate of the impedance of the wall according to the fact that we try to converge towards the solution we suppose that the initial step is close to the solution in this step we assume that complex magnitudes a m n and b m n are input the algorithm is based on newton raphson method adapted for non linear case for convenience the impedance z w is expressed in terms of admittance β w divided also in real part and imaginary part as β w 1 z w ξ w j σ w the unknown vector b of the algorithm is then composed of real part ξ and imaginary part σ of the admittance for each wall namely 9 b ξ y σ y ξ z σ z the relationship used in the iterative newton raphson process with relaxation coefficient denoted by λ fixed at 0 5 for all

the comparison between the measurements p and the optimized model m b k notice that the term m b k is used to comply with the mathematical definition of the newton raphson method in practice this term is evaluated simply by the eqs 1 4 5 and 6 the derivatives of the function used in the definition of the jacobian matrix are given in appendix the global chart of this algorithm could be summarized by the algorithm 2 3 3 step 3 demodulation method finite impedance case this last step assumes that the impedance estimate is correct then the principle is the same as the first step except that we have to deal with complex quantities decaying modes have to be managed cautiously because of diverging magnitude when we estimate the acoustic pressure close to the source due to the exponential behaviour of their magnitudes if a small difference far from the source is attributed to a decaying mode its magnitude will be considerably increased thus some relaxation parameters are introduced to converge slowly towards a solution and not diverging rapidly the global chart of this step is given in algorithm 3 the management of evanescent and decaying modes is the following for highly decayed modes and necessarily the evanescent ones if they exist the evaluation of mode is done only in the half space containing the decaying behaviour not the diverging behaviour that is to say that only the decaying shape of the mode is taken into account see the previous footnote moreover in the demodulation process the discrepancies between the model and the measurements are shared into different modes in order to converge on the solution small quantities could be allocated to evanescent modes or decaying modes due to the exponential behaviour of this decay magnitude a m n or b m n could be very high this aspect is avoided in the algorithm by forcing the amplitude of modes that are diverging to be zero in the half space of their exponential behaviour such rules are not restricting enough to ensure the amplitude not diverging in the particular case when the source is in the considered volume the amplitude of each decaying mode could be diverging due to discrepancies between the model at a given step and the measurements if the method tends to increase considerably the magnitude of a given mode let say ten times the maximum absolute value of pressure then this amplitude is set to zero 3 4 global chart of the method the whole method is then presented and discussed in this paragraph the global chart is described in the algorithm 4 the core of the method is a loop inside the while statement it consists of alternatively estimating the impedance with algorithm 2 and the complex magnitudes with the algorithm 3 in addition these magnitudes are slightly relaxed to prevent high jump in solution that could make the method diverging the relaxation coefficient λ 2 is fixed to 0 8 for all the tests investigated in this study after each process an evaluation of the discrepancies between the present model and measurements is made the average error and the standard deviation are computed and recorded as explained previously the decaying modes are managed with a brutal law forcing a mode to be zero if the pressure magnitude is too high such rule is required to manage decaying modes but is obviously not acceptable if the mode is present in order to be sure to consider most of the possibilities the algorithm is used with a chaotic principle regularly some discrepancies with the help of an added noise are imposed to modal amplitudes or to impedance values alternatively this process is used in order to compel the algorithm considering numerous combinations and to introduce some complex amplitude which could be not considered in previous steps see discussion in boucheron 2019a b two noise distributions have been used for disturbing a m n b m n or z w the normal distribution has been employed for the magnitude of the parameter and the uniform distribution for its phase the first steps of the method are particularly concerned by this behaviour because the initial step is provided by the demodulation assuming an infinite impedance at the walls then all the modes propagate and all the transverse acoustic wavenumber are real if no evanescent modes are considered in the problem thus the impedance step is then firstly used with perfect propagating modes only since the third step all quantities are complex and could converge to ensure convergence of such process relaxation parameters of both methods the one for impedance and the other one for modal magnitudes are introduced and have to be set cautiously consequently one of the drawback of such method is the need of numerous steps to be sure to converge against a solution 3 5 transcendental eigen equation solutions the specific step of solving one of the two transcendental eq 5 is here considered this latter is rewritten with new variable g defined by q m 2 j g and separating real part to imaginary part as g 1 2 ν m j 1 2 μ m which gives g tanh π g j h e j φ for m even g coth π g j h e j φ for m odd h e j φ β k l y 2 π the principle of the method is based on a newton raphson method with a relaxation coefficient indeed the solution of these equations in complex plane is easy because a lot of solutions exist but tricky if a particular mode is researched which is our case the initial value used as an input for the method is given by the infinite impedance solution to ensure the algorithm not converging on a solution with another number a small coefficient of relaxation is imposed for running the method λ 0 2 the fig 1 presents an example of the method process for both modes 0 and 1 for a given configuration the complex plane is represented with ν and μ reported on each axis contour plots representing h are plotted moreover background colour is coded with the phase value cold colours for negative phases and hot colours for positive phases contour lines are also represented with phase values every 10 the initial value infinite impedance case imposed to the method is located on the vertical axis the numerical method is stopped when an accuracy better than 10 15 is reached which is done in a maximum of dozen steps for all configuration tested in the present study fig 2 presents the convergence of the method for two computations on the same graph the line with circles respectively with squares represents the path used by the method for the z y z z respectively fixed at a different value from z y to exhibit the difference in behaviour between the initial step at left of each figure and the matched value the same case has been investigated with a relaxation coefficient of 0 7 at left and 0 2 at right as expected the method converges will a small number of steps for the higher relaxation coefficient the two solutions obtained for the z y case are the same conversely for the z z case the solutions are different due to a jump in the complex plane this jump is mainly due to the shape of the derivative functions and the large gap between each step that is to say that for a given order m of a mode the algorithm gives a solution of another mode another n because this step of the whole algorithm is dedicated to be run blindly that is without graphical check of convergence the relaxation coefficient has been adjusted to a lower value 0 2 for all the computations performed even if simulations with a coefficient of 0 5 has presented no jump in our tests 3 6 accuracy estimate a detail with great importance in the algorithm proposed is the estimate of the accuracy this estimate is performed at each step of the whole algorithm in order to detect the best fit between the model and the measurements one of the problems is here to give a germane variable depicting the accuracy of the model the difference between two complex magnitudes is a distance in complex plane as depicted by fig 3 let consider that the exact value is the point p m in fig 3 three different situations are considered for the estimated value namely p 1 p 2 and p 3 in the first case p 1 no phase shift is present but only a magnitude difference between the two points for the case p 3 the discrepancy between model and measurement is composed only by a shift in phase the case p 2 combines phase and magnitude differences basically the difference between all these points and the measured one could be estimated by the simple distance between each pair of points in the magnitude estimate process the difference between amplitude and phase difference must be differentiated the distance in case 1 could be expressed in pascal because it is real pressure in case 3 the magnitude in pressure is the same and there is no difference between the estimated and the measured one the distance is only due to a shift that is to say a delay between the two points physically if we refer to a hydrophone measurement it corresponds to an error in sensitivity for case 1 and in phase response for case 3 in order to be able to trade off this difference we define the accuracy of a model in complex plane by the criterion c defined with the two distance measurements p a and p a φ according to the following equations p a p m p i p a φ p m p i c m p a n p a φ m n the two integer coefficients m and n have to be chosen in order to focus on error in magnitude or in phase the variable c is a criterion evolving between two limits for a pure amplitude difference the value will be p a φ and for a pure phase difference the value will be p a φ n m n we can then realize a trade off of differences depending on hydrophone features in this study the couple m n 3 1 has been chosen 4 simulation the proposed method for acoustic demodulation with a simultaneous estimate of the wall impedances has been tested with simulated data the principle consists mainly of fixing complex magnitudes of several modes and impedance value with these values using the above equations the acoustic field could be computed inside the whole test section of the tunnel therefore choosing positions of sensors allows the computation of the complex magnitudes of the acoustic pressure these pressures are in return used by the method and results compared with the exact values results of the proposed algorithm applied to simulated data are presented in the following sections 4 1 demodulation different cases have been simulated to test the performances of the proposed method the configuration is the one the small test section of our cavitation tunnel with 31 sensors located at the wall along the test section of the tunnel the description is detailed further for an infinite impedance at the walls the first cut off frequency is estimated around 650 hz simulations have been performed at 1000 hz four different modes could propagate at this frequency in the case of a finite impedance at the walls all modes are decaying and numerous modes could appear table 1 presents the acoustic features of the first simulation and the results obtained by the algorithm for a case with high impedance and small reactance without noise that is considering those sensors are perfect the simulation has been conducted with 2000 steps fig 4 shows the convergence obtained by the algorithm for this first case it shows clearly that even if the results fit very well to the simulated data there are obtained after around 600 steps of the method it could be also observed that the different spikes on fig 4 denote the steps with added noise to amplitude or to impedance the accuracy obtained at the first step corresponds to the accuracy of the infinite impedance model fig 5 presents an evolution of the gain obtained at different steps during the process from the first point infinite impedance case to the optimal case each data from an individual sensor is represented in terms of difference between the exact value and the value estimated by the model in the complex plane this difference is expressed with magnitude and phase complex variables and presented in polar form to extend the scale a logarithm function is applied on magnitude with a reference chosen not to get negative values for the amplitude the first point is depicted by black triangles all others data are colour coded the cold colours represent the first steps and hot colours represent the last steps the red one being the optimal step found by the method ideally the last points depicted in red should be in the centre of the polar diagram the closer to centre the point the better accuracy of the complex magnitude estimate it could be observed that rapidly the method converges against the centre of the diagram the different points are spread over phase with approximatively the same accuracy for the same colour the difference in terms of amplitude between the triangles and the red points is the improvement of the method taking into account the finite impedance of the walls it could be summarized defining the gain factor by g g z g opt with 12 g z 20 log 10 δ p z and g o p t 20 log 10 δ p opt δ p z being the average of pressure differences at impedance z this gain is expressed in decibel and represents the improvement provided by the method obviously this gain is expected to be high for simulated data without noise and a hydrophone antenna adapted to the problem in this case it could be evaluated to 130 db moreover on fig 5 are represented the evolutions of five individual sensors with black lines only five to not overload the figure it could be observed that the first steps of the method reach rapidly a solution adjusting both magnitude and phase lines are crossing over the whole complex plane after this step the method is able to increase the gain by adjusting mainly the magnitude and maintaining the phase shift constant the lines are converging against zero along a radius during the last steps both amplitude and phase are adjusted this behaviour is linked to the fact that progressively the impedance phase is also adjusted by the method and close to the exact one associated to the convergence of the method the result in terms of acoustic field is represented in fig 6 three maps superimposed are represented each map represents the acoustic field at three walls as if the test section was flattened and seen from an upper view the upper wall is not represented for convenience the sensors are flush mounted and consequently at wall position they are represented by big circles the colour of the map and the circles is coded as a function of the real part of the acoustic pressure its scale is given by the colour bar at the right of the three figures the objective of the method is then to produce an acoustic field that fits with the data provided by sensor the map has to fit with circles each map is computed with the eq 1 with the complex magnitude of each mode provided by each method on the left of fig 6 are represented the results from the infinite impedance case in the middle the present method and at the right the exact acoustic field simulated it could be observed that even if the impedance is quite high the assumption of infinite impedance reach to discrepancies and the method is not able to converge on the solution this is due mainly to the fact that the wall impedance modify the axial wavenumber and also the shape of each mode which make the initial method failing to get great accuracy the solution proposed by our method fig 6 b succeeds to be very close to the exact values which is in accordance with the results given in table 1 4 2 sensitivity to noise to test the sensitivity of the method to noise several data sets have been created two kinds of noise have been generated with different amplitudes the first kind of noise n1 is a noise following a normal distribution with adjustable standard deviation n σ this noise could be added to sensor magnitude sensitivity of a real hydrophone is known generally with an accuracy of around 1 db this could generate in reality some discrepancies between the real acoustic field and the measured one moreover the response delay of each hydrophone could generate phase shift this could be simulated by imposing noise in phase to the simulated data it is represented by the second kind of noise n2 following a uniform distribution on a given phase range u d φ the acoustic features of the case simulated with noise are given in table 2 as an example fig 7 presents the acoustic fields obtained from the data sets corrupted with a noise of 0 5 db in magnitude the results in terms of modal magnitudes and impedance are given in table 3 it could be pointed out that the acoustic field estimated from the infinite impedance case is not so far from the exact case even if the impedance is lower than the case 1 the discrepancies visible on the acoustic field at left are erased on acoustic maps in the centre that makes the map estimated from the new technique comparable to the exact case the reconstructed field with the new method is very similar to the exact one however even if the global behaviour of the acoustic field estimated is great the results obtained by the method observed in detail reveal some errors the global magnitude and phase of the propagating modes presented in table 3 are globally well estimated by the method all these modes are propagating more precisely they are slightly decaying excepted the mode 1 1 which is highly decaying the imaginary part of the propagative constant is higher than the real part the different axial wavenumbers the exact values and the computed ones for the case 2 are represented in table 4 the presence of high decaying mode is probably one of the reasons of the difficulties for the method to converge on exact values see discussion in section 3 the estimated impedance values are close to the exact ones for the real part but the estimates of the imaginary part are inaccurate the propagating or slightly decaying modes are more stable than highly decaying modes consequently they are more easily estimated whereas the evanescent or highly decaying modes are more fickle and makes the convergence chaotic the error on wavenumber for this mode is higher than other discrepancies that make the estimate of modal magnitude very tricky 4 3 influence of hydrophone location arrangement in practice it is not always easy to dispose a hydrophone at a given location notably in cavitation tunnel for which structural considerations impose location constrains it is then important to consider a feasible hydrophone arrangement in order to appreciate the possibilities of the proposed method generally a cavitation tunnel test section see section 5 is composed of rigid structure in metal with interchangeable windows for an experimental configuration instrumented windows with different sensors are set up on the test section the position of sensors is then constrained by the windows locations the extreme case consists of locating all the sensors very close to each other this case is known to be not optimal especially for low frequency demodulation method is sensitive to phase error consequently another hydrophones configuration has been investigated with exactly the same acoustic parameters frequency noise etc according to the gth capabilities see paragraph 5 for more details the convergence of the demodulation process is presented in fig 8 the performance is globally the same as the first configuration except for the number of steps required to reach the same accuracy as it could be observed on fig 8 the method needs numerous steps around 4000 which has to be compared to the 500 steps in configuration 1 only the geometrical localization of sensors has been changed between these two cases which demonstrates that this parameter is important the magnitude convergence depicted in fig 9 shows the same behaviour for the convergence than the previous situation with the regular hydrophone locations the associated acoustic fields are represented in fig 10 the acoustic field obtained with the infinite impedance method is not close to the exact one in return the acoustic field estimated by the present method seems very close to the exact field simulated shown in fig 10 c even if the input data are corrupted with some additive noise the results obtained by the method converge close to the exact field that is worth to emphasize this result is important because it assesses the interest of the method to estimate both the complex magnitude of modes and the wall impedances from a general point of view main performances of the method remain constant between first and second configuration excepted for the number of steps required to obtain the same accuracy this could be due to the fact that the first step is carried out by the infinite impedance model which is more far away from the exact solution the convergence is slower for all the configurations this is due to the imposed relaxation coefficient which tries to limit the convergence but ensures a not diverging method differences observed at a given step during the process are smaller in the second configuration due to proximity of the sensors that imposes in return a little correction weighted with the relaxation coefficient which probably makes the method less efficient in convergence 4 4 gain and impedance the global behaviour of the method against noise is summarized in fig 11 each curve represents the gain of the method computed with eq 12 as a function of the noise magnitude added to the data set the gain is defined here by the difference between the infinite impedance result and the matched impedance one as evoked in section 4 1 several configurations are represented red diamonds are representing the curves for configuration using only the noise added to the magnitude i e no phase noise has been used blue circles curves represent the configuration with both added noise in magnitude and phase noise with an average of 10 amplitude error purple squares curves represent the configuration with an average of 60 amplitude error on phase hydrophones arrangement of configuration 1 is represented by bold line whereas configuration is plotted with dashed line the vertical bars that are rather small represent the standard deviation of the results obtained with 10 different data sets generated with the same noise features for convenience the abscissa of the second configuration have been slightly right shifted in order to not superimpose the points that is to say that the real noise magnitudes added were exactly 0 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 db as it could be expected all the curves are decreasing with increasing noise magnitude for the case with additional phase noise the gain is lower with higher noise which could be also expected an important point is to observe that the gain obtained decreases rapidly with noise from very high accuracy without noise the 100 db value is probably linked to the computer software floating point accuracy increasing noise in phase or in magnitude leads to decrease gain of the method combined noise produces the same behaviour for the method the global result in acoustic pressure is a good point but is not sufficient to appreciate the capabilities of the method indeed the acoustic pressure fields presented above are the main result but the method provides also an estimate of the acoustic impedance at walls fig 12 presents the results for these impedance estimates each colour corresponds to a given level of noise from cold colours 0 db to hot ones 1 5 db for the red fig 12 a presents the results for the first hydrophone configuration whereas fig 12 b is the results for the second configuration as expected high level of noise produces errors of impedance estimate without noise the method converges on exact values of impedance see the zoom in complex plane for each impedance with small noise the star represents the exact value of simulated data all the dark blue dots are superimposed with this exact value it could be observed even with small magnitude of noise the estimated impedance departs from the exact one with a not inconsiderable shift 0 2 db produces around 20 error on impedance first configuration obtains however better results in accuracy than second configuration 5 experimental set up a specific experiment has been performed in our cavitation tunnel in order to test the proposed demodulation method firstly we present our large cavitation tunnel and the experimental set up of the experiment 5 1 the large cavitation tunnel since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown in fig 13 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing for high visibility on the model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m 1 14 m 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m 1 35 m 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity is continuously variable v 0 20 m s 1 for the small test section and v 0 12 m s 1 for the large test section see lecoffre et al 1987 for more details on gth the pressure inside the tunnel is also adjustable in p 5 500 kpa for both test sections moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example the gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown in fig 14 the gth has been designed in order to offer the possibility to perform acoustic measurements inside the two test sections the perfect knowledge of acoustic behaviour of such test sections is primordial to increase measurement accuracy among all different details of such a measurement this communication deals with the propagation model that can be used in post processing techniques classically an acoustic measurement in gth is performed with two different kinds of hydrophone as presented in fig 15 streamline hydrophones can be used inside the flow as well as flush mounted hydrophones at a window streamline hydrophones present the advantage to escape the boundary layer attached to each window and then to be non disturbed by the pseudo noise of this boundary layer the flush mounted hydrophone can be used more easily and is not susceptible to generate cavitation for example to estimate the noise radiated by a propeller measurements are performed in the presence of a mean flow and with a complete scale model the development of an acoustic propagation model with flow is still today a challenging topic in particular conditions as exposed by a rectangular test section filled with water flow boucheron 2016 here modal theory is investigated without flow 5 2 experimental set up an experiment has been performed in the small test section of the gth the measurement apparatus is depicted in fig 16 the main measurement section is located at the fifth window from the right of fig 16 twenty six flush mounted hydrophones depicted by black circles have been positioned on the three faces of the test section the two side windows and the floor window these hydrophones are complemented with two streamline hydrophones close to the measurement area and 3 other hydrophones in sections of windows 1 4 and 7 due to this hydrophones arrangement only the first four modes on a dimension could be estimated modes of order 0 1 2 and 3 plane mode being 0 0 hydrophones are piezo electrical sensors with pre amplifier stages an amplifier provides a sine signal at 1 khz to an acoustic source located at different locations along the tunnel a synchronized acquisition system has been used to record all channels at a sampling frequency of 200 khz moreover two accelerometers have been used coupled with the hydrophones located at the first and fourth windows as noticed previously gth has the specificity to be able to switch from a test section to the other one closing doors that enable such possibility have been used here to investigate the acoustic response of the test section with and without these doors fig 17 shows the sketch of gth for the two configurations tested in configuration 1 the acoustic source is located upstream the test section in the elbow section of the tunnel in configuration 2 the test section is closed by the doors of gth it limits the acoustic domain tested for this configuration the acoustic source location is located at the entrance of the test section for each configuration the acoustic source radiates continuous sine signals via a dedicated amplifier data acquisition starts after a couple of seconds in order to be sure that the standing behaviour is established results of these measurements are presented in the following paragraph 6 results this section is dedicated to the results obtained by the demodulation method using the impedance estimate step the global algorithm 4 has been used for different configurations of measurements here nine different modes are estimated that is to say 9 different values of a m n and 9 values for b m n among these modes for the case with an infinite impedance at the walls 4 modes propagate and 5 are evanescent previous results have already been published in boucheron 2017 where an equivalent absorption coefficient of the end of the test section has been estimated acoustically the following paragraph presents the acoustic field results obtained from experimental data whereas paragraph 6 2 is dedicated to impedance results 6 1 demodulation fig 18 presents the acoustic field inside the test section for the configuration with the source in the elbow of the tunnel configuration 1 it could be observed that the infinite case fails to fit the measurements data the present algorithm improves the estimate and makes the measurements closer to the model the elbow where the source is located is situated at the left of the estimated acoustic field for negative x the presence of decaying modes at the entrance of the section could be the reason of such a modal division indeed if modes of high order are generated near the source they could propagate against the test section the section restriction between the source and the test section see fig 14 inhibits the propagation of higher modes and makes them evanescent or highly decaying this behaviour could be observed along the test section axis on fig 18 b the results for the same experimental parameters but with the source located inside the closed test section are given in fig 19 the differences between hydrophones measurements and model estimate are tiny in both cases although the resulting acoustic fields are totally different contrary to the former case no decaying mode is present in this configuration which is probably due to the absence of the converging part of the tunnel the fully different acoustic fields are revealing the sensitivity of acoustic demodulation to experimental errors as noticed in the previous section for the simulation the results obtained by each method with or without impedance estimate are really concerned by these errors the hydrophone configuration in experimental case is far to be optimal and makes the measurements errors due to accuracy of the material or and to signal processing estimate from data at the origin of most of the difficulties for converging nevertheless a gain eq 12 of around 5 db is observed for all configurations investigated 6 2 impedance estimate as noticed in the previous paragraph dedicated to simulations the impedance estimate with the proposed method is highly sensitive to errors from data however comparison between measurements from experimental data and estimate from the present method could be investigated as evoked previously two accelerometers have been used glued to hydrophones measuring acceleration and acoustic pressure at the same location should provide estimation for the impedance by the following equation expressed in fourier domain z ω j ω ft p ft γ with p the wall pressure provided by hydrophone γ the normal acceleration provided by accelerometer and ft the fourier transform this estimate is corrupted by several phenomena the acceleration integration seems not to be the main problem for high sampled data if the estimate is not done at high frequency more important is the response of each sensor the hydrophone being a piezo electric device it is not insensitive to acceleration that is to say that the acoustic pressure provided by such hydrophone is not pure acoustic pressure if the hydrophone is moving table 5 gives the results obtained for the different impedance estimates the two left columns give the results of measurements by the sensor couple hydrophone accelerometer the estimate has been made in fourier domain at the given frequency of the measurement differences between the y and z impedance could be explained by the tunnel configuration the roof wall is not equipped with windows which makes the effective impedance in this direction different from the y one the comparison between the results of configuration 1 is quite good contrary to those of configuration 2 the reactance estimate in the second configuration seems to be higher than in first one which is a problem to convergence for the demodulation all these values have to be compared to the material impedance of the different walls of the tunnel recalled at the end of table 5 the perspex windows have an acoustic impedance of around 2 whereas the rigid structure of the tunnel made in stainless has an acoustic impedance around 31 moreover the relative impedance between perspex and air is high and could also disturb the effective impedance inside the duct the test section being a sequence of perspex windows regularly spaced by steel stiffeners the effective impedance should be a particular value comprise into these two values the impedance estimated by the present method is expected to be directly comparable to this effective impedance this is not the case and the estimate obtained by the method is lower in first configuration and close to the perspex one in the second one in return the measured impedance is a local measurement it signifies that it is not the effective averaged impedance but the response of the window location of the hydrophone or more precisely the impedance of the hydrophone material close to the one of water that is 1 0 thereby it could be concluded that the estimated impedance by the proposed method seems to give a good order of magnitude of impedance even if the exact value cannot be estimated with great accuracy 7 conclusion in this paper a new demodulation processing technique in rectangular test section with complex magnitude and wall impedance estimated is addressed this method is based on modal acoustic theory in ducts with wall impedance the theory is briefly recalled and allows presenting the difficulties of the problem a new method for demodulation in this particular case is then proposed it is based on different algorithms solving successively the transcendental equations of dispersion and the two inverse problems for the estimation of the impedance and the complex magnitudes of modes simulated data have been generated to test the performances of the method with success it has been found that the method converges on exact values of both modal amplitudes and impedance to obtain this accuracy it has been necessary to help the method with particular attention to decaying modes and to regularly impose a noise step which compel the method to investigate others modal configurations this point has been found important for results obtained by the method the main drawback associated to this particular aspect of numerical method is the slowness of the process this slowness is also increased when the hydrophones arrangement is non optimal which can be encountered in real measurements moreover data corrupted with different kinds of noise to simulate accuracy of real hydrophones have been generated results obtained in this configuration show that the method is very sensitive to noise phase errors seem to be more critical than magnitude errors for the behaviour of the method the hydrophone arrangement has not been found influential on results except for the fastness of the method a regular arrangement makes the method more efficient finally the method presented in this paper has been applied to measurements in a cavitation tunnel results obtained by the method are satisfactory regarding the expected accuracy the comparison is tricky because particular aspects of measurements but the order of magnitude of results provided by the method is satisfactory it has to be noticed that such a method could be applied for frequencies up to several khz in our case the limitation is due to the number of modes that are to be taken into account this number is linked to the number of sensors available and their positions along the test section it requires roughly twice sensors than the number of modes investigated future works should be conducted to improve the proposed algorithm on accuracy especially to make the method less sensitive to noise other works should be done to take into account more numerous modes and also to improve the management of the decaying modes in particular when the source is close to the measurement area where are located the sensors the acoustic field could be affected by numerous decaying modes even for low frequencies as discussed by boucheron 2017 and hynninen et al 2017 in the vicinity of the source all the modes exist most of them are highly damped as long as you depart for the source location and could be neglected but you will have to manage much more modes than the cut off theory predicts in duct this aspect prevents the method from being used very close to a source without particular precautions other works could be dedicated for example to combine the demodulation method with the use of a denoising technique approach see amaill et al 2018 blacodon 2011 hald 2017 2019 dinsenmeyer et al 2019 for example to enhance the accuracy of the results or also to design an appropriated shape of an array to improve the

21806,slamming load is one of fundamental importance in the design of ship structures however the prediction of ship slamming load largely focuses on the head sea due to the more complex physics mechanism in oblique waves in this paper asymmetrical slamming loads of ship in oblique waves had been numerically predicted where one hybrid two step solution was applied through combining seakeeping theory and cfd method firstly asymmetrical ship motions vertical horizontal and roll motions were obtained through the seakeeping analysis then slamming loads of two typical bow flare sections were predicted through applying the cfd method where the complicated flow forms flow separation and air pocket were included the characteristics of impact hydrodynamics including free surface pressure distribution and pressure time history were analyzed systematically showing that the slamming load in oblique wave has obvious asymmetry and is much larger than the head sea these findings clarify the complicated impact phenomenon in oblique wave cases which could improve our understanding on the asymmetrical impact of bow flare sections keywords slamming loads cfd method seakeeping theory asymmetrical impact oblique waves 1 introduction ship slamming is quite common due to the interaction between wave and ship motion this slamming can cause ship vibration speed reduction and even damage the ship structure directly in serious cases ship slamming is an important concern of ship structural design wang and guedes soares 2017 however prediction of slamming loads is a very challenging subject partly due to the highly random marine environment and partly due to the strongly nonlinear free surface and physical surface conditions during impact in order to simplify the ship slamming problem a practical method is to introduce the strip theory and study the simple two dimensional water entry problem a lot of researches on the water entry problem of two dimensional rigid hull sections have been carried out most early researches are based on single phase flow model such as wagner s theory wagner 1932 modified logvinovich model mlm korobkin 2004 qin et al 2011 similarity solution dobrovol skaya 1969 wu and sun 2014 and boundary element method bem zhao and faltinsen 1993 sun 2007 sun and wu 2013 these methods focus on simplified shapes wedges or ship like section but the impact hydrodynamic characteristics of ship bow are different to these simplified shapes as an example for the water entry of a bow flare section the bulbous bow can result in the flow separation when it first enters into water then the separated fluid will hit flare area and thus cause the secondary impact in this process flow separation and air pocket phenomena will happen xie et al 2020a complicated flow forms and air effect are quite prominent for this case and how to simulate these phenomena reasonably will directly influence the accuracy of slamming loads in recent years some computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been applied to predict the slamming loads stenius et al 2006 used lsdyna software to study the problem of wedge section entering into water and discussed the influence of parameters such as grid density and contact stiffness on the calculation results yang et al 2007 simulated the water entry problem of wedges based on fluent and the application of dynamic mesh technology and 6 dof motion 6 dof solver reduced the numerical oscillations the agreement with the result of free falling experiment shows its applicability for the asymmetric cases xie et al 2018b combined the dynamic technology and finite volume method fvm to study the water entry problems of full scale bow flare section the water air phase flow was solved by vof method and the free surface was tracked using predictive lossless image compression plic scheme hu et al 2018 studied the water entry problem of asymmetric wedge by using a constrained interpolation profile cip method to solve the navier stokes n s equations a cartesian grid was used and the free surface was captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw and the body motion was calculated by an immersed boundary method some other similar work can be found in wang and guedes soares 2014 wei et al 2015 and xie et al 2018c 2020b compared to the water entry impact ship slamming is required to consider the wave body interaction which makes this problem more difficult considering the computational time the hybrid two step method is usually adopted this method mainly uses the seakeeping theory to calculate the relative motion of the ship and wave and then applies the impact theory to predict the slamming loads for example hermundstad and moan 2005 used the nonlinear strip theory to obtain the water entry velocity and then adopted a two dimensional boundary element method introduced by zhao and faltinsen 1993 to calculate the slamming pressure xie et al 2018d predicted the relative motion under the wave through seakeeping theory and applied cfd method to calculate slamming pressure other similar works are ochi and motter 1973 schellin and moctar 2006 soares et al 2007 chen et al 2014 and xie et al 2019 although the water entry impact theory and seakeeping theory have greatly developed most of them focus on the head sea cases where the water entry impact is symmetrical however slamming in oblique waves is more common due to the changing course and complicated marine environment for the actual ship slamming the wave and ship motions can greatly influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads kim et al 2019 therefore the purpose of this paper is to put forward a reasonable approach to predict the asymmetrical ship slamming loads in oblique waves since the slamming time is very short the influence of impact force on the overall ship motions is minor lloyd 1989 therefore slamming loads and ship motions can be calculated independently this paper used a hybrid two step method to predict the asymmetrical slamming loads of ship bow in oblique waves in the calculation the time history of impact velocity was firstly obtained by the seakeeping theory where the wave effect and asymmetrical ship motions were taken into account and then slamming loads were predicted through the cfd method where the complicated flow forms flow separation and air pocket were included the rest of paper is organized as following in section 2 a hybrid two step method for predicting asymmetrical ship slamming loads is presented in section 3 numerical verifications on the prediction of ship motion and asymmetrical impact are carried out in section 4 the characteristics related to impact hydrodynamics are presented and the effect of wave direction on the pressure peak is further discussed section 5 draws some important conclusions and outlines further work 2 hybrid two step methods in this paper there are two main concerns determination of impact velocity and prediction of slamming loads a hybrid two step method is adopted which is shown in fig 1 firstly the relative motion of the ship and wave is calculated by the seakeeping theory and then the slamming load is predicted based on the cfd method where the relative motions are treated as the input data of body motion during impact in this hybrid two step method the body motions during impact can be calculated quickly and complicated fluid forms including flow separation and air pocket during asymmetrical impact can be modeled through the cfd method which synthesizes the computational effort and accuracy for predicting the ship slamming load 2 1 seakeeping analysis for body motions during impact the six freedom motions of ship have been widely studied based on the three dimensional potential flow theory such as linear frequency domain method xie et al 2020c wang 2004 and nonlinear time domain method kim and kim 2017 jiao et al 2019 the nonlinear time domain method is an advanced approach quickly developed in recent years however the code is not fully open source in contrast the linear frequency domain method is comparatively mature and has been integrated some commercial codes such as wasim code in addition the calculation of six freedom motions of the ship is not key point in this paper therefore a simple frequency method recalled here is recalled here to enlarge its application for designers in the linear three dimensional frequency domain method the global velocity potential for the ship is usually decomposed into two parts the velocity potential of the steady flow u 0 x φ s x y z and that of unsteady flow φ t x y z e i ω t the velocity potential of unsteady flow φ t is further decomposed into four parts φ 0 for the incident wave potential φ j j 1 2 6 for the radiated waves and φ 7 for the diffracted waves as 1 φ t x y z φ 0 x y z j 1 6 φ j x y z φ 7 x y z these velocity potential stratifies the following control equation and boundaries conditions as 2 d 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 7 b φ j n z h 0 j 1 2 7 on bottom s b f i w u 0 x 2 g z φ j z 0 0 j 1 2 7 on free surface s f s n φ 0 φ 7 0 φ j n n j u 0 i w m j j 1 2 6 on body surface s s r lim r φ j 0 j 1 2 7 on truncated boundary s r where n is the unit normal vector on the plane u 0 is the ship speed three dimensional panel method using the rankine source is usually applied to solve the velocity potential φ j such as the wasim code the six degree ship motions can be predicted once the velocity potential is obtained see newman 1977 then the body motion used in the cfd simulation comes from the actual relative motion of ship and wave for the relative motions the seakeeping theory has been widely used such as hermundstad and moan 2005 and veen and gourlay 2012 for the arbitrary point x y z of the ship the horizontal velocity y v and vertical velocity z v are written as 3 y v d η 2 d t x x b d η 6 d t u ω sin θ 4 z v d η 3 d t x x b d η 5 d t w ω u 0 η 5 where x b y b z b represents the coordinate of ship gravity center η t is the six degree of freedom motion of ship u ω and w ω denote the vertical and horizontal velocity respectively it should be noted that the relative motion caused by roll motion is not included here because the roll motion will be treated as an individual motion in the cfd simulation 2 2 cfd method for water entry impact in the present work water entry of a two dimensional bow flare section with specified motions is simulated based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd method ignore the viscidity the continuity equation and momentum equation can be written as 5 ρ u 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u t p ρ g where u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure field ρ is the density of fluid g is the gravity acceleration the vof method is implemented to track the free surface through introducing the volume fraction of fluid the basic phase is air which means the air effect can be included in the prediction of slamming loads the phase equation is written as 7 ρ α t ρ α u 0 where α is the volume fraction of air the effect of the air pocket in the actual process is quite important for bow flare section as stated by xie and liu 2020 the compressibility of the fluid is modified by the karman tsien formula as 8 ρ w ρ w 1 δ p ρ w m w 2 9 ρ a ρ a 1 δ p ρ a m a 2 where ρ w and ρ a is the initial density of water generally as 1025 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 ρ w and ρ a is the density of water and air after considering the compressibility δ p is the pressure difference between flow field pressure and standard atmospheric pressure m a and m w is the propagation speed of sound in water and air respectively generally as 340 m s and 1500 m s the correction of compressibility can be achieved by redefining the density of water and air through user s define functions udf in fluent and the density and dynamic viscosity should be updated as 10 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w where μ w and μ a are the viscosity of water and air when the roll angle is large there is a strong impact between the bow flare section surface and the free surface the air effect becomes important for the cases with a large roll angle for two phase flow the discontinuity of pressure on the interface of air and water can cause the divergence of numerical simulation aiming at obvious air effect a continuum surface force csf model presented in brackbill et al 1992 is adopted to keep the discontinuity of pressure which expresses the interfacial pressure as a continuous function the function can be written as 11 p t p b α 0 p a c α n 0 α 1 p a α 1 where c is surface tension coefficient then the pressure in the whole area can be corrected as 12 p p c κ α where κ is interface curvature defined as κ n momentum equation eq 6 can be rewritten by combining the eq 12 as 13 ρ u t ρ u u t p c κ α ρ g it can be seen that there has an addition source item c κ α in eq 13 than the original moment equation eq 6 eqs 5 7 and 13 constitute the continuity equation phase equation and momentum equation of the improved vof method this source item is added through user s definition source uds the water entry problem of a rigid body can be regarded as such a flow where the shape of the fluid domain is changing with time and the changing boundary is the outline of the body dynamic mesh approach is applied to solve the large deformation when the body moves forced motions presented by eqs 3 4 are utilized in the simulation according to the relative motion of ship and wave the update of the volume mesh is handled automatically by fluent at each time step through re meshing technology according to the new positions of the moving boundaries two kinds of mesh morphing methods including spring based smoothing and local re meshing method are adopted in the present work to improve the mesh quality when the boundary of the fluid domain the outline of the body is changed a finite volume method is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations details of numerical procedure have been reported in our pervious study of xie et al 2018b 3 numerical verifications 3 1 asymmetrical slamming of ship like section in the study of yang et al 2007 the accuracy of cfd method has been verified by the experiments but the comparison results are limited to the case of wedges the actual hull has more complex profiles which cause the flow during impact to be different from the wedge case for this reason we select the free falling experiments of ship like section to further verify the cfd method where experimental results come from aarsnes 1996 the ship like section used in the experiment is shown in fig 2 a two pressure locations were used to compare the results defined as p1 and p2 and fig 2 b shows the details of position three different mesh sizes were used and the parameters of mesh were listed in table 1 in the simulation the angle of inclination is 14 7 and the drop height is 0 02 m fig 3 shows the comparison of the predicted results and other numerical results where the boundary element method bem from sun and faltinsen 2009 and the arbitrary lagrange euler method ale from wang and guedes soares 2013 in fig 3 a we can see the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost coincident and they are close to the experimental ones however in the experimental result there is a periodic oscillation at t 0 1s which is confirmed to come from the vibration of the falling device during the falling process see sun 2007 in addition it should be noted that there are two obvious force peaks according to the bow flare section penetration the force firstly increases due to the bow flare section penetration until the right side is fully immersed by water t 0 132s the slamming load begins to decrease when the water separates from the chine and thus appears the first peak after that the body still moves down which increases the hydrostatic pressure and the left side of body begins to touch water which increases the slamming pressure on this side such a situation causes the force increases again when the grid size is small enough the numerical results will converge to the experimental results in order to reduce the computation time mesh 2 will be applied to the numerical study in this paper for the comparative results of local pressure p1 and p2 the results of bem are 15 larger than the experimental ones the air effect is ignored in bem which is the reason causing large error with small deadrise angle about 15 3 results of ale and cfd are similar and they are close to experimental ones about 5 errors it is noted that pressure oscillation of from ale method is more obvious than that in cfd method in ale method the water maybe across the body surface so called leakage phenomenon this phenomenon can cause the numerical oscillations 3 2 analysis of body motions and slamming load in wave since the relative motion of ship sections as the input data in the water entry progress its accuracy can influence the prediction of slamming loads therefore body motions obtained by seakeeping theory should be validated in this paper the ro ro vessel is chosen as the calculated model and the experimental data has been published by hermundstad and moan 2005 where the model tests of a ro ro vessel in regular head bow and bow quartering wave of various heights were carried out the experiments were conducted on a self propelled 1 21 6 scale model of a 120 m car carrier in 45 oblique sea with height 5 m and period 9s slamming loads on two panels in the upper part of the bow flare section were measured fig 4 shows the time series of measured and calculated results in regular oblique wave for the heave motion fig 4 a the positive amplitude peak value are almost same error less than 5 while the negative values valley value in the calculation are larger than the experimental ones with an average of 13 for the pitch motion fig 4 b the valley values are almost same error less than 5 while the measured peak values are 15 larger than the calculated results the nonlinear slamming force appeared in the experiments while it is not included in this presented study this difference causes about 10 error on the predicting the ship motions for the relative motion at the bow fig 4 c the valley values are almost same with an error of 3 4 while the peak value obtained by the present method is larger than the measured value with an average of 18 7 the positive part denotes the ship moving upwards while the negative part represents the ship moving downward for the hull slamming it usually happens at the stage of the ship moving downward relative motion is less than zero so only negative part of relative motion is important in the present study fortunately the error between them is small about 5 although the slamming force can prevent the ship move downward the influence of slamming force becomes obvious at the time instant of relative motion from negative becoming positive where the vertical velocity reaches up to maximum at this moment slamming progress has ended which means the nonlinear slamming force has small influence on the prediction of slamming loads even though the ship motion has about 10 errors for the actual ship slamming in waves the wave and 3d effect can influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads therefore it is necessary to verify these differences in order to accurately describe slamming pressure in waves fig 5 shows the comparative results between predicted and measured slamming pressure at the two pressure gauges p1 and p2 the pressure peak obtained by cfd method is larger than the experimental data with the approximate errors of 22 8 for p1 and 32 for p2 on the one hand the wave has horizontal propagation velocity which can cause horizontal slamming pressure so call slapping on the other hand the ship bow is a three dimensional model which has obvious 3d effects according to the discussion on the 3d effects of bow flare model in our pervious study of xie et al 2018a the 3d flow can reduce average 25 slamming pressure 4 results and discussions this paper takes a 21kteu ultra large container ship as an example to discuss the characteristic of the bow flare slamming load in different wave conditions the primary parameter in full load condition is listed in table 2 two typical bow flare profiles were selected whose relative position referring to the whole ship is shown in fig 6 for each profile four typical monitoring points are selected on each side to show the pressure time history whose locations are shown in fig 7 4 1 characteristic of body motions in this study the influence of wave direction on slamming load is the key factor the wave amplitude is uniformed as 5 m with the wave frequency 0 4 rad s fig 8 shows the time history of relative motions at sec 2 it can be seen that the relative motions show obvious periodicity because the ship motions are solved based on the linear frequency domain method in general ship slamming occurs when the relative displacement between ship and wave is less than or equal to zero touching water condition and the vertical velocity is less than zero water entry condition faltinsen et al 2004 in order to save computational effort for predicting the slamming loads the body motions within one period were used in the water entry simulation fig 9 shows the body motion time history during impact in different oblique waves it can be seen that there have additional horizontal velocity and roll motion in oblique waves while there is none in the head sea θ 0 in addition the horizontal velocity and roll motion increase but the vertical velocity decreases with θ the bow flare section tends to much flatter when the roll angle becomes larger which bears larger slamming loads on the upwind side zhao and faltinsen 1993 it implies that the increment of roll angle may cause greater slamming loads even though the vertical velocity is small in some oblique wave conditions 4 2 impact hydrodynamic characteristics once the body motions are obtained the slamming loads can be predicted through simulating the water entry of bow flare section with forced motions vertical velocity horizontal velocity and roll motion the size of the fluid domain in the present paper is set as 700 m 620 m the domain grid is obtained through the mesh processor icem cfd where the mesh size on the body can be set as 0 4 m and the maximum mesh size is 4 m according to the mesh convergence study in section 3 1 the grid type is the unstructured grid and detail of mesh is illustrated in fig 10 in order to reduce the pressure oscillation the average pressure of three grids nearby each point is regarded as the final pressure time history in the simulation body motions during the water entry process are assigned by the relative motions as shown in fig 9 the time step is 0 005s with a total time 5s and cpu time for each case is approximately 4h15min 4 2 1 analysis of free surface evolution a major characteristic of asymmetrical impact is that it has more complicated free surface form than the symmetrical case fig 11 illustrates the free surface evolution of sec 2 during water entry in 30 oblique wave it can be observed that the body is rotating anticlockwise with time according to the body motions showed in fig 9 c the roll motion is always positive before 4 7s which means the heel angle always increases at this time quantum this asymmetry on the two sides causes the different flow characteristics showing the pileup on the left side upwind side moves faster than the right side on the left side the flow separation occurs at t 1 7s and then the separated flow re hits the body at t 2 1s such the situation can cause secondary impact and air pocket phenomena which affects the pressure distribution along the body surface xie et al 2020a fig 12 illustrates the free surface elevation at θ 60 more obvious asymmetrical free surface characteristics can be observed one important characteristic is that the free surface nearby the body right side is below the initial water surface i e fig 12 e which means there does not appear pileup characteristic it is quite different from the normal water entry impact phenomenon where the pileup is the primary flow characteristic during impact this is because the body has roll motion which makes the body rotates anticlockwise this motion extrudes left fluid quickly rising and separates the right fluid and thus causing a black region between rigid side and body surface in addition the horizontal velocity y v 0 makes the body move to the left side which further increases this separation the right water will flow into this black region due to gravity effect which makes the lower free surface characteristic in order to further make sure the deformation of free surfaces predicting correctly at numerical approach we define a coefficient of dispatched volume ψ which is the volume ratio of pileup and immersed body see fig 13 as 14 ψ r 1 r 2 r 0 where r i represents the pileup water volume and r 0 is the volume of the immersed body according to the free surface evolution showed in fig 11 water entry process can be divided into five stages stage i water immerses the body fig 11 a stage ii water is separated from the bulbous bow fig 11 b stage iii separated fluid re hits body fig 11 c stage iv water immerses the low deadrise angle side fig 11 d stage v water immerses high deadrise angle side fig 11 e we will discuss the characteristic of ψ in these five stages fig 14 shows the time history of ψ for sec 2 in different oblique waves it can be seen that the value of ψ fluctuates around one before stage iv in theory pileup volume should be equal to that of the immersed body before the water separates from the chine of the body stage iv as ψ 1 it reflects that the free surface form presented by the numerical simulation basically conforms to the physical reality during impact in 30 oblique case fig 14 a at stage i t 0 9s the volume of pileup is larger than the volume of immersed body that maybe some air is wrapped at the initial time instant of body touching water xu et al 2010 in stage ii 0 9s t 1 5s the fluid is separated from the body which causes the volume of water pushed by the body is greater than the pileup when the separated fluid re hits the body surface stage iii 0 15s t 2 1s air pocket is formed resulting in an increment of ψ after that stage iv 2 1s t 2 7s the ψ gradually decreases and approaches to 1 as the bubble surrounding body gradually escapes in stage iv 2 7s t 3 2s the separated fluid exists an upward velocity that increases the ψ when the right side is fully immersed by water stage v t 3 2s the displacement volume of the body remains the same but the pileup still moves upwards causing a more increment of ψ in 60 oblique case fig 14 b this change law of ψ is similar to that in fig 14 a but the rate of increase of ψ is significantly lower than that in fig 14 a after the fluid has completely submerged the body t 4 2s as can be seen from the free surface showed in fig 12 when the transverse inclination angle is larger the pileup on the right side is not obvious and the free surface near the body is even lower than the undisturbed still water surface this indicates that the displacement of the fluid by the body is not obvious on the right side resulting in a slower upward movement of the fluid 4 2 2 characteristic of pressure distribution fig 15 and fig 16 show the pressure distribution along these two sections at different time instants where the negative value of the axis represents the left z directional height of ship section while the positive value is the right z directional height the pressure on both sides presents symmetry in the head sea condition fig 15 the pressure distribution is greatly related to the free surface which further makes sure the credibility of free surface evolution in oblique wave conditions fig 15 b d the pressure on the left side is greater than that on the right side it is mainly due to the roll and horizontal motions of the section this asymmetry of pressure distribution is the typical characteristics in asymmetrical slamming which have been found in many literatures such as krastev et al 2018 and russo et al 2018b for the ships asymmetry of pressure distribution leads to a huge torque and horizontal force in the ship bow which greatly affects the structural strength especially for larger open container ships in addition the difference of pressure on the two sides increases with θ for example the error ratio of pressure peak on the two sides is 1 25 in θ 30 case while it increases to 7 05 in θ 60 for the case of sec 2 fig 16 there appears smaller pressure at 10 m z 0 m this is because there is an obvious concave surface between the bulbous bow and flare area which reduces the impact force of body extruding water compared to the case of sec 1 there shows more obvious asymmetry and even appears negative pressure on the right side for example in fig 15 d it can be clearly seen that the pressure on the right side is almost zero which means the effect of body extruding water is quite small for larger roll angles causes by wave direction increment the angle between the flare surface and the undisturbed water surface is smaller the pressure distribution on the left side windward side shows a higher and sharper peak in addition the pressure is much larger due to the larger roll motion which means that the water impact on the flare surface is stronger as the wave direction increases meanwhile the contribution from the right side leeward side becomes less with increasing roll angle it should be noted that the obvious negative pressure less than atmospheric pressure appears at the keel and chine of section when the wave direction increases θ 30 as the section is inclined with a large roll angle the velocity of the flow around the bottom can be very high due to strong impact which will be accompanied by very low pressure e g negative pressure a large area of negative pressure on the wetted body surface may result in ventilation this does not seem to have happened in the keel of section 0 z 10 m due to the negative pressure has not gone back to zero however ventilation appears in the chine of section 30 m z 35 m because negative pressure tends to fade see fig 16 b d 4 2 3 characteristic of pressure time history time history of impact hydrodynamic pressure is significant in aspect of marine structure in this part we further discuss its characteristics fig 17 i shows the pressure time history at p1 p4 left side of sec 1 in different wave directions in the head sea fig 17 i a the impact duration at p1 is about 3 4s which is 21 4 larger than p4 about 2 8s impact duration of p1 p4 follows the rule of p1 p2 p3 p4 indicating that the longer the pressure time history goes through the closer to the bottom the location is in addition the maximum pressures at the flare section p1 p4 occur almost at the same time t 2 2s during water entry progress when the water flow hits the flare part of the section this is obviously different from what appears in the wedge entries where the location of the maximum pressure moves upward on the wedge surface following the pileup see yettou et al 2007 it shows the maximum pressures for different positions successively occur in time further the pressure histories imply that when the water impacts the flare region the high pressure area covers almost the whole section surface similar phenomenon was presented by sun 2007 in their study of the water entry of a bow flare section when the flow separates from chine the flare pressure begins to decrease which is similar to the wedge cases as the root of the jet flow leaves the chine the pressure distribution becomes almost linear along the wetted surface of the wedge with much lower magnitude see bao et al 2016 similar situation about impact duration also occurs in the oblique wave conditions see fig 17 i b d but the impact duration at the same positions becomes shorter as the θ increases that is because the deadrise angle becomes much smaller with the heel angle increasing the pressure peak of different wave directions is analyzed below the pressure peaks at p1 p4 change greatly with the wave direction θ according to the wedge results of zhao and faltinsen 1993 the smaller the deadrise angle of section the greater the slamming pressure it can be conducted that this difference is mainly due to the increase of heel angle fig 17 ii shows the pressure time history of p5 p8 right side in different wave directions the pressure on this side is evidently smaller than the left side in oblique wave cases which reflects the asymmetry of pressure time history slamming pressure decreases with the θ increasing and even appears some negative values see fig 17 ii d fig 18 shows the pressure time history of sec 2 in different wave directions in the case of sec 1 the maximum value at p1 and p2 appears at θ 30 and the maximum at p3 and p4 appear at 45 oblique wave however in case of sec 2 the extreme value of p1 p4 appears at θ 60 it means that the maximum slamming pressure at different positions appears at different wave conditions these differences mainly because the bow flare profile is a curve form which causes the deadrise angle at different positions is not same in addition it should be noted that the pressure peak in oblique wave maybe not appear the time instant of vertical velocity reaching maximum for example fig 18 i c peak pressure appears at 3 8s while the maximum vertical velocity appears at 2 5s in the ship structural strength assessment the maximum vertical velocity is usually used to predict the peak pressure however it is not suitable in oblique wave cases due to the effect of horizontal velocity and heel angle which should be treated carefully 5 conclusions in this paper a hybrid two step method was applied to analyze the characteristics of bow flare slamming loads in oblique waves which combines a highly efficient seakeeping analysis for body motions and an accurate cfd method for predicting slamming loads differing to the head sea case the effects asymmetric motions were considered taking 21000teu container ship as an example the characteristics of slamming loads under different wave conditions were analyzed numerical verifications were firstly carried out which includes the body motions and asymmetrical impact present seakeeping analysis can cause about 10 error on the ship motion heave and pitch motion but the error of relative motion during impact is acceptable about 5 which means the independent motion solution is feasible for predicting the slamming loads numerical verification for ship like section entering into water with heel angle shows that the present cfd method has a reasonable prediction maximum error less than 8 for the asymmetrical slamming load the characteristics of relative motion in different wave directions were discussed the results show the relative vertical velocity decreases while the transverse velocity and roll motion increase with the wave direction it implies that the effects of transverse velocity and roll motion on slamming loads cannot be neglected when the wave direction is large more than 30 the slamming loads were predicted with three kinds of motion vertical velocity horizontal velocity and roll motion and the characteristics including free surface pressure distribution and pressure time history were systematically analyzed for free surface evolution obvious asymmetry can be observed and pileup characteristic on high deadrise angle side was not significant and even disappeared in 60 oblique wave direction which is quite different from the normal water impact phenomenon for pressure distribution pressure distributed on the left side is greater than that on the right side in the oblique wave conditions which results in the torsion moment and horizontal force for the pressure time history the results show that the impact duration becomes small from keel to chine in addition the maximum pressure for different positions occurs in different wave directions the main reason is the difference of curvature at these positions which reflecting multiple wave direction angles should be calculated to obtain the more accurate peak pressure in different local positions the most important purpose of this paper is to clarify the characteristics of bow flare slamming loads in oblique waves based on a hybrid two step method the complex impact phenomenon in oblique wave case was clarified by analyzing free surface deformation pressure distribution and pressure time history for two typical bow flare sections related conclusions can further improve the design of the marine structure further work should concentrate on the prediction of 3d bow slamming loads and fluid structure coupling effects acknowledgments this work is supported by the project of science and

21806,slamming load is one of fundamental importance in the design of ship structures however the prediction of ship slamming load largely focuses on the head sea due to the more complex physics mechanism in oblique waves in this paper asymmetrical slamming loads of ship in oblique waves had been numerically predicted where one hybrid two step solution was applied through combining seakeeping theory and cfd method firstly asymmetrical ship motions vertical horizontal and roll motions were obtained through the seakeeping analysis then slamming loads of two typical bow flare sections were predicted through applying the cfd method where the complicated flow forms flow separation and air pocket were included the characteristics of impact hydrodynamics including free surface pressure distribution and pressure time history were analyzed systematically showing that the slamming load in oblique wave has obvious asymmetry and is much larger than the head sea these findings clarify the complicated impact phenomenon in oblique wave cases which could improve our understanding on the asymmetrical impact of bow flare sections keywords slamming loads cfd method seakeeping theory asymmetrical impact oblique waves 1 introduction ship slamming is quite common due to the interaction between wave and ship motion this slamming can cause ship vibration speed reduction and even damage the ship structure directly in serious cases ship slamming is an important concern of ship structural design wang and guedes soares 2017 however prediction of slamming loads is a very challenging subject partly due to the highly random marine environment and partly due to the strongly nonlinear free surface and physical surface conditions during impact in order to simplify the ship slamming problem a practical method is to introduce the strip theory and study the simple two dimensional water entry problem a lot of researches on the water entry problem of two dimensional rigid hull sections have been carried out most early researches are based on single phase flow model such as wagner s theory wagner 1932 modified logvinovich model mlm korobkin 2004 qin et al 2011 similarity solution dobrovol skaya 1969 wu and sun 2014 and boundary element method bem zhao and faltinsen 1993 sun 2007 sun and wu 2013 these methods focus on simplified shapes wedges or ship like section but the impact hydrodynamic characteristics of ship bow are different to these simplified shapes as an example for the water entry of a bow flare section the bulbous bow can result in the flow separation when it first enters into water then the separated fluid will hit flare area and thus cause the secondary impact in this process flow separation and air pocket phenomena will happen xie et al 2020a complicated flow forms and air effect are quite prominent for this case and how to simulate these phenomena reasonably will directly influence the accuracy of slamming loads in recent years some computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been applied to predict the slamming loads stenius et al 2006 used lsdyna software to study the problem of wedge section entering into water and discussed the influence of parameters such as grid density and contact stiffness on the calculation results yang et al 2007 simulated the water entry problem of wedges based on fluent and the application of dynamic mesh technology and 6 dof motion 6 dof solver reduced the numerical oscillations the agreement with the result of free falling experiment shows its applicability for the asymmetric cases xie et al 2018b combined the dynamic technology and finite volume method fvm to study the water entry problems of full scale bow flare section the water air phase flow was solved by vof method and the free surface was tracked using predictive lossless image compression plic scheme hu et al 2018 studied the water entry problem of asymmetric wedge by using a constrained interpolation profile cip method to solve the navier stokes n s equations a cartesian grid was used and the free surface was captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw and the body motion was calculated by an immersed boundary method some other similar work can be found in wang and guedes soares 2014 wei et al 2015 and xie et al 2018c 2020b compared to the water entry impact ship slamming is required to consider the wave body interaction which makes this problem more difficult considering the computational time the hybrid two step method is usually adopted this method mainly uses the seakeeping theory to calculate the relative motion of the ship and wave and then applies the impact theory to predict the slamming loads for example hermundstad and moan 2005 used the nonlinear strip theory to obtain the water entry velocity and then adopted a two dimensional boundary element method introduced by zhao and faltinsen 1993 to calculate the slamming pressure xie et al 2018d predicted the relative motion under the wave through seakeeping theory and applied cfd method to calculate slamming pressure other similar works are ochi and motter 1973 schellin and moctar 2006 soares et al 2007 chen et al 2014 and xie et al 2019 although the water entry impact theory and seakeeping theory have greatly developed most of them focus on the head sea cases where the water entry impact is symmetrical however slamming in oblique waves is more common due to the changing course and complicated marine environment for the actual ship slamming the wave and ship motions can greatly influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads kim et al 2019 therefore the purpose of this paper is to put forward a reasonable approach to predict the asymmetrical ship slamming loads in oblique waves since the slamming time is very short the influence of impact force on the overall ship motions is minor lloyd 1989 therefore slamming loads and ship motions can be calculated independently this paper used a hybrid two step method to predict the asymmetrical slamming loads of ship bow in oblique waves in the calculation the time history of impact velocity was firstly obtained by the seakeeping theory where the wave effect and asymmetrical ship motions were taken into account and then slamming loads were predicted through the cfd method where the complicated flow forms flow separation and air pocket were included the rest of paper is organized as following in section 2 a hybrid two step method for predicting asymmetrical ship slamming loads is presented in section 3 numerical verifications on the prediction of ship motion and asymmetrical impact are carried out in section 4 the characteristics related to impact hydrodynamics are presented and the effect of wave direction on the pressure peak is further discussed section 5 draws some important conclusions and outlines further work 2 hybrid two step methods in this paper there are two main concerns determination of impact velocity and prediction of slamming loads a hybrid two step method is adopted which is shown in fig 1 firstly the relative motion of the ship and wave is calculated by the seakeeping theory and then the slamming load is predicted based on the cfd method where the relative motions are treated as the input data of body motion during impact in this hybrid two step method the body motions during impact can be calculated quickly and complicated fluid forms including flow separation and air pocket during asymmetrical impact can be modeled through the cfd method which synthesizes the computational effort and accuracy for predicting the ship slamming load 2 1 seakeeping analysis for body motions during impact the six freedom motions of ship have been widely studied based on the three dimensional potential flow theory such as linear frequency domain method xie et al 2020c wang 2004 and nonlinear time domain method kim and kim 2017 jiao et al 2019 the nonlinear time domain method is an advanced approach quickly developed in recent years however the code is not fully open source in contrast the linear frequency domain method is comparatively mature and has been integrated some commercial codes such as wasim code in addition the calculation of six freedom motions of the ship is not key point in this paper therefore a simple frequency method recalled here is recalled here to enlarge its application for designers in the linear three dimensional frequency domain method the global velocity potential for the ship is usually decomposed into two parts the velocity potential of the steady flow u 0 x φ s x y z and that of unsteady flow φ t x y z e i ω t the velocity potential of unsteady flow φ t is further decomposed into four parts φ 0 for the incident wave potential φ j j 1 2 6 for the radiated waves and φ 7 for the diffracted waves as 1 φ t x y z φ 0 x y z j 1 6 φ j x y z φ 7 x y z these velocity potential stratifies the following control equation and boundaries conditions as 2 d 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 7 b φ j n z h 0 j 1 2 7 on bottom s b f i w u 0 x 2 g z φ j z 0 0 j 1 2 7 on free surface s f s n φ 0 φ 7 0 φ j n n j u 0 i w m j j 1 2 6 on body surface s s r lim r φ j 0 j 1 2 7 on truncated boundary s r where n is the unit normal vector on the plane u 0 is the ship speed three dimensional panel method using the rankine source is usually applied to solve the velocity potential φ j such as the wasim code the six degree ship motions can be predicted once the velocity potential is obtained see newman 1977 then the body motion used in the cfd simulation comes from the actual relative motion of ship and wave for the relative motions the seakeeping theory has been widely used such as hermundstad and moan 2005 and veen and gourlay 2012 for the arbitrary point x y z of the ship the horizontal velocity y v and vertical velocity z v are written as 3 y v d η 2 d t x x b d η 6 d t u ω sin θ 4 z v d η 3 d t x x b d η 5 d t w ω u 0 η 5 where x b y b z b represents the coordinate of ship gravity center η t is the six degree of freedom motion of ship u ω and w ω denote the vertical and horizontal velocity respectively it should be noted that the relative motion caused by roll motion is not included here because the roll motion will be treated as an individual motion in the cfd simulation 2 2 cfd method for water entry impact in the present work water entry of a two dimensional bow flare section with specified motions is simulated based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd method ignore the viscidity the continuity equation and momentum equation can be written as 5 ρ u 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u t p ρ g where u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure field ρ is the density of fluid g is the gravity acceleration the vof method is implemented to track the free surface through introducing the volume fraction of fluid the basic phase is air which means the air effect can be included in the prediction of slamming loads the phase equation is written as 7 ρ α t ρ α u 0 where α is the volume fraction of air the effect of the air pocket in the actual process is quite important for bow flare section as stated by xie and liu 2020 the compressibility of the fluid is modified by the karman tsien formula as 8 ρ w ρ w 1 δ p ρ w m w 2 9 ρ a ρ a 1 δ p ρ a m a 2 where ρ w and ρ a is the initial density of water generally as 1025 kg m3 and 1 25 kg m3 ρ w and ρ a is the density of water and air after considering the compressibility δ p is the pressure difference between flow field pressure and standard atmospheric pressure m a and m w is the propagation speed of sound in water and air respectively generally as 340 m s and 1500 m s the correction of compressibility can be achieved by redefining the density of water and air through user s define functions udf in fluent and the density and dynamic viscosity should be updated as 10 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w where μ w and μ a are the viscosity of water and air when the roll angle is large there is a strong impact between the bow flare section surface and the free surface the air effect becomes important for the cases with a large roll angle for two phase flow the discontinuity of pressure on the interface of air and water can cause the divergence of numerical simulation aiming at obvious air effect a continuum surface force csf model presented in brackbill et al 1992 is adopted to keep the discontinuity of pressure which expresses the interfacial pressure as a continuous function the function can be written as 11 p t p b α 0 p a c α n 0 α 1 p a α 1 where c is surface tension coefficient then the pressure in the whole area can be corrected as 12 p p c κ α where κ is interface curvature defined as κ n momentum equation eq 6 can be rewritten by combining the eq 12 as 13 ρ u t ρ u u t p c κ α ρ g it can be seen that there has an addition source item c κ α in eq 13 than the original moment equation eq 6 eqs 5 7 and 13 constitute the continuity equation phase equation and momentum equation of the improved vof method this source item is added through user s definition source uds the water entry problem of a rigid body can be regarded as such a flow where the shape of the fluid domain is changing with time and the changing boundary is the outline of the body dynamic mesh approach is applied to solve the large deformation when the body moves forced motions presented by eqs 3 4 are utilized in the simulation according to the relative motion of ship and wave the update of the volume mesh is handled automatically by fluent at each time step through re meshing technology according to the new positions of the moving boundaries two kinds of mesh morphing methods including spring based smoothing and local re meshing method are adopted in the present work to improve the mesh quality when the boundary of the fluid domain the outline of the body is changed a finite volume method is used to solve the continuity and momentum equations details of numerical procedure have been reported in our pervious study of xie et al 2018b 3 numerical verifications 3 1 asymmetrical slamming of ship like section in the study of yang et al 2007 the accuracy of cfd method has been verified by the experiments but the comparison results are limited to the case of wedges the actual hull has more complex profiles which cause the flow during impact to be different from the wedge case for this reason we select the free falling experiments of ship like section to further verify the cfd method where experimental results come from aarsnes 1996 the ship like section used in the experiment is shown in fig 2 a two pressure locations were used to compare the results defined as p1 and p2 and fig 2 b shows the details of position three different mesh sizes were used and the parameters of mesh were listed in table 1 in the simulation the angle of inclination is 14 7 and the drop height is 0 02 m fig 3 shows the comparison of the predicted results and other numerical results where the boundary element method bem from sun and faltinsen 2009 and the arbitrary lagrange euler method ale from wang and guedes soares 2013 in fig 3 a we can see the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost coincident and they are close to the experimental ones however in the experimental result there is a periodic oscillation at t 0 1s which is confirmed to come from the vibration of the falling device during the falling process see sun 2007 in addition it should be noted that there are two obvious force peaks according to the bow flare section penetration the force firstly increases due to the bow flare section penetration until the right side is fully immersed by water t 0 132s the slamming load begins to decrease when the water separates from the chine and thus appears the first peak after that the body still moves down which increases the hydrostatic pressure and the left side of body begins to touch water which increases the slamming pressure on this side such a situation causes the force increases again when the grid size is small enough the numerical results will converge to the experimental results in order to reduce the computation time mesh 2 will be applied to the numerical study in this paper for the comparative results of local pressure p1 and p2 the results of bem are 15 larger than the experimental ones the air effect is ignored in bem which is the reason causing large error with small deadrise angle about 15 3 results of ale and cfd are similar and they are close to experimental ones about 5 errors it is noted that pressure oscillation of from ale method is more obvious than that in cfd method in ale method the water maybe across the body surface so called leakage phenomenon this phenomenon can cause the numerical oscillations 3 2 analysis of body motions and slamming load in wave since the relative motion of ship sections as the input data in the water entry progress its accuracy can influence the prediction of slamming loads therefore body motions obtained by seakeeping theory should be validated in this paper the ro ro vessel is chosen as the calculated model and the experimental data has been published by hermundstad and moan 2005 where the model tests of a ro ro vessel in regular head bow and bow quartering wave of various heights were carried out the experiments were conducted on a self propelled 1 21 6 scale model of a 120 m car carrier in 45 oblique sea with height 5 m and period 9s slamming loads on two panels in the upper part of the bow flare section were measured fig 4 shows the time series of measured and calculated results in regular oblique wave for the heave motion fig 4 a the positive amplitude peak value are almost same error less than 5 while the negative values valley value in the calculation are larger than the experimental ones with an average of 13 for the pitch motion fig 4 b the valley values are almost same error less than 5 while the measured peak values are 15 larger than the calculated results the nonlinear slamming force appeared in the experiments while it is not included in this presented study this difference causes about 10 error on the predicting the ship motions for the relative motion at the bow fig 4 c the valley values are almost same with an error of 3 4 while the peak value obtained by the present method is larger than the measured value with an average of 18 7 the positive part denotes the ship moving upwards while the negative part represents the ship moving downward for the hull slamming it usually happens at the stage of the ship moving downward relative motion is less than zero so only negative part of relative motion is important in the present study fortunately the error between them is small about 5 although the slamming force can prevent the ship move downward the influence of slamming force becomes obvious at the time instant of relative motion from negative becoming positive where the vertical velocity reaches up to maximum at this moment slamming progress has ended which means the nonlinear slamming force has small influence on the prediction of slamming loads even though the ship motion has about 10 errors for the actual ship slamming in waves the wave and 3d effect can influence the predicting accuracy of slamming loads therefore it is necessary to verify these differences in order to accurately describe slamming pressure in waves fig 5 shows the comparative results between predicted and measured slamming pressure at the two pressure gauges p1 and p2 the pressure peak obtained by cfd method is larger than the experimental data with the approximate errors of 22 8 for p1 and 32 for p2 on the one hand the wave has horizontal propagation velocity which can cause horizontal slamming pressure so call slapping on the other hand the ship bow is a three dimensional model which has obvious 3d effects according to the discussion on the 3d effects of bow flare model in our pervious study of xie et al 2018a the 3d flow can reduce average 25 slamming pressure 4 results and discussions this paper takes a 21kteu ultra large container ship as an example to discuss the characteristic of the bow flare slamming load in different wave conditions the primary parameter in full load condition is listed in table 2 two typical bow flare profiles were selected whose relative position referring to the whole ship is shown in fig 6 for each profile four typical monitoring points are selected on each side to show the pressure time history whose locations are shown in fig 7 4 1 characteristic of body motions in this study the influence of wave direction on slamming load is the key factor the wave amplitude is uniformed as 5 m with the wave frequency 0 4 rad s fig 8 shows the time history of relative motions at sec 2 it can be seen that the relative motions show obvious periodicity because the ship motions are solved based on the linear frequency domain method in general ship slamming occurs when the relative displacement between ship and wave is less than or equal to zero touching water condition and the vertical velocity is less than zero water entry condition faltinsen et al 2004 in order to save computational effort for predicting the slamming loads the body motions within one period were used in the water entry simulation fig 9 shows the body motion time history during impact in different oblique waves it can be seen that there have additional horizontal velocity and roll motion in oblique waves while there is none in the head sea θ 0 in addition the horizontal velocity and roll motion increase but the vertical velocity decreases with θ the bow flare section tends to much flatter when the roll angle becomes larger which bears larger slamming loads on the upwind side zhao and faltinsen 1993 it implies that the increment of roll angle may cause greater slamming loads even though the vertical velocity is small in some oblique wave conditions 4 2 impact hydrodynamic characteristics once the body motions are obtained the slamming loads can be predicted through simulating the water entry of bow flare section with forced motions vertical velocity horizontal velocity and roll motion the size of the fluid domain in the present paper is set as 700 m 620 m the domain grid is obtained through the mesh processor icem cfd where the mesh size on the body can be set as 0 4 m and the maximum mesh size is 4 m according to the mesh convergence study in section 3 1 the grid type is the unstructured grid and detail of mesh is illustrated in fig 10 in order to reduce the pressure oscillation the average pressure of three grids nearby each point is regarded as the final pressure time history in the simulation body motions during the water entry process are assigned by the relative motions as shown in fig 9 the time step is 0 005s with a total time 5s and cpu time for each case is approximately 4h15min 4 2 1 analysis of free surface evolution a major characteristic of asymmetrical impact is that it has more complicated free surface form than the symmetrical case fig 11 illustrates the free surface evolution of sec 2 during water entry in 30 oblique wave it can be observed that the body is rotating anticlockwise with time according to the body motions showed in fig 9 c the roll motion is always positive before 4 7s which means the heel angle always increases at this time quantum this asymmetry on the two sides causes the different flow characteristics showing the pileup on the left side upwind side moves faster than the right side on the left side the flow separation occurs at t 1 7s and then the separated flow re hits the body at t 2 1s such the situation can cause secondary impact and air pocket phenomena which affects the pressure distribution along the body surface xie et al 2020a fig 12 illustrates the free surface elevation at θ 60 more obvious asymmetrical free surface characteristics can be observed one important characteristic is that the free surface nearby the body right side is below the initial water surface i e fig 12 e which means there does not appear pileup characteristic it is quite different from the normal water entry impact phenomenon where the pileup is the primary flow characteristic during impact this is because the body has roll motion which makes the body rotates anticlockwise this motion extrudes left fluid quickly rising and separates the right fluid and thus causing a black region between rigid side and body surface in addition the horizontal velocity y v 0 makes the body move to the left side which further increases this separation the right water will flow into this black region due to gravity effect which makes the lower free surface characteristic in order to further make sure the deformation of free surfaces predicting correctly at numerical approach we define a coefficient of dispatched volume ψ which is the volume ratio of pileup and immersed body see fig 13 as 14 ψ r 1 r 2 r 0 where r i represents the pileup water volume and r 0 is the volume of the immersed body according to the free surface evolution showed in fig 11 water entry process can be divided into five stages stage i water immerses the body fig 11 a stage ii water is separated from the bulbous bow fig 11 b stage iii separated fluid re hits body fig 11 c stage iv water immerses the low deadrise angle side fig 11 d stage v water immerses high deadrise angle side fig 11 e we will discuss the characteristic of ψ in these five stages fig 14 shows the time history of ψ for sec 2 in different oblique waves it can be seen that the value of ψ fluctuates around one before stage iv in theory pileup volume should be equal to that of the immersed body before the water separates from the chine of the body stage iv as ψ 1 it reflects that the free surface form presented by the numerical simulation basically conforms to the physical reality during impact in 30 oblique case fig 14 a at stage i t 0 9s the volume of pileup is larger than the volume of immersed body that maybe some air is wrapped at the initial time instant of body touching water xu et al 2010 in stage ii 0 9s t 1 5s the fluid is separated from the body which causes the volume of water pushed by the body is greater than the pileup when the separated fluid re hits the body surface stage iii 0 15s t 2 1s air pocket is formed resulting in an increment of ψ after that stage iv 2 1s t 2 7s the ψ gradually decreases and approaches to 1 as the bubble surrounding body gradually escapes in stage iv 2 7s t 3 2s the separated fluid exists an upward velocity that increases the ψ when the right side is fully immersed by water stage v t 3 2s the displacement volume of the body remains the same but the pileup still moves upwards causing a more increment of ψ in 60 oblique case fig 14 b this change law of ψ is similar to that in fig 14 a but the rate of increase of ψ is significantly lower than that in fig 14 a after the fluid has completely submerged the body t 4 2s as can be seen from the free surface showed in fig 12 when the transverse inclination angle is larger the pileup on the right side is not obvious and the free surface near the body is even lower than the undisturbed still water surface this indicates that the displacement of the fluid by the body is not obvious on the right side resulting in a slower upward movement of the fluid 4 2 2 characteristic of pressure distribution fig 15 and fig 16 show the pressure distribution along these two sections at different time instants where the negative value of the axis represents the left z directional height of ship section while the positive value is the right z directional height the pressure on both sides presents symmetry in the head sea condition fig 15 the pressure distribution is greatly related to the free surface which further makes sure the credibility of free surface evolution in oblique wave conditions fig 15 b d the pressure on the left side is greater than that on the right side it is mainly due to the roll and horizontal motions of the section this asymmetry of pressure distribution is the typical characteristics in asymmetrical slamming which have been found in many literatures such as krastev et al 2018 and russo et al 2018b for the ships asymmetry of pressure distribution leads to a huge torque and horizontal force in the ship bow which greatly affects the structural strength especially for larger open container ships in addition the difference of pressure on the two sides increases with θ for example the error ratio of pressure peak on the two sides is 1 25 in θ 30 case while it increases to 7 05 in θ 60 for the case of sec 2 fig 16 there appears smaller pressure at 10 m z 0 m this is because there is an obvious concave surface between the bulbous bow and flare area which reduces the impact force of body extruding water compared to the case of sec 1 there shows more obvious asymmetry and even appears negative pressure on the right side for example in fig 15 d it can be clearly seen that the pressure on the right side is almost zero which means the effect of body extruding water is quite small for larger roll angles causes by wave direction increment the angle between the flare surface and the undisturbed water surface is smaller the pressure distribution on the left side windward side shows a higher and sharper peak in addition the pressure is much larger due to the larger roll motion which means that the water impact on the flare surface is stronger as the wave direction increases meanwhile the contribution from the right side leeward side becomes less with increasing roll angle it should be noted that the obvious negative pressure less than atmospheric pressure appears at the keel and chine of section when the wave direction increases θ 30 as the section is inclined with a large roll angle the velocity of the flow around the bottom can be very high due to strong impact which will be accompanied by very low pressure e g negative pressure a large area of negative pressure on the wetted body surface may result in ventilation this does not seem to have happened in the keel of section 0 z 10 m due to the negative pressure has not gone back to zero however ventilation appears in the chine of section 30 m z 35 m because negative pressure tends to fade see fig 16 b d 4 2 3 characteristic of pressure time history time history of impact hydrodynamic pressure is significant in aspect of marine structure in this part we further discuss its characteristics fig 17 i shows the pressure time history at p1 p4 left side of sec 1 in different wave directions in the head sea fig 17 i a the impact duration at p1 is about 3 4s which is 21 4 larger than p4 about 2 8s impact duration of p1 p4 follows the rule of p1 p2 p3 p4 indicating that the longer the pressure time history goes through the closer to the bottom the location is in addition the maximum pressures at the flare section p1 p4 occur almost at the same time t 2 2s during water entry progress when the water flow hits the flare part of the section this is obviously different from what appears in the wedge entries where the location of the maximum pressure moves upward on the wedge surface following the pileup see yettou et al 2007 it shows the maximum pressures for different positions successively occur in time further the pressure histories imply that when the water impacts the flare region the high pressure area covers almost the whole section surface similar phenomenon was presented by sun 2007 in their study of the water entry of a bow flare section when the flow separates from chine the flare pressure begins to decrease which is similar to the wedge cases as the root of the jet flow leaves the chine the pressure distribution becomes almost linear along the wetted surface of the wedge with much lower magnitude see bao et al 2016 similar situation about impact duration also occurs in the oblique wave conditions see fig 17 i b d but the impact duration at the same positions becomes shorter as the θ increases that is because the deadrise angle becomes much smaller with the heel angle increasing the pressure peak of different wave directions is analyzed below the pressure peaks at p1 p4 change greatly with the wave direction θ according to the wedge results of zhao and faltinsen 1993 the smaller the deadrise angle of section the greater the slamming pressure it can be conducted that this difference is mainly due to the increase of heel angle fig 17 ii shows the pressure time history of p5 p8 right side in different wave directions the pressure on this side is evidently smaller than the left side in oblique wave cases which reflects the asymmetry of pressure time history slamming pressure decreases with the θ increasing and even appears some negative values see fig 17 ii d fig 18 shows the pressure time history of sec 2 in different wave directions in the case of sec 1 the maximum value at p1 and p2 appears at θ 30 and the maximum at p3 and p4 appear at 45 oblique wave however in case of sec 2 the extreme value of p1 p4 appears at θ 60 it means that the maximum slamming pressure at different positions appears at different wave conditions these differences mainly because the bow flare profile is a curve form which causes the deadrise angle at different positions is not same in addition it should be noted that the pressure peak in oblique wave maybe not appear the time instant of vertical velocity reaching maximum for example fig 18 i c peak pressure appears at 3 8s while the maximum vertical velocity appears at 2 5s in the ship structural strength assessment the maximum vertical velocity is usually used to predict the peak pressure however it is not suitable in oblique wave cases due to the effect of horizontal velocity and heel angle which should be treated carefully 5 conclusions in this paper a hybrid two step method was applied to analyze the characteristics of bow flare slamming loads in oblique waves which combines a highly efficient seakeeping analysis for body motions and an accurate cfd method for predicting slamming loads differing to the head sea case the effects asymmetric motions were considered taking 21000teu container ship as an example the characteristics of slamming loads under different wave conditions were analyzed numerical verifications were firstly carried out which includes the body motions and asymmetrical impact present seakeeping analysis can cause about 10 error on the ship motion heave and pitch motion but the error of relative motion during impact is acceptable about 5 which means the independent motion solution is feasible for predicting the slamming loads numerical verification for ship like section entering into water with heel angle shows that the present cfd method has a reasonable prediction maximum error less than 8 for the asymmetrical slamming load the characteristics of relative motion in different wave directions were discussed the results show the relative vertical velocity decreases while the transverse velocity and roll motion increase with the wave direction it implies that the effects of transverse velocity and roll motion on slamming loads cannot be neglected when the wave direction is large more than 30 the slamming loads were predicted with three kinds of motion vertical velocity horizontal velocity and roll motion and the characteristics including free surface pressure distribution and pressure time history were systematically analyzed for free surface evolution obvious asymmetry can be observed and pileup characteristic on high deadrise angle side was not significant and even disappeared in 60 oblique wave direction which is quite different from the normal water impact phenomenon for pressure distribution pressure distributed on the left side is greater than that on the right side in the oblique wave conditions which results in the torsion moment and horizontal force for the pressure time history the results show that the impact duration becomes small from keel to chine in addition the maximum pressure for different positions occurs in different wave directions the main reason is the difference of curvature at these positions which reflecting multiple wave direction angles should be calculated to obtain the more accurate peak pressure in different local positions the most important purpose of this paper is to clarify the characteristics of bow flare slamming loads in oblique waves based on a hybrid two step method the complex impact phenomenon in oblique wave case was

21807,waters surrounding zhoushan archipelago have the most abundant tidal current energy in china which makes it a promising site for tidal farm construction in the future before deploying tidal current turbines the potential environmental impacts on surrounding waters must be evaluated in this work we focus on the flow field impact assessment of an assumed tidal farm installed in zhoushan putuo hulu channel first in order to evaluate the tidal characteristics there a 2 month adcp campaign is carried out and a 3 d hydrodynamic model is established and validated with the in situ measurements additionally tidal current velocity and water depth as well as flow heading asymmetry information are used to evaluate the tidal stream exploitability within this channel second a tidal farm consisting of 115 turbines is planned and assumed to be deployed throughout this channel blade element momentum method is used to numerically characterize the flow turbine interactions and then the spatial temporal flow field variations caused by the assumed tidal farm are evaluated it can be seen from the results that the peak flow speed reduction produced by the tidal farm could be over 0 5 m s within the wake zones while the flow velocity increment along two islands could reach 0 6 m s in particular a flow speed phase shift phenomenon can be observed besides the water level experiences a small overall rise and the difference compared with the reference is within 3 0 cm moreover the seabed shear stress within the wake zones could drop by 65 while the areas along the two islands might see over 100 increase indicating the risk of sediment deposition and coastal erosion keywords tidal current energy tidal farm hydrodynamic analysis flow field impact putuo hulu channel zhoushan archipelago 1 introduction with the growing environmental problems caused by fossil fuels such as global warming and air pollution human beings have paid more and more attentions to the development and utilization of clean renewable energies among them tidal current energy has attracted considerable interest from both academia and industry in recent years due to its great potential zhou et al 2017 many countries such as the uk ward et al 2018 adcock and draper 2014 france campbell et al 2017 spain mestres et al 2019 and several others vennell 2012 chong and lam 2013 have conducted extensive research studies and demonstration projects on cost efficiently harvesting tidal energy in particular the european ocean energy center emec has established a large scale marine energy experimental base where various types of tidal turbines have been tested black and veatch consulting 2009 european marine energy centre 2019 although there has been no commercialized tidal farm yet the technology readiness level of tidal current energy harvesting is very close to industrialization compared with europe tidal current energy technology in china has also been rapidly developed liu et al 2017 in recent years many studies have been carried out on assessing and collecting tidal energy from china s coastal waters wu et al 2017a li et al 2012 2018 liu et al 2019 and several different types of tidal current turbines have been developed and tested zhang et al 2014 among different shoreline areas waters around zhoushan archipelago have lots of channels with strong tidal currents and it is regarded as the most promising place to install china s first national tidal farm in the future li et al 2010 qian et al 2019 both numerical study and experimental tests have been conducted to evaluate the tidal current energy potential in zhoushan in 2010 adopted the farm and flux method to evaluate the resource reserves of tidal current energy in the gaoting and guanmen channel wang et al 2010 in 2011 hou et al established a 3 d hydrodynamic model of zhoushan archipelago and its adjacent waters based on the open source code fvcom in 2015 the hydrodynamic environment of zhoushan waters was studied with modified bottom friction coefficients and the flow field impacts from tidal turbines were assessed hou et al 2015 besides gao et al evaluated the tidal current energy development potential in the waters near hulu island based on the mike 21 module gao et al 2015 in 2016 li studied the resource reserves of the major channels in hangzhou bay in comprehensive consideration of technical and economic factors li 2016 at the same time chen performed numerical simulations of tidal currents in zhoushan archipelago and its northern waters based on the adcirc and fvcom models and also optimized the tidal farm layout which is assumed to be installed in these waters chen 2016 xu et al analysed the flow velocity energy intensity and turbulent kinetic energy for several channels in zhoushan waters with the roms model xu et al 2016 in 2017 wu et al used the flux and garret method to analyse the flow field of putuo hulu channel wu et al 2017 besides yu et al established a 2 d hydrodynamic model of the waters near zhoushan and studied the flow field impacts of exploiting tidal current resources by increasing the bottom friction coefficient yu et al 2017 recently the authors in zhang et al 2018 2020 used an open source code tidal farm to optimize the layout of tidal turbines for energy output improvement the aforementioned works mainly focus on tidal current resource assessment of the waters in zhoushan archipelago and also lots of attentions are drawn to tidal farm layout optimization however little scientific investigation has been conducted on corresponding environmental impacts brought by tidal farms in zhoushan area in fact the installed offshore renewable energy devices for instance wind farms chang and jeng 2014 qian et al 2018 wave energy converters o dea et al 2018 contardo et al 2018 and tidal current turbines haverson et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 will produce considerable impacts on the surrounding environment such as flow field sediment and ecosystem these influences need to be well evaluated before approving an offshore engineering project nash and phoenix 2017 therefore it is important to perform an environmental impact assessment before developing a tidal farm project in this regard this study mainly aims to evaluate the environmental impact caused by a tidal farm assumed to be installed in the putuo hulu channel in zhoushan particularly we focus on the tidal farm induced flow field influence first a 2 month adcp campaign is carried out to measure the tidal current in this channel and a 3 d hydrodynamic model of zhoushan archipelago and its adjacent waters is established based on delft3d and further validated with the continuous in situ measured data the tidal characteristics and resource distribution are then assessed based on tidal stream exploitability evaluation second a tidal farm consisting of 115 turbines with 30 m diameter rotor is preliminarily planned and assumed to be installed in the channel the turbine flow interaction has also been coupled into the 3 d numerical hydrodynamic model so that the flow field impact analysis can be performed the tempo spatial variations of flow velocity water level and seabed shear stress etc caused by the operational tidal farm are then evaluated and analysed which should be taken into consideration in future tidal farm development the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 performs the tidal characteristics analysis of putuo hulu channel based on both experimental and numerical methods section 3 describes the tidal farm design process and how it is coupled into the hydrodynamic model then the detailed tempo spatial flow field impact analysis is presented at last we draw the conclusions 2 putuo hulu channel flow field analysis 2 1 putuo hulu channel zhoushan archipelago as shown in fig 1 off the east coast of zhejiang province has the largest number of islands more than a thousand in china accounting for about 20 of the total amount the waters around these islands have abundant tidal current energy which is more than half of the nationwide tidal current resources li et al 2010 in this work the putuo hulu channel in zhoushan area as starred in fig 1 is selected as the study object as its name implies this channel is located between putuo island and hulu island which is about 7 km east to the zhoushan main island the peak flow velocity within this channel was estimated to be over 2 m s luo and xia 2017 although its tidal current resource is believed not as abundant as several other channels in zhoushan archipelago for instance the guishan channel the tidal current energy there is still considerable and no major restrictions for tidal current energy development are found there as well such as shipping and fishery in fact the national tidal current energy testing site ntced in china has been located in putuo hulu channel and several demonstration and testing projects are currently ongoing there which makes in a promising site for future tidal farm development in china zheng et al 2015 prior to this study bathymetric survey of this channel with 10 m resolution has been conducted as shown in fig 2 it can be noticed from this map that north entrance of the channel is divided into two parts by a reef and the water depth is relatively shallow on the west side sometimes less than 30 m with an area of 1 0 km width while it is much deeper on the east side more than 40 m with an area of about 1 3 km width besides in the middle part the underwater terrain is quite complex where the water depth is usually more than 40 m and the deepest location even exceeds 80 m in addition there is a salient in this channel that the water depth comes to below 30 m in the south the water depth usually exceeds 40 m with a relatively flat subsea terrain 2 2 adcp campaign in 2018 zhejiang university conducted a 2 month tidal current in situ measurement campaign at this channel as shown in fig 3 a nortek awac 600 khz adcp was deployed with the gps coordinates of 30 2 207 n 122 24 435 e and it was mounted on the seabed at a water depth of 37 m in the adcp settings 40 cells are used with 1 m vertical bin size and 30 pings with 1hz sampling rate are averaged every 5 min as the output detailed information for this adcp campaign can be found in table 1 the tidal current roses at six different water depths are shown in fig 4 in post processing the data for the upper 4 cells above water surface are excluded as they are invalid the measurements of the remaining 36 vertical cells are divided into three water layers i e bottom middle and surface the tidal current velocity time series of the last 28 days in the three layers are plotted in fig 5 it is found that the maximum ebb tide flow velocity appears on march 20 in surface layer which is 2 36 m s with the 157 flow direction while the maximum flood tide flow velocity is on april 1 in surface layer reaching 2 55 m s with 335 flow direction 2 3 3 d numerical modelling besides in situ measurement a 3 d numerical model is established in this work to better understand the flow field behaviors of putuo hulu channel 2 3 1 theory shallow water equations swe are used in hydrodynamic modelling process based on swe and boussinesq assumptions this finite difference code solves the baroclinic navier stokes equation which can be used in either 2 d or 3 d occasions the governing equations of this model consist of three sets of equations which are list as follows mass conservation equation 1 ζ t d ζ u x d ζ v y q transport equation 2 ζ d c t ζ d u c x ζ d v c y d h 2 c λ d d ζ c r momentum conservation equation 3 u t u u x v u y f v g ζ x g ρ 0 d ζ ρ x d z τ s x τ b x ρ 0 d ζ v h 2 u u t u u x v u y f u g ζ y g ρ 0 d ζ ρ y d z τ s y τ b y ρ 0 d ζ v h 2 v where ζ is the water level d is the water depth relative to a reference plane u and v are the velocity vectors along x and y directions respectively q is the intensity of mass sources per unit area f is the coriolis parameter v h is the kinematic horizontal eddy viscosity ρ 0 is the reference density ρ is the anomaly density τ s x and τ s y are the components of the wind stress acting on the sea surface τ b x and τ b y are the components of shear stress at the bottom c is the salinity or temperature d h is the horizontal eddy diffusivity λ d is the first order decay process r is the source term per unit area g is the gravitational coefficient 2 3 2 modelling the delft3d platform deltares 2013 originally developed by deltares is adopted to construct the hydrodynamic model this model adopts orthogonal curvilinear grid with the sigma coordinate along the vertical direction and the domain decomposition approach is used to build the computational grid in the model in order to deal with the large number of islands and complex bathymetry in the target waters as shown in fig 6 a grids with different colors represent distinct computational domains instead of one way transmission grid nodes transfer data bidirectionally through linear interpolation at the boundary between adjacent computational domains the grid is nested for three times with the grid resolution refined five times in each nesting the resolution in the most refined area i e around the putuo hulu channel has reached 30 30 m as shown in fig 6 b and this grid resolution is able to well simulate the flow turbine interaction in addition this grid is sliced into 10 sigma layers along vertical depth and the vertical eddy viscosity is computed with k ε turbulence model the thickness of each layer is 10 of the local water depth which is enough to reflect the vertical spatial distribution of the flow field next by using the bathymetric map in fig 2 a topographic model of the waters near zhoushan is built with the delft3d quickin module negative water depth 5 0 m is used for the land part in this model the open boundary conditions are set at the edges of the peripheral grids with the inputs of 11 major astronomical tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 m4 m6 ms4 1 1 https www tpxo net global the land boundaries are null flow and free slip with zero shear stress in addition the wind stress exerted on the free surface is not considered while the seabed shear stress at the bottom boundary is computed according to the quadratic stress law 4 τ b g ρ 0 u b u b c 3 d 2 where u b is the horizontal velocity in the bottom layer and c 3 d is the 3d chézy coefficient calculated from 5 c 3 d c 2 d g κ ln δ z b 2 h where δ z b represents the vertical distance from the seabed to the nearest computational grid point κ stands for the von karman constant κ 0 41 and h is the overall water depth c 2 d is the 2 d chézy coefficient where the spatially uniform value c 2 d 65 m½ s is used in the simulation besides the calculation time step is set as 0 25 min which satisfies the courant condition to ensure computational stability and the simulation using barotropic mode covers a period of 32 days including a spin up time of 2 days 2 3 3 validation tide table and tidal current observations are used to validate the effectiveness of the established 3 d hydrodynamic model for the flow field of putuo hulu channel water level as spotted in fig 1 the water level data from the tide tables of three nearby observing stations national marine data and information service 2018 i e daishan shenjiamen and xize are used to evaluate the accuracy of the established model linear regression test is performed against these data and the results are shown in fig 7 two statistical indices are used to indicate the modelling accuracy i e root mean square error r m s e and correlation coefficient r which are given by 6 r m s e 1 n n 1 n s n m n 2 7 r 1 n n 1 n s n s n m n m n σ s σ m where n is the number of samples n is the data sequence number s n represents the simulation result m n is the measured data σ s and σ m denote the standard deviations of the numerical results and the tide tables respectively it can be seen that the simulation results of this model agree well with the tide tables where the correlation coefficients are all above 0 98 also notice there is a slight prediction deviation on the occasions of low tide this may be due to the influence of large number of islands and complex topography around the validation sites which makes it difficult to accurately reproduce the actual water level with the corresponding grid resolution tidal current the simulation results of flow velocity and direction are compared with the adcp measurements the validation results for the surface middle and bottom layers are shown in fig 8 good agreement can also be found both regarding flow velocity and direction however there are still minor differences for the peak velocities in the surface layer which may be due to the model uncertainties on free surfaces such as effects from wind and waves in addition it should be noted that due to lack of detailed information of the seabed friction coefficient in the channel the uniform chézy friction coefficient is used in the simulation so that the model accuracy in the bottom layer is slightly lower than that in the middle layer overall despite there are small deviations the established model achieves good accuracy which is sufficient to predict the distribution of tidal currents in the putuo hulu channel 2 4 flow field analysis 2 4 1 tidal characteristics based on the above established model the flow field of the target water area can be predicated results about the velocity distribution estimations during flood and ebb tides are shown in fig 9 respectively it can be seen that the areas with high speed current are mainly located on the west side and the peak velocity is close to 2 5 m s at the north west entrance of the channel besides it can be noticed the current velocity could also exceed 2 m s on the southwest side of hulu island in general no significant difference can be observed in comparison with the existing research works on flow field prediction of this channel although different numerical models are used gao et al 2015 luo and xia 2017 wu et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 the 3 d flow field characteristics at four representative locations are investigated for the north west entrance in fig 10 a notice that there is an area with sharp water depth decrease producing a blocking effect that will accelerate the tidal current velocity and lead to flow speed asymmetry during flood and ebb tides the peak velocity during flood tide is significantly higher than that during ebb which could exceed 2 3 m s regarding flow direction flood and ebb tides are approximately towards 300 and 120 respectively with good symmetry in addition due to the steep slope bathymetry there is a slight change in the flow direction along the vertical profile for the north entrance simulation result in fig 10 b good symmetry for both flow velocity and direction can be observed as the seabed is relatively flat there the peak flow velocity around 1 5 m s is slightly lower than that of north west entrance and flood and ebb flow directions are 345 and 165 respectively besides there is almost no flow direction change at different water depth in the middle of the channel in fig 10 c the symmetry and stability of flow velocity are poor during both flood and ebb because of the salient as mentioned above besides the peak flood flow velocity exceeds 1 6 m s which is stronger than that in ebb the peak velocity in the middle is also slightly higher than that on the north entrance for the site in the southern part as shown in fig 10 d the flow direction is similar to that of the middle but the flow velocity and direction symmetry is much better 2 4 2 resource distribution further this work adopts the tidal stream exploitability t s e method to investigate the tidal current resource distribution and evaluate the development potential within this water channel this approach combines the tidal current velocity and water depth information to identify areas with good development potential the t s e index is given as 8 t s e ξ 2 v 0 3 h 0 v f 3 v e 3 h where v 0 and h 0 are the characteristic velocity and depth respectively here v 0 1 4 m s and h 0 50 m are seen as the reference assume t s e 2 it means the exploitable amount of energy at one location is twice of that with v 0 and h 0 in addition v f and v e are the depth averaged velocities at mid flood and mid ebb respectively h is the water depth ξ is the penalty function which is given as 9 ξ 0 if h δ h 2 h 1 ξ 1 h 2 h 1 h δ h 2 h 1 if h 1 h δ h 2 h 2 ξ 1 if h δ h 2 h 2 where δ h is the maximum tidal range h 1 and h 2 are the maximum upper and lower limits of the water depth compensation for turbine installation which are 2 m and 5 m respectively note that due to the aforementioned flow direction asymmetries the influences of turbine yaw misalignment on energy extraction should also be taken into account therefore we further incorporate the yaw misalignment effect into the t s e index define the average yaw misalignment angle γ as 10 γ θ f θ e 180 2 where θ f and θ e are the main flow directions for mid flood and mid ebb respectively then the augmented t s e index can be rewritten as 11 t s e ξ 2 v 0 3 h 0 v f 3 v e 3 h cos 3 γ with the bathymetric information in fig 2 and the estimated flow velocity distribution in fig 9 during mid flood and mid ebb the t s e index for this channel area can be calculated as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that t s e has large values along the west side of this channel and the north west entrance implying these locations are more suitable for developing tidal current energy while t s e is relatively lower on the east and south sides besides it can be noticed that several other potential areas with high flow velocities for instance the south east part close to hulu island as shown in fig 9 a are with low t s e index values this is due to the small water depth there preventing it from large tidal current turbine installation 3 flow field impact assessment of a tidal farm in this section a tidal farm is assumed to be installed in the putuo hulu channel and the flow field impact caused by the tidal turbine array is evaluated 3 1 tidal farm design the obtained t s e scores are indicating favourable places for tidal current energy development by also considering the water depth and turbine spacing restrictions we preliminary design a tidal farm in this water channel as follows the horizontal axis tidal turbine is used in this study to form the tidal farm for its relatively high efficiency and stability according to emec guidelines black and veatch consulting 2009 large rotor size is suggested to provide more favourable economics which is based on the same principle of rapidly growing rotor size for offshore wind turbines since the water depth within the resource area of putuo hulu channel is mostly 40 90 m the 3 blade horizontal axis tidal current turbine with 30 m rotor diameter is used in this work to form the assumed tidal farm the large rotor is also supposed to build up an extreme but technical sensible condition for flow field impact analysis which is also the study object this work moreover a 5 m top clearance and 25 water depth as the bottom clearance are recommended in the emec s report black and veatch consulting 2009 so that the minimum water depth for tidal current turbine installation is set as 47 m for each turbine the nacelle is supposed to be located in the middle water depth in order to minimize the disturbances from both the seabed and water surface besides according to the tidal farm layout requirement in chen et al 2015 the lateral spacing is set as twice the rotor diameter while the longitudinal spacing is ten times as shown in fig 12 additionally a staggered arrangement is used in the farm layout in order to reduce the wake effect zhang et al 2020 also note that the turbine yaw angles are adjusted towards the main flow direction for maximum power extraction as a result the planned tidal farm will be consisting of a total number of 115 turbines as marked in fig 13 here the t s e values are configured as 0 with water depth below 47 m it is worth noting that the tidal farm design is not the focus of this work and many other engineering elements in planning a tidal farm are not considered such as the technical maturity of tidal turbines supporting platforms o m accessibility and grid connection 3 2 flow turbine interaction modelling in order to characterize the tidal farm induced flow field impact the tidal turbines are numerically coupled into the established 3 d flow field model relevant theory and modelling process are presented below when tidal currents passing through the turbine part of the kinetic energy within the incoming flow is captured and eventually converted into electrical energy based on the blade element momentum bem theory vogel et al 2018 burton et al 2011 the swept area of a horizontal turbine s rotor can be seen as an ideal plate and the incoming flow does not change directions while flowing through the rotor so that complex influences induced by a running turbine on the flow field can be simplified as a drag force f on the incoming flow based on bem the flow momentum change caused by a horizontal turbine can be described as an actuator disk model as portrayed in fig 14 and the drag force will be 12 f 1 2 a t ρ c t v in 2 where a t is rotor swept area v in represents incoming flow velocity c t stands for the axial force coefficient generally there are mainly two approaches that can couple the drag force f into the numerical hydrodynamic model to simulate flow turbine interactions the first one is by modifying the bottom friction coefficient of the model yang et al 2013 but it is not applicable in 3 d models second one is to incorporate momentum source terms into the flow field model sanchez et al 2014 which is valid for both 2 d and 3 d models it has been widely adopted in roms brown et al 2017 fvcom murray and gallego 2017 and delft3d baston et al 2015 waldman et al 2017 codes as well and its effectiveness has been verified by tank experiments mungar 2014 and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations masters et al 2015 therefore we use the latter approach by injecting momentum source terms to model the flow turbine interactions in a 3 d domain and the introduction of source terms is implemented in this work by tuning the coefficients of the so called porous plate structures in delft3d deltares 2013 a porous plate is able to apply a reactive drag force on the flow with the energy loss coefficient c l o s s porous plates can be only laid along the grid axes or 45 to them in order to adjust turbine yaw angle towards arbitrary main flow direction two porous plates are created for the grid containing tidal current turbines with the coefficients c l o s s u and c l o s s v as shown in fig 15 here u and v are the flow velocity components along x and y axes here c l o s s u can be written as waldman et al 2015 13 c l o s s u 2 γ u 1 1 γ u 2 where γ u represents the proportion of the momentum sinks through the cell along u direction that γ u c t a u δ y δ z n a u is the total swept area of rotor in the cell flowing along u direction that a u a t cos θ c t is the tidal turbine axial force coefficient which is assumed to remain constant at c t 0 8 bahaj et al 2007 θ is the angle between x and turbine axis δ y is the distance between grid points along the y direction δ z is the height of a sigma layer n is the number of layers occupied by the turbine similarly c l o s s v is in the same form then eq 3 can be rewritten as 14 d u d t f v g ζ x g ρ 0 d ζ ρ x d z v h 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v v 2 u z 2 m x d v d t f u g ζ y g ρ 0 d ζ ρ y d z v h 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 v v 2 v z 2 m y where m x and m y respectively are the source terms per unit area along the x and y directions of the computational grid which are given by 15 m x c l o s s u u 2 δ x f x m m y c l o s s v v 2 δ y f y m where f x and f y are the components of drag force f along x and y axes and m is the flow mass of the grids occupied by the tidal turbine that m ρ n δ x δ y δ z then the flow field with an operational tidal farm can be predicted with the above numerical method note that the flow field impacts from the auxiliary and supporting components such as foundations or platforms are neglected in the numerical study 3 3 flow field impact analysis this section evaluates the flow field impacts brought by the designed tidal farm based on the above established 3 d model numerical simulations have been performed with the results shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the tidal farm is able to yield noticeable impacts on the flow field of putuo hulu channel at different water depths during flood and ebb tides detailed analysis on flow velocity water depth and seabed shear stress variations are presented below 3 3 1 flow velocity in order to better evaluate how much the flow velocities are affected within this channel the distributions of velocity variations at two specific moments during flood and ebb tides are calculated and plotted in fig 17 1 it can be noticed that the current velocities are generally decreased within the tidal farm wake zone and the maximum flow reduction could be over 0 5 m s for certain areas particularly more reductions are seen in the east part during flood while it is the west during ebb tide 2 additionally the blocking effect produced by the tidal turbines will accelerate the flow in areas between the tidal farm and nearby islands for instance the west of hulu island during flood putuo island east coast and hulu island north coast during ebb tide an increment of 0 4 m s could be reached posting the risk of coastal erosion 3 for each water layer the speed variation distribution is quite similar but it is a bit different in magnitude indicated by the colour darkness in fig 17 the middle layer with over 30 variations is more influenced by the operational turbines than top and bottom layers for the time domain analysis fig 18 plots the current velocity variation time series at the four chosen sites as marked in fig 10 for three depth layers in a 15 day tidal periodicity these curves have confirmed again that the flow velocity in the middle layer is mostly influenced additionally the current velocity is generally decreased within the tidal farm wake zone where the four sites are located however the velocity on the spot of north west entrance is somehow a bit elevated as shown in fig 18 a particularly for flood tide this is probably due to the tidal turbines on the north entrance are densely installed such that a blocking effect is produced therefore more flow is redirected to the north west entrance so that the tidal current speed there is even accelerated for the other three sites positive spikes can still be observed as seen in fig 18 b d label velnorth label velsouthern meaning that there are velocity increment at certain time periods different from the flow re direction for north west entrance this is mainly due to a phase shift effect caused by the tidal turbine array as depicted in the zoom in figure of fig 19 where the time shift may reach 0 5 h this phenomenon should be further studied as it may alter the local tidal current periodical characteristics within the water channel 3 3 2 water level same type of analysis is performed to evaluate the tidal farm induced impacts on water level of nearby waters the water variation during flood and ebb tides is shown in fig 20 notice that the tidal farm will influence the water level in a large area of surrounding waters but the impact is only within 3 0 cm the highly affected area is mainly concentrated in the middle part of this channel and the water level is much less influenced in further areas for the coastline of nearby islands the water level influence due to the tidal farm is less than 1 0 cm the time domain water level comparison for the above mentioned four sites is shown in fig 21 it can be observed that there is little water level change and the maximum difference is less than 2 0 cm in general the water level is elevated a bit due to the operational tidal farm for instance on the middle and south observation spots as shown in fig 21 c 21 d and the average water level elevation over there is about 0 1 0 2 cm for the north part as shown in fig 21 a 21 b the water level is lifted in ebb tide compared with no farm case but it declines in the flood in addition different from the tidal current velocity change no obvious time shift for the water level variation caused by the assumed tidal farm is observed 3 3 3 seabed shear stress the variation of seabed shear stress is also calculated to assess the potential influences regarding sediment deposition and erosion as shown in fig 22 the shear stress values are noticeably decreased within the tidal farm wake zone a drop ratio of 65 can be reached on the north entrance and middle part during flood while the southern area has similar bottom shear stress decline during ebb tide the possible sediment depositions in these areas need to be well taken care of in the tidal farm design process additionally the seabed shear stress has drastic changes along the island coasts for instance there could be an increase of 100 for the putuo island north east coast and hulu island north and east coasts meaning these areas will have higher risk of coastal erosion further the bottom shear stress changes for adjacent waters are also calculated as colored in fig 23 unexpectedly an increase of 30 is observed for the zhoushan island east coastline and baishagang island north east coast this means the tidal farm induced flow field impact may spread to further surrounding areas which need to be taken into account in planning the tidal farm 4 conclusions in this study the flow field impact caused by an assumed operational tidal farm is assessed for the putuo hulu channel first a two month adcp campaign has been carried out to evaluate tidal characteristics of this water channel and a 3 d hydrodynamic model is established with delft3d based on shallow water equations and validated by the in situ measurement data based on the 3 d hydrodynamic model the flow filed characteristics in this channel are analysed and evaluated with the augmented t s e index it is shown the tidal current resources in the putuo hulu channel are mainly concentrated on the west side and north west entrance where the peak velocity is close to 2 5 m s second a tidal farm with 115 tidal current turbines is preliminarily planned in this channel and the induced flow field impacts are evaluated the dynamic flow turbine interaction is numerically coupled into the established model based on the bem based actuator disk theory following flow field impacts from the assumed tidal farm can be observed from the obtained numerical results 1 the current velocities within the tidal farm wake zone are generally decreased due to the operational tidal turbines and the maximum flow reduction could be over 0 5 m s for certain areas velocity increment as high as 0 3 m s can also be observed for certain periods of time which is mainly due to the phase shift effect caused by the tidal farm where the shifting time could reach 0 5 h besides the seabed shear stress could be dropped by over 65 within the tidal farm wake zone the possible sediment depositions in these areas need to be well taken care of in the tidal farm design process 2 current flows are generally accelerated in coastal areas between the tidal farm and nearby islands which is mainly due to the tidal farm blocking effect the maximum velocity increment could reach 0 6 m s and the seabed shear stress sees over 100 increase meaning these areas will have higher risk of coastal erosion with the tidal farm installed besides the influence of seabed shear stress could be spread to further areas such as zhoushan island east coast and baishanggang island north east coast which also needs to be taken into account in planning the tidal farm 3 in terms of water level it is generally elevated in the channel area due to the assumed operational tidal farm and the water level difference compared with the reference is within 3 0 cm in addition the highly influenced area is mainly concentrated in the middle of the channel while it is much less affected for further areas for the coastline of nearby islands the water level variation due to the assumed tidal farm is less than 1 0 cm in summary the assumed large scale tidal farm will affect the channel flow field characteristics regarding current speed water level and shear stress as well and may further change the hydrodynamic environment of nearby waters therefore it is necessary to consider the environment tolerability before constructing a large scale tidal farm in this channel acknowledgment the study is supported by the national natural science

21807,waters surrounding zhoushan archipelago have the most abundant tidal current energy in china which makes it a promising site for tidal farm construction in the future before deploying tidal current turbines the potential environmental impacts on surrounding waters must be evaluated in this work we focus on the flow field impact assessment of an assumed tidal farm installed in zhoushan putuo hulu channel first in order to evaluate the tidal characteristics there a 2 month adcp campaign is carried out and a 3 d hydrodynamic model is established and validated with the in situ measurements additionally tidal current velocity and water depth as well as flow heading asymmetry information are used to evaluate the tidal stream exploitability within this channel second a tidal farm consisting of 115 turbines is planned and assumed to be deployed throughout this channel blade element momentum method is used to numerically characterize the flow turbine interactions and then the spatial temporal flow field variations caused by the assumed tidal farm are evaluated it can be seen from the results that the peak flow speed reduction produced by the tidal farm could be over 0 5 m s within the wake zones while the flow velocity increment along two islands could reach 0 6 m s in particular a flow speed phase shift phenomenon can be observed besides the water level experiences a small overall rise and the difference compared with the reference is within 3 0 cm moreover the seabed shear stress within the wake zones could drop by 65 while the areas along the two islands might see over 100 increase indicating the risk of sediment deposition and coastal erosion keywords tidal current energy tidal farm hydrodynamic analysis flow field impact putuo hulu channel zhoushan archipelago 1 introduction with the growing environmental problems caused by fossil fuels such as global warming and air pollution human beings have paid more and more attentions to the development and utilization of clean renewable energies among them tidal current energy has attracted considerable interest from both academia and industry in recent years due to its great potential zhou et al 2017 many countries such as the uk ward et al 2018 adcock and draper 2014 france campbell et al 2017 spain mestres et al 2019 and several others vennell 2012 chong and lam 2013 have conducted extensive research studies and demonstration projects on cost efficiently harvesting tidal energy in particular the european ocean energy center emec has established a large scale marine energy experimental base where various types of tidal turbines have been tested black and veatch consulting 2009 european marine energy centre 2019 although there has been no commercialized tidal farm yet the technology readiness level of tidal current energy harvesting is very close to industrialization compared with europe tidal current energy technology in china has also been rapidly developed liu et al 2017 in recent years many studies have been carried out on assessing and collecting tidal energy from china s coastal waters wu et al 2017a li et al 2012 2018 liu et al 2019 and several different types of tidal current turbines have been developed and tested zhang et al 2014 among different shoreline areas waters around zhoushan archipelago have lots of channels with strong tidal currents and it is regarded as the most promising place to install china s first national tidal farm in the future li et al 2010 qian et al 2019 both numerical study and experimental tests have been conducted to evaluate the tidal current energy potential in zhoushan in 2010 adopted the farm and flux method to evaluate the resource reserves of tidal current energy in the gaoting and guanmen channel wang et al 2010 in 2011 hou et al established a 3 d hydrodynamic model of zhoushan archipelago and its adjacent waters based on the open source code fvcom in 2015 the hydrodynamic environment of zhoushan waters was studied with modified bottom friction coefficients and the flow field impacts from tidal turbines were assessed hou et al 2015 besides gao et al evaluated the tidal current energy development potential in the waters near hulu island based on the mike 21 module gao et al 2015 in 2016 li studied the resource reserves of the major channels in hangzhou bay in comprehensive consideration of technical and economic factors li 2016 at the same time chen performed numerical simulations of tidal currents in zhoushan archipelago and its northern waters based on the adcirc and fvcom models and also optimized the tidal farm layout which is assumed to be installed in these waters chen 2016 xu et al analysed the flow velocity energy intensity and turbulent kinetic energy for several channels in zhoushan waters with the roms model xu et al 2016 in 2017 wu et al used the flux and garret method to analyse the flow field of putuo hulu channel wu et al 2017 besides yu et al established a 2 d hydrodynamic model of the waters near zhoushan and studied the flow field impacts of exploiting tidal current resources by increasing the bottom friction coefficient yu et al 2017 recently the authors in zhang et al 2018 2020 used an open source code tidal farm to optimize the layout of tidal turbines for energy output improvement the aforementioned works mainly focus on tidal current resource assessment of the waters in zhoushan archipelago and also lots of attentions are drawn to tidal farm layout optimization however little scientific investigation has been conducted on corresponding environmental impacts brought by tidal farms in zhoushan area in fact the installed offshore renewable energy devices for instance wind farms chang and jeng 2014 qian et al 2018 wave energy converters o dea et al 2018 contardo et al 2018 and tidal current turbines haverson et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 will produce considerable impacts on the surrounding environment such as flow field sediment and ecosystem these influences need to be well evaluated before approving an offshore engineering project nash and phoenix 2017 therefore it is important to perform an environmental impact assessment before developing a tidal farm project in this regard this study mainly aims to evaluate the environmental impact caused by a tidal farm assumed to be installed in the putuo hulu channel in zhoushan particularly we focus on the tidal farm induced flow field influence first a 2 month adcp campaign is carried out to measure the tidal current in this channel and a 3 d hydrodynamic model of zhoushan archipelago and its adjacent waters is established based on delft3d and further validated with the continuous in situ measured data the tidal characteristics and resource distribution are then assessed based on tidal stream exploitability evaluation second a tidal farm consisting of 115 turbines with 30 m diameter rotor is preliminarily planned and assumed to be installed in the channel the turbine flow interaction has also been coupled into the 3 d numerical hydrodynamic model so that the flow field impact analysis can be performed the tempo spatial variations of flow velocity water level and seabed shear stress etc caused by the operational tidal farm are then evaluated and analysed which should be taken into consideration in future tidal farm development the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 performs the tidal characteristics analysis of putuo hulu channel based on both experimental and numerical methods section 3 describes the tidal farm design process and how it is coupled into the hydrodynamic model then the detailed tempo spatial flow field impact analysis is presented at last we draw the conclusions 2 putuo hulu channel flow field analysis 2 1 putuo hulu channel zhoushan archipelago as shown in fig 1 off the east coast of zhejiang province has the largest number of islands more than a thousand in china accounting for about 20 of the total amount the waters around these islands have abundant tidal current energy which is more than half of the nationwide tidal current resources li et al 2010 in this work the putuo hulu channel in zhoushan area as starred in fig 1 is selected as the study object as its name implies this channel is located between putuo island and hulu island which is about 7 km east to the zhoushan main island the peak flow velocity within this channel was estimated to be over 2 m s luo and xia 2017 although its tidal current resource is believed not as abundant as several other channels in zhoushan archipelago for instance the guishan channel the tidal current energy there is still considerable and no major restrictions for tidal current energy development are found there as well such as shipping and fishery in fact the national tidal current energy testing site ntced in china has been located in putuo hulu channel and several demonstration and testing projects are currently ongoing there which makes in a promising site for future tidal farm development in china zheng et al 2015 prior to this study bathymetric survey of this channel with 10 m resolution has been conducted as shown in fig 2 it can be noticed from this map that north entrance of the channel is divided into two parts by a reef and the water depth is relatively shallow on the west side sometimes less than 30 m with an area of 1 0 km width while it is much deeper on the east side more than 40 m with an area of about 1 3 km width besides in the middle part the underwater terrain is quite complex where the water depth is usually more than 40 m and the deepest location even exceeds 80 m in addition there is a salient in this channel that the water depth comes to below 30 m in the south the water depth usually exceeds 40 m with a relatively flat subsea terrain 2 2 adcp campaign in 2018 zhejiang university conducted a 2 month tidal current in situ measurement campaign at this channel as shown in fig 3 a nortek awac 600 khz adcp was deployed with the gps coordinates of 30 2 207 n 122 24 435 e and it was mounted on the seabed at a water depth of 37 m in the adcp settings 40 cells are used with 1 m vertical bin size and 30 pings with 1hz sampling rate are averaged every 5 min as the output detailed information for this adcp campaign can be found in table 1 the tidal current roses at six different water depths are shown in fig 4 in post processing the data for the upper 4 cells above water surface are excluded as they are invalid the measurements of the remaining 36 vertical cells are divided into three water layers i e bottom middle and surface the tidal current velocity time series of the last 28 days in the three layers are plotted in fig 5 it is found that the maximum ebb tide flow velocity appears on march 20 in surface layer which is 2 36 m s with the 157 flow direction while the maximum flood tide flow velocity is on april 1 in surface layer reaching 2 55 m s with 335 flow direction 2 3 3 d numerical modelling besides in situ measurement a 3 d numerical model is established in this work to better understand the flow field behaviors of putuo hulu channel 2 3 1 theory shallow water equations swe are used in hydrodynamic modelling process based on swe and boussinesq assumptions this finite difference code solves the baroclinic navier stokes equation which can be used in either 2 d or 3 d occasions the governing equations of this model consist of three sets of equations which are list as follows mass conservation equation 1 ζ t d ζ u x d ζ v y q transport equation 2 ζ d c t ζ d u c x ζ d v c y d h 2 c λ d d ζ c r momentum conservation equation 3 u t u u x v u y f v g ζ x g ρ 0 d ζ ρ x d z τ s x τ b x ρ 0 d ζ v h 2 u u t u u x v u y f u g ζ y g ρ 0 d ζ ρ y d z τ s y τ b y ρ 0 d ζ v h 2 v where ζ is the water level d is the water depth relative to a reference plane u and v are the velocity vectors along x and y directions respectively q is the intensity of mass sources per unit area f is the coriolis parameter v h is the kinematic horizontal eddy viscosity ρ 0 is the reference density ρ is the anomaly density τ s x and τ s y are the components of the wind stress acting on the sea surface τ b x and τ b y are the components of shear stress at the bottom c is the salinity or temperature d h is the horizontal eddy diffusivity λ d is the first order decay process r is the source term per unit area g is the gravitational coefficient 2 3 2 modelling the delft3d platform deltares 2013 originally developed by deltares is adopted to construct the hydrodynamic model this model adopts orthogonal curvilinear grid with the sigma coordinate along the vertical direction and the domain decomposition approach is used to build the computational grid in the model in order to deal with the large number of islands and complex bathymetry in the target waters as shown in fig 6 a grids with different colors represent distinct computational domains instead of one way transmission grid nodes transfer data bidirectionally through linear interpolation at the boundary between adjacent computational domains the grid is nested for three times with the grid resolution refined five times in each nesting the resolution in the most refined area i e around the putuo hulu channel has reached 30 30 m as shown in fig 6 b and this grid resolution is able to well simulate the flow turbine interaction in addition this grid is sliced into 10 sigma layers along vertical depth and the vertical eddy viscosity is computed with k ε turbulence model the thickness of each layer is 10 of the local water depth which is enough to reflect the vertical spatial distribution of the flow field next by using the bathymetric map in fig 2 a topographic model of the waters near zhoushan is built with the delft3d quickin module negative water depth 5 0 m is used for the land part in this model the open boundary conditions are set at the edges of the peripheral grids with the inputs of 11 major astronomical tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 m4 m6 ms4 1 1 https www tpxo net global the land boundaries are null flow and free slip with zero shear stress in addition the wind stress exerted on the free surface is not considered while the seabed shear stress at the bottom boundary is computed according to the quadratic stress law 4 τ b g ρ 0 u b u b c 3 d 2 where u b is the horizontal velocity in the bottom layer and c 3 d is the 3d chézy coefficient calculated from 5 c 3 d c 2 d g κ ln δ z b 2 h where δ z b represents the vertical distance from the seabed to the nearest computational grid point κ stands for the von karman constant κ 0 41 and h is the overall water depth c 2 d is the 2 d chézy coefficient where the spatially uniform value c 2 d 65 m½ s is used in the simulation besides the calculation time step is set as 0 25 min which satisfies the courant condition to ensure computational stability and the simulation using barotropic mode covers a period of 32 days including a spin up time of 2 days 2 3 3 validation tide table and tidal current observations are used to validate the effectiveness of the established 3 d hydrodynamic model for the flow field of putuo hulu channel water level as spotted in fig 1 the water level data from the tide tables of three nearby observing stations national marine data and information service 2018 i e daishan shenjiamen and xize are used to evaluate the accuracy of the established model linear regression test is performed against these data and the results are shown in fig 7 two statistical indices are used to indicate the modelling accuracy i e root mean square error r m s e and correlation coefficient r which are given by 6 r m s e 1 n n 1 n s n m n 2 7 r 1 n n 1 n s n s n m n m n σ s σ m where n is the number of samples n is the data sequence number s n represents the simulation result m n is the measured data σ s and σ m denote the standard deviations of the numerical results and the tide tables respectively it can be seen that the simulation results of this model agree well with the tide tables where the correlation coefficients are all above 0 98 also notice there is a slight prediction deviation on the occasions of low tide this may be due to the influence of large number of islands and complex topography around the validation sites which makes it difficult to accurately reproduce the actual water level with the corresponding grid resolution tidal current the simulation results of flow velocity and direction are compared with the adcp measurements the validation results for the surface middle and bottom layers are shown in fig 8 good agreement can also be found both regarding flow velocity and direction however there are still minor differences for the peak velocities in the surface layer which may be due to the model uncertainties on free surfaces such as effects from wind and waves in addition it should be noted that due to lack of detailed information of the seabed friction coefficient in the channel the uniform chézy friction coefficient is used in the simulation so that the model accuracy in the bottom layer is slightly lower than that in the middle layer overall despite there are small deviations the established model achieves good accuracy which is sufficient to predict the distribution of tidal currents in the putuo hulu channel 2 4 flow field analysis 2 4 1 tidal characteristics based on the above established model the flow field of the target water area can be predicated results about the velocity distribution estimations during flood and ebb tides are shown in fig 9 respectively it can be seen that the areas with high speed current are mainly located on the west side and the peak velocity is close to 2 5 m s at the north west entrance of the channel besides it can be noticed the current velocity could also exceed 2 m s on the southwest side of hulu island in general no significant difference can be observed in comparison with the existing research works on flow field prediction of this channel although different numerical models are used gao et al 2015 luo and xia 2017 wu et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 the 3 d flow field characteristics at four representative locations are investigated for the north west entrance in fig 10 a notice that there is an area with sharp water depth decrease producing a blocking effect that will accelerate the tidal current velocity and lead to flow speed asymmetry during flood and ebb tides the peak velocity during flood tide is significantly higher than that during ebb which could exceed 2 3 m s regarding flow direction flood and ebb tides are approximately towards 300 and 120 respectively with good symmetry in addition due to the steep slope bathymetry there is a slight change in the flow direction along the vertical profile for the north entrance simulation result in fig 10 b good symmetry for both flow velocity and direction can be observed as the seabed is relatively flat there the peak flow velocity around 1 5 m s is slightly lower than that of north west entrance and flood and ebb flow directions are 345 and 165 respectively besides there is almost no flow direction change at different water depth in the middle of the channel in fig 10 c the symmetry and stability of flow velocity are poor during both flood and ebb because of the salient as mentioned above besides the peak flood flow velocity exceeds 1 6 m s which is stronger than that in ebb the peak velocity in the middle is also slightly higher than that on the north entrance for the site in the southern part as shown in fig 10 d the flow direction is similar to that of the middle but the flow velocity and direction symmetry is much better 2 4 2 resource distribution further this work adopts the tidal stream exploitability t s e method to investigate the tidal current resource distribution and evaluate the development potential within this water channel this approach combines the tidal current velocity and water depth information to identify areas with good development potential the t s e index is given as 8 t s e ξ 2 v 0 3 h 0 v f 3 v e 3 h where v 0 and h 0 are the characteristic velocity and depth respectively here v 0 1 4 m s and h 0 50 m are seen as the reference assume t s e 2 it means the exploitable amount of energy at one location is twice of that with v 0 and h 0 in addition v f and v e are the depth averaged velocities at mid flood and mid ebb respectively h is the water depth ξ is the penalty function which is given as 9 ξ 0 if h δ h 2 h 1 ξ 1 h 2 h 1 h δ h 2 h 1 if h 1 h δ h 2 h 2 ξ 1 if h δ h 2 h 2 where δ h is the maximum tidal range h 1 and h 2 are the maximum upper and lower limits of the water depth compensation for turbine installation which are 2 m and 5 m respectively note that due to the aforementioned flow direction asymmetries the influences of turbine yaw misalignment on energy extraction should also be taken into account therefore we further incorporate the yaw misalignment effect into the t s e index define the average yaw misalignment angle γ as 10 γ θ f θ e 180 2 where θ f and θ e are the main flow directions for mid flood and mid ebb respectively then the augmented t s e index can be rewritten as 11 t s e ξ 2 v 0 3 h 0 v f 3 v e 3 h cos 3 γ with the bathymetric information in fig 2 and the estimated flow velocity distribution in fig 9 during mid flood and mid ebb the t s e index for this channel area can be calculated as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that t s e has large values along the west side of this channel and the north west entrance implying these locations are more suitable for developing tidal current energy while t s e is relatively lower on the east and south sides besides it can be noticed that several other potential areas with high flow velocities for instance the south east part close to hulu island as shown in fig 9 a are with low t s e index values this is due to the small water depth there preventing it from large tidal current turbine installation 3 flow field impact assessment of a tidal farm in this section a tidal farm is assumed to be installed in the putuo hulu channel and the flow field impact caused by the tidal turbine array is evaluated 3 1 tidal farm design the obtained t s e scores are indicating favourable places for tidal current energy development by also considering the water depth and turbine spacing restrictions we preliminary design a tidal farm in this water channel as follows the horizontal axis tidal turbine is used in this study to form the tidal farm for its relatively high efficiency and stability according to emec guidelines black and veatch consulting 2009 large rotor size is suggested to provide more favourable economics which is based on the same principle of rapidly growing rotor size for offshore wind turbines since the water depth within the resource area of putuo hulu channel is mostly 40 90 m the 3 blade horizontal axis tidal current turbine with 30 m rotor diameter is used in this work to form the assumed tidal farm the large rotor is also supposed to build up an extreme but technical sensible condition for flow field impact analysis which is also the study object this work moreover a 5 m top clearance and 25 water depth as the bottom clearance are recommended in the emec s report black and veatch consulting 2009 so that the minimum water depth for tidal current turbine installation is set as 47 m for each turbine the nacelle is supposed to be located in the middle water depth in order to minimize the disturbances from both the seabed and water surface besides according to the tidal farm layout requirement in chen et al 2015 the lateral spacing is set as twice the rotor diameter while the longitudinal spacing is ten times as shown in fig 12 additionally a staggered arrangement is used in the farm layout in order to reduce the wake effect zhang et al 2020 also note that the turbine yaw angles are adjusted towards the main flow direction for maximum power extraction as a result the planned tidal farm will be consisting of a total number of 115 turbines as marked in fig 13 here the t s e values are configured as 0 with water depth below 47 m it is worth noting that the tidal farm design is not the focus of this work and many other engineering elements in planning a tidal farm are not considered such as the technical maturity of tidal turbines supporting platforms o m accessibility and grid connection 3 2 flow turbine interaction modelling in order to characterize the tidal farm induced flow field impact the tidal turbines are numerically coupled into the established 3 d flow field model relevant theory and modelling process are presented below when tidal currents passing through the turbine part of the kinetic energy within the incoming flow is captured and eventually converted into electrical energy based on the blade element momentum bem theory vogel et al 2018 burton et al 2011 the swept area of a horizontal turbine s rotor can be seen as an ideal plate and the incoming flow does not change directions while flowing through the rotor so that complex influences induced by a running turbine on the flow field can be simplified as a drag force f on the incoming flow based on bem the flow momentum change caused by a horizontal turbine can be described as an actuator disk model as portrayed in fig 14 and the drag force will be 12 f 1 2 a t ρ c t v in 2 where a t is rotor swept area v in represents incoming flow velocity c t stands for the axial force coefficient generally there are mainly two approaches that can couple the drag force f into the numerical hydrodynamic model to simulate flow turbine interactions the first one is by modifying the bottom friction coefficient of the model yang et al 2013 but it is not applicable in 3 d models second one is to incorporate momentum source terms into the flow field model sanchez et al 2014 which is valid for both 2 d and 3 d models it has been widely adopted in roms brown et al 2017 fvcom murray and gallego 2017 and delft3d baston et al 2015 waldman et al 2017 codes as well and its effectiveness has been verified by tank experiments mungar 2014 and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations masters et al 2015 therefore we use the latter approach by injecting momentum source terms to model the flow turbine interactions in a 3 d domain and the introduction of source terms is implemented in this work by tuning the coefficients of the so called porous plate structures in delft3d deltares 2013 a porous plate is able to apply a reactive drag force on the flow with the energy loss coefficient c l o s s porous plates can be only laid along the grid axes or 45 to them in order to adjust turbine yaw angle towards arbitrary main flow direction two porous plates are created for the grid containing tidal current turbines with the coefficients c l o s s u and c l o s s v as shown in fig 15 here u and v are the flow velocity components along x and y axes here c l o s s u can be written as waldman et al 2015 13 c l o s s u 2 γ u 1 1 γ u 2 where γ u represents the proportion of the momentum sinks through the cell along u direction that γ u c t a u δ y δ z n a u is the total swept area of rotor in the cell flowing along u direction that a u a t cos θ c t is the tidal turbine axial force coefficient which is assumed to remain constant at c t 0 8 bahaj et al 2007 θ is the angle between x and turbine axis δ y is the distance between grid points along the y direction δ z is the height of a sigma layer n is the number of layers occupied by the turbine similarly c l o s s v is in the same form then eq 3 can be rewritten as 14 d u d t f v g ζ x g ρ 0 d ζ ρ x d z v h 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v v 2 u z 2 m x d v d t f u g ζ y g ρ 0 d ζ ρ y d z v h 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 v v 2 v z 2 m y where m x and m y respectively are the source terms per unit area along the x and y directions of the computational grid which are given by 15 m x c l o s s u u 2 δ x f x m m y c l o s s v v 2 δ y f y m where f x and f y are the components of drag force f along x and y axes and m is the flow mass of the grids occupied by the tidal turbine that m ρ n δ x δ y δ z then the flow field with an operational tidal farm can be predicted with the above numerical method note that the flow field impacts from the auxiliary and supporting components such as foundations or platforms are neglected in the numerical study 3 3 flow field impact analysis this section evaluates the flow field impacts brought by the designed tidal farm based on the above established 3 d model numerical simulations have been performed with the results shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the tidal farm is able to yield noticeable impacts on the flow field of putuo hulu channel at different water depths during flood and ebb tides detailed analysis on flow velocity water depth and seabed shear stress variations are presented below 3 3 1 flow velocity in order to better evaluate how much the flow velocities are affected within this channel the distributions of velocity variations at two specific moments during flood and ebb tides are calculated and plotted in fig 17 1 it can be noticed that the current velocities are generally decreased within the tidal farm wake zone and the maximum flow reduction could be over 0 5 m s for certain areas particularly more reductions are seen in the east part during flood while it is the west during ebb tide 2 additionally the blocking effect produced by the tidal turbines will accelerate the flow in areas between the tidal farm and nearby islands for instance the west of hulu island during flood putuo island east coast and hulu island north coast during ebb tide an increment of 0 4 m s could be reached posting the risk of coastal erosion 3 for each water layer the speed variation distribution is quite similar but it is a bit different in magnitude indicated by the colour darkness in fig 17 the middle layer with over 30 variations is more influenced by the operational turbines than top and bottom layers for the time domain analysis fig 18 plots the current velocity variation time series at the four chosen sites as marked in fig 10 for three depth layers in a 15 day tidal periodicity these curves have confirmed again that the flow velocity in the middle layer is mostly influenced additionally the current velocity is generally decreased within the tidal farm wake zone where the four sites are located however the velocity on the spot of north west entrance is somehow a bit elevated as shown in fig 18 a particularly for flood tide this is probably due to the tidal turbines on the north entrance are densely installed such that a blocking effect is produced therefore more flow is redirected to the north west entrance so that the tidal current speed there is even accelerated for the other three sites positive spikes can still be observed as seen in fig 18 b d label velnorth label velsouthern meaning that there are velocity increment at certain time periods different from the flow re direction for north west entrance this is mainly due to a phase shift effect caused by the tidal turbine array as depicted in the zoom in figure of fig 19 where the time shift may reach 0 5 h this phenomenon should be further studied as it may alter the local tidal current periodical characteristics within the water channel 3 3 2 water level same type of analysis is performed to evaluate the tidal farm induced impacts on water level of nearby waters the water variation during flood and ebb tides is shown in fig 20 notice that the tidal farm will influence the water level in a large area of surrounding waters but the impact is only within 3 0 cm the highly affected area is mainly concentrated in the middle part of this channel and the water level is much less influenced in further areas for the coastline of nearby islands the water level influence due to the tidal farm is less than 1 0 cm the time domain water level comparison for the above mentioned four sites is shown in fig 21 it can be observed that there is little water level change and the maximum difference is less than 2 0 cm in general the water level is elevated a bit due to the operational tidal farm for instance on the middle and south observation spots as shown in fig 21 c 21 d and the average water level elevation over there is about 0 1 0 2 cm for the north part as shown in fig 21 a 21 b the water level is lifted in ebb tide compared with no farm case but it declines in the flood in addition different from the tidal current velocity change no obvious time shift for the water level variation caused by the assumed tidal farm is observed 3 3 3 seabed shear stress the variation of seabed shear stress is also calculated to assess the potential influences regarding sediment deposition and erosion as shown in fig 22 the shear stress values are noticeably decreased within the tidal farm wake zone a drop ratio of 65 can be reached on the north entrance and middle part during flood while the southern area has similar bottom shear stress decline during ebb tide the possible sediment depositions in these areas need to be well taken care of in the tidal farm design process additionally the seabed shear stress has drastic changes along the island coasts for instance there could be an increase of 100 for the putuo island north east coast and hulu island north and east coasts meaning these areas will have higher risk of coastal erosion further the bottom shear stress changes for adjacent waters are also calculated as colored in fig 23 unexpectedly an increase of 30 is observed for the zhoushan island east coastline and baishagang island north east coast this means the tidal farm induced flow field impact may spread to further surrounding areas which need to be taken into account in planning the tidal farm 4 conclusions in this study the flow field impact caused by an assumed operational tidal farm is assessed for the putuo hulu channel first a two month adcp campaign has been carried out to evaluate tidal characteristics of this water channel and a 3 d hydrodynamic model is established with delft3d based on shallow water equations and validated by the in situ measurement data based on the 3 d hydrodynamic model the flow filed characteristics in this channel are analysed and evaluated with the augmented t s e index it is shown the tidal current resources in the putuo hulu channel are mainly concentrated on the west side and north west entrance where the peak velocity is close to 2 5 m s second a tidal farm with 115 tidal current turbines is preliminarily planned in this channel and the induced flow field impacts are evaluated the dynamic flow turbine interaction is numerically coupled into the established model based on the bem based actuator disk theory following flow field impacts from the assumed tidal farm can be observed from the obtained numerical results 1 the current velocities within the tidal farm wake zone are generally decreased due to the operational tidal turbines and the maximum flow reduction could be over 0 5 m s for certain areas velocity increment as high as 0 3 m s can also be observed for certain periods of time which is mainly due to the phase shift effect caused by the tidal farm where the shifting time could reach 0 5 h besides the seabed shear stress could be dropped by over 65 within the tidal farm wake zone the possible sediment depositions in these areas need to be well taken care of in the tidal farm design process 2 current flows are generally accelerated in coastal areas between the tidal farm and nearby islands which is mainly due to the tidal farm blocking effect the maximum velocity increment could reach 0 6 m s and the seabed shear stress sees over 100 increase meaning these areas will have higher risk of coastal erosion with the tidal farm installed besides the influence of seabed shear stress could be spread to further areas such as zhoushan island east coast and baishanggang island north east coast which also needs to be taken into account in planning the tidal farm 3 in terms of water level it is generally elevated in the channel area due to the assumed operational tidal farm and the water level difference compared with the reference is within 3 0 cm in addition the highly influenced area is mainly concentrated in the middle of the channel while it is much less affected for further areas for the coastline of nearby islands the water level variation due to the assumed tidal farm is less than 1 0 cm in summary the assumed large scale tidal farm will affect the channel flow field characteristics regarding current speed water level and shear stress as well and may further change the hydrodynamic environment of nearby waters therefore it is necessary to consider the environment tolerability before constructing a large scale tidal farm in this channel acknowledgment the study is supported by the national natural science

21808,the performance of an aquatic clean energy harvester aceh under the wake interferences of different arranged stationary cylinders is numerically studied nine wake interferences are generated by varying the transverse distance between the two stationary interfering cylinders sic and the streamwise distance between sic and the energy harvesting cylinder ehc the mass ratio damping and spring stiffness of the aceh are set as 1 6674 2 7274 n s m and 758 11 n m respectively the wake interference can induce the ehc to galloping at some particular positions the maximum values of the output power and the conversion efficiency of the aceh were 0 82 w and respectively besides even when the sic does not induce galloping on ehc the output power and the conversion efficiency of the aceh are higher than those of the single cylinder the performance of the wake interference is beneficial to energy harve 10 13 sting as the distance between the sic and the ehc increases the wake interference of the sic gets weaker and the energy harvesting performance of the aceh reduces gradually finally the influence is comprehensively divided into three different regions promotion region disturbed region and weak region keywords vortex induced vibration wake interference energy harvesting galloping 1 introduction renewable and clean sources of energy are being developed and encouraged to be included in the energy mix on local and national levels around the globe wang et al 2020 fang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 huang et al 2019 no doubt energy is the driving force of social development tang et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2019a fang et al 2019 although the ocean and wind are inundated with energy it is not easy to extract energy from them because of the insufficient development of technology in the ocean current and tide are the main forms of existence of energy zou et al 2019a wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a ding et al 2020a chen et al 2020 as the knowledge of flow induced vibration fiv phenomena deepens researchers have been gradually trying to develop the energy harvester that can extract hydrokinetic energy from the ocean ding et al 2019 wang et al 2018a ma et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the main forms of the fiv are vortex induced vibration viv and galloping flutter and wake galloping while viv is the most common vibration phenomenon the limitation of viv is that it can produce large amplitude in a small velocity range only zhu et al 2020 which is unfavorable for energy harvesting on the other hand galloping can only be induced and maintained with a higher amplitude at a higher current velocity yang et al 2020 ding et al 2020b yang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 viv is a common fiv phenomenon caused by the periodic force exerting on the bluff body thus the structure shape and position have a significant impact on the vibration characteristics indeed the amplitude plays a vital role in promoting the output power of the flow induced energy harvester for the sake of making a bluff body to have a higher amplitude over a wider range of current velocity researchers have carried out experimental theoretical and simulation studies one of the major research issues is to optimize the bluff body surface structure and promote the vibration response under the inspiration of biomimetic thought hee chang and sang joon 2004 allen and smits 2001 cha et al 2013 proposed a biomimetic energy harvester installed at the tail of a fish model the theoretical model was given to predict the energy harvester performance proving that the theoretical results are consistent with the experimental results from an underwater experiment besides the width of the lock in range directly determines the velocity range of extracting energy from current jin et al 2019 added some bulges or pits on the bare cylinder and designed a wind tunnel experiment to study the output voltage and the output power of the biomimetic energy harvester experimental results showed that the bulges could improve the output power and the effective working wind velocity to 1 21 mw and 1 8 m s respectively adding accessories to the bluff body can increase the amplitude and the effective working velocity range hu et al 2019 experimentally examined the efficiency of an energy harvester where two rods were fixed on the energy harvesting circular cylinder the rods were prisms cylinders or cuboids and the positions were varied on periphery of the cylinder the experimental result showed that the highest output voltage and the output power could be achieved when the prism shaped rods were installed on the back of the cylinder at the angle between the rods and the wind current is 60 aiming to enhance the energy conversion capacity of the harvester wang et al 2019b installed a y shaped accessory on a cylinder which converted viv to galloping the conversion mechanism between the viv and galloping was investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd method the feasibility of the numerical results was experimentally verified the energy harvester translated wind energy to electricity for the wind velocity of 0 5 m s to 2 m s with the output power reaching 1 2 mw at a wind velocity of 2 m s ptc passive turbulence control sticking roughness to the surface of the bare cylinder can also achieve the conversion from viv to galloping kim et al 2013 ding et al 2013 2015 it is conducive to generating more electricity then ding et al 2016 numerically studied the dynamic response of the ptc cylinder in ocean current at high reynolds numbers r e and explored the relationship between the amplitude vibration frequency and current velocity concurrently wang et al 2018 experimentally investigated the conversion of kinetic energy to electricity using ptc under different resistances in a wind tunnel wu et al 2014 in water tunnel experiment examined the impact of the structure size sandpaper and mounting position of sandpaper on the energy harvesting performance the output voltage increased rapidly when a thicker ptc was deployed at higher reduced velocity u the installation location had a major influence on the output power although mounting accessories can effectively improve the capability of the energy harvester the obvious disadvantage is that the structure of the energy harvester becomes more complicated in addition numerous vibration phenomena and dynamic effects are interrelated to the arrangement of the structure as such the interference effect of the series of bluff bodies receives extensive attention hu et al 2019 khalid et al 2016 kim et al 2009 wang et al 2019 gnatowska 2019 ding et al 2013 2015 explored the response of the wake occurring between two ptc cylinders and extended this interactional study to the four ptc cylinders zhou and wang 2018 experimentally and numerically studied the efficiency of the dual serial wind energy translation abdelkefi et al 2013 have examined the simultaneous vibration of two bluff bodies via wind tunnel experiments where the cross section of the bluff body and the distance between the bluff bodies were varied further zhang et al 2017a investigated the phase amplitude and interaction of circular square pentagonal d shaped cylinders hu et al 2019 tested the output voltage of two galloping piezoelectric energy harvesters arranged in tandem under optimal external resistance the experimental data showed that the output voltage of either of the two energy harvesters is much higher than that of a solitary energy harvester at the same wind velocity which proves that the wake interference has a great influence on energy harvesting the application of the wake interference can not only improve the energy harvesting characteristics but also effectively reduce the complexity of the system the natural frequency and stiffness of the cylinder system have considerable impacts on the vibration characteristics placing a cylinder in front of or behind another is not only the case affecting the vibration rather staggered arrangements of cylinders do better sometimes hu et al 2019 for the sake of systematically studying the wake interference on the aceh further three cylinders in a triangular arrangement are chosen as a research unit in this work two of them are stationary and the third one is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction effect of current velocity and interspacing between cylinders on the vibration amplitude and frequency responses and energy harvesting performance outputs power conversion efficiency and power density are numerically explored also the vortex shedding modes of the ehc are analyzed and examined to carry out a visual study of the wake interference while reduced current velocity u normalized based on d and natural frequency varies from 2 to 12 where d is the cylinder diameter the interspacing between the cylinders change from 2d to 4d 2 governing equations 2 1 equations for incompressible fluid flow in this work considering the actual application the fluid water is assumed as incompressible and viscous the current passing a bluff body can be described by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the flow processes follow the conservation of mass and momentum equations 1 u i x i 0 and 2 ρ u i t u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i ρ u i u j x j where u i represents the reynolds stress 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k t δ ij in the above equations t p and ρ indicate time pressure and fluid density respectively simultaneously μ δ ij μ t and k t are the fluid viscosity kronecker delta function turbulent viscosity and kinetic turbulent energy besides x i u i and u i represent the position coordinate velocity components and velocity fluctuation components correspondingly i and j are the directions in cartesian coordinates and u i is time averaged velocity two dimensional urns equations were solved along with sst shear stress transport k ω turbulent model which was developed by mentor menter 1994 the sst k ω model is a rationale for effectively solving the fluid problem with both inner and outflow which is suitable for the fluid structure interaction problem in this work as it is known k ω model is the model of simplicity and a good choice of solving the sublayer on the boundary layer which corresponds to the near wall function solving of the sic and eic by comprising the transformed k ϵ model which is good at solving the freestream independence of the outer part of the boundary layer and introducing a function f1 the governing of the new baseline model can be given as menter 1994 4 d ρ k d t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j 5 d ρ ω d t γ v t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω 2 x j μ σ ω μ t ω x j 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where any constant σ k in the sst k ω model is the superposition of the corresponding constants in the original and the transformed wilcox k ω models menter 1994 therefore the sst k ω model is the combination of the original and the transformed wilcox k ω models the cross diffusion term appeared in the ω equation i e right hand side last term of eq 5 is inherited from the transformed k ω model one advantage of the sst k ω model is that the robustness and the accuracy are increased for the application in the near wall region another advantage is that the shear stress transport effect which is of great importance can be taken into account due to these improvements the sst k ω model has been proved to be of higher reliability in the sst model a transport equation for the turbulent shear stress τ basing on bradshaw s assumption that the shear stress in a boundary layer is proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy k t which is defined as τ ρ a 1 k more detail can be found in menter 1994 since the sst k ω model is readily available in the commercial software ansys fluent and the detailed techniques about the implementation of the sst k ω model are not the focus of this study thus it is not furthermore introduced in this paper 2 2 equations for rigid body motion the energy harvester system is composed of three identical diameter cylinders two of the cylinders are stationary called stationary interference cylinders sics and the last cylinder is vibratory called energy harvesting cylinder ehc as the vibration amplitude of the ehc is much weaker in the streamwise direction x direction than transverse direction y direction the vibration model is simplified as a two dimensional model of single degree of freedom the mass spring damper system of the ehc can be described by a second order linear differential equation as 6 m y 2 ξ ω n y ω n 2 y f y t where m ξ and ω n donate the mass damping ratio and natural frequency rad s of the vibration device respectively ω n 2 π f n w a t e r f y t is lift force exerted on the ehc the y y and y are the acceleration velocity and displacement of the ehc respectively the electricity translated from flow kinetic energy during a vibration period t osc is calculated as zhang et al 2018b 7 p ehc 1 t osc 0 t osc f y t y d t combining eq 7 and eq 6 8 p ehc 1 t osc 0 t osc m y 2 ξ ω n y ω n 2 y y d t to simplify eq 8 and to obtain the mathematical model of the harnessed and dissipated power of the energy harvester the viv and galloping responses of the rigid cylinder are both assumed to be approximately sinusoidal this is a fairly accurate approximation except for the desynchronization viv branch the latter may be overtaken by the galloping range depending on the initial velocity of galloping therefore the displacement of the cylinder can be expressed as 9 y t a sin 2 π f osc t where a represents the vibration amplitude and f osc is the vibration frequency thus the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction is 10 y t 2 π f osc a cos 2 π f osc t basing on eq 10 the nonzero term in eq 8 on the right hand is the velocity term and thus eq 8 can be simplified to 11 p ehc 2 t osc 0 t osc m ξ ω n y 2 d t inserting eq 10 into eq 11 the final expression for the power can be achieved as 12 p ehc 8 π 3 m ξ f n water a 2 f osc 2 the fluid kinetic energy of water flow approaching on the ehc is 13 p water 1 2 ρ u 3 d l 1 2 ρ u 3 d 2 3 the conversion efficiency is 14 η har p ehc p water 2 4 solution methodology the cylinder displacement was calculated by using udf user defined functions compiled by combined programming language for implementing the movement of the ehc in the vertical direction numerical calculations were carried out by using the fourth order runge kutta method it is realized by combining fluent with the udf to solve the displacement and average velocity of the bluff body in each time step then the calculated displacement and average velocity are used as the initial condition for the next calculation while driving the update of the grid the process of solving eq 6 is as follows converting the form of eq 6 the following expression is obtained zhu et

sics and the ehc is calculated by multiple the lateral space between the first group of sics and the next sics and the transverse space between the first ehc and the next one thus the volume can be calculated by lee and bernitsas 2011 zhu et al 2018 22 v d e n s i t y 5 d s d t d l the power density of aceh can be acquired by 23 p d e n s i t y p ehc v d e n s i t y p ehc 5 d s d t d in the present work the define cg motion is used as the motion function to drive the ehc movement in each time step the mass and momentum conservation equations are solved first and then the periodic fluid forces are calculated afterward the new coordinates and velocity of the ehc were obtained by solving the coupled momentum and pressure based continuity equations based on a second order upwind scheme with the spatial discretization method at this point the iteration end and the iteratively calculated velocity and coordinates were used as the initial conditions for the next calculation correspondingly the mesh would also be updated 3 method validation 3 1 physical models fig 1 represents the single freedom of degree model of the energy harvesting system the lateral interspacing between the two stationary is denoted by sd and the streamwise distance between the stationary and vibrating cylinder is represented by td to find an optimal cylinder interspacing corresponding to a maximum energy harvesting nine combinations of sd 2d 3d 4d and td 2d 3d 4d are chosen to explore the vibration characteristics and the energy harvesting performance of the ehc in 2 u 12 1 77 10 4 r e 1 06 10 5 0 2 m s u 1 2 m s the ehc is supported by a linear spring stiffness k and a damping device it is worth mentioning that the reason for using the damping device is equivalent to the kinetic energy losses caused by friction and the internal resistance of the generator the system damping c is introduced into the governing equation furthermore the natural frequency and the damping ratio are expressed by f n warter and ξ respectively the system parametric values and definitions of symbols are listed in table 1 the boundary conditions are chosen as below the inflow boundary condition is set as u u v 0 to represent the free stream a traction free condition u x 0 u x 0 p 0 is used as the outflow boundary to promise the full development of the flow the top and the bottom boundaries are both imposed as a free slip condition with u x 0 v 0 the boundary condition of the sics is also set as a free slip wall besides and differently the outside of the ehc is set as a moving wall which is controlled by the mass damping spring governing equation the initial computation conditions are defined as y t 0 0 y t 0 0 3 2 meshing and iteration time step assessment in this paper structured grids were adopted in numerical calculations widely and the simulation was conducted in a rectangle flow field of the size 35d streamwise distance 20d transverse distance which is illustrated in fig 2 to ensure the simulation is more approaching to the actual application and eliminate the interference of the fluid domain boundary layer the distance between the wall and the center of the ehc is set as 10d the specified shear condition is used the inlet to center of the ehc distance to is set as 10d the distance between the outlet and the center of the ehc is set as 25d to ensure the vortex developed fully meanwhile to avoid the computational divergence caused by the negative grid and advance the mesh update the method of combined using overset mesh and moving mesh was selected overset mesh can be especially useful in cases involving large relative motion between components the overset mesh allows greater control of local mesh characteristics as the geometry moves through the domain because individual mesh zones need not deform to accommodate moving geometry besides as shown in fig 2 a c there are two types of grids which can be defined as foreground mesh and background mesh which correspond to the blue color and red color mesh shown in fig 2 a respectively fig 2 b and c illustrate the detail of the near wall grids of the sic and ehc the two types of grids realize the overset function of current computation the principle of emulating calculation is comprehensively described in fig 3 considering the effect of mesh size and number on simulation period and accuracy the mesh generation method must be verified zhu et al 2018 due to the range of sd and td in the calculation process will be 2d 3d and 4d respectively the case with s d 3 d t d 3 d and u 8 was used to review the influence of grid size grid the parameter y 0 172 δ y d 0 1 ρ u μ 0 9 are identified as 5 8 and 10 zou et al 2019b and the calculation results with three grids were shown in table 2 from table 2 in this work to select a maximum iteration time step on the premise of not affecting the calculation accuracy of the transient simulation the numerical simulations with various iteration time steps of t osc 70 t osc 80 and t osc 90 were carried out at u 8 and the grid number was selected as 284 566 the comparison of the calculation results is shown in fig 4 which shows that the computational responses are in good agreement for different time steps besides in our and some other previous work e g ding et al ding et al 2016 ding et al 2017 zou et al 2019b zhu et al 2018 2020 and ding et al 2019 2020c have employed a similar method to investigate the energy harvesting from flow induced vibrations by both experiments and numerical simulation the numerical results agreed with the experimental well which could prove the feasibility and efficiency of the computational method in this work thus in the present work we conducted the simulation for the energy harvesting frame basing on the same method 4 results and analysis 4 1 amplitude and frequency the amplitude and vibration frequency are the two most critical factors in determining the aceh performance as the wake interference is mainly determined by the size of sd thus the vibration performance can be divided into three segments for the convenience of contrastive analysis named promotion region sd 2d disturbed region sd 3d and weak region sd 4d figs 6 8 show the amplitude and the vibration frequency are changing along with current velocity u reduced velocity u and reynolds number r e at different positions as shown in the following figures the smaller sd is the stronger the disturbance will be and subsequently galloping is easier to be induced 4 1 1 promotion region sd 2d as presented in fig 5 in the series arrangements of sd 2d the wake interference of the sics is positive and it is evident that the amplitude of the ehc is higher than the single cylinder and the maximum amplitude of a max 1 12 d occurs on the case of sd 2d td 3d and u 5 interestingly the noteworthy phenomenon of the viv happened at first and then followed by the galloping with the increase of current velocity has been captured at the typical cases of sd 2d td 2d and sd 2d td 4d respectively in the initial branch the reduced velocity ranging from 2 to 4 all sd 2d cases follow a similar trend that the amplitude and the vibration frequency magnify with the increase of the reduced velocity when the vibration frequency gets close to the natural frequency of the single cylinder although the reduced velocity keeps increasing the amplitude and the vibration frequency of the single cylinder will remain at a relatively stable value before the reduced velocity reaches 10 this phenomenon is called resonance or lock in and the velocity range is named the upper branch of viv lock in happens in vortex induced vibration that is when the flow velocity gets to a particular value the vibratory frequency will be locked on the cylinder s resonant frequency and meanwhile the vibratory amplitude will stay high values in the lower branch the amplitude begins to show a decreasing trend with the reduced velocity increases and the vibration frequency continues to increase until the cylinder is stationary compared to the single cylinder even though the ehc with position td 3d has a higher amplitude the synchronization range is only in 6 u 8 which limits its application scope seriously when the interference distance satisfies td 2d and td 4d both echs occur galloping for the case of td 2d the initial branch and the upper branch have an analogous trend and velocity range contrasted to the single cylinder when the reduced velocity reaches to u 10 even though the amplitude of the ehc has also decreased with higher decreasing magnitude it does not enter the lower branch but the transitional region from viv to galloping and the distinctive galloping characteristics of higher amplitude and lower vibration frequency is presented simultaneously in the situation td 4d another galloping is also obvious compared with the previous galloping the current vibration response enters the transition region at u 5 with higher amplitude and the lower vibration frequency than the single cylinder similar to the previous galloping when the reduced velocity drops in the transitional range the amplitude response will show a sudden drop and then enhance again 4 1 2 disturbed region sd 3d the vortex shedding from sics is periodic that the wake interference on ehc is also affected by the distance of streamwise the wake interference of sics at sd 3d is illustrated in fig 6 for sd 3d only when td 4d galloping can be observed owing to the wake interference the synchronization range for td 2d is 4 u 7 and the amplitude is higher than the single cylinder significantly besides for td 3d the amplitude is smaller than others and the vibration synchronization range is the same as the single cylinder the galloping emerging at sd 3d and td 4d will enter the transitional range and then develop into galloping when u 9 which is similar to the galloping of sd 2d td 2d 4 1 3 weak region sd 4d as depicted in fig 7 wake interference does not always promote the amplitude to magnify in contrast with the promotion region and disturbed region when sd increases to 4d the sics will no longer motivate the vibration of the ehc and change the type of fiv while the wake interference still has an important impact on the synchronization range and the amplitude of ehc due to the existence of the wake interference the viv of ehc is also different from the classical viv for example the vibration frequency and the amplitude will slightly fluctuate during the lock in range also with the decrease of td the synchronization range of viv gradually decreases when td 2d the synchronization range is 4 u 8 which is obviously smaller than the single cylinder nevertheless the initial branch is always captured at reduced velocity from 2 u 4 apart from the synchronization range sics can not apparently influence on the amplitude and the vibration frequency of ehc overall if sd reaches 4d the influence on the vibration of hec will be relatively weak 4 2 visualized analysis the vibration is caused by the periodic vortex shedding behind the cylinder when the fluid flows past the cylinder therefore the genre of the vortex detaching is the fundamental factor affecting the vibration characteristics and the energy harvesting performance of aceh besides khalak and williamson 1996 1997 have given the terminology for vortex shedding forms in different branches in early experimental studies in this work to visually analyze the impact of sics on ehc energy harvesting mechanisms the visual analysis for the vortex shedding is provided in this section williamson and roshko 1988 zhang et al 2017b and the wake interference of sd 2d and td 2d is plotted in fig 8 10 as depicted in fig 8 in the initial branch the vortex shedding from the sics sic v has just been in contact with the ehc and the vortex generated by ehc will not fuse with the sic v therefore the influence of sic v on ehc vibration is not obvious fig 9 shows the vortex shedding when the reduced velocity is u 6 and 11 and in these two reduced velocities the ehc begins to hit the sic v interestingly when the ehc moves to the position where the displacement is the largest in the negative direction of the y axis is n y the ehc vortex will fuse with the sic v shedding off from the outside of the sic which is at the n y and the vortex generated by the fusion will adhere to the ehc and stretched to the largest displacement position in the positive direction of the y axis is p y and then the vortex fuses with the sic v shedding from the outside of the sic which is at the p y the vortex generated by the second fusion will enclose the ehc with the other sic v together this disturbance limits the amplitude of the ehc so the amplitude will decrease different from the vortex fusion shown in fig 10 when the ehc interfered by sic v although the ehc v will still fuse with the sic v the vortex generated by the fusion does not adhere to the ehc and moves to the opposite direction at the maximum amplitude then moves directly downstream along streamwise direction simultaneously when the ehc arrives at the maximum amplitude in the p y the ehc is surrounded by two opposite vortices from the sic which are in the corresponding position and this interference is beneficial to the ehc vibration therefore the vibration of the ehc is strengthened 4 3 energy harvesting feature the main purpose of this work is to harvest the kinetic energy containing in the ocean utilizing fiv and the amount of the output of the harvested power from the ocean current is the first criterion for evaluating the property of the aceh simultaneously from the perspective of energy saving energy conversion efficiency is also an important indicator to evaluate the performance and applicable condition of the aceh to ensure the advantages of the aceh in practical application the influence of the current velocity on the power density in different positions is also an important research goal thus the effects of the different wake interference on the output power the energy conversion efficiency and the power density under different branches were analyzed in this section 4 3 1 output power fig 11 a d represent the power output of energy harvesting systems with different configurations as observed in fig 11 a owing to the sics induce the galloping phenomenon of ehc at sd 2d td 2d and sd 2d td 4d the output power harvested by the ehc is distinctly greater than the output power of the sics at other positions and the single cylinder therefore the output power of the sics can reach 0 82 w which is the maximum value at sd 2d td 2d and u 12 despite the output power harvested from the water current is slightly bigger than the other positions at sd 2d td 3d and the velocity range is 2 u 8 when the upper branch is beyond u 8 the output power of the galloping ehi is higher than other conditions the reason is that at sd 2d td 3d the ehc has a higher amplitude in the velocity range of 2 u 8 correspondingly when u 8 the amplitude and the vibration frequency of the ehc at sd 2d and td 3d will decrease rapidly thus the power output will diminish gradually furthermore after entering the lower branch the galloping ehc shows a current that the output power begins to heighten with the reduced velocity increases and resulting in the output voltage of galloping ehc becomes the largest this difference can also be explained by eq 12 as is seen from eq 12 the amplitude and the vibration frequency are the pivotal parameters that have an apparent influence on the output power for the ehc with sd 2d and td 3d although the vibration frequency increases the amplitude decreases rapidly after enters the lower branch then the amplitude of the galloping ehc reduces in the transition zone where the vibration frequency rises sharply besides the output power of the galloping ehc is eventually higher than the viv ehc and single cylinder correspondingly the galloping ehc will exhibit the notable characteristics of the high amplitude and the low vibration frequency in the galloping zone besides ehc exhibits viv likes single cylinder however it has narrower effective bandwidth than a single cylinder besides although the effective bandwidth is not as wide as the single cylinder the amplitude of the upper branch and the lower branch is higher than the single cylinder and thus the output power is higher than the single cylinder except in the low branch this considerable result not only improves the output power of the ehc but also avoids structural damage caused by excessive amplitude in short when sd is 2d the wake interference effectively improves the output power of the ehc which is consistent with the goal of this work to harvest more electricity from ocean current fig 11 b shows the effect of sics on ehc output power when the streamwise distance in 3d when sd 3d the output power is no longer higher than the single cylinder under any interference different from sd 2d only when td 4d sics can induce ehc to arise galloping and the output power of the galloping ehc is higher than the single cylinder when u 8 interestingly the induced galloping does not show that output power continues to increase with the reduced velocity in the transition zone but shows a trend that the output power decreases rapidly at first and then keep rising simultaneously not only does the galloping ehc have an area where the output power reduces at the higher reduced velocity but also the viv ehc shows a similar phenomenon the output power is greater than the single cylinder under each interference at that condition this phenomenon is mainly caused by the fact that the amplitude has started to drop sharply before the vibration frequency rises sharply overall although the output power of ehc reduces comparing with sd 2d it is still larger than the single cylinder at a certain velocity range from the flow induced vibration energy harvesting point of view this tendency proves that the wake interference of sics is still favorable as the wake interference effect of sics decreases gradually with the increase of sd therefore in contrast to sd 2d and sd 3d the sics wake interference does not induce galloping any longer when the streamwise distance increases to 4d while the output power also decreases whereas because the vibration frequency will be strengthened under the interference in the initial branch and lower branch the output power is still larger than the single cylinder when u 5 and u 11 as presented in fig 11 c when td 2d the output power of the ehc is the largest this law is consistent with the law presented when sd 3d the reason for these phenomena is that the smaller the distance between the cylinders is the stronger the interference will be besides owing to the interference effect the effective bandwidth of ehc decreases with the narrowing of the distance between sics but when the form of vibration is the same the amplitude at the same reduced velocity is larger than the amplitude with a longer distance between sics in a word the wake interference effect generated by sics is conducive to harvest energy from ocean current and the closer the distance between the sics and the ehc is the stronger the interference will be and more energy can be extracted from the water current when sd 2d td 2d and u 12 the output power reaches the maximum value of 0 43 w at the same time when the sics is in the special positions the output power transformed by the ehc from the ocean current will enlarge with the increase of the reduced velocity also the output power produced by the viv ehc is also larger than the single cylinder this detection is beneficial to enhance the energy harvesting performance of the aceh 4 3 2 conversion efficiency in this section the variation law of energy conversion efficiency with the change of the reduced velocity at different sics positions are discussed as depicted in fig 12 the conversion efficiency increases first and then decreases with the increase of the reduced velocity and tends to be stable finally the highest conversion efficiency occurs at the end of the initial branch also due to the presence of wake interference when sd 4d td 3d and u 2 the efficiency reaches the maximum value and the maximum conversion efficiency is 10 13 at the beginning of the initial branch the ehc emerges a small amplitude as described in eq 12 and eq 13 the energy harvested by aceh is smaller which leads to the lower conversion efficiency at the end of the initial branch the vibration frequency of the ehc is close to the natural frequency and the amplitude is also close to the maximum simultaneously the water velocity is still relatively small that is the fluid kinetic energy of water is small hence the conversion efficiency is maximal with the increase of the reduced velocity although the vibration frequency and the amplitude of the ehc reach the maximum and they do not change with the increase of the current velocity within the range of lock in oppositely the fluid kinetic energy of water increases with the water current velocity which ultimately leads to the decrease of the conversion efficiency correspondingly in the subsequent region the amplitude increases galloping or approaches 0 viv with the increase of the water current velocity and the fluid kinetic energy also increases with the water velocity so the conversion efficiency gradually becomes stable 4 3 3 power density as mentioned in the previous summaries of this paper when the distance between cylinders is 4d the effect of wake interference on the flow around the cylinder is relatively weak to avoid the obstruction of the surrounding cylinder on the energy harvesting characteristics of aceh in the process of practical application the aceh will be arranged as represented in fig 13 a and the streamwise distance between acehs is set as 5d fig 13 a presents the conceptual design of six groups of an energy harvesting system the system comprises of sics and ehc each blue color stationary cylinder can also be treated as a component in both two adjacent energy harvesting systems consequently more energy would be harvested by arranging more arrays of the converters eq 23 can be used to calculate the volume required for an aceh to harvest energy the power density of aceh can be acquired by introducing eq 23 into eq 21 as plotted in fig 13 b when sd 2d and td 2d aceh obtains the highest power density because the ehc induced the galloping when the sics are in the position of sd 2d and td 2d the power density of ehc increases with the reduced velocity when the reduced velocity is less than 10 the power density of the single cylinder increases with the reduced velocity which is owing to the single cylinder is in the initial branch and the upper branch of viv when u 10 therefore in that velocity range the power density of the single cylinder is greater than the ehc when the sics are located at other locations on the contrary when u 10 the single cylinder enters the lower branch of the viv so the power density of the single cylinder begins to decrease sharply while the power of the ehc begins to increase or only decline slowly as a result the power density of more and more ehcs is larger than the single cylinder with the increase of velocity in a word the existence of sics effectively improves the power density of ehc in a certain velocity range especially when sd 2d and td 2d the power density of ehc is significantly improved fig 14 presents the concept of the proposed energy harvesting system in this work which comprising two stationary interfering cylinders and a main energy harvesting cylinder and spring damping components are also presented 5 conclusions in this work the wake interference of the stationary cylinders on the cylinder harvesting energy and vibration has been investigated by the numerical simulation method the reduced velocity is set as 2 u 12 and the sd and td adopt 2d 3d and 4d respectively by analyzing the simulation results the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the wake interference effect of sics conduces to harvest more electricity from the kinetic energy the output power of aceh can reach a maximum of 0 81 w when sd 2d td 2d and u 12 the energy conversion efficiency can reach the highest value of 10 13 when sd 4d td 3d and u 3 2 when sd 2d and td 2d the output power of ehc is larger than that of the single cylinder and increases with the decreasing velocity 3 when the sics are located at the positions of sd 2d td 2d sd 2d td 4d and sd 3d td 4d the wake interference induces the ehc to arise galloping besides they entered the transition zone when the reduced velocity is 5 10 and 9 respectively 4 although the presence of the wake interference reduces the effective bandwidth of viv ehc compared with the single cylinder it increases the amplitude and the vibration frequency of viv ehc effectively the output power of the ehc is still higher than the single cylinder 5 as the distance between sics and ehc increases the wake interference of sics gradually weakens and the vibration and energy harvesting characteristics of ehc gradually approach those of the single cylinder credit

21808,the performance of an aquatic clean energy harvester aceh under the wake interferences of different arranged stationary cylinders is numerically studied nine wake interferences are generated by varying the transverse distance between the two stationary interfering cylinders sic and the streamwise distance between sic and the energy harvesting cylinder ehc the mass ratio damping and spring stiffness of the aceh are set as 1 6674 2 7274 n s m and 758 11 n m respectively the wake interference can induce the ehc to galloping at some particular positions the maximum values of the output power and the conversion efficiency of the aceh were 0 82 w and respectively besides even when the sic does not induce galloping on ehc the output power and the conversion efficiency of the aceh are higher than those of the single cylinder the performance of the wake interference is beneficial to energy harve 10 13 sting as the distance between the sic and the ehc increases the wake interference of the sic gets weaker and the energy harvesting performance of the aceh reduces gradually finally the influence is comprehensively divided into three different regions promotion region disturbed region and weak region keywords vortex induced vibration wake interference energy harvesting galloping 1 introduction renewable and clean sources of energy are being developed and encouraged to be included in the energy mix on local and national levels around the globe wang et al 2020 fang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 huang et al 2019 no doubt energy is the driving force of social development tang et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2019a fang et al 2019 although the ocean and wind are inundated with energy it is not easy to extract energy from them because of the insufficient development of technology in the ocean current and tide are the main forms of existence of energy zou et al 2019a wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a ding et al 2020a chen et al 2020 as the knowledge of flow induced vibration fiv phenomena deepens researchers have been gradually trying to develop the energy harvester that can extract hydrokinetic energy from the ocean ding et al 2019 wang et al 2018a ma et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the main forms of the fiv are vortex induced vibration viv and galloping flutter and wake galloping while viv is the most common vibration phenomenon the limitation of viv is that it can produce large amplitude in a small velocity range only zhu et al 2020 which is unfavorable for energy harvesting on the other hand galloping can only be induced and maintained with a higher amplitude at a higher current velocity yang et al 2020 ding et al 2020b yang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 viv is a common fiv phenomenon caused by the periodic force exerting on the bluff body thus the structure shape and position have a significant impact on the vibration characteristics indeed the amplitude plays a vital role in promoting the output power of the flow induced energy harvester for the sake of making a bluff body to have a higher amplitude over a wider range of current velocity researchers have carried out experimental theoretical and simulation studies one of the major research issues is to optimize the bluff body surface structure and promote the vibration response under the inspiration of biomimetic thought hee chang and sang joon 2004 allen and smits 2001 cha et al 2013 proposed a biomimetic energy harvester installed at the tail of a fish model the theoretical model was given to predict the energy harvester performance proving that the theoretical results are consistent with the experimental results from an underwater experiment besides the width of the lock in range directly determines the velocity range of extracting energy from current jin et al 2019 added some bulges or pits on the bare cylinder and designed a wind tunnel experiment to study the output voltage and the output power of the biomimetic energy harvester experimental results showed that the bulges could improve the output power and the effective working wind velocity to 1 21 mw and 1 8 m s respectively adding accessories to the bluff body can increase the amplitude and the effective working velocity range hu et al 2019 experimentally examined the efficiency of an energy harvester where two rods were fixed on the energy harvesting circular cylinder the rods were prisms cylinders or cuboids and the positions were varied on periphery of the cylinder the experimental result showed that the highest output voltage and the output power could be achieved when the prism shaped rods were installed on the back of the cylinder at the angle between the rods and the wind current is 60 aiming to enhance the energy conversion capacity of the harvester wang et al 2019b installed a y shaped accessory on a cylinder which converted viv to galloping the conversion mechanism between the viv and galloping was investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd method the feasibility of the numerical results was experimentally verified the energy harvester translated wind energy to electricity for the wind velocity of 0 5 m s to 2 m s with the output power reaching 1 2 mw at a wind velocity of 2 m s ptc passive turbulence control sticking roughness to the surface of the bare cylinder can also achieve the conversion from viv to galloping kim et al 2013 ding et al 2013 2015 it is conducive to generating more electricity then ding et al 2016 numerically studied the dynamic response of the ptc cylinder in ocean current at high reynolds numbers r e and explored the relationship between the amplitude vibration frequency and current velocity concurrently wang et al 2018 experimentally investigated the conversion of kinetic energy to electricity using ptc under different resistances in a wind tunnel wu et al 2014 in water tunnel experiment examined the impact of the structure size sandpaper and mounting position of sandpaper on the energy harvesting performance the output voltage increased rapidly when a thicker ptc was deployed at higher reduced velocity u the installation location had a major influence on the output power although mounting accessories can effectively improve the capability of the energy harvester the obvious disadvantage is that the structure of the energy harvester becomes more complicated in addition numerous vibration phenomena and dynamic effects are interrelated to the arrangement of the structure as such the interference effect of the series of bluff bodies receives extensive attention hu et al 2019 khalid et al 2016 kim et al 2009 wang et al 2019 gnatowska 2019 ding et al 2013 2015 explored the response of the wake occurring between two ptc cylinders and extended this interactional study to the four ptc cylinders zhou and wang 2018 experimentally and numerically studied the efficiency of the dual serial wind energy translation abdelkefi et al 2013 have examined the simultaneous vibration of two bluff bodies via wind tunnel experiments where the cross section of the bluff body and the distance between the bluff bodies were varied further zhang et al 2017a investigated the phase amplitude and interaction of circular square pentagonal d shaped cylinders hu et al 2019 tested the output voltage of two galloping piezoelectric energy harvesters arranged in tandem under optimal external resistance the experimental data showed that the output voltage of either of the two energy harvesters is much higher than that of a solitary energy harvester at the same wind velocity which proves that the wake interference has a great influence on energy harvesting the application of the wake interference can not only improve the energy harvesting characteristics but also effectively reduce the complexity of the system the natural frequency and stiffness of the cylinder system have considerable impacts on the vibration characteristics placing a cylinder in front of or behind another is not only the case affecting the vibration rather staggered arrangements of cylinders do better sometimes hu et al 2019 for the sake of systematically studying the wake interference on the aceh further three cylinders in a triangular arrangement are chosen as a research unit in this work two of them are stationary and the third one is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction effect of current velocity and interspacing between cylinders on the vibration amplitude and frequency responses and energy harvesting performance outputs power conversion efficiency and power density are numerically explored also the vortex shedding modes of the ehc are analyzed and examined to carry out a visual study of the wake interference while reduced current velocity u normalized based on d and natural frequency varies from 2 to 12 where d is the cylinder diameter the interspacing between the cylinders change from 2d to 4d 2 governing equations 2 1 equations for incompressible fluid flow in this work considering the actual application the fluid water is assumed as incompressible and viscous the current passing a bluff body can be described by the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the flow processes follow the conservation of mass and momentum equations 1 u i x i 0 and 2 ρ u i t u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i ρ u i u j x j where u i represents the reynolds stress 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k t δ ij in the above equations t p and ρ indicate time pressure and fluid density respectively simultaneously μ δ ij μ t and k t are the fluid viscosity kronecker delta function turbulent viscosity and kinetic turbulent energy besides x i u i and u i represent the position coordinate velocity components and velocity fluctuation components correspondingly i and j are the directions in cartesian coordinates and u i is time averaged velocity two dimensional urns equations were solved along with sst shear stress transport k ω turbulent model which was developed by mentor menter 1994 the sst k ω model is a rationale for effectively solving the fluid problem with both inner and outflow which is suitable for the fluid structure interaction problem in this work as it is known k ω model is the model of simplicity and a good choice of solving the sublayer on the boundary layer which corresponds to the near wall function solving of the sic and eic by comprising the transformed k ϵ model which is good at solving the freestream independence of the outer part of the boundary layer and introducing a function f1 the governing of the new baseline model can be given as menter 1994 4 d ρ k d t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j 5 d ρ ω d t γ v t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω 2 x j μ σ ω μ t ω x j 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where any constant σ k in the sst k ω model is the superposition of the corresponding constants in the original and the transformed wilcox k ω models menter 1994 therefore the sst k ω model is the combination of the original and the transformed wilcox k ω models the cross diffusion term appeared in the ω equation i e right hand side last term of eq 5 is inherited from the transformed k ω model one advantage of the sst k ω model is that the robustness and the accuracy are increased for the application in the near wall region another advantage is that the shear stress transport effect which is of great importance can be taken into account due to these improvements the sst k ω model has been proved to be of higher reliability in the sst model a transport equation for the turbulent shear stress τ basing on bradshaw s assumption that the shear stress in a boundary layer is proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy k t which is defined as τ ρ a 1 k more detail can be found in menter 1994 since the sst k ω model is readily available in the commercial software ansys fluent and the detailed techniques about the implementation of the sst k ω model are not the focus of this study thus it is not furthermore introduced in this paper 2 2 equations for rigid body motion the energy harvester system is composed of three identical diameter cylinders two of the cylinders are stationary called stationary interference cylinders sics and the last cylinder is vibratory called energy harvesting cylinder ehc as the vibration amplitude of the ehc is much weaker in the streamwise direction x direction than transverse direction y direction the vibration model is simplified as a two dimensional model of single degree of freedom the mass spring damper system of the ehc can be described by a second order linear differential equation as 6 m y 2 ξ ω n y ω n 2 y f y t where m ξ and ω n donate the mass damping ratio and natural frequency rad s of the vibration device respectively ω n 2 π f n w a t e r f y t is lift force exerted on the ehc the y y and y are the acceleration velocity and displacement of the ehc respectively the electricity translated from flow kinetic energy during a vibration period t osc is calculated as zhang et al 2018b 7 p ehc 1 t osc 0 t osc f y t y d t combining eq 7 and eq 6 8 p ehc 1 t osc 0 t osc m y 2 ξ ω n y ω n 2 y y d t to simplify eq 8 and to obtain the mathematical model of the harnessed and dissipated power of the energy harvester the viv and galloping responses of the rigid cylinder are both assumed to be approximately sinusoidal this is a fairly accurate approximation except for the desynchronization viv branch the latter may be overtaken by the galloping range depending on the initial velocity of galloping therefore the displacement of the cylinder can be expressed as 9 y t a sin 2 π f osc t where a represents the vibration amplitude and f osc is the vibration frequency thus the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction is 10 y t 2 π f osc a cos 2 π f osc t basing on eq 10 the nonzero term in eq 8 on the right hand is the velocity term and thus eq 8 can be simplified to 11 p ehc 2 t osc 0 t osc m ξ ω n y 2 d t inserting eq 10 into eq 11 the final expression for the power can be achieved as 12 p ehc 8 π 3 m ξ f n water a 2 f osc 2 the fluid kinetic energy of water flow approaching on the ehc is 13 p water 1 2 ρ u 3 d l 1 2 ρ u 3 d 2 3 the conversion efficiency is 14 η har p ehc p water 2 4 solution methodology the cylinder displacement was calculated by using udf user defined functions compiled by combined programming language for implementing the movement of the ehc in the vertical direction numerical calculations were carried out by using the fourth order runge kutta method it is realized by combining fluent with the udf to solve the displacement and average velocity of the bluff body in each time step then the calculated displacement and average velocity are used as the initial condition for the next calculation while driving the update of the grid the process of solving eq 6 is as follows converting the form of eq 6 the following expression is obtained zhu et al 2017 15 y t f water y t m 2 ξ ω n y ω n 2 y 16 y t δ t y t δ t 6 β 1 2 β 2 2 β 3 1 β 4 17 y t δ t y t y t δ t δ t 2 6 β 1 β 2 β 3 in the above equations δ t represents the computational time step the expressions of the intermediate functions β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are 18 β 1 f y t m 2 ξ ω n y t ω n 2 y t 19 β 2 f y t m 2 ξ ω n y t δ t 2 β 1 ω n 2 y t δ t 2 y t 20 β 3 f y t m 2 ξ ω n y t δ t 2 β 2

sics and the ehc is calculated by multiple the lateral space between the first group of sics and the next sics and the transverse space between the first ehc and the next one thus the volume can be calculated by lee and bernitsas 2011 zhu et al 2018 22 v d e n s i t y 5 d s d t d l the power density of aceh can be acquired by 23 p d e n s i t y p ehc v d e n s i t y p ehc 5 d s d t d in the present work the define cg motion is used as the motion function to drive the ehc movement in each time step the mass and momentum conservation equations are solved first and then the periodic fluid forces are calculated afterward the new coordinates and velocity of the ehc were obtained by solving the coupled momentum and pressure based continuity equations based on a second order upwind scheme with the spatial discretization method at this point the iteration end and the iteratively calculated velocity and coordinates were used as the initial conditions for the next calculation correspondingly the mesh would also be updated 3 method validation 3 1 physical models fig 1 represents the single freedom of degree model of the energy harvesting system the lateral interspacing between the two stationary is denoted by sd and the streamwise distance between the stationary and vibrating cylinder is represented by td to find an optimal cylinder interspacing corresponding to a maximum energy harvesting nine combinations of sd 2d 3d 4d and td 2d 3d 4d are chosen to explore the vibration characteristics and the energy harvesting performance of the ehc in 2 u 12 1 77 10 4 r e 1 06 10 5 0 2 m s u 1 2 m s the ehc is supported by a linear spring stiffness k and a damping device it is worth mentioning that the reason for using the damping device is equivalent to the kinetic energy losses caused by friction and the internal resistance of the generator the system damping c is introduced into the governing equation furthermore the natural frequency and the damping ratio are expressed by f n warter and ξ respectively the system parametric values and definitions of symbols are listed in table 1 the boundary conditions are chosen as below the inflow boundary condition is set as u u v 0 to represent the free stream a traction free condition u x 0 u x 0 p 0 is used as the outflow boundary to promise the full development of the flow the top and the bottom boundaries are both imposed as a free slip condition with u x 0 v 0 the boundary condition of the sics is also set as a free slip wall besides and differently the outside of the ehc is set as a moving wall which is controlled by the mass damping spring governing equation the initial computation conditions are defined as y t 0 0 y t 0 0 3 2 meshing and iteration time step assessment in this paper structured grids were adopted in numerical calculations widely and the simulation was conducted in a rectangle flow field of the size 35d streamwise distance 20d transverse distance which is illustrated in fig 2 to ensure the simulation is more approaching to the actual application and eliminate the interference of the fluid domain boundary layer the distance between the wall and the center of the ehc is set as 10d the specified shear condition is used the inlet to center of the ehc distance to is set as 10d the distance between the outlet and the center of the ehc is set as 25d to ensure the vortex developed fully meanwhile to avoid the computational divergence caused by the negative grid and advance the mesh update the method of combined using overset mesh and moving mesh was selected overset mesh can be especially useful in cases involving large relative motion between components the overset mesh allows greater control of local mesh characteristics as the geometry moves through the domain because individual mesh zones need not deform to accommodate moving geometry besides as shown in fig 2 a c there are two types of grids which can be defined as foreground mesh and background mesh which correspond to the blue color and red color mesh shown in fig 2 a respectively fig 2 b and c illustrate the detail of the near wall grids of the sic and ehc the two types of grids realize the overset function of current computation the principle of emulating calculation is comprehensively described in fig 3 considering the effect of mesh size and number on simulation period and accuracy the mesh generation method must be verified zhu et al 2018 due to the range of sd and td in the calculation process will be 2d 3d and 4d respectively the case with s d 3 d t d 3 d and u 8 was used to review the influence of grid size grid the parameter y 0 172 δ y d 0 1 ρ u μ 0 9 are identified as 5 8 and 10 zou et al 2019b and the calculation results with three grids were shown in table 2 from table 2 in this work to select a maximum iteration time step on the premise of not affecting the calculation accuracy of the transient simulation the numerical simulations with various iteration time steps of t osc 70 t osc 80 and t osc 90 were carried out at u 8 and the grid number was selected as 284 566 the comparison of the calculation results is shown in fig 4 which shows that the computational responses are in good agreement for different time steps besides in our and some other previous work e g ding et al ding et al 2016 ding et al 2017 zou et al 2019b zhu et al 2018 2020 and ding et al 2019 2020c have employed a similar method to investigate the energy harvesting from flow induced vibrations by both experiments and numerical simulation the numerical results agreed with the experimental well which could prove the feasibility and efficiency of the computational method in this work thus in the present work we conducted the simulation for the energy harvesting frame basing on the same method 4 results and analysis 4 1 amplitude and frequency the amplitude and vibration frequency are the two most critical factors in determining the aceh performance as the wake interference is mainly determined by the size of sd thus the vibration performance can be divided into three segments for the convenience of contrastive analysis named promotion region sd 2d disturbed region sd 3d and weak region sd 4d figs 6 8 show the amplitude and the vibration frequency are changing along with current velocity u reduced velocity u and reynolds number r e at different positions as shown in the following figures the smaller sd is the stronger the disturbance will be and subsequently galloping is easier to be induced 4 1 1 promotion region sd 2d as presented in fig 5 in the series arrangements of sd 2d the wake interference of the sics is positive and it is evident that the amplitude of the ehc is higher than the single cylinder and the maximum amplitude of a max 1 12 d occurs on the case of sd 2d td 3d and u 5 interestingly the noteworthy phenomenon of the viv happened at first and then followed by the galloping with the increase of current velocity has been captured at the typical cases of sd 2d td 2d and sd 2d td 4d respectively in the initial branch the reduced velocity ranging from 2 to 4 all sd 2d cases follow a similar trend that the amplitude and the vibration frequency magnify with the increase of the reduced velocity when the vibration frequency gets close to the natural frequency of the single cylinder although the reduced velocity keeps increasing the amplitude and the vibration frequency of the single cylinder will remain at a relatively stable value before the reduced velocity reaches 10 this phenomenon is called resonance or lock in and the velocity range is named the upper branch of viv lock in happens in vortex induced vibration that is when the flow velocity gets to a particular value the vibratory frequency will be locked on the cylinder s resonant frequency and meanwhile the vibratory amplitude will stay high values in the lower branch the amplitude begins to show a decreasing trend with the reduced velocity increases and the vibration frequency continues to increase until the cylinder is stationary compared to the single cylinder even though the ehc with position td 3d has a higher amplitude the synchronization range is only in 6 u 8 which limits its application scope seriously when the interference distance satisfies td 2d and td 4d both echs occur galloping for the case of td 2d the initial branch and the upper branch have an analogous trend and velocity range contrasted to the single cylinder when the reduced velocity reaches to u 10 even though the amplitude of the ehc has also decreased with higher decreasing magnitude it does not enter the lower branch but the transitional region from viv to galloping and the distinctive galloping characteristics of higher amplitude and lower vibration frequency is presented simultaneously in the situation td 4d another galloping is also obvious compared with the previous galloping the current vibration response enters the transition region at u 5 with higher amplitude and the lower vibration frequency than the single cylinder similar to the previous galloping when the reduced velocity drops in the transitional range the amplitude response will show a sudden drop and then enhance again 4 1 2 disturbed region sd 3d the vortex shedding from sics is periodic that the wake interference on ehc is also affected by the distance of streamwise the wake interference of sics at sd 3d is illustrated in fig 6 for sd 3d only when td 4d galloping can be observed owing to the wake interference the synchronization range for td 2d is 4 u 7 and the amplitude is higher than the single cylinder significantly besides for td 3d the amplitude is smaller than others and the vibration synchronization range is the same as the single cylinder the galloping emerging at sd 3d and td 4d will enter the transitional range and then develop into galloping when u 9 which is similar to the galloping of sd 2d td 2d 4 1 3 weak region sd 4d as depicted in fig 7 wake interference does not always promote the amplitude to magnify in contrast with the promotion region and disturbed region when sd increases to 4d the sics will no longer motivate the vibration of the ehc and change the type of fiv while the wake interference still has an important impact on the synchronization range and the amplitude of ehc due to the existence of the wake interference the viv of ehc is also different from the classical viv for example the vibration frequency and the amplitude will slightly fluctuate during the lock in range also with the decrease of td the synchronization range of viv gradually decreases when td 2d the synchronization range is 4 u 8 which is obviously smaller than the single cylinder nevertheless the initial branch is always captured at reduced velocity from 2 u 4 apart from the synchronization range sics can not apparently influence on the amplitude and the vibration frequency of ehc overall if sd reaches 4d the influence on the vibration of hec will be relatively weak 4 2 visualized analysis the vibration is caused by the periodic vortex shedding behind the cylinder when the fluid flows past the cylinder therefore the genre of the vortex detaching is the fundamental factor affecting the vibration characteristics and the energy harvesting performance of aceh besides khalak and williamson 1996 1997 have given the terminology for vortex shedding forms in different branches in early experimental studies in this work to visually analyze the impact of sics on ehc energy harvesting mechanisms the visual analysis for the vortex shedding is provided in this section williamson and roshko 1988 zhang et al 2017b and the wake interference of sd 2d and td 2d is plotted in fig 8 10 as depicted in fig 8 in the initial branch the vortex shedding from the sics sic v has just been in contact with the ehc and the vortex generated by ehc will not fuse with the sic v therefore the influence of sic v on ehc vibration is not obvious fig 9 shows the vortex shedding when the reduced velocity is u 6 and 11 and in these two reduced velocities the ehc begins to hit the sic v interestingly when the ehc moves to the position where the displacement is the largest in the negative direction of the y axis is n y the ehc vortex will fuse with the sic v shedding off from the outside of the sic which is at the n y and the vortex generated by the fusion will adhere to the ehc and stretched to the largest displacement position in the positive direction of the y axis is p y and then the vortex fuses with the sic v shedding from the outside of the sic which is at the p y the vortex generated by the second fusion will enclose the ehc with the other sic v together this disturbance limits the amplitude of the ehc so the amplitude will decrease different from the vortex fusion shown in fig 10 when the ehc interfered by sic v although the ehc v will still fuse with the sic v the vortex generated by the fusion does not adhere to the ehc and moves to the opposite direction at the maximum amplitude then moves directly downstream along streamwise direction simultaneously when the ehc arrives at the maximum amplitude in the p y the ehc is surrounded by two opposite vortices from the sic which are in the corresponding position and this interference is beneficial to the ehc vibration therefore the vibration of the ehc is strengthened 4 3 energy harvesting feature the main purpose of this work is to harvest the kinetic energy containing in the ocean utilizing fiv and the amount of the output of the harvested power from the ocean current is the first criterion for evaluating the property of the aceh simultaneously from the perspective of energy saving energy conversion efficiency is also an important indicator to evaluate the performance and applicable condition of the aceh to ensure the advantages of the aceh in practical application the influence of the current velocity on the power density in different positions is also an important research goal thus the effects of the different wake interference on the output power the energy conversion efficiency and the power density under different branches were analyzed in this section 4 3 1 output power fig 11 a d represent the power output of energy harvesting systems with different configurations as observed in fig 11 a owing to the sics induce the galloping phenomenon of ehc at sd 2d td 2d and sd 2d td 4d the output power harvested by the ehc is distinctly greater than the output power of the sics at other positions and the single cylinder therefore the output power of the sics can reach 0 82 w which is the maximum value at sd 2d td 2d and u 12 despite the output power harvested from the water current is slightly bigger than the other positions at sd 2d td 3d and the velocity range is 2 u 8 when the upper branch is beyond u 8 the output power of the galloping ehi is higher than other conditions the reason is that at sd 2d td 3d the ehc has a higher amplitude in the velocity range of 2 u 8 correspondingly when u 8 the amplitude and the vibration frequency of the ehc at sd 2d and td 3d will decrease rapidly thus the power output will diminish gradually furthermore after entering the lower branch the galloping ehc shows a current that the output power begins to heighten with the reduced velocity increases and resulting in the output voltage of galloping ehc becomes the largest this difference can also be explained by eq 12 as is seen from eq 12 the amplitude and the vibration frequency are the pivotal parameters that have an apparent influence on the output power for the ehc with sd 2d and td 3d although the vibration frequency increases the amplitude decreases rapidly after enters the lower branch then the amplitude of the galloping ehc reduces in the transition zone where the vibration frequency rises sharply besides the output power of the galloping ehc is eventually higher than the viv ehc and single cylinder correspondingly the galloping ehc will exhibit the notable characteristics of the high amplitude and the low vibration frequency in the galloping zone besides ehc exhibits viv likes single cylinder however it has narrower effective bandwidth than a single cylinder besides although the effective bandwidth is not as wide as the single cylinder the amplitude of the upper branch and the lower branch is higher than the single cylinder and thus the output power is higher than the single cylinder except in the low branch this considerable result not only improves the output power of the ehc but also avoids structural damage caused by excessive amplitude in short when sd is 2d the wake interference effectively improves the output power of the ehc which is consistent with the goal of this work to harvest more electricity from ocean current fig 11 b shows the effect of sics on ehc output power when the streamwise distance in 3d when sd 3d the output power is no longer higher than the single cylinder under any interference different from sd 2d only when td 4d sics can induce ehc to arise galloping and the output power of the galloping ehc is higher than the single cylinder when u 8 interestingly the induced galloping does not show that output power continues to increase with the reduced velocity in the transition zone but shows a trend that the output power decreases rapidly at first and then keep rising simultaneously not only does the galloping ehc have an area where the output power reduces at the higher reduced velocity but also the viv ehc shows a similar phenomenon the output power is greater than the single cylinder under each interference at that condition this phenomenon is mainly caused by the fact that the amplitude has started to drop sharply before the vibration frequency rises sharply overall although the output power of ehc reduces comparing with sd 2d it is still larger than the single cylinder at a certain velocity range from the flow induced vibration energy harvesting point of view this tendency proves that the wake interference of sics is still favorable as the wake interference effect of sics decreases gradually with the increase of sd therefore in contrast to sd 2d and sd 3d the sics wake interference does not induce galloping any longer when the streamwise distance increases to 4d while the output power also decreases whereas because the vibration frequency will be strengthened under the interference in the initial branch and lower branch the output power is still larger than the single cylinder when u 5 and u 11 as presented in fig 11 c when td 2d the output power of the ehc is the largest this law is consistent with the law presented when sd 3d the reason for these phenomena is that the smaller the distance between the cylinders is the stronger the interference will be besides owing to the interference effect the effective bandwidth of ehc decreases with the narrowing of the distance between sics but when the form of vibration is the same the amplitude at the same reduced velocity is larger than the amplitude with a longer distance between sics in a word the wake interference effect generated by sics is conducive to harvest energy from ocean current and the closer the distance between the sics and the ehc is the stronger the interference will be and more energy can be extracted from the water current when sd 2d td 2d and u 12 the output power reaches the maximum value of 0 43 w at the same time when the sics is in the special positions the output power transformed by the ehc from the ocean current will enlarge with the increase of the reduced velocity also the output power produced by the viv ehc is also larger than the single cylinder this detection is beneficial to enhance the energy harvesting performance of the aceh 4 3 2 conversion efficiency in this section the variation law of energy conversion efficiency with the change of the reduced velocity at different sics positions are discussed as depicted in fig 12 the conversion efficiency increases first and then decreases with the increase of the reduced velocity and tends to be stable finally the highest conversion efficiency occurs at the end of the initial branch also due to the presence of wake interference when sd 4d td 3d and u 2 the efficiency reaches the maximum value and the maximum conversion efficiency is 10 13 at the beginning of the initial branch the ehc emerges a small amplitude as described in eq 12 and eq 13 the energy harvested by aceh is smaller which leads to the lower conversion efficiency at the end of the initial branch the vibration frequency of the ehc is close to the natural frequency and the amplitude is also close to the maximum simultaneously the water velocity is still relatively small that is the fluid kinetic energy of water is small hence the conversion efficiency is maximal with the increase of the reduced velocity although the vibration frequency and the amplitude of the ehc reach the maximum and they do not change with the increase of the current velocity within the range of lock in oppositely the fluid kinetic energy of water increases with the water current velocity which ultimately leads to the decrease of the conversion efficiency correspondingly in the subsequent region the amplitude increases galloping or approaches 0 viv with the increase of the water current velocity and the fluid kinetic energy also increases with the water velocity so the conversion efficiency gradually becomes stable 4 3 3 power density as mentioned in the previous summaries of this paper when the distance between cylinders is 4d the effect of wake interference on the flow around the cylinder is relatively weak to avoid the obstruction of the surrounding cylinder on the energy harvesting characteristics of aceh in the process of practical application the aceh will be arranged as represented in fig 13 a and the streamwise distance between acehs is set as 5d fig 13 a presents the conceptual design of six groups of an energy harvesting system the system comprises of sics and ehc each blue color stationary cylinder can also be treated as a component in both two adjacent energy harvesting systems consequently more energy would be harvested by arranging more arrays of the converters eq 23 can be used to calculate the volume required for an aceh to harvest energy the power density of aceh can be acquired by introducing eq 23 into eq 21 as plotted in fig 13 b when sd 2d and td 2d aceh obtains the highest power density because the ehc induced the galloping when the sics are in the position of sd 2d and td 2d the power density of ehc increases with the reduced velocity when the reduced velocity is less than 10 the power density of the single cylinder increases with the reduced velocity which is owing to the single cylinder is in the initial branch and the upper branch of viv when u 10 therefore in that velocity range the power density of the single cylinder is greater than the ehc when the sics are located at other locations on the contrary when u 10 the single cylinder enters the lower branch of the viv so the power density of the single cylinder begins to decrease sharply while the power of the ehc begins to increase or only decline slowly as a result the power density of more and more ehcs is larger than the single cylinder with the increase of velocity in a word the existence of sics effectively improves the power density of ehc in a certain velocity range especially when sd 2d and td 2d the power density of ehc is significantly improved fig 14 presents the concept of the proposed energy harvesting system in this work which comprising two stationary interfering cylinders and a main energy harvesting cylinder and spring damping components are also presented 5 conclusions in this work the wake interference of the stationary cylinders on the cylinder harvesting energy and vibration has been investigated by the numerical simulation method the reduced velocity is set as 2 u 12 and the sd and td adopt 2d 3d and 4d respectively by analyzing the simulation results the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the wake interference effect of sics conduces to harvest more electricity from the kinetic energy the output power of aceh can reach a maximum of 0 81 w when sd 2d td 2d and u 12 the energy conversion efficiency can reach the highest value of 10 13 when sd 4d td 3d and u 3 2 when sd 2d and td 2d the output power of ehc is larger than that of the single cylinder and increases with the decreasing velocity 3 when the sics are located at the positions of sd 2d td 2d sd 2d td 4d and sd 3d td 4d the wake interference induces the ehc to arise galloping besides they entered the transition zone when the reduced velocity is 5 10 and 9 respectively 4 although the presence of the wake interference reduces the effective bandwidth of viv ehc compared with the single cylinder it increases the amplitude and the vibration frequency of viv ehc effectively the output power of the ehc is still higher than the single cylinder 5 as the distance between sics and ehc increases the wake interference of sics gradually weakens and the vibration and energy harvesting characteristics of ehc gradually approach those of the single cylinder credit

dynamic pressures and flow fields around cylinders are described good agreements between numerical results and experimental data of forces on the isolated cylinder are achieved for the extended cylinder the vertical forces per unit length increase with the increase in the extended length the horizontal forces on the extended cylinder change from increasing to decreasing after the centre to centre distance exceeding 3 5 times the diameter of the isolated cylinder the peak and valley values of maximum dynamic pressures impose on the lower side of the leading edge and upper side of the trailing edge of the extended cylinder respectively the horizontal forces on each of the two tandem cylinders with different centre to centre distances are smaller than those on the isolated cylinder

pressures flow field horizontal cylinders 1 introduction with the continuous advancement of marine engineering technology the enthusiasm of offshore countries for the development and utilization of marine resources continues to rise submerged vehicle and marine engineering structures such as offshore drilling platforms submarine pipelines or support cylinders are often subjected to the impact of the surrounding sea and submerged currents while undertaking the task of developing marine resources internal waves can penetrate almost the entire ocean depth and generate large wave forces that can cause the marine engineering structure to move or twist as a whole bole et al 1994 according to the statistics of roberts 1975 the maximum vertical amplitude is even 180 m internal solitary waves isws are typical representatives of internal waves because of their frequent activities the balance between nonlinearity and frequency dispersion is responsible for the propagation of isws with a constant waveform and propagation velocity in oceans as described in song song et al 2011 the force order magnitude of the isw acting on the submerged structure in the finite depth two layer fluid is the same as that of the surface wave and the isw induced maximum total horizontal force is roughly 1 3 of the surface wave force consequently the hydrodynamic loads induced by isws are assignable threats to the safe operation of submerged structures zhang and li 2007 the practical marine engineering structures such as semi submersible platforms tension leg platforms tlp spar platforms and float production storage and offloading fpso are generally composed of complex cylindrical structures kurup et al 2015 wang et al 2018 it is of practical significance to study the forces caused by the isw acting on the cylindrical structure which is one of the basic forms of the offshore engineering structure the study of loads on cylindrical structures induced by an isw has been conducted by many researchers in numerous ways ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 experimentally studied the isw induced forces acting on the submerged horizontal cylinder in the stratified system and found the position where the cylinder is subjected to the maximum horizontal and vertical forces through the newly developed wave maker and hydrodynamic load measurement technology wei wei et al 2014 confirmed the interaction characteristics between internal waves and the submerged slender body cai cai et al 2003 2006 2008 calculated forces and torques acting on the vertical cylinder exerted by isws based on the morison empirical formula and analysed the impact of background shear flows on forces xie xie et al 2010 song song et al 2011 si si et al 2012 xu xu et al 2012 lv lü et al 2016 respectively used the morison empirical formula combined with various isw theory to estimate the isw induced forces on vertical cylindrical piles wang wang et al 2016 investigated isw forces on two tandem vertical cylinders by using the numerical simulation and found that hydrodynamic interactions are sensitive to the centre to centre distance of two cylinders nevertheless experiments or numerical studies on the investigations of forces induced by the isw interaction with the horizontal cylindrical structures are rare in the literatures thus this paper aims to investigate the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the isw on horizontal cylinders by using the numerical simulation the type of the horizontal cylinders includes an isolated cylinder located at different positions an extended cylinder with different extended lengths and two tandem cylinders with different centre to centre distances to further reveal the characteristics of the interactions between an isw and horizontal cylinders maximum dynamic pressures and the flow field around horizontal cylinders which are rarely used by aforementioned researchers are also employed the numerical model is listed in section 2 an isw propagation over an isolated horizontal cylinder is investigated in section 3 results of the isw interactions with the extended horizontal cylinder and two tandem horizontal cylinders are addressed in sections 4 and 5 respectively finally conclusions are given in section 6 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the isw flow field is governed by the mass continuity equation and the reynolds average navier

velocity in the upper and lower layer can be expressed as 20 u i x t 1 i 1 c m k d v h i ζ x t where i 1 2 denotes the upper and lower layer the vertical velocities w i in the upper and lower layer can be derived from the mass conservation eq 1 during the numerical simulation the forces on the cylinder are defined as follow 21 f x μ γ u z w x n z d γ γ p n x d γ 22 f z μ γ u z w x n x d γ γ p n z d γ where f x z are the horizontal and vertical forces γ is the wetted surface of the cylinder n x n z are the outward unit normal vector of the cylinder surface the values of the variables in eqs 21 22 are stored in the grid nodes around the cylindrical surface 2 3 numerical method the numerical model developed for this investigation is based on the openfoam library the interface between upper and lower layers is captured by vof method hirt nichols time advancement is performed by the implicit euler method meng and zhang 2016 the finite volume method fvm is used to discretise the spatial term on a structured grid the velocity gradient on the left hand side of eq 1 is obtained by the gaussian linear interpolation jasak 1996 the second order total variation diminishing tvd limited linear scheme is employed to discretise the convection term in eq 2 harten 1983 the linearized source terms on the right hand side of eq 2 are integrated over a control volume the superbee scheme is used to discretise the second term on the left hand side of eq 3 ai and ding 2016 the pressure velocity coupling term is solved by using pimple algorithm which is a combination of piso algorithm and simple algorithm pimple inherits the main structure of the original piso and allows equations under relaxation to ensure that all equations at each time step can converge details of the pimple algorithm can be found in jasak 1996 the bottom boundary is specified as a no slip condition the rigid lid approximation is employed to the free surface which can eliminate the effects of the surface wave koop and butler 1981 a narrow relaxation zone is set on the right side of the numerical wave tank to absorb the reflected wave the details of the relaxation zone can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 the initial density distribution with a pycnocline as shown in fig 1 can be expressed by the following equation chen et al 2007 12b ρ z ρ 1 ρ 2 2 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 t a n h s z z c η where z is the vertical coordinate z c is the location of mid pycnocline or interface level s is the reciprocal of the half depth in the lower layer defined from the interface level the position of the value ρ 1 ρ 2 2 in the pycnocline is the stratified fluid interface when the velocity of the flow field is initialized the pycnocline above the fluid interface is treated as the upper fluid and vice versa therefore the initial velocity obtained from eq 20 is also applicable to the pycnocline 3 isw interaction with an isolated horizontal cylinder the cylinder is the basic structure of marine engineering or support structures numerical simulations of the isw propagation over an isolated horizontal cylinder located at different positions are conducted in this section hydrodynamic loads flow field and maximum dynamic pressures around the cylinder are revealed 3 1 computational setup a two dimensional numerical wave tank is established to simulate the elevation type isw the basic sizes of the wave tank which is filled with two layers of fluids are 4 m long in the horizontal direction and 0 125 m deep in the vertical direction as shown in fig 2 the red dashed line represents the interface of two layers the densities in the upper and lower layer fluids are ρ 1 1000 kg m3 and ρ 2 1021 kg m3 respectively the relative density difference between ρ 1 and ρ 2 is 0 021 ψ ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 in the isw propagation region the thicknesses of the upper and lower layer are h 1 and h 2 respectively the centre coordinate of the cylinder with a diameter of d 0 015 m is 1 9 m h 0 to ensure the stability and efficiency of the numerical simulation the courant number c o u δ t δ l is set to 0 2 in all numerical simulations δ t is the adjustable time step and δ l is the discrete grid size 3 2 grid independence analysis to avoid the dependence of numerical simulation results on the grid accuracy this part performs the grid independence analysis fig 3 indicates that three kinds of spatial resolutions around the isolated cylinder are considered the generation of grid is done by employing the standard mesh generator snappyhexmesh both the grid size δ l around the isolated cylinder and the total grid number n for each grid size are listed in table 1 the isw amplitude 0 0072 m pycnocline thickness 0 028 m and cylinder centre relative height h 0 h 0 3872 are used in the grid independence analysis figs 4 and 5 describe numerical results of three different grids including the hydrodynamic force coefficient acting on the cylinder and the dimensionless velocity at z h 0 the force coefficients per unit length of the cylinder are defined as c x z f x z ρ 1 gaw where f x z are forces acting on the cylinder a is the cylinder cross sectional area and w is the unit length of the cylinder maximum force coefficients c x z m m a x c x z t of three different grids are also listed in table 1 generally the higher the grid accuracy is the smaller the numerical error becomes as illustrated in fig 4 there is a remarkable difference of c x z between the case sparse and case medium with the increase in the grid accuracy while the difference of c x z between case medium and case dense is tiny fig 5 indicates that the difference of dimensionless velocity at z h 0 between the case sparse and case medium is noticeable however the difference of corresponding results simulated by the case medium and case dense is negligible according to the grid independence analysis above all the following numerical simulations use the same grid resolution as the case medium to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulation 3 3 force on the isolated cylinder to verify the accuracy of the numerical model in this paper the numerical simulation results of an isw propagation over the isolated cylinder located at different positions are compared with the laboratory experiment data obtained by ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 two pycnocline thicknesses including 2 8 cm and 3 9 cm are used in this part the isw amplitude η and pycnocline thickness δ used in numerical simulations are listed in table 2 nineteen cylinder centre relative heights shown in table 3 are considered in this verification process the comparisons of maximum hydrodynamic force coefficients in each series of numerical simulations are illustrated in fig 6 it is noted that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 6 a the c x m reaches the extremum while the cylinder position is approaching the wave tank bottom h 0 h 0 0125 the c x m decreases with the increase in h 0 h as the cylinder centre is near the position of h 0 h 2 η owing to the existence of a discontinuous tangential velocity at the interface between the upper and lower layer fluids ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 the c x m reaches the minimum the horizontal force begins to rise as the h 0 h continues to increase for h 0 h 0 6 c x m approaches the constant value 0 04 under this circumstance the isolated cylinder is completely in the upper layer fluid the horizontal force induced by the isw propagation acting on the cylinder is imposed by the fluid motion the constancy of c x m satisfies the assumption of the conventional shallow water theory that the horizontal fluid velocity is uniformly distributed along the direction of fluid depth grue et al 1999 the comparison of maximum vertical force coefficient c z m between numerical simulation and experimental data is demonstrated in fig 6 b the c z m increases with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder centre position and the interface of stratified fluid when the cylinder located in the lower layer fluid however the c z m gradually decreases with the increase in the distance between the cylinder centre position and the interface of stratified fluid when the cylinder located in the upper layer fluid when the cylinder centre is near the position of h 0 h 2 η the c z m on cylinder reaches the maximum fig 6 indicates that the numerical results generally agree well with the experimental data the pattern of c x z m is similar under the nearly unchanged isw amplitude and significantly varied pycnocline thickness to investigate characteristics of forces on the isolated cylinder located at different positions hydrodynamic force coefficients versus time are described in fig 7 cases including iso2 iso4 iso6 iso8 iso11 iso13 iso15 iso17 and iso19 listed in table 2 are employed as typical cases series a in table 1 is used as illustrated in fig 7 a the positive c x indicates that the direction of the force is the same as that of the isw propagation and vice versa for cases of the cylinder located below the interface of stratified fluid such as cases iso2 iso4 iso6 and iso8 the larger the distance between the cylinder and interface is the larger the c x becomes compared with other cases shown in fig 7 the cylinder in the case iso11 subjects to a smaller horizontal force fig 7 b indicates that a larger vertical force imposes on the isolated cylinder which is located at the interface of stratified fluid the larger the distance between the cylinder and interface is the smaller the c z becomes for the case of the isolated cylinder locating near the top or bottom of the wave tank the c z acting on the cylinder approaches zero at the time t 12 5 and 15 25s the c x and c z reach maximum for most typical cases 3 4 flow field and dynamic pressure around the isolated cylinder flow fields including the vortices and streamlines around the isolated horizontal cylinder are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 for cases considering series a in table 1 is employed the characteristic ratio d λ 0 007 indicates that the existence of the cylinder does not disturb the initial isw field cai et al 2003 λ 2 14 m is the wavelength of isw nine dimensionless distances h 0 h including 0 148 0 2208 0 2664 0 3168 0 3872 0 4104 0 48 0 5784 and 0 84 are taken into account flow fields at the time t 12 5 and 15 25s at which the maximum horizontal and vertical forces imposing on the isolated cylinder for most typical cases are revealed fig 8 indicates that the range and strength of vorticity around the horizontal isolated cylinder at the time of maximum vertical force are greater than those at the time of maximum horizontal force it can be seen from fig 9 that the distribution of streamlines around the cylinder at the moment of maximum vertical force is more complicated than that at the moment of maximum horizontal force as shown in the right panel of fig 8 the interaction between the positive vorticity of the isw and the cylinder induces complicated vorticity distribution fig 8 b p and r describe that a pair of vortices forms symmetrically near the upper and lower sides of the cylinder according to the vortices distribution it can be found that directions of fluids motion in the upper and lower layers are opposite due to the distances between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid shown in fig 8 b and p are smaller than that described in fig 8 r the distribution of vortices in fig 8 b and p are more complicated under the action of the positive vorticity of the isw the range of the negative vorticity around the cylinder is smaller than that of the positive vorticity around the cylinder as shown in fig 8 b and p with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid the distribution of vortices becomes more complicated fig 8 d f h and n a pair of vortices asymmetrically generates near the upper side and the lower side fig 8 d and f the intensity and range of the negative vorticity near the upper side are smaller than those of the positive one near the lower side under the effect of the positive vorticity of the isw moreover a negative vorticity is formed near the rear edge of the cylinder positive vortices are also produced near the downstream of the cylinder during the interaction between the isw and cylinder the range of the negative vorticity near the trailing edge of the upper side of the cylinder in fig 8 f is smaller than that near the trailing edge of the upper side of the cylinder in fig 8 d the range of the positive vorticity near the downstream of the cylinder in fig 8 f are larger than that near the downstream of the cylinder in fig 8 d fig 8 n describes that positive vortices generate asymmetrically on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder under the isw interaction with the cylinder the intensity of the positive vorticity near the lower side is greater than that on the upper side for the case of the cylinder crossing through the isw profile as shown in fig 8 j and l the positive and negative vortices asymmetrically alternately distribute around the cylinder the intensity and range of positive vortices are greater than those of negative vortices as described in fig 8 j and l distributions of positive vortices around the cylinder are similar fig 10 describes the distribution of maximum dynamic pressures p d m around the cylinder during the isw interaction with the isolated cylinder the p d m in fig 10 are the peak values of the dynamic pressures at those points around the cylinder over all time when the cylinder locates near the bottom or top of the wave tank the p d m distribute symmetrically from fig 10 a it can be seen that the distribution of p d m around the cylinder is symmetrical along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the 60 direction the largest and smallest values of p d m imposed on the cylinder are near the 60 and 240 respectively fig 10 h illustrates that the p d m around the cylinder distribute symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the 150 direction as described in fig 10 i the p d m distribute symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the x direction the p d m on the trailing edge are smaller than those on other positions the p d m decrease noticeably with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid whether the cylinder is placed above or below the interface fig 10 b c d and g the distribution of p d m is asymmetrical as described in fig 10 b c and d the p d m on the leading edge are larger than those on the trailing edge fig 10 b describes that the largest and smallest values of the p d m are located near 90 and 172 5 respectively positions of the smallest and largest values of the p d m in fig 10 c are located near the 90 and 315 of the cylinder respectively fig 10 g illustrates that the p d m on the lower side are smaller than those on the upper side the upper side near the 315 is subjected to the largest maximum dynamic pressure the lower side near the 135 withstands the smallest maximum dynamic pressure for the case of the cylinder crossing the interface of stratified fluid fig 10 e and f the distribution of p d m is asymmetrical fig 10 e shows that the p d m impose on the lower side are larger than those on the upper side the largest and smallest values of the p d m imposed on the cylinder are near the 45 and 225 respectively 4 isw propagations over an extended horizontal cylinder the practical marine engineering structures or support structures generally are composed of complex cylindrical structures in this section the isw interaction with the extended cylinder with different extended length are investigated the size of the wave tank and parameters of the stratified fluid used in this section are the same as those in section 3 considering the most unfavourable force condition from fig 6 series a in table 1 is employed in this section the geometry of the extend cylinder is composed of a rectangular and two semicircles at each end fig 11 the radius of the semicircle is r 0 0075 m the distance between the centres of two semicircles called extended length is s the centre coordinate of the semicircle at the front end of the rectangular is 1 9 m 0 0484 m the height of the rectangular is 0 015 m details of the extended length s considered in this part are listed in table 4 the half wavelength λ 2 of the isw used in this section is 1 055 m which is larger than the s the characteristic ratio s m a x λ 0 032 is less than 0 15 which indicates that the existence of the extended cylinder has no obvious influence on the initial isw flow field cai et al 2003 s m a x is the maximum s in table 4 it is worth noting that the geometry of the extended cylinder in the case e1 is the same as that of the isolated cylinder in the case iso11 in section 3 4 1 force and dynamic pressure on the extended cylinder to investigate the force acting on the extended cylinder the expression e x z f x z ext f x z iso is defined as the dimensionless hydrodynamic force coefficients where f x ext is the horizontal force acting on the extended cylinder f z ext is the vertical force per unit length on the cylinder and f x z iso are the maximum forces on the isolated cylinder of the case iso11 all over the numerical simulation time the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces coefficients e x z m m a x e x z t are illustrated in fig 12 the e x m on the cylinder changes from increasing to decreasing with the increase in the s d it reaches its maximum value at approximately s d 2 5 the e z m increases with the increase in the s d the relationship between the e z m and the s d tends to be linear after s d 1 0 the distribution of p d m around the extended cylinder during the interaction between the isw and the cylinder is described in fig 13 the p d m in fig 13 are the peak values of the dynamic pressures at those points over all time the patterns of the distributions of the p d m around the cylinder with different extended length s are similar as illustrated in fig 13 the p d m on the upper and lower sides decrease gradually in the direction of the isw propagation the p d m on the lower side are larger than those on the upper side the leading edge withstands larger dynamic pressures compared with the trailing edge as shown in fig 13 the p d m at the front end of the extended cylinder increase with the increase in the s however the p d m at the rear end gradually decrease with the increase in the s the largest and smallest values of the p d m are located at the lower side of the leading edge and upper side of the trailing edge respectively 4 2 flow field around the extended cylinder as a helpful instrument for presenting numerical simulation results streamlines and the vorticity field around the extended cylinder are performed in figs 14 and 15 respectively in the following study extended lengths s including e1 e4 e7 and e10 in table 4 are employed as typical cases due to the existence of density gradient along the depth of the stratified fluid system and interactions between the isw and extended cylinder the distribution of velocity streamlines is asymmetrical fig 14 at the early stage of the isw arriving at the extended cylinder the cylinder has a remarkable blocking effect on the isw propagation fig 14 a the density of streamlines below the interface of stratified fluid is greater than that of the streamlines above the interface fig 14 b as illustrated in fig 14 c after the isw propagating away from the extended cylinder a significant counterclockwise flow is formed near the lower side of the trailing edge from the left panel in fig 14 it can be observed that the blocking effect of the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s the middle panel in fig 14 indicates that the larger the s is the more complicated the streamlines become as shown in fig 14 k a remarkable counterclockwise flow forms on the upper side of the front end after the isw leaving from the cylinder the range of the counterclockwise flow near the lower side of the trailing edge increases with the increase in the s fig 14 right panel the noticeable counterclockwise flow forms on the upper side of the extended cylinder with a larger s fig 14 i and l the range of the counterclockwise flow increases with the increase in the s the larger the s the stronger the interaction between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of the cylinder as shown in fig 15 a and b the intensity of negative and positive vortices which are asymmetrically alternately distributed around the extended cylinder becomes greater during the isw interaction with the cylinder after the isw propagating away a noticeable negative vorticity exists at the lower side fig 15 c the left panel of fig 14 indicates that locations of negative and positive vortices near the lower side are almost unaffected by the extended length s at the beginning of the interaction between the isw and the cylinder the position of the negative vorticity near the semicircle upper side at the front end is almost independent of the s however the location of the positive vorticity near the upper side gradually moves forward with the increase in the s as illustrated in the middle panel of fig 15 the intensity and range of the negative and positive vortices increase after the isw propagating over the extended cylinder the range of the positive vorticity near the upper side of the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s interaction between the negative and positive vortices becomes more remarkable with the increase in the s the larger the s is the longer the distance of the negative vorticity near the lower side of the leading edge moves forward the strength of interactions between negative and positive vortices near the lower side of the rear edge becomes more noticeable with the increase in the s the increase of vortices interactions on the upper and lower sides has a remarkable effect on the maximum vertical force after the isw spreading away the vorticity field around the cylinder with a longer s is more complicated fig 15 right panel at the upstream of the cylinder the intensity of the interactions between the negative and positive vortices increase with the increase in the s fig 16 displays the comparison of dimensionless velocities u coeff e u e c mkdv and v coeff e v e c mkdv at z 0 0484 m at the moment of the maximum vertical force impose on the cylinder s where u e v e and c mkdv are horizontal vertical and phase velocity respectively fig 16 a illustrates that the u coeff e in front of the cylinder firstly decreases and then increases the inflection point of the u coeff e ahead of the extended cylinder is recorded as i the u coeff e ahead of i decrease with the increase in the s as the extended length s increases the inflection point i moves forward the u coeff e between i and the cylinder increases with the increase in the s there are two inflection points in the change of the u coeff e which are ii and iii respectively behind the cylinder the u coeff e between the cylinder and ii decreases with the increase in the x as the increase in the x the u coeff e between ii and iii increases gradually the u coeff e behind iii decreases gradually with the increase in the x the u coeff e increases with the increase in the s for cases e2 e10 the u coeff e between the cylinder and ii in case e1 is slightly larger than that in case e3 fig 16 b shows that the v coeff e in front of the cylinder firstly increases and then decreases the effect of the increases in the s on the v coeff e ahead of the inflection point iv is negligible the v coeff e between iv and the cylinder decreases with the increase in the s the v coeff e behind the cylinder increases gradually with the increase in the x the v coeff e tends to be the same at x 2 05m 5 isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders for the practical marine engineering structures composed of cylinders arranged in tandem or side by side the interference between cylinders has a significant effect on the flow field around each cylinder an isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders with different centre to centre distances are investigated in this section the basic setting of the wave tank is the same as that in section 3 the η and δ used in this section are 0 72 cm and 2 8 cm respectively which are the same as those in section 4 the diameter of the two tandem cylinders shown in fig 17 is d 0 015 m the centre to centre distance between two tandem cylinders is l centre coordinates of two tandem cylinders are 1 9 m 0 0484 m and 1 9 l 0 0484 m two tandem cylinders are named cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 respectively as described in table 5 ten kinds of l are considered to investigate the isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders the half wavelength λ 2 of the isw used in this section is 1 055 m which is larger than the l the characteristic ratio l m a x λ 0 042 is less than 0 15 which indicates that the existence of tandem cylinders has no obvious influence on the initial isw flow field cai et al 2003 l m a x is the maximum l in table 5 5 1 force and dynamic pressure on two tandem cylinders to get a better understanding of forces on two tandem cylinders the expression d i x z f i x z dou f x z iso is defined as the dimensionless hydrodynamic force coefficients where f i x z dou are the forces acting on each of two tandem cylinders i 1 denotes the cylinder 1 and i 2 denotes the cylinder 2 the f x z iso are defined as the same as those in section 4 the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces coefficients d i x z m m a x d i x z t in numerical simulations are illustrated in fig 18 fig 18 indicates that the centre to centre distance between two tandem cylinders plays a significant role in the force the horizontal forces acting on each of two cylinders are smaller than those on the isolated cylinder this pattern is consistent with that mentioned in wang wang et al 2016 due to the addition of the cylinder the maximum horizontal force on the cylinder 1 is significantly reduced compared with that on the isolated cylinder after the dimensionless centre to centre distance l d exceeding 2 5 the maximum horizontal force on the cylinder 1 changes from decreasing to increasing with the increase in the l d the relationship between d 2 x m acting on the cylinder 2 and l d is similar to that between d 1 x m on the cylinder 1 and l d fig 16 a the maximum horizontal force acting on the cylinder 2 is smaller than that on the isolated cylinder before the l d reaching 6 when l d 2 5 the maximum horizontal forces on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are 48 9 and 84 4 of the maximum horizontal force on the isolated cylinder respectively fig 18 b indicates that maximum vertical forces induced by the isw acting on horizontal cylinders arranged in tandem are larger than those on the isolated cylinder the smaller the l d is the larger the maximum vertical forces on the two tandem cylinders become the increases in maximum vertical forces on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are only 6 and 1 3 of those on the isolated cylinder respectively as described in fig 18 c the maximum horizontal forces on the cylinder 2 are significantly larger than those on the cylinder 1 the extremum of the d 2 x m on the cylinder 2 is 1 725 times that on the cylinder 1 when l d 2 5 the d 2 z m on the cylinder 2 is smaller than that on the cylinder 1 the difference between vertical forces acting on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 decreases gradually with the increase in the l d fig 19 illustrates that the smallest p d m around each of two tandem cylinders is located at 225 of the cylinder the lower side of the leading edge of the cylinder withstands the greater p d m fig 19 indicates that distributions of p d m values around each of two tandem cylinders are similar to those around the isolated cylinder described in fig 10 e under the same conditions of η δ and h 0 h the p d m on the leading edge and lower side of each cylinder are larger than those on the trailing edge and upper side respectively the largest maximum dynamic pressure imposes on the lower side of the leading edge of each cylinder the upper side of the trailing edge of each cylinder subjects to the smallest maximum dynamic pressure as illustrated in fig 19 p d m on the cylinder 1 are larger than those on the cylinder 2 with the increase in the l the difference in p d m around the cylinder 1 is negligible the p d m on cylinder 2 gradually decrease with the increase in the l 5 2 flow field around two tandem cylinders in the following study centre to centre distances l including d1 d4 d7 and d10 in table 5 are employed as typical cases as illustrated in fig 20 the distribution of velocity streamlines induced by interactions between the isw and cylinders arranged in tandem is asymmetrical when the isw arrives at the two cylinders as shown in fig 20 a both cylinders have the blocking effect on the propagation of isw during the isw interaction with the two cylinders distributions of streamlines in the front of the cylinder 1 and the rear of the cylinder 2 are similar to those around the isolated cylinder fig 20 a b when the isw spreads away from the cylinder 2 counterclockwise flow appears at the leading and trailing edges of the cylinder 1 counterclockwise flow also forms at the upper side of the leading edge and lower side of the trailing edge of the cylinder 2 the interaction between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of two cylinders is described in fig 20 c at the beginning of the isw interaction with the two cylinders the left panel of fig 20 indicates that the blocking effect induced by cylinders on the isw leading edge is insensitive to the change of the l after the isw propagating over two tandem cylinders the blocking effect on the spread of the trailing edge of the isw increase with the decrease in the l fig 20 middle panel according to the distribution of the flow between the two cylinders as illustrated in fig 9 the interaction of the clockwise and counterclockwise flow decreases with the increase in the l the range of counterclockwise flow on the rear edge of the lower side of each cylinder increases and decreases with the increase in the l respectively the smaller the l is the smaller the range of interactions between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of two cylinders is during the isw interaction with two tandem cylinders fig 21 a b indicate that the strength of interactions between the negative and positive vortices increases with the increase in the interaction between the isw and cylinders after the isw propagating away from the two cylinders fig 21 c the range and intensity of interactions between the positive and negative vortices decrease noticeably at the early stage of the isw arriving at two tandem cylinders the left panel of fig 21 indicates that vortices near the leading edge of the cylinder 1 are insensitive to the change of the l the range of vortices around the cylinder 1 is larger than that around the cylinder 2 according to the variation of vortices range in front of the cylinder 2 interactions of vortices between the two cylinders decrease with the increase in the l as described in the middle panel of fig 21 the range and intensity of vortices around the cylinder 1 are smaller than those of vortices around the cylinder 2 after the isw propagating over two tandem cylinders from fig 21 b it can be observed that vortices between two cylinders are combinations of vortices behind the cylinder 1 and at front of the cylinder 2 fig 21 e h and k indicate that the smaller l makes it easier for vortices at the trailing edge of the cylinder 1 to interact with vortices at the leading edge of the cylinder 2 the decreases in vorticity interactions indicate that the velocity between two cylinders will decrease from eq 2 it can be found that the pressure around the cylinder increases with the decrease in the fluid velocity around the cylinder according to the conclusion in ding ding et al 2020 the force on the submersible structure exerted by the isw propagation is dominated by the pressure therefore interactions of vortices existing between two cylinders have a significant effect on forces acting on tandem cylinders vortices interactions between two cylinders have the most remarkable influence on reducing the horizontal force acting on two cylinders when l d 2 5 as illustrated in figs 18 a 19 and 21 middle panel after the isw propagating away fig 21 right panel the strength of vortices around two tandem cylinders decreases fig 22 displays the comparison of dimensionless velocities u coeff t u t c mkdv and v coeff t v t c mkdv at z 0 0484 m at the moment of the maximum vertical force impose on the cylinder where u t v t and c mkdv are horizontal vertical and phase velocity respectively fig a illustrates that the u coeff t in front of the cylinder1 firstly decreases and then increases fig b shows that the v coeff t ahead the cylinder1 firstly increases and then decreases the variable of centre to centre distance l has no obvious effect on the velocity in front of the cylinder1 as displayed in fig 22 a the u coeff t between two tandem cylinders for cases d1 d3 firstly decreases and then increases the u coeff t decreases with the increase in the l for cases d4 d10 changes in the u coeff t become complicated three inflection points which are iia iib and iic respectively can be observed iib is the peak of the u coeff t while the iia and iic are the valley values of the u coeff t the u coeff t between two tandem cylinders increases with the increase in the l from fig 22 b it can be seen that the v coeff t between two cylinders in case d1 decreases gradually with the increase in the x for d2 and d3 two inflection points which are v and vi respectively can be observed however the inflection point of v coeff t in cases d4 d10 is reduced to one fig 22 a indicates that there are two inflection points iii and iv in the change of u coeff t behind the cylinder2 the u coeff t between the cylinder and iii decreases with the increase in the x as the increase in the x the u coeff t between iii and iv increases gradually the u coeff t behind iv decreases gradually with the increase in the x the u coeff t decreases with the increase in the l fig 22 b illustrates that the v coeff t behind the cylinder increases gradually with the increase in the x fig indicates that the velocity tends to be the same at x 2 05m 6 conclusions this paper employs a numerical model based upon the navier stokes equations to investigate hydrodynamic forces dynamic pressures and flow field around various horizontal cylinders under the action of an isw for the interaction between isw and the isolated cylinder good agreements between numerical results and experimental data in terms of forces acting on the cylinder are obtained indicating that the model can accurately predict the isw induced forces on the horizontal cylinder the horizontal force on the isolated cylinder reaches its maximum value when the cylinder is close to the bottom of the wave tank the isolated cylinder subjects the maximum vertical force when the cylinder centre is near the interface of stratified fluid with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid the distribution of vortices around the cylinder becomes more complicated however the maximum dynamic pressures around the isolated cylinder increase with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and interface for the extended cylinder with different extended length s the hydrodynamic forces dynamic pressures and flow field around the cylinder are sensitive to the variation of the s the maximum vertical force increases almost linearly with the increase in the s after the dimensionless extended length s d exceeds 1 therefore special consideration should be paid to the vertical load induced by the isw in the design of relevant marine structures the changes of the maximum horizontal force is non monotonous with the increase in the s d it reaches its maximum value when s d 2 5 the lower side of the leading edge and the upper side of the trailing edge of the extended cylinder are subjected to the larger and the smaller dynamic pressures respectively with the increase in the s the flow field around the cylinder becomes more complicated vortices generated near the upper and lower sides of the extended cylinder have a noticeable effect on the maximum vertical force for the velocity in front of the extended cylinder the horizontal velocity ahead of the velocity inflexion point decreases with the increase in the s the vertical velocity behind the velocity inflexion point decreases with the increase in the s the horizontal velocity behind the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s the investigation on the propagation of an isw over two tandem horizontal cylinders indicates that the horizontal forces on each of the two cylinders are smaller than those on the isolated cylinder the maximum horizontal forces on the two cylinders are only 48 9 and 84 4 of those on the isolated cylinder when the dimensionless centre to centre distance l d reaches 2 5 the vertical forces on the two cylinders decrease with the increase in the l d the comparison of forces between the two cylinders indicates that larger horizontal forces and smaller vertical forces are imposed on the rear cylinder vortices interactions between the two cylinders remarkably reduce the horizontal force acting on the two cylinders when l d 2 5 the effect of l on the velocity in front of the cylinder 1 is negligible the velocity behind the cylinder 2 decreases with the increase in the l before l d reaches 2 5 the horizontal velocity between two tandem cylinders decreases with the increase in the l however after l d reaches 2 5 the horizontal velocity between two tandem cylinders increases with the increase in the l and becomes more complicated the above conclusions about the interaction between the isw and horizontal cylinder including the extended cylinder and two tandem cylinders are obtained on the premise that the isw amplitude is 0 72 cm when the amplitude or wavelength change the results of the interaction between the isw and the two types of horizontal cylinder

pressures flow field horizontal cylinders 1 introduction with the continuous advancement of marine engineering technology the enthusiasm of offshore countries for the development and utilization of marine resources continues to rise submerged vehicle and marine engineering structures such as offshore drilling platforms submarine pipelines or support cylinders are often subjected to the impact of the surrounding sea and submerged currents while undertaking the task of developing marine resources internal waves can penetrate almost the entire ocean depth and generate large wave forces that can cause the marine engineering structure to move or twist as a whole bole et al 1994 according to the statistics of roberts 1975 the maximum vertical amplitude is even 180 m internal solitary waves isws are typical representatives of internal waves because of their frequent activities the balance between nonlinearity and frequency dispersion is responsible for the propagation of isws with a constant waveform and propagation velocity in oceans as described in song song et al 2011 the force order magnitude of the isw acting on the submerged structure in the finite depth two layer fluid is the same as that of the surface wave and the isw induced maximum total horizontal force is roughly 1 3 of the surface wave force consequently the hydrodynamic loads induced by isws are assignable threats to the safe operation of submerged structures zhang and li 2007 the practical marine engineering structures such as semi submersible platforms tension leg platforms tlp spar platforms and float production storage and offloading fpso are generally composed of complex cylindrical structures kurup et al 2015 wang et al 2018 it is of practical significance to study the forces caused by the isw acting on the cylindrical structure which is one of the basic forms of the offshore engineering structure the study of loads on cylindrical structures induced by an isw has been conducted by many researchers in numerous ways ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 experimentally studied the isw induced forces acting on the submerged horizontal cylinder in the stratified system and found the position where the cylinder is subjected to the maximum horizontal and vertical forces through the newly developed wave maker and hydrodynamic load measurement technology wei wei et al 2014 confirmed the interaction characteristics between internal waves and the submerged slender body cai cai et al 2003 2006 2008 calculated forces and torques acting on the vertical cylinder exerted by isws based on the morison empirical formula and analysed the impact of background shear flows on forces xie xie et al 2010 song song et al 2011 si si et al 2012 xu xu et al 2012 lv lü et al 2016 respectively used the morison empirical formula combined with various isw theory to estimate the isw induced forces on vertical cylindrical piles wang wang et al 2016 investigated isw forces on two tandem vertical cylinders by using the numerical simulation and found that hydrodynamic interactions are sensitive to the centre to centre distance of two cylinders nevertheless experiments or numerical studies on the investigations of forces induced by the isw interaction with the horizontal cylindrical structures are rare in the literatures thus this paper aims to investigate the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the isw on horizontal cylinders by using the numerical simulation the type of the horizontal cylinders includes an isolated cylinder located at different positions an extended cylinder with different extended lengths and two tandem cylinders with different centre to centre distances to further reveal the characteristics of the interactions between an isw and horizontal cylinders maximum dynamic pressures and the flow field around horizontal cylinders which are rarely used by aforementioned researchers are also employed the numerical model is listed in section 2 an isw propagation over an isolated horizontal cylinder is investigated in section 3 results of the isw interactions with the extended horizontal cylinder and two tandem horizontal cylinders are addressed in sections 4 and 5 respectively finally conclusions are given in section 6 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the isw flow field is governed by the mass continuity equation and the reynolds average navier

z d γ where f x z are the horizontal and vertical forces γ is the wetted surface of the cylinder n x n z are the outward unit normal vector of the cylinder surface the values of the variables in eqs 21 22 are stored in the grid nodes around the cylindrical surface 2 3 numerical method the numerical model developed for this investigation is based on the openfoam library the interface between upper and lower layers is captured by vof method hirt nichols time advancement is performed by the implicit euler method meng and zhang 2016 the finite volume method fvm is used to discretise the spatial term on a structured grid the velocity gradient on the left hand side of eq 1 is obtained by the gaussian linear interpolation jasak 1996 the second order total variation diminishing tvd limited linear scheme is employed to discretise the convection term in eq 2 harten 1983 the linearized source terms on the right hand side of eq 2 are integrated over a control volume the superbee scheme is

wave koop and butler 1981 a narrow relaxation zone is set on the right side of the numerical wave tank to absorb the reflected wave the details of the relaxation zone can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 the initial density distribution with a pycnocline as shown in fig 1 can be expressed by the following equation chen et al 2007 12b ρ z ρ 1 ρ 2 2 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 t a n h s z z c η where z is the vertical coordinate z c is the location of mid pycnocline or interface level s is the reciprocal of the half depth in the lower layer defined from the interface level the position of the value ρ 1 ρ 2 2 in the pycnocline is the stratified fluid interface when the velocity of the flow field is initialized the pycnocline above the fluid interface is treated as the upper fluid and vice versa therefore the initial velocity obtained from eq 20 is also applicable to the pycnocline 3 isw interaction with an isolated horizontal cylinder the cylinder is the basic structure of marine engineering or support structures numerical simulations of the isw propagation over an isolated horizontal cylinder located at different positions are conducted in this section hydrodynamic loads flow field and maximum dynamic pressures around the cylinder are revealed 3 1 computational setup a two dimensional numerical wave tank is established to simulate the elevation type isw the basic sizes of the wave tank which is filled with two layers of fluids are 4 m long in the horizontal direction and 0 125 m deep in the vertical direction as shown in fig 2 the red dashed line represents the interface of two layers the densities in the upper and lower layer fluids are ρ 1 1000 kg m3 and ρ 2 1021 kg m3 respectively the relative density difference between ρ 1 and ρ 2 is 0 021 ψ ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 in the isw propagation region the thicknesses of the upper and lower layer are h 1 and h 2 respectively the centre coordinate of the cylinder with a diameter of d 0 015 m is 1 9 m h 0 to ensure the stability and efficiency of the numerical simulation the courant number c o u δ t δ l is set to 0 2 in all numerical simulations δ t is the adjustable time step and δ l is the discrete grid size 3 2 grid independence analysis to avoid the dependence of numerical simulation results on the grid accuracy this part performs the grid independence analysis fig 3 indicates that three kinds of spatial resolutions around the isolated cylinder are considered the generation of grid is done by employing the standard mesh generator snappyhexmesh both the grid size δ l around the isolated cylinder and the total grid number n for each grid size are listed in table 1 the isw amplitude 0 0072 m pycnocline thickness 0 028 m and cylinder centre relative height h 0 h 0 3872 are used in the grid independence analysis figs 4 and 5 describe numerical results of three different grids including the hydrodynamic force coefficient acting on the cylinder and the dimensionless velocity at z h 0 the force coefficients per unit length of the cylinder are defined as c x z f x z ρ 1 gaw where f x z are forces acting on the cylinder a is the cylinder cross sectional area and w is the unit length of the cylinder maximum force coefficients c x z m m a x c x z t of three different grids are also listed in table 1 generally the higher the grid accuracy is the smaller the numerical error becomes as illustrated in fig 4 there is a remarkable difference of c x z between the case sparse and case medium with the increase in the grid accuracy while the difference of c x z between case medium and case dense is tiny fig 5 indicates that the difference of dimensionless velocity at z h 0 between the case sparse and case medium is noticeable however the difference of corresponding results simulated by the case medium and case dense is negligible according to the grid independence analysis above all the following numerical simulations use the same grid resolution as the case medium to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulation 3 3 force on the isolated cylinder to verify the accuracy of the numerical model in this paper the numerical simulation results of an isw propagation over the isolated cylinder located at different positions are compared with the laboratory experiment data obtained by ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 two pycnocline thicknesses including 2 8 cm and 3 9 cm are used in this part the isw amplitude η and pycnocline thickness δ used in numerical simulations are listed in table 2 nineteen cylinder centre relative heights shown in table 3 are considered in this verification process the comparisons of maximum hydrodynamic force coefficients in each series of numerical simulations are illustrated in fig 6 it is noted that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 6 a the c x m reaches the extremum while the cylinder position is approaching the wave tank bottom h 0 h 0 0125 the c x m decreases with the increase in h 0 h as the cylinder centre is near the position of h 0 h 2 η owing to the existence of a discontinuous tangential velocity at the interface between the upper and lower layer fluids ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 the c x m reaches the minimum the horizontal force begins to rise as the h 0 h continues to increase for h 0 h 0 6 c x m approaches the constant value 0 04 under this circumstance the isolated cylinder is completely in the upper layer fluid the horizontal force induced by the isw propagation acting on the cylinder is imposed by the fluid motion the constancy of c x m satisfies the assumption of the conventional shallow water theory that the horizontal fluid velocity is uniformly distributed along the direction of fluid depth grue et al 1999 the comparison of maximum vertical force coefficient c z m between numerical simulation and experimental data is demonstrated in fig 6 b the c z m increases with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder centre position and the interface of stratified fluid when the cylinder located in the lower layer fluid however the c z m gradually decreases with the increase in the distance between the cylinder centre position and the interface of stratified fluid when the cylinder located in the upper layer fluid when the cylinder centre is near the position of h 0 h 2 η the c z m on cylinder reaches the maximum fig 6 indicates that the numerical results generally agree well with the experimental data the pattern of c x z m is similar under the nearly unchanged isw amplitude and significantly varied pycnocline thickness to investigate characteristics of forces on the isolated cylinder located at different positions hydrodynamic force coefficients versus time are described in fig 7 cases including iso2 iso4 iso6 iso8 iso11 iso13 iso15 iso17 and iso19 listed in table 2 are employed as typical cases series a in table 1 is used as illustrated in fig 7 a the positive c x indicates that the direction of the force is the same as that of the isw propagation and vice versa for cases of the cylinder located below the interface of stratified fluid such as cases iso2 iso4 iso6 and iso8 the larger the distance between the cylinder and interface is the larger the c x becomes compared with other cases shown in fig 7 the cylinder in the case iso11 subjects to a smaller horizontal force fig 7 b indicates that a larger vertical force imposes on the isolated cylinder which is located at the interface of stratified fluid the larger the distance between the cylinder and interface is the smaller the c z becomes for the case of the isolated cylinder locating near the top or bottom of the wave tank the c z acting on the cylinder approaches zero at the time t 12 5 and 15 25s the c x and c z reach maximum for most typical cases 3 4 flow field and dynamic pressure around the isolated cylinder flow fields including the vortices and streamlines around the isolated horizontal cylinder are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 for cases considering series a in table 1 is employed the characteristic ratio d λ 0 007 indicates that the existence of the cylinder does not disturb the initial isw field cai et al 2003 λ 2 14 m is the wavelength of isw nine dimensionless distances h 0 h including 0 148 0 2208 0 2664 0 3168 0 3872 0 4104 0 48 0 5784 and 0 84 are taken into account flow fields at the time t 12 5 and 15 25s at which the maximum horizontal and vertical forces imposing on the isolated cylinder for most typical cases are revealed fig 8 indicates that the range and strength of vorticity around the horizontal isolated cylinder at the time of maximum vertical force are greater than those at the time of maximum horizontal force it can be seen from fig 9 that the distribution of streamlines around the cylinder at the moment of maximum vertical force is more complicated than that at the moment of maximum horizontal force as shown in the right panel of fig 8 the interaction between the positive vorticity of the isw and the cylinder induces complicated vorticity distribution fig 8 b p and r describe that a pair of vortices forms symmetrically near the upper and lower sides of the cylinder according to the vortices distribution it can be found that directions of fluids motion in the upper and lower layers are opposite due to the distances between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid shown in fig 8 b and p are smaller than that described in fig 8 r the distribution of vortices in fig 8 b and p are more complicated under the action of the positive vorticity of the isw the range of the negative vorticity around the cylinder is smaller than that of the positive vorticity around the cylinder as shown in fig 8 b and p with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid the distribution of vortices becomes more complicated fig 8 d f h and n a pair of vortices asymmetrically generates near the upper side and the lower side fig 8 d and f the intensity and range of the negative vorticity near the upper side are smaller than those of the positive one near the lower side under the effect of the positive vorticity of the isw moreover a negative vorticity is formed near the rear edge of the cylinder positive vortices are also produced near the downstream of the cylinder during the interaction between the isw and cylinder the range of the negative vorticity near the trailing edge of the upper side of the cylinder in fig 8 f is smaller than that near the trailing edge of the upper side of the cylinder in fig 8 d the range of the positive vorticity near the downstream of the cylinder in fig 8 f are larger than that near the downstream of the cylinder in fig 8 d fig 8 n describes that positive vortices generate asymmetrically on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder under the isw interaction with the cylinder the intensity of the positive vorticity near the lower side is greater than that on the upper side for the case of the cylinder crossing through the isw profile as shown in fig 8 j and l the positive and negative vortices asymmetrically alternately distribute around the cylinder the intensity and range of positive vortices are greater than those of negative vortices as described in fig 8 j and l distributions of positive vortices around the cylinder are similar fig 10 describes the distribution of maximum dynamic pressures p d m around the cylinder during the isw interaction with the isolated cylinder the p d m in fig 10 are the peak values of the dynamic pressures at those points around the cylinder over all time when the cylinder locates near the bottom or top of the wave tank the p d m distribute symmetrically from fig 10 a it can be seen that the distribution of p d m around the cylinder is symmetrical along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the 60 direction the largest and smallest values of p d m imposed on the cylinder are near the 60 and 240 respectively fig 10 h illustrates that the p d m around the cylinder distribute symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the 150 direction as described in fig 10 i the p d m distribute symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the cylinder in the x direction the p d m on the trailing edge are smaller than those on other positions the p d m decrease noticeably with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid whether the cylinder is placed above or below the interface fig 10 b c d and g the distribution of p d m is asymmetrical as described in fig 10 b c and d the p d m on the leading edge are larger than those on the trailing edge fig 10 b describes that the largest and smallest values of the p d m are located near 90 and 172 5 respectively positions of the smallest and largest values of the p d m in fig 10 c are located near the 90 and 315 of the cylinder respectively fig 10 g illustrates that the p d m on the lower side are smaller than those on the upper side the upper side near the 315 is subjected to the largest maximum dynamic pressure the lower side near the 135 withstands the smallest maximum dynamic pressure for the case of the cylinder crossing the interface of stratified fluid fig 10 e and f the distribution of p d m is asymmetrical fig 10 e shows that the p d m impose on the lower side are larger than those on the upper side the largest and smallest values of the p d m imposed on the cylinder are near the 45 and 225 respectively 4 isw propagations over an extended horizontal cylinder the practical marine engineering structures or support structures generally are composed of complex cylindrical structures in this section the isw interaction with the extended cylinder with different extended length are investigated the size of the wave tank and parameters of the stratified fluid used in this section are the same as those in section 3 considering the most unfavourable force condition from fig 6 series a in table 1 is employed in this section the geometry of the extend cylinder is composed of a rectangular and two semicircles at each end fig 11 the radius of the semicircle is r 0 0075 m the distance between the centres of two semicircles called extended length is s the centre coordinate of the semicircle at the front end of the rectangular is 1 9 m 0 0484 m the height of the rectangular is 0 015 m details of the extended length s considered in this part are listed in table 4 the half wavelength λ 2 of the isw used in this section is 1 055 m which is larger than the s the characteristic ratio s m a x λ 0 032 is less than 0 15 which indicates that the existence of the extended cylinder has no obvious influence on the initial isw flow field cai et al 2003 s m a x is the maximum s in table 4 it is worth noting that the geometry of the extended cylinder in the case e1 is the same as that of the isolated cylinder in the case iso11 in section 3 4 1 force and dynamic pressure on the extended cylinder to investigate the force acting on the extended cylinder the expression e x z f x z ext f x z iso is defined as the dimensionless hydrodynamic force coefficients where f x ext is the horizontal force acting on the extended cylinder f z ext is the vertical force per unit length on the cylinder and f x z iso are the maximum forces on the isolated cylinder of the case iso11 all over the numerical simulation time the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces coefficients e x z m m a x e x z t are illustrated in fig 12 the e x m on the cylinder changes from increasing to decreasing with the increase in the s d it reaches its maximum value at approximately s d 2 5 the e z m increases with the increase in the s d the relationship between the e z m and the s d tends to be linear after s d 1 0 the distribution of p d m around the extended cylinder during the interaction between the isw and the cylinder is described in fig 13 the p d m in fig 13 are the peak values of the dynamic pressures at those points over all time the patterns of the distributions of the p d m around the cylinder with different extended length s are similar as illustrated in fig 13 the p d m on the upper and lower sides decrease gradually in the direction of the isw propagation the p d m on the lower side are larger than those on the upper side the leading edge withstands larger dynamic pressures compared with the trailing edge as shown in fig 13 the p d m at the front end of the extended cylinder increase with the increase in the s however the p d m at the rear end gradually decrease with the increase in the s the largest and smallest values of the p d m are located at the lower side of the leading edge and upper side of the trailing edge respectively 4 2 flow field around the extended cylinder as a helpful instrument for presenting numerical simulation results streamlines and the vorticity field around the extended cylinder are performed in figs 14 and 15 respectively in the following study extended lengths s including e1 e4 e7 and e10 in table 4 are employed as typical cases due to the existence of density gradient along the depth of the stratified fluid system and interactions between the isw and extended cylinder the distribution of velocity streamlines is asymmetrical fig 14 at the early stage of the isw arriving at the extended cylinder the cylinder has a remarkable blocking effect on the isw propagation fig 14 a the density of streamlines below the interface of stratified fluid is greater than that of the streamlines above the interface fig 14 b as illustrated in fig 14 c after the isw propagating away from the extended cylinder a significant counterclockwise flow is formed near the lower side of the trailing edge from the left panel in fig 14 it can be observed that the blocking effect of the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s the middle panel in fig 14 indicates that the larger the s is the more complicated the streamlines become as shown in fig 14 k a remarkable counterclockwise flow forms on the upper side of the front end after the isw leaving from the cylinder the range of the counterclockwise flow near the lower side of the trailing edge increases with the increase in the s fig 14 right panel the noticeable counterclockwise flow forms on the upper side of the extended cylinder with a larger s fig 14 i and l the range of the counterclockwise flow increases with the increase in the s the larger the s the stronger the interaction between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of the cylinder as shown in fig 15 a and b the intensity of negative and positive vortices which are asymmetrically alternately distributed around the extended cylinder becomes greater during the isw interaction with the cylinder after the isw propagating away a noticeable negative vorticity exists at the lower side fig 15 c the left panel of fig 14 indicates that locations of negative and positive vortices near the lower side are almost unaffected by the extended length s at the beginning of the interaction between the isw and the cylinder the position of the negative vorticity near the semicircle upper side at the front end is almost independent of the s however the location of the positive vorticity near the upper side gradually moves forward with the increase in the s as illustrated in the middle panel of fig 15 the intensity and range of the negative and positive vortices increase after the isw propagating over the extended cylinder the range of the positive vorticity near the upper side of the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s interaction between the negative and positive vortices becomes more remarkable with the increase in the s the larger the s is the longer the distance of the negative vorticity near the lower side of the leading edge moves forward the strength of interactions between negative and positive vortices near the lower side of the rear edge becomes more noticeable with the increase in the s the increase of vortices interactions on the upper and lower sides has a remarkable effect on the maximum vertical force after the isw spreading away the vorticity field around the cylinder with a longer s is more complicated fig 15 right panel at the upstream of the cylinder the intensity of the interactions between the negative and positive vortices increase with the increase in the s fig 16 displays the comparison of dimensionless velocities u coeff e u e c mkdv and v coeff e v e c mkdv at z 0 0484 m at the moment of the maximum vertical force impose on the cylinder s where u e v e and c mkdv are horizontal vertical and phase velocity respectively fig 16 a illustrates that the u coeff e in front of the cylinder firstly decreases and then increases the inflection point of the u coeff e ahead of the extended cylinder is recorded as i the u coeff e ahead of i decrease with the increase in the s as the extended length s increases the inflection point i moves forward the u coeff e between i and the cylinder increases with the increase in the s there are two inflection points in the change of the u coeff e which are ii and iii respectively behind the cylinder the u coeff e between the cylinder and ii decreases with the increase in the x as the increase in the x the u coeff e between ii and iii increases gradually the u coeff e behind iii decreases gradually with the increase in the x the u coeff e increases with the increase in the s for cases e2 e10 the u coeff e between the cylinder and ii in case e1 is slightly larger than that in case e3 fig 16 b shows that the v coeff e in front of the cylinder firstly increases and then decreases the effect of the increases in the s on the v coeff e ahead of the inflection point iv is negligible the v coeff e between iv and the cylinder decreases with the increase in the s the v coeff e behind the cylinder increases gradually with the increase in the x the v coeff e tends to be the same at x 2 05m 5 isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders for the practical marine engineering structures composed of cylinders arranged in tandem or side by side the interference between cylinders has a significant effect on the flow field around each cylinder an isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders with different centre to centre distances are investigated in this section the basic setting of the wave tank is the same as that in section 3 the η and δ used in this section are 0 72 cm and 2 8 cm respectively which are the same as those in section 4 the diameter of the two tandem cylinders shown in fig 17 is d 0 015 m the centre to centre distance between two tandem cylinders is l centre coordinates of two tandem cylinders are 1 9 m 0 0484 m and 1 9 l 0 0484 m two tandem cylinders are named cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 respectively as described in table 5 ten kinds of l are considered to investigate the isw propagations over two tandem horizontal cylinders the half wavelength λ 2 of the isw used in this section is 1 055 m which is larger than the l the characteristic ratio l m a x λ 0 042 is less than 0 15 which indicates that the existence of tandem cylinders has no obvious influence on the initial isw flow field cai et al 2003 l m a x is the maximum l in table 5 5 1 force and dynamic pressure on two tandem cylinders to get a better understanding of forces on two tandem cylinders the expression d i x z f i x z dou f x z iso is defined as the dimensionless hydrodynamic force coefficients where f i x z dou are the forces acting on each of two tandem cylinders i 1 denotes the cylinder 1 and i 2 denotes the cylinder 2 the f x z iso are defined as the same as those in section 4 the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces coefficients d i x z m m a x d i x z t in numerical simulations are illustrated in fig 18 fig 18 indicates that the centre to centre distance between two tandem cylinders plays a significant role in the force the horizontal forces acting on each of two cylinders are smaller than those on the isolated cylinder this pattern is consistent with that mentioned in wang wang et al 2016 due to the addition of the cylinder the maximum horizontal force on the cylinder 1 is significantly reduced compared with that on the isolated cylinder after the dimensionless centre to centre distance l d exceeding 2 5 the maximum horizontal force on the cylinder 1 changes from decreasing to increasing with the increase in the l d the relationship between d 2 x m acting on the cylinder 2 and l d is similar to that between d 1 x m on the cylinder 1 and l d fig 16 a the maximum horizontal force acting on the cylinder 2 is smaller than that on the isolated cylinder before the l d reaching 6 when l d 2 5 the maximum horizontal forces on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are 48 9 and 84 4 of the maximum horizontal force on the isolated cylinder respectively fig 18 b indicates that maximum vertical forces induced by the isw acting on horizontal cylinders arranged in tandem are larger than those on the isolated cylinder the smaller the l d is the larger the maximum vertical forces on the two tandem cylinders become the increases in maximum vertical forces on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are only 6 and 1 3 of those on the isolated cylinder respectively as described in fig 18 c the maximum horizontal forces on the cylinder 2 are significantly larger than those on the cylinder 1 the extremum of the d 2 x m on the cylinder 2 is 1 725 times that on the cylinder 1 when l d 2 5 the d 2 z m on the cylinder 2 is smaller than that on the cylinder 1 the difference between vertical forces acting on the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 decreases gradually with the increase in the l d fig 19 illustrates that the smallest p d m around each of two tandem cylinders is located at 225 of the cylinder the lower side of the leading edge of the cylinder withstands the greater p d m fig 19 indicates that distributions of p d m values around each of two tandem cylinders are similar to those around the isolated cylinder described in fig 10 e under the same conditions of η δ and h 0 h the p d m on the leading edge and lower side of each cylinder are larger than those on the trailing edge and upper side respectively the largest maximum dynamic pressure imposes on the lower side of the leading edge of each cylinder the upper side of the trailing edge of each cylinder subjects to the smallest maximum dynamic pressure as illustrated in fig 19 p d m on the cylinder 1 are larger than those on the cylinder 2 with the increase in the l the difference in p d m around the cylinder 1 is negligible the p d m on cylinder 2 gradually decrease with the increase in the l 5 2 flow field around two tandem cylinders in the following study centre to centre distances l including d1 d4 d7 and d10 in table 5 are employed as typical cases as illustrated in fig 20 the distribution of velocity streamlines induced by interactions between the isw and cylinders arranged in tandem is asymmetrical when the isw arrives at the two cylinders as shown in fig 20 a both cylinders have the blocking effect on the propagation of isw during the isw interaction with the two cylinders distributions of streamlines in the front of the cylinder 1 and the rear of the cylinder 2 are similar to those around the isolated cylinder fig 20 a b when the isw spreads away from the cylinder 2 counterclockwise flow appears at the leading and trailing edges of the cylinder 1 counterclockwise flow also forms at the upper side of the leading edge and lower side of the trailing edge of the cylinder 2 the interaction between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of two cylinders is described in fig 20 c at the beginning of the isw interaction with the two cylinders the left panel of fig 20 indicates that the blocking effect induced by cylinders on the isw leading edge is insensitive to the change of the l after the isw propagating over two tandem cylinders the blocking effect on the spread of the trailing edge of the isw increase with the decrease in the l fig 20 middle panel according to the distribution of the flow between the two cylinders as illustrated in fig 9 the interaction of the clockwise and counterclockwise flow decreases with the increase in the l the range of counterclockwise flow on the rear edge of the lower side of each cylinder increases and decreases with the increase in the l respectively the smaller the l is the smaller the range of interactions between the counterclockwise and clockwise flow at the upstream of two cylinders is during the isw interaction with two tandem cylinders fig 21 a b indicate that the strength of interactions between the negative and positive vortices increases with the increase in the interaction between the isw and cylinders after the isw propagating away from the two cylinders fig 21 c the range and intensity of interactions between the positive and negative vortices decrease noticeably at the early stage of the isw arriving at two tandem cylinders the left panel of fig 21 indicates that vortices near the leading edge of the cylinder 1 are insensitive to the change of the l the range of vortices around the cylinder 1 is larger than that around the cylinder 2 according to the variation of vortices range in front of the cylinder 2 interactions of vortices between the two cylinders decrease with the increase in the l as described in the middle panel of fig 21 the range and intensity of vortices around the cylinder 1 are smaller than those of vortices around the cylinder 2 after the isw propagating over two tandem cylinders from fig 21 b it can be observed that vortices between two cylinders are combinations of vortices behind the cylinder 1 and at front of the cylinder 2 fig 21 e h and k indicate that the smaller l makes it easier for vortices at the trailing edge of the cylinder 1 to interact with vortices at the leading edge of the cylinder 2 the decreases in vorticity interactions indicate that the velocity between two cylinders will decrease from eq 2 it can be found that the pressure around the cylinder increases with the decrease in the fluid velocity around the cylinder according to the conclusion in ding ding et al 2020 the force on the submersible structure exerted by the isw propagation is dominated by the pressure therefore interactions of vortices existing between two cylinders have a significant effect on forces acting on tandem cylinders vortices interactions between two cylinders have the most remarkable influence on reducing the horizontal force acting on two cylinders when l d 2 5 as illustrated in figs 18 a 19 and 21 middle panel after the isw propagating away fig 21 right panel the strength of vortices around two tandem cylinders decreases fig 22 displays the comparison of dimensionless velocities u coeff t u t c mkdv and v coeff t v t c mkdv at z 0 0484 m at the moment of the maximum vertical force impose on the cylinder where u t v t and c mkdv are horizontal vertical and phase velocity respectively fig a illustrates that the u coeff t in front of the cylinder1 firstly decreases and then increases fig b shows that the v coeff t ahead the cylinder1 firstly increases and then decreases the variable of centre to centre distance l has no obvious effect on the velocity in front of the cylinder1 as displayed in fig 22 a the u coeff t between two tandem cylinders for cases d1 d3 firstly decreases and then increases the u coeff t decreases with the increase in the l for cases d4 d10 changes in the u coeff t become complicated three inflection points which are iia iib and iic respectively can be observed iib is the peak of the u coeff t while the iia and iic are the valley values of the u coeff t the u coeff t between two tandem cylinders increases with the increase in the l from fig 22 b it can be seen that the v coeff t between two cylinders in case d1 decreases gradually with the increase in the x for d2 and d3 two inflection points which are v and vi respectively can be observed however the inflection point of v coeff t in cases d4 d10 is reduced to one fig 22 a indicates that there are two inflection points iii and iv in the change of u coeff t behind the cylinder2 the u coeff t between the cylinder and iii decreases with the increase in the x as the increase in the x the u coeff t between iii and iv increases gradually the u coeff t behind iv decreases gradually with the increase in the x the u coeff t decreases with the increase in the l fig 22 b illustrates that the v coeff t behind the cylinder increases gradually with the increase in the x fig indicates that the velocity tends to be the same at x 2 05m 6 conclusions this paper employs a numerical model based upon the navier stokes equations to investigate hydrodynamic forces dynamic pressures and flow field around various horizontal cylinders under the action of an isw for the interaction between isw and the isolated cylinder good agreements between numerical results and experimental data in terms of forces acting on the cylinder are obtained indicating that the model can accurately predict the isw induced forces on the horizontal cylinder the horizontal force on the isolated cylinder reaches its maximum value when the cylinder is close to the bottom of the wave tank the isolated cylinder subjects the maximum vertical force when the cylinder centre is near the interface of stratified fluid with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and the interface of stratified fluid the distribution of vortices around the cylinder becomes more complicated however the maximum dynamic pressures around the isolated cylinder increase with the decrease in the distance between the cylinder and interface for the extended cylinder with different extended length s the hydrodynamic forces dynamic pressures and flow field around the cylinder are sensitive to the variation of the s the maximum vertical force increases almost linearly with the increase in the s after the dimensionless extended length s d exceeds 1 therefore special consideration should be paid to the vertical load induced by the isw in the design of relevant marine structures the changes of the maximum horizontal force is non monotonous with the increase in the s d it reaches its maximum value when s d 2 5 the lower side of the leading edge and the upper side of the trailing edge of the extended cylinder are subjected to the larger and the smaller dynamic pressures respectively with the increase in the s the flow field around the cylinder becomes more complicated vortices generated near the upper and lower sides of the extended cylinder have a noticeable effect on the maximum vertical force for the velocity in front of the extended cylinder the horizontal velocity ahead of the velocity inflexion point decreases with the increase in the s the vertical velocity behind the velocity inflexion point decreases with the increase in the s the horizontal velocity behind the extended cylinder increases with the increase in the s the investigation on the propagation of an isw over two tandem horizontal cylinders indicates that the horizontal forces on each of the two cylinders are smaller than those on the isolated cylinder the maximum horizontal forces on the two cylinders are only 48 9 and 84 4 of those on the isolated cylinder when the dimensionless centre to centre distance l d reaches 2 5 the vertical forces on the two cylinders decrease with the increase in the l d the comparison of forces between the two cylinders indicates that larger horizontal forces and smaller vertical forces are imposed on the rear cylinder vortices interactions between the two cylinders remarkably reduce the horizontal force acting on the two cylinders when l d 2 5 the effect of l on the velocity in front of the cylinder 1 is negligible the velocity behind the cylinder 2 decreases with the increase in the l before l d reaches 2 5 the horizontal velocity between two tandem cylinders decreases with the increase in the l however after l d reaches 2 5 the horizontal velocity between two tandem cylinders increases with the increase in the l and becomes more complicated the above conclusions about the interaction between the isw and horizontal cylinder including the extended cylinder and two tandem cylinders are obtained on the premise that the isw amplitude is 0 72 cm when the amplitude or wavelength change the results of the interaction between the isw and the two types of horizontal cylinder
