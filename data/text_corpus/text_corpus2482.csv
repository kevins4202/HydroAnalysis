acclimatization during the start up period takes time the aim of this study is to investigate the initial stage of an innovative cell entrapped biofilter start up for manganese removal streptomyces violarus sbp1 sbp1 entrapped in barium alginate was incorporated into the biofilter to enhance manganese removal and cell retention the manganese removal performance microbial community and manganese transformation were examined through dual media columns representing free cell augmented fc entrapped cell augmented ec and conventional biofilters at an initial manganese concentration of 1 mg l in a filtration experiment ec achieved better removal performance 53 than fc 45 and conventional biofilter 39 because of higher manganese bio oxidation during the beginning period manganese adsorption was predominant whereas manganese bio oxidation played a main role thereafter a synchrotron based analysis confirmed that most mn ii was oxidized to mn iii and mn iv the amplicon sequencing results revealed that proteobacteria dominated natural biofilm in all three filters while streptomyces expected as sbp1 was the major bacterial group in ec this study demonstrated the feasibility of

next generation sequencing synchrotron data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction manganese is an inorganic contaminant in raw water sources especially groundwater water with manganese levels higher than 0 2 mg l may become brown or black and manganese precipitates lead to pipe clogging 1 long term human consumption of manganese contaminated water can promote human neurotoxic parkinson s like symptoms 2 countries that use groundwater as a main drinking water source have encountered this problem for example 87 of groundwater samples with manganese exceeded the allowable concentration in a district in bangladesh 3 in 2017 the who suggested a health based manganese concentration limit of 0 4mg l in drinking water 1 more recently the who published a provisional health based guideline value of 0 08 mg l for total manganese in drinking water 4 improved technology for manganese removal from groundwater is required to meet this more stringent limit physical chemical and biological processes exist for metal iron and manganese contaminated groundwater treatment the physical and chemical processes include aeration membrane separation ion exchange and chemical oxidation aeration is not effective for manganese removal because of its low oxidation rate the other physical and chemical processes mentioned membrane separation ion exchange and chemical oxidation could remove manganese but have higher operational costs and chemical oxidation may produce toxic by products 5 biofiltration has emerged as a process used alone or in combination with others for manganese removal and is typically used in many countries biofiltration is a water treatment system that combines biological transformation by biofilm with solid separation by a filter medium biofilters have been used to remove various contaminants such as dissolved organic carbon nitrogen iron manganese and heavy metals via biodegradation biotransformation biosorption absorption and physical filtration mechanisms 6 8 biofiltration is an effective easily installed and operated environmentally friendly and economical technique in some cases manganese removal by biofiltration is limited because of low numbers of naturally occurring manganese oxidizing bacteria mnobs in the filtration system leading to less manganese removal and long start up periods 2 8 months 9 10 this problem can be alleviated by a cell augmentation technique 11 adding effective mnobs to sand filters increased manganese removal 12 13 several mnobs have been isolated including bacterial strains in pseudomonas leptothrix gallionella hyphomicrobium and streptomyces taxa that can be applied as augmented culture alternatives 14 16 however the augmented culture may be washed off the filter during water production and backwashing before biofilm maturation 17 18 cell entrapment a technique for cell immobilization in a polymeric matrix can potentially solve the issue entrapped cells have been used successfully to remove various organic and inorganic chemicals in site remediation and wastewater treatment applications 19 21 entrapment material can retain the microbial cells in the system and protect the microbial cells from environmental stresses resulting in better treatment performance 22 in addition the entrapped cells do not require a biofilm formation period which accelerates biofilter performance no previous study has focused on improving manganese contaminated water treatment using the cell entrapment technique the ultimate goal of this study was to develop an innovative cell entrapped biofiltration technique for manganese removal that would shorten the start up period compared to other filters innovative and conventional systems for treating manganese contaminated water during the initial stage of the start up period were compared the initial stage was investigated to obtain information on the role of manganese adsorption and biotransformation during the start up period the study assessed 1 manganese removal performance 2 manganese speciation related to the removal mechanism and 3 identification of the related microbial community a previously isolated mnob streptomyces violarus sbp1 sbp1 and barium alginate were chosen as an augmented culture and entrapment matrix respectively 16 23 firstly the manganese removal performance of conventional no augmented cell free cell augmented and innovative cell entrapped biofilters was compared secondly manganese speciation was examined using synchrotron and electron microscopic based techniques to elucidate manganese removal behavior finally microbial community identification related to manganese oxidation in biofilters was conducted using an amplicon sequencing approach the results of this study will be useful for the full scale development design and operation of an innovative cell entrapped biofilter 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chemicals analytical reagent grade obtained

cell augmented ec biofilters were tested the columns were prepared following the rapid small scale column test rssct approach information on column setup and operation is provided in tables s1 and s2 the rssct approach was used to accelerate the manganese adsorption process during the beginning period of the column operation in practice the natural groundwater used in this study is used directly without treatment fig s1 a hypothetical full scale filter at a slow filtration rate was selected table s2 cylindrical glass columns total medium height of 30 0 cm and diameter of 1 5 cm were

16 30 16 n 102 47 17 e and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before use fig s1 mnso4 h2o was added to groundwater with an average background manganese concentration of 0 1 mg l to obtain a manganese concentration of 1 mg l the natural groundwater sampling location and water characteristics are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s3 the manganese contaminated groundwater was transferred to a storage tank fig 1 a peristatic pump watson marlow uk was used to feed the groundwater through the biofilters in upflow mode at a filtration rate of 0 3 m3 m2 h empty bed contact time of 77 min triplicate bench scale filters were operated continuously for 28 8 d equivalent to full scale filter operation for 6 months based on previous research the start up periods of the biofilters varied from 2 to 8 months 9 10 the 28 8 d investigation simulated for 6 months in a full scale scheme represented the initial stage of the biofilters influent and effluent water samples were collected continuously for measurement of manganese concentrations once every other day fig 1 the manganese distribution manganese speciation cell and material morphology and microbial community of entrapped cells and biofilter media after the 28 8 d experiment were examined the total manganese concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas according to the 3500 mn method 25 the other analytical characterization procedures are described in the following sections 2 4 microbial and material morphological observations the morphologies of the sand anthracite entrapment

briefly samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde and barium chloride solutions the samples were then dehydrated and coated with gold 2 5 manganese distribution the entrapped cells were observed using the micro x ray fluorescence imaging technique Î¼xrf to investigate the manganese distribution in the entrapped cells the entrapped cells were fixed dehydrated and dried using the sample preparation method for sem observation described in section 2 4 the Î¼xrf experiments were conducted at a beamline bl6b synchrotron light research institute slri thailand under conditions described by youngwilai et al 24 2 6 manganese speciation filter medium samples including anthracite bottom sand and anthracite middle and sand top layers were taken from the cm fc em and ec biofilters at the end of experiments to investigate the manganese species the filter media were oven dried at 105 c for 6 h before the analysis the manganese speciation investigation was conducted to confirm the contribution of manganese biotransformation and adsorption manganese k edge analysis by the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes technique was performed at a beamline bl5 2 slri thailand to determine the oxidation state of the manganese 26 the xanes results were processed further for background correction normalization and estimation of manganese speciation using the athena program implemented in the ifeffit package 2 7 microbial community and manganese removal related enzyme identification 2 7 1 dna extraction pcr amplification and next generation sequencing after the manganese removal experiments were completed three medium samples were obtained anthracite from 2 cm from the bottom of the column anthracite and sand from 1 cm from the middle of the column and sand from 2 cm from the top of the column the medium samples from the triplicate columns were combined the genomic dnas of the biofilms on the filter media and entrapped cells from the bottom middle and top layers were identified the samples were extracted using a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usa and stored at 20 c before analysis for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification 16s rrna gene fragments were

final extension at 72 c the pcr products were purified using nucleospin gel and pcr clean up macherey nagel germany and sent to the omics sciences and bioinformatics center at chulalongkorn university bangkok thailand for sequencing 2 7 2 microbial community analysis and related gene identification the analysis workflow of the 16s rrna sequences was performed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology package qiime 2 version 2020 6 28 the dada2 package implemented in qiime 2 was used for quality filtering de noising and the construction of an amplicon sequence variant asvs table 29 the taxonomic classification was conducted by classify consensus blast against the midas2 database version 2 1 3 using an identity cutoff of 90 30 based on the asvs table using qiime 2 the chao richness estimator the shannon index and the simpson index were calculated a venn diagram was created to illustrate the shared and unique asvs among the samples based on the occurrence of asvs across the filter medium samples principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to assess the diversity of the microbial communities across the samples correlation analysis was conducted to identify the relationships among the top 30 microbial taxa from the absolute count filter medium types and different biofilters the r software version 4 0 2 was used to analyze spearman s correlation indices picrust2 31 was used to predict the potential functional contributions based on 16s rrna gene asvs the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg was employed to analyze genes related to manganese removal by the biofilters streptomyces sequences were detected by asvs for microbial identification the references of streptomyces bacteria were obtained from the national center of biotechnology information ncbi database usa which was added into mega7 software 32 a phylogenetic tree of streptomyces bacteria was constructed by the neighbor joining method using the poisson model with 1000 bootstrap resamples 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were triplicated manganese removal efficiencies are presented as average values standard deviation a one way analysis of variance p 0 05 with duncan s multiple range test stata 14 statacorp usa was performed for comparisons of manganese removal efficiencies by the filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilter performance four filters cm fc em and ec were operated for 28 8 d under the rssct mode to mimic 6 months of full scale operation as detailed in the supplementary material table s2 biofilter operation can be divided into two stages acclimation and biodegradation steady state during acclimation the filter may remove contaminants via abiotic processes especially adsorption and microorganisms as biofilm slowly forms on the media this stage can take several months the rssct operation was performed to accelerate abiotic processes during the microbial acclimation period groundwater with a manganese concentration of 1 mg l water characteristics shown in the supplementary material table s3 was used to simulate highly manganese contaminated water the manganese breakthrough curves of the filters are shown in fig 2 the breakthrough and abiotic exhaustion times approximately 1 and 7 d respectively of all filters were similar the ec and fc filters achieved slightly better manganese removal than the em and cm filters during the initial period days 1 to 13 after day 13 of the experiment the effluent manganese concentration decreased with time fig 2 this suggests that the biofilm removed manganese from all filters at the end of the experiment 28 8 d the manganese removal performance of the filters could be ranked in the following order ec fc em cm corresponding to manganese removals based on total manganese concentrations of 52 96 4 34 45 12 3 60 42 42 2 35 and 38 98 1 68 respectively statistical comparisons showed that the ec filter achieved significantly better manganese removal than the fc em and cm filters based on p values of 0 044 0 025 and 0 010 respectively the results of this study are consistent with by previous works of limited manganese adsorption on anthracite 6 33 manganese breakthroughs in the filters were found after one day of use later after day 13 the manganese removal by the filters was probably due to biotransformation in the cm and em filters no augmented bacteria were applied this indicates that manganese removing microorganisms were able to grow and form biofilm on the biofilter media consistent with previous studies 7 10 34 the results of this study indicated that the manganese removal of the augmented biofilters fc and ec was superior to that of the cm and em filters this outcome was driven by the augmented microorganism 11 13 ec clearly showed higher manganese removal than the other filters fig 2 the superiority of ec over fc in manganese removal was attributed to the enhancement of microbial cell retention by the entrapment material the results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies castro gutierrez et al 11 reported that augmented cells removed 90 of metaldehyde from water to below the allowable concentration casalini et al 13 compared pseudomonas sagittaria mob 18 augmented and conventional filters for manganese removal and observed faster manganese removal in the augmented filter in winter an augmented sand filter reached a manganese removal efficacy of 95 at 39 d whereas a conventional sand filter achieved the same level of manganese removal at 54 d 13 breda et al 34 reported that non inoculated and inoculated filters removed manganese at concentrations lower than the water quality standard after column operation for 41 and 25 d respectively the manganese removal rates reported in previous studies and this study differed because of different experimental conditions water quality and augmented cultures however the results of previous research and this study corroborate the higher contaminant removal provided by augmented filters 13 34 the manganese removal performance of an innovative biofilter was compared to that of other filters in this study a residual manganese concentration of 0 4 mg l was expected all filters tested in this study were able to remove manganese although the filters did not achieve the expected degree of manganese removal in the 28 8 d experiment the removal trends suggested that all of the filters were likely to reach the expected concentration 0 4 mg l within 30 to 40 d whether ec can shorten the acclimation period is unclear however it is clear that ec significantly improved the biofilter performance the role of the entrapped cells in manganese removal should be examined further a long term experiment to do so is strongly recommended 3 2 manganese distribution and speciation the manganese distribution on materials including sand anthracite and entrapped cells was examined using the xrf technique 24 for both the sand and anthracite samples no manganese signal was detected after the experiment and a very low manganese signal was detected from the entrapped cell data not shown dangeti et al 8 reported a slight manganese signal on filter media sand and anthracite measured by xrf after a 5 month operation the filters in this study started to remove manganese as shown in fig 2 and described above but the filters were only used in the initial start up period the Î¼xrf results obtained in this study indicate that the manganese might be spread widely over the filter media and entrapped cells resulting in low manganese accumulation in any specific area manganese speciation observed in the filter media after the experiment using the xanes technique is shown in table 1 the main manganese species observed in all filters were mn iii and mn iv combined 92 100 of total mn the average manganese oxidation states were 3 05 3 37 3 16 and 3 45 in the cm fc em and ec filters respectively the ec filter with the entrapped sbp1 showed the highest manganese transformation abiotic oxidation was preliminarily tested by the aeration of water containing manganese and no manganese removal was observed manganese speciation suggested that manganese removal in the filters was probably governed by manganese oxidation processes manganese oxidation could result from biological or physico chemical processes theoretically biological manganese mn ii oxidation initially took place and formed manganese oxide mn iii and mn iv then manganese oxide coated the filter media and promoted manganese auto catalytical adsorption and oxidation whereas biological manganese removal occurred continuously in the long term application 35 in this study the initial stage of the filter start up was examined therefore biological manganese removal was emphasized the xanes results suggest that manganese removal may occur via bio oxidation by sbp1 and natural mnobs found in the filters the results are consistent with those of a previous study 8 manganese with oxidation states close to 4 3 5 to 3 9 was detected in a biofilter operated for 5 months the biofilters especially the innovative filter showed manganese oxide coating on the surface of the filter media this could potentially enhance manganese removal via a combination of bio oxidation and auto catalytical adsorption and oxidation in the long term 35 3 3 microbial and material morphological observations the sem observations showed the presence of microbial cells and media from the filters after the experiment fig s3 numerous microbial cells with various cell shapes were attached to sand and anthracite surfaces fig s3 a and b and microbial colonies with extracellular polymeric substances appeared on the anthracite surface fig s3 b the biofilm with diverse microorganisms based on cell morphology on the filter media observed in this study is consistent with observations of previous studies 8 36 for entrapped cell images fig s3 c and d the microbial cells which were expected to be sbp1 were mainly located at the inner layer of the entrapment matrix fig s3 d overall the sem images indicate the growth of microorganisms in the filters which probably contributed to manganese removal 3 4 microbial community observation 3 4 1 relative microbial abundance diversity and correlation twelve samples from the lower middle and upper layers of the biofilters after the cm em fc and ec experiments were analyzed using amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene an average gene length of 292 bp and a total of 24 277 reads 1336 to 2352 reads per sample were obtained similar microbial diversity indices including a simpson index of 0 99 shannon indices of 9 57 to 10 53 and chao1 indices of 1336 to 2358 found in all of the biofilters indicate high microbial diversity the pcoa plot showed microbial relationships in biofilters at different layers fig s4 the microbial communities in the middle and upper layers of each biofilter were similar the microbial communities in the lower layers anthracite of all of the biofilters were clustered all columns were up fed with the same water source therefore similar microbial communities were found 13 venn diagrams show the relationships between unique and shared asvs of the samples from the different filter layers fig 3 the samples from the lower layers of the biofilters exhibited high numbers of asvs diverse microbial communities at the inlet parts bottom layer reported here are consistent with previous observations 14 37 the taxonomic composition of microbial phyla from the biofilters is shown in fig s5 for all samples proteobacteria was the dominant phylum 63 33 to 89 47 followed by bacteroidetes 3 05 to 28 13 actinobacteria 0 09 to 28 85 and planctomycetes 0 99 to 17 31 respectively the dominance of proteobacteria in biofilters has previously been reported 13 37 38 the top 30 microbial taxa from the biofilter samples approximately 78 of asvs were further analyzed to generate a hierarchical cluster and heat map fig 4 the dominant population trends in all layers of the biofilters were similar hydrogenophaga with the highest abundance of 11 77 to 31 75 sphingopyxis pseudorhodoferax streptomyces novosphingobium shinella pirellula caulobacter ferrovibrio and hirschia were the top 10 taxa found in the filters isolated mnobs in hydrogenophaga 39 40 sphingopyxis 36 and streptomyces 16 were previously reported diverse taxa of mnobs depend on environmental conditions for example sources climates and toxic co contaminants 13 14 41 42 the microbial correlations of the top five abundant taxa and streptomyces as the augmented microbes in each layer were analyzed the correlation matrices of the top 30 microbial taxa in the lower middle and top layers across all biofilters are presented in figs 5 s6 and s7 respectively considering the lower layer anthracite which had the highest microbial diversity and abundance two groups i hydrogenophaga sphingopyxis and novosphingobium and ii caulobacter ferrovibrio and streptomyces were positively correlated fig 6 all the taxa mentioned belong to proteobacteria proteobacteria were previously reported as the main phylum in biofilters for manganese removal in groundwater 13 14 43 44 3 4 2 potential microorganisms related to manganese removal among the columns the innovative cell entrapped biofilter ec had a different microbial abundance trend compared to the other filters fig 4 it is obvious that streptomyces had the highest relative abundance 16 01 28 75 especially in the lower layer sample even though the fc column was augmented with sbp1 the abundance of streptomyces only reached 0 98 a phylogenetic tree fig 6 revealed that the asv results for streptomyces from next generation sequencing were closely related to sbp1 this suggests that streptomyces well grown in the ec column was probably sbp1 the relative microbial abundance result revealed that the highest manganese removal performance of ec was probably promoted by sbp1 the result also suggests that the novel cell entrapped biofilter with streptomyces achieved high and stable manganese removal 53 because the augmented culture could survive and coexist with indigenous bacteria typical biofilters achieve high manganese removal efficiencies because mnobs naturally grow and attach well to the filter media but acclimation takes a long time previous research has shown that the augmentation technique can accelerate the removal performance 13 the cell entrapment technique as shown in ec proposed in this study enhanced the removal performance since the entrapment material may retain mnobs in the filter better fig 2 although the results of this study apply to the initial stage of the biofilter start up the innovative filter with entrapped cells has potential for practical manganese removal potential functional genes related to manganese oxidation were examined in this study using the picrust2 program the examination of the potential functional genes was focused on the top ten abundant genera based on kegg pathways kate encoding catalase and or bfr encoding bacterioferritin genes were predicted in the top ten abundant genera of the microbial community this suggests that most of the microorganisms in the biofilters may contain kate and bfr genes previous studies have shown that the kate gene may be involved in the manganese oxidation process and biofilm formation 45 46 the bfr gene is responsible for the iron homeostasis process in bacteria and archaea 47 and may be able to change fe based metabolism to mn based metabolism at high levels of manganese 48 several previous studies have also reported simultaneous manganese and iron oxidation by biofilter systems 12 14 49 the amplicon sequencing results obtained in this study suggest that other typical manganese oxidation enzymes such as moxa and mnxg mmco genes were not present therefore the possible roles of other potential manganese oxidation enzymes in proteobacteria and streptomyces taxa should be further studied using metagenomic sequencing analysis the biofilters considered in this study can be ranked according to the presence of the top 10 abundant genera in the following order ec fc em cm corresponding to bacterial abundances of 61 7 53 3 50 8 and 48 0 respectively these results support the feasibility of bioaugmentation and cell entrapment techniques the ec filter contained the highest number of bacterial cells with manganese related genes leading to the highest manganese removal 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the potential of an innovative cell entrapped biofilter for manganese removal during the start up period the filter effectively removed manganese through oxidation by natural biofilm and augmented sbp1 with limited manganese adsorption by the filter media the innovative cell entrapped biofilter achieved higher manganese removal 53 than the conventional and free cell augmented biofilters to which it was compared the manganese speciation results of the xanes analysis confirmed higher manganese oxidation in the augmented biofilters the innovative cell entrapped biofilter enhanced manganese removal and provided microbial retention and stability the environmental and operating conditions influencing manganese removal such as water characteristics empty bed contact time rate and filter medium type by the innovative cell entrapped biofilter should be further investigated before full scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

concentration of 1 mg l the natural groundwater sampling location and water characteristics are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s3 the manganese contaminated groundwater was transferred to a storage tank fig 1 a peristatic pump watson marlow uk was used to feed the groundwater through the biofilters in upflow mode at a filtration rate of 0 3 m3 m2 h empty bed contact time of 77 min triplicate bench scale filters were operated continuously for 28 8 d equivalent to full scale filter operation for 6 months based on previous research the start up periods of the biofilters varied from 2 to 8 months 9 10 the 28 8 d investigation simulated for 6 months in a full scale scheme represented the initial stage of the biofilters influent and effluent water samples were collected continuously for measurement of manganese concentrations once every other day fig 1 the manganese distribution manganese speciation cell and material morphology and microbial community of entrapped cells and biofilter media after the 28 8 d experiment were examined the total manganese concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas according to the 3500 mn method 25 the other analytical characterization procedures are described in the following sections 2 4 microbial and material morphological observations the morphologies of the sand anthracite entrapment material and entrapped cells after the end of the experiment were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem leo 1450vp zeiss usa according to the procedure described by therdkiattikul et al 23 briefly samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde and barium chloride solutions the samples were then dehydrated and coated with gold 2 5 manganese distribution the entrapped cells were observed using the micro x ray fluorescence imaging technique Î¼xrf to investigate the manganese distribution in the entrapped cells the entrapped cells were fixed dehydrated and dried using the sample preparation method for sem observation described in section 2 4 the Î¼xrf experiments were conducted at a beamline bl6b synchrotron light research institute slri thailand under conditions described by youngwilai et al 24 2 6 manganese speciation filter medium samples including anthracite bottom sand and anthracite middle and sand top layers were taken from the cm fc em and ec biofilters at the end of experiments to investigate the manganese species the filter media were oven dried at 105 c for 6 h before the analysis the manganese speciation investigation was conducted to confirm the contribution of manganese biotransformation and adsorption manganese k edge analysis by the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes technique was performed at a beamline bl5 2 slri thailand to determine the oxidation state of the manganese 26 the xanes results were processed further for background correction normalization and estimation of manganese speciation using the athena program implemented in the ifeffit package 2 7 microbial community and manganese removal related enzyme identification 2 7 1 dna extraction pcr amplification and next generation sequencing after the manganese removal experiments were completed three medium samples were obtained anthracite from 2 cm from the bottom of the column anthracite and sand from 1 cm from the middle of the column and sand from 2 cm from the top of the column the medium samples from the triplicate columns were combined the genomic dnas of the biofilms on the filter media and entrapped cells from the bottom middle and top layers were identified the samples were extracted using a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usa and stored at 20 c before analysis for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification 16s rrna gene fragments were

final extension at 72 c the pcr products were purified using nucleospin gel and pcr clean up macherey nagel germany and sent to the omics sciences and bioinformatics center at chulalongkorn university bangkok thailand for sequencing 2 7 2 microbial community analysis and related gene identification the analysis workflow of the 16s rrna sequences was performed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology package qiime 2 version 2020 6 28 the dada2 package implemented in qiime 2 was used for quality filtering de noising and the construction of an amplicon sequence variant asvs table 29 the taxonomic classification was conducted by classify consensus blast against the midas2 database version 2 1 3 using an identity cutoff of 90 30 based on the asvs table using qiime 2 the chao richness estimator the shannon index and the simpson index were calculated a venn diagram was created to illustrate the shared and unique asvs among the samples based on the occurrence of asvs across the filter medium samples principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to assess the diversity of the microbial communities across the samples correlation analysis was conducted to identify the relationships among the top 30 microbial taxa from the absolute count filter medium types and different biofilters the r software version 4 0 2 was used to analyze spearman s correlation indices picrust2 31 was used to predict the potential functional contributions based on 16s rrna gene asvs the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg was employed to analyze genes related to manganese removal by the biofilters streptomyces sequences were detected by asvs for microbial identification the references of streptomyces bacteria were obtained from the national center of biotechnology information ncbi database usa which was added into mega7 software 32 a phylogenetic tree of streptomyces bacteria was constructed by the neighbor joining method using the poisson model with 1000 bootstrap resamples 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were triplicated manganese removal efficiencies are presented as average values standard deviation a one way analysis of variance p 0 05 with duncan s multiple range test stata 14 statacorp usa was performed for comparisons of manganese removal efficiencies by the filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilter performance four filters cm fc em and ec were operated for 28 8 d under the rssct mode to mimic 6 months of full scale operation as detailed in the supplementary material table s2 biofilter operation can be divided into two stages acclimation and biodegradation steady state during acclimation the filter may remove contaminants via abiotic processes especially adsorption and microorganisms as biofilm slowly forms on the media this stage can take several months the rssct operation was performed to accelerate abiotic processes during the microbial acclimation period groundwater with a manganese concentration of 1 mg l water characteristics shown in the supplementary material table s3 was used to simulate highly manganese contaminated water the manganese breakthrough curves of the filters are shown in fig 2 the breakthrough and abiotic exhaustion times approximately 1 and 7 d respectively of all filters were similar the ec and fc filters achieved slightly better manganese removal than the em and cm filters during the initial period days 1 to 13 after day 13 of the experiment the effluent manganese concentration decreased with time fig 2 this suggests that the biofilm removed manganese from all filters at the end of the experiment 28 8 d the manganese removal performance of the filters could be ranked in the following order ec fc em cm corresponding to manganese removals based on total manganese concentrations of 52 96 4 34 45 12 3 60 42 42 2 35 and 38 98 1 68 respectively statistical comparisons showed that the ec filter achieved significantly better manganese removal than the fc em and cm filters based on p values of 0 044 0 025 and 0 010 respectively the results of this study are consistent with by previous works of limited manganese adsorption on anthracite 6 33 manganese breakthroughs in the filters were found after one day of use later after day 13 the manganese removal by the filters was probably due to biotransformation in the cm and em filters no augmented bacteria were applied this indicates that manganese removing microorganisms were able to grow and form biofilm on the biofilter media consistent with previous studies 7 10 34 the results of this study indicated that the manganese removal of the augmented biofilters fc and ec was superior to that of the cm and em filters this outcome was driven by the augmented microorganism 11 13 ec clearly showed higher manganese removal than the other filters fig 2 the superiority of ec over fc in manganese removal was attributed to the enhancement of microbial cell retention by the entrapment material the results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies castro gutierrez et al 11 reported that augmented cells removed 90 of metaldehyde from water to below the allowable concentration casalini et al 13 compared pseudomonas sagittaria mob 18 augmented and conventional filters for manganese removal and observed faster manganese removal in the augmented filter in winter an augmented sand filter reached a manganese removal efficacy of 95 at 39 d whereas a conventional sand filter achieved the same level of manganese removal at 54 d 13 breda et al 34 reported that non inoculated and inoculated filters removed manganese at concentrations lower than the water quality standard after column operation for 41 and 25 d respectively the manganese removal rates reported in previous studies and this study differed because of different experimental conditions water quality and augmented cultures however the results of previous research and this study corroborate the higher contaminant removal provided by augmented filters 13 34 the manganese removal performance of an innovative biofilter was compared to that of other filters in this study a residual manganese concentration of 0 4 mg l was expected all filters tested in this study were able to remove manganese although the filters did not achieve the expected degree of manganese removal in the 28 8 d experiment the removal trends suggested that all of the filters were likely to reach the expected concentration 0 4 mg l within 30 to 40 d whether ec can shorten the acclimation period is unclear however it is clear that ec significantly improved the biofilter performance the role of the entrapped cells in manganese removal should be examined further a long term experiment to do so is strongly recommended 3 2 manganese distribution and speciation the manganese distribution on materials including sand anthracite and entrapped cells was examined using the xrf technique 24 for both the sand and anthracite samples no manganese signal was detected after the experiment and a very low manganese signal was detected from the entrapped cell data not shown dangeti et al 8 reported a slight manganese signal on filter media sand and anthracite measured by xrf after a 5 month operation the filters in this study started to remove manganese as shown in fig 2 and described above but the filters were only used in the initial start up period the Î¼xrf results obtained in this study indicate that the manganese might be spread widely over the filter media and entrapped cells resulting in low manganese accumulation in any specific area manganese speciation observed in the filter media after the experiment using the xanes technique is shown in table 1 the main manganese species observed in all filters were mn iii and mn iv combined 92 100 of total mn the average manganese oxidation states were 3 05 3 37 3 16 and 3 45 in the cm fc em and ec filters respectively the ec filter with the entrapped sbp1 showed the highest manganese transformation abiotic oxidation was preliminarily tested by the aeration of water containing manganese and no manganese removal was observed manganese speciation suggested that manganese removal in the filters was probably governed by manganese oxidation processes manganese oxidation could result from biological or physico chemical processes theoretically biological manganese mn ii oxidation initially took place and formed manganese oxide mn iii and mn iv then manganese oxide coated the filter media and promoted manganese auto catalytical adsorption and oxidation whereas biological manganese removal occurred continuously in the long term application 35 in this study the initial stage of the filter start up was examined therefore biological manganese removal was emphasized the xanes results suggest that manganese removal may occur via bio oxidation by sbp1 and natural mnobs found in the filters the results are consistent with those of a previous study 8 manganese with oxidation states close to 4 3 5 to 3 9 was detected in a biofilter operated for 5 months the biofilters especially the innovative filter showed manganese oxide coating on the surface of the filter media this could potentially enhance manganese removal via a combination of bio oxidation and auto catalytical adsorption and oxidation in the long term 35 3 3 microbial and material morphological observations the sem observations showed the presence of microbial cells and media from the filters after the experiment fig s3 numerous microbial cells with various cell shapes were attached to sand and anthracite surfaces fig s3 a and b and microbial colonies with extracellular polymeric substances appeared on the anthracite surface fig s3 b the biofilm with diverse microorganisms based on cell morphology on the filter media observed in this study is consistent with observations of previous studies 8 36 for entrapped cell images fig s3 c and d the microbial cells which were expected to be sbp1 were mainly located at the inner layer of the entrapment matrix fig s3 d overall the sem images indicate the growth of microorganisms in the filters which probably contributed to manganese removal 3 4 microbial community observation 3 4 1 relative microbial abundance diversity and correlation twelve samples from the lower middle and upper layers of the biofilters after the cm em fc and ec experiments were analyzed using amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene an average gene length of 292 bp and a total of 24 277 reads 1336 to 2352 reads per sample were obtained similar microbial diversity indices including a simpson index of 0 99 shannon indices of 9 57 to 10 53 and chao1 indices of 1336 to 2358 found in all of the biofilters indicate high microbial diversity the pcoa plot showed microbial relationships in biofilters at different layers fig s4 the microbial communities in the middle and upper layers of each biofilter were similar the microbial communities in the lower layers anthracite of all of the biofilters were clustered all columns were up fed with the same water source therefore similar microbial communities were found 13 venn diagrams show the relationships between unique and shared asvs of the samples from the different filter layers fig 3 the samples from the lower layers of the biofilters exhibited high numbers of asvs diverse microbial communities at the inlet parts bottom layer reported here are consistent with previous observations 14 37 the taxonomic composition of microbial phyla from the biofilters is shown in fig s5 for all samples proteobacteria was the dominant phylum 63 33 to 89 47 followed by bacteroidetes 3 05 to 28 13 actinobacteria 0 09 to 28 85 and planctomycetes 0 99 to 17 31 respectively the dominance of proteobacteria in biofilters has previously been reported 13 37 38 the top 30 microbial taxa from the biofilter samples approximately 78 of asvs were further analyzed to generate a hierarchical cluster and heat map fig 4 the dominant population trends in all layers of the biofilters were similar hydrogenophaga with the highest abundance of 11 77 to 31 75 sphingopyxis pseudorhodoferax streptomyces novosphingobium shinella pirellula caulobacter ferrovibrio and hirschia were the top 10 taxa found in the filters isolated mnobs in hydrogenophaga 39 40 sphingopyxis 36 and streptomyces 16 were previously reported diverse taxa of mnobs depend on environmental conditions for example sources climates and toxic co contaminants 13 14 41 42 the microbial correlations of the top five abundant taxa and streptomyces as the augmented microbes in each layer were analyzed the correlation matrices of the top 30 microbial taxa in the lower middle and top layers across all biofilters are presented in figs 5 s6 and s7 respectively considering the lower layer anthracite which had the highest microbial diversity and abundance two groups i hydrogenophaga sphingopyxis and novosphingobium and ii caulobacter ferrovibrio and streptomyces were positively correlated fig 6 all the taxa mentioned belong to proteobacteria proteobacteria were previously reported as the main phylum in biofilters for manganese removal in groundwater 13 14 43 44 3 4 2 potential microorganisms related to manganese removal among the columns the innovative cell entrapped biofilter ec had a different microbial abundance trend compared to the other filters fig 4 it is obvious that streptomyces had the highest relative abundance 16 01 28 75 especially in the lower layer sample even though the fc column was augmented with sbp1 the abundance of streptomyces only reached 0 98 a phylogenetic tree fig 6 revealed that the asv results for streptomyces from next generation sequencing were closely related to sbp1 this suggests that streptomyces well grown in the ec column was probably sbp1 the relative microbial abundance result revealed that the highest manganese removal performance of ec was probably promoted by sbp1 the result also suggests that the novel cell entrapped biofilter with streptomyces achieved high and stable manganese removal 53 because the augmented culture could survive and coexist with indigenous bacteria typical biofilters achieve high manganese removal efficiencies because mnobs naturally grow and attach well to the filter media but acclimation takes a long time previous research has shown that the augmentation technique can accelerate the removal performance 13 the cell entrapment technique as shown in ec proposed in this study enhanced the removal performance since the entrapment material may retain mnobs in the filter better fig 2 although the results of this study apply to the initial stage of the biofilter start up the innovative filter with entrapped cells has potential for practical manganese removal potential functional genes related to manganese oxidation were examined in this study using the picrust2 program the examination of the potential functional genes was focused on the top ten abundant genera based on kegg pathways kate encoding catalase and or bfr encoding bacterioferritin genes were predicted in the top ten abundant genera of the microbial community this suggests that most of the microorganisms in the biofilters may contain kate and bfr genes previous studies have shown that the kate gene may be involved in the manganese oxidation process and biofilm formation 45 46 the bfr gene is responsible for the iron homeostasis process in bacteria and archaea 47 and may be able to change fe based metabolism to mn based metabolism at high levels of manganese 48 several previous studies have also reported simultaneous manganese and iron oxidation by biofilter systems 12 14 49 the amplicon sequencing results obtained in this study suggest that other typical manganese oxidation enzymes such as moxa and mnxg mmco genes were not present therefore the possible roles of other potential manganese oxidation enzymes in proteobacteria and streptomyces taxa should be further studied using metagenomic sequencing analysis the biofilters considered in this study can be ranked according to the presence of the top 10 abundant genera in the following order ec fc em cm corresponding to bacterial abundances of 61 7 53 3 50 8 and 48 0 respectively these results support the feasibility of bioaugmentation and cell entrapment techniques the ec filter contained the highest number of bacterial cells with manganese related genes leading to the highest manganese removal 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the potential of an innovative cell entrapped biofilter for manganese removal during the start up period the filter effectively removed manganese through oxidation by natural biofilm and augmented sbp1 with limited manganese adsorption by the filter media the innovative cell entrapped biofilter achieved higher manganese removal 53 than the conventional and free cell augmented biofilters to which it was compared the manganese speciation results of the xanes analysis confirmed higher manganese oxidation in the augmented biofilters the innovative cell entrapped biofilter enhanced manganese removal and provided microbial retention and stability the environmental and operating conditions influencing manganese removal such as water characteristics empty bed contact time rate and filter medium type by the innovative cell entrapped biofilter should be further investigated before full scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12411,in this study a novel three stage partial denitrification partial nitrification anammox pd pn anammox system was established results showed that the excess of cod and the reduction of nitrite in pd process caused by the instability of influent nitrate are avoided through real time influent cod n ratio of 2 1 the extending the aeration interval in pn process enhanced the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and promoted the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria under low free ammonia fa 1 1 0 2 mg l in the upflow porous plate anaerobic reactor uppar anammox bacteria candidatus kuennia was rapid natural enriched from 0 to 48 4 and granular anammox was formed by the increased of filamentous bacteria Î± d glucose and a helix moreover the removal and robustness of ammonia nitrogen 98 9 1 8 and total nitrogen 87 0 2 3 in this system are better than those of the single stage pn pd anammox process and its cost of oxygen consumption cod consumption and sludge treatment is far lower than that of nitrification denitrification process and pn anammox denitrification process this study provides a series of feasible start up and operation strategies of pd pn anammox and pd pn anammox processes for the application of anammox in rare earth mining wastewater which proposes upgrading and renovation plans for local wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial denitrification partial nitrification anammox granular sludge pilot scale real mining wastewater nob inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen rich mine wastewater nmw is formed under the leaching of these rare earth tailings in rainwater and groundwater 1 which is highly variable ammonia 65 185 mg l and nitrate nitrogen 30 88 mg l low chemical oxygen demand cod 10 mg l and residual rare earth elements rees 0 20 mg l 2 3 the nitrification denitrification process is the only technology used in nmw wastewater treatment plants wwtps 4 5 compared with this process the anammox process has significant advantages due to its superior performance and less organic carbon consumption energy consumption and sludge output 6 in nmw wastewater low concentration ammonia limits the inhibition of free ammonia fa on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 2 and reduces the growth of anammox bacteria anaob 7 therefore the stably inhibition of nob and the naturally enrichment of anaob obstacles to the application of anammox process in nmw wastewater 8 device innovation strategy innovation and development of a multi stage coupling process based on the anammox process are important methods to overcome these two obstacles and promote the application of anammox 9 the realization of natural enrichment of anaob is the key to promote the application of anammox process in real wastewater 8 sludge granulation is one of the optimal choices to achieve the enrichment and retention of anaob 10 then proper reactor configuration is one of the key conditions for forming granular sludge and enriching anaob 10 however the natural enrichment of anaob in real nmw wastewater has not yet been realized 7 hence the innovation of reactor configuration to realize the enrichment and granulation of anaob is an important way to promote the application of anammox process in real nmw wastewater preventing nitrite oxidation in partial nitrification pn process is a necessary condition to realize the stable supply of nitrite and anammox process 11 12 the inhibition strategies of nitrite oxidation include nitrite oxidation inhibitor 12 operation optimization intermittent aeration 13 micro aeration 14 etc ultrasonic treatment 15 fa control 7 etc when applying nitrite oxidation inhibitor ultrasonic treatment or fa control strategy in low ammonia wastewater the potential pollutants inhibitors ammonia nitrogen etc are added or energy consumption ultrasonic is increased and the performance pn process will face the risk of performance deterioration after long term operation 11 12 then the comprehensive control strategy integrating ph value aeration rate and aeration time control is considered to be the most effective strategy to achieve nob inhibition in low ammonia wastewater 11 generally there are two types anammox based processes single stage and multi stage 16 although the installation efforts of single stage anammox based process are less multi stage anammox based process has more significant advantages in good system stability and easy promotion when treating unstable ammonia wastewater 7 in a study on nmw wastewater treatment influent ammonia and nitrate were removed by pn a process and denitrification process respectively and 62 of nitrogen was autotrophic removed 7 moreover the proportion of autotrophic nitrogen removal can be further increased by replacing denitrification process with partial denitrification pd process and supplying nitrite to anammox process which will significantly reduce operating costs such as organic agent consumption aeration energy consumption and sludge disposal currently only one single stage pn pd anammox process has been reported but its long term stability of nitrogen removal efficiency is poor 17 in previous studies many start up and operational strategies for pd pn and anammox processes were developed in treating stable simulated wastewater 2 7 18 19 however the ingredients of real nmw wastewater were complicated thus it is unknown whether these strategies can achieve ideal results in treating nmw wastewater the feasibility of treating nmw wastewater with three stage pn a denitrification process has been confirmed which achieving pn and anammox processes through the addition of ammonia nitrogen and mature anaerobic ammonia oxidation fillers respectively but the feasibility of long term stable operation of pn a process in treating nmw wastewater has not been verified in practice 7 furthermore a stable cod n ratio is crucial for the implementation of the pd process 17 while the nitrate in real nmw wastewater is highly unstable which poses a huge challenge to the implementation and stable operation of the pd process in this study a novel three stage ppa system was developed to treat real nmw wastewater which included two pilot scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs and a pilot scale upflow porous plate anaerobic reactor uppar were used for pd pn and anammox this study aimed to i determine the feasibility of establish pd pn and anammox process using activated sludge ii realize stable and efficient nitrite accumulation in pd and pn process through strategy innovation iii reveal the mechanism of uppar promoting anammox granulation and natural enrichment of anaob iv evaluate the long term 208 days efficiency and stability of three stage ppa system treatment real nmw wastewater v assess the economics of ppa systems in treating nmw wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the pilot scale device the pilot scale device consists of pd reactor pn reactor anammox reactor intermediate water tank and control system fig 1 the pd and pn reactors are sequencing batch reactor sbr with effective volume of 14 83 m3 and 14 45 m3 respectively and the volume exchange rates of those two reactors are 45 in the anammox reactor uppar reactor the natural enrichment retention and granulation of anaob were achieved in alternating high low shear zones by adding multistage porous plates the automatic control system achieves the control of ph dissolved oxygen do and hydraulic retention time hrt in each reactor by adjusting the control pump and valve the ppa system was installed at the site of the guanxi nmw wastewater wwtps nitrification denitrification process in longnan city jiangxi province china with a wastewater treatment capacity of 50 m3 d this pilot scale device is operated in two modes in mode i the pd pn and anammox reactors were started and operated in treating real nmw wastewater respectively in mode ii these three reactors in stable operation were combined into a ppa system and used to treat real nmw wastewater the real nmw wastewater passes through pd pn and anammox reactors one by one and nitrate and ammonia in the wastewater are sequentially removed 2 2 characteristics of wastewater and inoculum the residual sludge obtained from the wwtps was added to the pd pn and anammox reactors respectively after inoculation the mixed solution volatile suspended solids mlvss of these reactors were 2 8 g l the influent of the pilot scale device is real nmw wastewater with ammonia of 92 36 mg l cod of 3 2 mg l nitrate of 43 16 mg l and ph of 8 5 0 5 moreover to avoid effects of rees the concentration of rees is decrease to a low level 0 24 0 74 mg l by precipitation with calcium carbonate 2 3 operational designs the individual operation of the pd reactor is divided into three stages start up stage a i strategy optimization stage a ii and long term operation stage a iii and its operating cycle includes feeding stirring settling discharging and idling for 20 min 60 min 30 min 10 min 60 min respectively then the individual operation of the pn reactor is divided into three stages start up stage bi long term operation stage b ii and strategy optimization stage b iii and its operating cycle includes feeding stirring settling discharging and idling for 20 min 120 min 30 min 10 min 10 min respectively moreover the individual operation of the am reactor is divided into three stages inoculum acclimatization stage ci start up stage c ii and long term operation stage c iii furthermore the operation of ppa system is divided into two stages operation optimization stage di and long term operation stage d ii through the automatic control system the control of influent cod n ratio and ph is achieved by adjusting the flow rate of sodium acetate and sodium hydroxide dosing pumps the detailed operating parameters of pilot scale pd pn and anammox reactors are summarized in table 1 in this study the ph do strategy the real time cod n ratio control rtcrc strategy and the uppar strategy are strategies for establishing pd pn and anammox processes in real nmw wastewater respectively which is first posted in treating synthetic nmw wastewater 20 22 and improved based on actual operation in this study in the ph do strategy the ph in pn reactor is remained at 7 5 the do of 0 7 mg l and aeration 30 min interval 30 min in start up stage and the do of 0 1 mg l and aeration 25 min interval 35 min in long term operation stage through this strategy nob is inhibited through the lack of do and the delayed restore of anaerobic nob active after aeration intervals while aob is selectively enriched at appropriate ph and do in the rtcrc strategy the cod n ratio decreased from 5 0 to 2 1 in the first 20 days and then remained at 2 1 base on the real time nitrate concentration that before feeding in the uppar strategy under reflux ratio of 2 the natural enrichment retention and granulation of anaob were achieved in alternating high low shear zones by adding multistage porous plates details of these three strategies have been provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are daily measured via standard methods 23 moreover the ph value in water sample and reactor are measured by

nitrogen and cod concentration determination was performed in pd and pn reactors water samples are obtained in the in situ nitrogen concentration determination when mixing time of sbr reactor is 0 30 60 90 and 120 min which are stored at 4 c after passing through a 0 45 Î¼m filter 2 6 high throughput sequencing and microbial community analysis all sludge samples are obtained in pd pn and anammox process to explore the evolution of microbial community structure before and after strategy optimization and joint operation these sludge samples are subjected to high throughput sequencing details for sludge sample processing and high throughput sequencing were shown in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of stable pilot scale pd process in nmw wastewater 3 1 1 start up stage of pd reactor the start up and operational performance of the pilot scale pd process is shown in fig 2 in this study sodium acetate organic carbon was injected after feeding in stage a i days 1 20 the cod n ratio was gradually reduced from 5 to 2 1 to achieve nitrite accumulation fig 2a within the first 8 days of the pd operation the ph and cod n ratio of are maintained at 8 0 mg l and 5 0 respectively fig 2b c the effluent nitrate is decreased to a very low level 0 2 mg l fig 2a indicated that the denitrification performance was fully recovered with the cod n ratio gradually reduced to 2 1 days 9 20 the nitrite in effluent gradually increased from 0 24 mg l to 16 6 mg l fig 2a and the nitrite accumulation rate nar also increased from 0 47 to 31 9 fig 2c which means the accumulation of nitrite can be initially achieved in real nmw wastewater 3 1 2 strategy optimization stag of pd reactor the stage a ii days 21 71 is the strategy adjustment stage on days 21 31 nar was stable at 28 6 4 2 fig 2b however under the same strategy the nar of lab scale pd process achieved 60 22 hence the operation strategy of pd process needs to be adjusted to cope with the complex actual nmw wastewater and increase the nar consecutive rainfall on days 28 29 and days 33 34 resulted in a significant drop in influent nitrate fig 2a nar was reduced from 26 96 to 0 03 fig 2c since the cod n ratio and the dosage of sodium acetate are fixed fig 2b the reduction of influent nitrate results in a rapid increase in the actual cod n ratio in the short term fig 2c which leads to the further removal of nitrite by denitrifying bacteria then the nar was always in low level 6 2 1 0 on days 36 44 fig 2c means that the performance of pd process deteriorated after continuous short term shock high ph value 9 0 9 2 is regarded as an important way to improve the stability of pd process and alleviate the deterioration of pd process 24 25 therefore on days 44 61 the ph value in the pd reactor was set to 9 0 0 2 fig 2a and the nar gradually increased from 4 4 to 21 8 fig 2c however as the rainfall on days 46 51 and 55 the nar then decreased again to a lower level 3 8 3 4 fig 2c this implies that the high ph strategy can only achieve the temporary recovery of pd process efficiency but still cannot cope with the continuous short term shock of nmw wastewater after the rtcrc strategy was applied the effluent nitrite gradually increased from 4 4 mg l to 15 2 mg l fig 2a and the nar also increased to a higher level 26 5 4 9 fig 2c confirmed that the rtcrc strategy can recover the deteriorated pd process 3 1 3 recovery and long term operation stage of pd reactor on days 31 and 51 the influent nitrate was decreased due to rainfall hence the real cod n ratio rapidly increased and significantly exceeding its set value and then the nar decreased to a low level fig 2c therefore in stage a iii days 61 105 the rtcrc strategy was applied the injection volume of cdo is determined by the influent nitrate before feeding in each cycle through the automatic control system rather than the influent nitrate during sampling details shown in the supplementary materials on days 61 70 the real cod n ratio is close to the theoretical cod n ratio the nar gradually increased and maintained at a high level 25 5 1 1 fig 2c confirmed that the rtcrc strategy is an effective strategy for pd process treating real nmw wastewater on days 71 105 to determine the role of high ph in restoring pd process the ph value was decreased from 9 0 to 8 0 nar further increased to 53 7 5 3 fig 2c indicating that a high ph of 9 0 was beneficial for pd process in short time but was unbeneficial for it in long time in situ nitrogen and cod determination and high throughput sequencing were carried out in pd reactor on days 1 19 69 and 105 fig 2d f the nitrite on days 1 19 and 69 basically remains unchanged within 90 120 min of stirring fig 2d indicating that the above strategies can achieve nitrite accumulation the accumulation rate and ratio of nitrite on day 69 are significantly higher than those on days 1 and 19 fig 2d shows that the key to enhance the resistance of short term shock is the rtcrc strategy rather than the high ph strategy the initial cod concentration the first sample obtained after uniform mixing on day 69 is significantly higher than that on days 1 and 19 fig 2e which confirms that the rtcrc strategy may be to achieve the efficient accumulation of nitrite by reducing the consumption of cod by non functional bacteria in the main genus of pd reactor relative abundance 2 the theura is classified to partial denitrification bacteria 26 and the simplicispira thermomonas and acidovorax are classified to complete denitrifying bacteria 2 26 28 compared with sample on day 1 the abundance of theura and simplicispira on day 19 decreased while the abundance of thermomonas and acidovorax increased fig 2f which showed that the high ph strategy only has a certain inhibition on dominant non functional bacteria but has a significant inhibition on functional bacteria on day 69 the abundance of theura gradually recovered and approached that on day 1 while abundance of other three main non functional bacteria decreased significantly fig 2f therefore selective and efficient enrichment of pd functional bacteria in real nmw wastewater was achieved by rtcrc strategy 3 2 establishment of stable pilot scale pn process in nmw wastewater 3 2 1 start up stage of pn reactor in stage bi days 1 18 with ph of 7 5 0 2 hrt of 12 h and do of 0 7 mg l aeration 30 min every 30 min nitrate and ammonia in effluent were gradually decreased fig 3a b the effluent nitrite was increased to a high level fig 3b and nar was increased from 19 7 to 90 1 fig 3c nar over 90 means that pn process was started 21 hence the ph do strategy is an effective strategy to start up pn process under the continuous short term shock of ammonia in influent 3 2 2 strategy optimization stag of pn reactor in stage b ii days 19 49 with do of 0 1 mg l and hrt of 6 h the effluent ammonia gradually decreased from 27 0 mg l to a low level 0 9 0 4 mg l after a short time rise fig 3a then the nar increased to a high level 95 2 1 9 on days 19 38 fig 3c but decreased to 87 4 fig 3c with the influent ammonia decreased from 120 3 19 6 mg l to 96 4 8 8 mg l on days 38 49 the fa is positively correlated with influent ammonia 21 moreover napr on day 49 was significantly higher than that on day 29 fig 3e indicated that the activity of nob was increased due to the decrease in nob inhibition caused by fa therefore it is necessary to optimize strategies to further inhibit the growth of nob 3 2 3 long term operation stage of pn reactor according to the nitrogen in situ determination on day 49 shown in the supplementary materials nitrate was produced after stirring for 3 h extending the aeration interval appropriately is believed to help strengthen the inhibition of nob 21 thus in stage b iii days 50 60 with the hrt reduced to 4 h and the aeration mode adjusted to 25 min of aeration every 35 min the effluent nitrate gradually approached and basically remained consistent with influent nitrite fig 3b and the nar increased and stabilized at a high level 99 5 0 8 fig 3c moreover the influent ammonia 113 9 6 0 mg l in stage b iii was higher than that in days 39 49 but lower than that in days 19 39 fig 3a while the average nar 99 5 in stage b iii was significantly higher than that in days 39 49 95 3 and days 19 39 91 9 fig 3c therefore the extending the aeration interval is an efficient and sustainable strategy for achieving long term stable operation of the pn process in real nmw wastewater furthermore the abundance of nitrospira the only found nob in samples and napr are decreased significantly fig 3d e hence through the extending the aeration interval the inhibition of nob was enhanced and its negative effect caused by the decrease in fa has been eliminated interestingly the abundance of nitrosomonas the only found aob in samples on day 60 was higher than that on day 49 fig 3f while the average snpr increased from 9 9 mg l h to 17 2 mg l h on days 49 60 fig 3d means that extending the aeration interval not only enhanced the inhibition of nob but also promoted the activity of aob 3 3 establishment of stable pilot scale anammox process in nmw wastewater 3 3 1 inoculum acclimatization stage of anammox reactor the start up and stable operation of a pilot scale anammox process in uppar reactor have been successfully realized in real nmw wastewater fig 4 in stage ci days 1 39 with the hrt of 72 h and the nitrite to ammonia ratio in influent of 0 4 the tn in effluent was mostly lower than that in influent the nre increases first and then decreases fig 4a and the nitrate in effluent first decreases and then gradually approaches that in influent fig 4b then the abundance of denitrifying bacteria thanura aridibacter and thermomonas 6 1 8 9 at this stage 2 is significantly higher than that of anaob candidatus kuenenia 0 0 7 fig 4d e therefore endogenous denitrification is the main pathway for nitrogen removal at this stage moreover nitrosomonas and nitrospirus are the only aob and nob found in the reactor respectively and their abundance were increased in stage ci fig 4g which is beneficial for the enrichment of anaob via create an anaerobic environment on days 34 39 the nitrate in effluent gradually approached that in influent fig 4c and actual values of the no2 removal to nh4 removal ratio and the no3 production to nh4 removal ratio gradually approached their theoretical values fig 4d indicated that anammox process gradually became the main nitrogen removal pathway 3 3 2 start up stage of anammox reactor in stage c ii days 40 70 the nitrite nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen ratio in influent is set to 1 3 the anr is increased from 20 8 to 92 4 the nre is increased from 23 5 to 67 6 nrr is increased from 0 001 to 0 11 kgn m3 d fig 4b and the abundance of candidatus kuennia was increased from 0 7 to 3 3 fig 4e hence the anr and nre over 90 and 60 means that anammox process has been successfully started 3 3 3 long term operation stage of anammox reactor in stage c iii days 71 95 with the hrt of 24 h and the nitrite nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen ratio in influent of 1 3 the influent ammonia suddenly decreased from 135 9 mg l to 73 0 mg l and then recovered to 113 1 mg l on days 73 89 fig 4a and the nre first decreased from 67 7 to 42 4 and then recovered to 65 3 fig 4b shown that the anammox process using uppar reactor has great resistance to ammonia shock after startup then the significant increase in the abundance of candidatus kuennia and the decrease in the abundance of other bacteria fig 4e g confirm that the natural enrichment anaob was achieved in the uppar reactor 3 3 4 granulation in anammox reactor uppar reactor is a uasb reactor that adds three porous plates with a decreasing number of holes from bottom to top to achieve local high speed water flow shear force at low reflux speeds to promote granulation formation 19 the sludge images of each stage provided in supplementary materials shown the formation process of anammox granular sludge in the uppar reactor in stage ci the sludge color changes from brown to gray and it presents a fine sand morphology size of 0 2 0 8 mm indicated the end of cell lysis by inert bacteria and the beginning of sludge granulation in stage c ii the sludge color gradually changed to light red and deep red and the sludge particle size significantly increased to 0 2 1 0 mm revealed the rapid accumulation of anaob and the acceleration of sludge granulation in stage c iii a large number of bright red particles with sizes exceeding 2 mm are found confirmed that the uppar reactor is an effective device for realizing sludge granulation in real nmw wastewater moreover anaerolineaceae is an anaerobic filamentous bacterium that plays a key role in sludge granulation and maintaining the stability of granular sludge 29 in stage c ii the abundance of unclassified anaerolineaceae was increased rapidly and maintained at a high level 2 6 3 0 fig 4g shown that it is an important way to achieve sludge granulation in uppar reactor that promote the growth of filamentous bacteria according to the ftir graph the peaks at 873 cm 1 and 1425 cm 1 are the most two peaks with the most significant increase fig 4h which were classified as characteristic absorption peaks of Î± d glucose and the a helix in the secondary structure of protein and play a key role in backbone support and cell aggregation in anammox granular sludge respectively 30 31 therefore it is an important way for uppar reactors to achieve sludge granulation in real nmw wastewater that promote the generation of Î± d glucose and a helix 3 4 performance of pilot scale ppa system after some exploratory attempts in stage d days 120 208 the anammox reactor was connected with pd and pn reactors to verify the performance of the ppa system in treating real nmw wastewater 3 4 1 operation optimization stage in stage di days 120 175 the hrt is reduced from 24 h to 12 h to enhance the performance of ppa system and further enrich functional bacteria with the hrt was reduced on days 127 132 140 and 156 the ammonia nitrite and total nitrogen in the effluent quickly returned to low levels after a brief increase fig 5a b the ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre would return to normal levels after a brief decrease fig 5b which means that the ppa system has good adaptability to hrt changes then tnrr gradually increased from 0 12 kgn m3 d to 0 29 kgn m3 d fig 5c indicated that the efficiency of the ppa system has been significantly improved with the shortening of hrt it is worth noting that under the shock of influent ammonia on days 130 137 and 150 the effluent nitrite temporarily increased to about 20 mg l and then decreased to a low level after 3 days fig 5a however after a similar shock in ammonia on the 167th day the effluent nitrite only increased to 15 mg l and decreased to 0 06 mg l on the second day fig 5a which confirmed that the stability of the ppa system would gradually increase with the extension of operation time and the enrichment of functional bacteria 3 4 2 long term operation stage in stage d ii days 176 208 with the hrt was shortened to 11 h the feed pump of anammox reached the maximum actual flow ammonia removal and nitrate removal remain basically unchanged fig 5b implied that there is still great potential for improvement in the efficiency of the ppa system the influent ammonia was decreased at day 182 and increased at day 200 fig 5a while the ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre were remained basically stable fig 5b c indicated that the long term stable and efficient nitrogen removal was achieved by ppa system in treat variable real nmw wastewater averages of ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre in the ppa system were 98 8 66 1 and 87 0 respectively and maximum values of them of 100 77 4 and 91 7 respectively fig 5b c then the nre average of ppa system is higher than that of the single stage pn pd anammox process 85 3 17 means that the performance of ppa system is better than that of single stage pn pd anammox process moreover the average value of tnlr 0 31 kgn m3 d in stage d iii is lower than that on days 156 175 hrt is 12 h 0 32 kgn m3 d while the average value of tnrr 0 272 kgn m3 d in stage d iii is higher than that on days 156 175 0 267 kgn m3 d fig 5d revealed that shortening of hrt rather than increasing tnlr leads to the increase of tnrr in ppa system 3 4 3 nitrogen conversion rate and functional bacteria on the begin and end of stage d nitrogen conversion rate of pd and pn reactors were determined by in situ measurement on days 128 183 the nitrite production rate in pd reactor was increased from 17 9 mg l h to 61 2 mg l h and the time for nitrite accumulation to reach its maximum was shortened from 60 min to 30 min fig 5e f similarly on days 120 184 the nitrite accumulation rate in pn reactor is increased from 8 6 mg l h to 13 7 mg l h and the time when the ratio of nitrite to ammonia reaches 1 3 is shortened from 150 min to 90 min fig 5h k therefore the nitrogen conversion rate in pd and pn processes were significantly improved due to those advanced operating strategies moreover when the mixing time of 120 min the nitrate on day 184 5 5 mg l is lower than that on day 120 5 8 mg l fig 5h k means that the activity of nob was efficiently suppressed for a long time in real nmw wastewater through the optimized ph do strategy then the influent ammonia on day 184 80 mg l is much lower than that on day 120 123 mg l fig 5a indicated the inhibition of optimized ph do strategy on nob is less affected by the influent ammonia furthermore in the uppar reactor the abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased significantly from 16 8 day 120 to 48 3 day 208 in summary through the real time cod n control strategy the optimized ph do strategy and the uppar reactor the nitrogen conversion rate and functional bacterial abundance in pd pn and anammox reactors have been improved in long term operation respectively 3 4 4 influence of hrt on the performance of ppa system in order to clearly reveal the influence of hrt on the performance of ppa system statistical analysis was performed on nre nrr and nrcra under each hrt fig 5d f the nre average first decreased slowly and then increased significantly with the increase of hrt and the nre average reached the minimum when hrt of 16 h fig 5j the increase in the abundance of anaob on days 120 140 was significantly lower than that on days 140 175 and days 173 208 fig 5i hence maybe the lag in the growth of functional bacteria caused the decrease of nre average when hrt of 18 h and 16 h then the nre average when hrt of 12 h 81 9 and 11 h 86 6 were apparently higher than that when het of 14 24 h 72 4 79 1 fig 5j the abundance of nob was in high level on days 120 140 4 0 5 1 and in low level on days 173 208 0 5 0 7 fig 5i means that the shortening hrt improved the nre via by accelerating the wash out of nob in anammox granular sludge anaob is located inside and nob is located outside 19 in the ppa system the influent of anammox reactor is the effluent of the pn reactor and its do was lower than 0 1 mg l in pn reactor thus the nob on the surface of anammox granular sludge has lost its role in creating an anaerobic environment during the start up phase and limited the efficiency of the ppa system by increasing nitrate production shortening hrt is an effective way to facilitate granular sludge formation and functional bacterial enrichment by increasing water flow shear force 32 therefore the shortening of hrt may promote the washing out of surface nob and the enrichment of anaob in granular sludge by increasing the shear force on granule sludge 3 5 economic analyses of ppa system the economy of the nitrogen removal process was evaluated through the consumption of reagents and electrical energy and the amount of activated sludge generated per 1m3 of nmw wastewater calculated based on ammonia of 120 mg l and nitrate of 40 mg l processed during the stable operation stage for every 1 m3 of nmw wastewater treated 552 g of oxygen and 456 g of cod are consumed and 107 6 g of biomass is produced in the traditional nitrification and denitrification process 235 6 g of oxygen and 164 7 g of cod are consumed and 51 1 g of biomass is produced in the pn anammox denitrification process 7 and 200 4 g of oxygen and 45 6 g of cod are consumed and 26 4 g of biomass is produced in the ppa system fig 6 therefore the oxygen consumption cod consumption and biomass production of the ppa system are reduced by 64 90 and 76 respectively compared to the nitrification and denitrification process and by 15 72 and 48 respectively compared to the pn anammox denitrification process compared to the pn anammox denitrification process the ppa system converts the influent nitrate into nitrite through pd process and reducing 1 cod consumption by reducing the cod n ratio from 4 5 to 2 1 2 biomass production by inhibiting the growth of other heterotrophic unfunctional bacteria 3 oxygen consumption in pn process due to the supply of nitrite in pd process 3 6 characteristics and application prospects of the ppa system in this study a novel three stage pd pn anammox process was successfully constructed to achieve stable efficient energy saving and cost reducing real nmw wastewater treatment firstly the maximum autotrophic nitrogen removal was achieved through pd and pn processes and significant reduced aeration energy consumption carbon source consumption and biomass production secondly the instability of unstable influent ammonia and nitrate nitrogen to the nre of ppa system was weakened by the combination of pd pn and anammox processes thirdly the excess of cod and the reduction of nitrite caused by the instability of influent nitrate were avoided through a rtcrc strategy fourthly the inhibition of the ph do strategy on nob was enhanced and the efficient nitrite accumulation at low fa concentrations 1 1 0 2 mg l was achieved via extending the aeration interval fifthly the anammox sludge particles with size over 2 mm were formed in nmw wastewater through the uppar reactor sixthly in the uppar reactor nob was promoted to form granular sludge during the start up stage of anammox process and selectively washed out during the combined operation stage to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of the ppa system seventh the main ways to achieve anammox sludge granulation in uppar reactor include adding filamentous bacteria Î± d glucose and a helix finally the average of nre in the ppa system 87 0 is higher than that in the single stage pn pd anammox process 85 3 and the pn anammox pd anammox process 84 9 and the average of effluent ammonia 1 0 mg l in the ppa system is significantly lower than that of pn a denitrification process 4 0 mg l and integrated pd pn anammox process about 20 0 mg l 7 17 33 in the ppa system the pd process is responsible for removing the influent nitrate and supplying nitrite for anammox process the pn process is responsible for ensuring stable nitrite to ammonia ratio in the influent of anammox through the adjustment of hrt and the anammox process is responsible for the autotrophic removal of nitrogen moreover through the combination of three processes not only the proportion of nitrogen autotrophic removal from nmw wastewater was increased achieve energy saving and consumption reducing but also the excellent nre and good robustness of the ppa system efficiency increasing and quality improving were achieved in another study the pn anammox process has been proven to be capable of continuously treating simulated nmw wastewater using multistage baffled reactors 34 therefore the principle of ppa systems can be used to upgrade and transform current wwtps in the form of multistage baffled reactors by adding baffles to oxidation ditches 4 conclusions in this study a novel three stage pd pn anammox combined ppa system is developed to achieve efficiency increasing quality improving energy saving and consumption reducing through strategy and device innovation the efficient anr 98 9 1 8 and nre 87 0 2 3 the natural enrichment of anaob the abundance increased from 0 to 48 4 and the granulation of anammox sludge size 2 mm are realized in ppa system in the treatment of highly variable real nmw wastewater then the stable inhibition of nob by the improved ph do strategy under long term low fa concentration ensures the application of the anammox process in treating low ammonia nitrogen wastewater moreover in uppar reactor the granulation of anammox is achieved by adding specific bacteria macromolecules and protein secondary structures

12411,in this study a novel three stage partial denitrification partial nitrification anammox pd pn anammox system was established results showed that the excess of cod and the reduction of nitrite in pd process caused by the instability of influent nitrate are avoided through real time influent cod n ratio of 2 1 the extending the aeration interval in pn process enhanced the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and promoted the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria under low free ammonia fa 1 1 0 2 mg l in the upflow porous plate anaerobic reactor uppar anammox bacteria candidatus kuennia was rapid natural enriched from 0 to 48 4 and granular anammox was formed by the increased of filamentous bacteria Î± d glucose and a helix moreover the removal and robustness of ammonia nitrogen 98 9 1 8 and total nitrogen 87 0 2 3 in this system are better than those of the single stage pn pd anammox process and its cost of oxygen consumption cod consumption and sludge treatment is far lower than that of nitrification denitrification process and pn anammox denitrification process this study provides a series of feasible start up and operation strategies of pd pn anammox and pd pn anammox processes for the application of anammox in rare earth mining wastewater which proposes upgrading and renovation plans for local wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial denitrification partial nitrification anammox granular sludge pilot scale real mining wastewater nob inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen rich mine wastewater nmw is formed under the leaching of these rare earth tailings in rainwater and groundwater 1 which is highly variable ammonia 65 185 mg l and nitrate nitrogen 30 88 mg l low chemical oxygen demand cod 10 mg l and residual rare earth elements rees 0 20 mg l 2 3 the nitrification denitrification process is the only technology used in nmw wastewater treatment plants wwtps 4 5 compared with this process the anammox process has significant advantages due to its superior performance and less organic carbon consumption energy consumption and sludge output 6 in nmw wastewater low concentration ammonia limits the inhibition of free ammonia fa on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 2 and reduces the growth of anammox bacteria anaob 7 therefore the stably inhibition of nob and the naturally enrichment of anaob obstacles to the application of anammox process in nmw wastewater 8 device innovation strategy innovation and development of a multi stage coupling process based on the anammox process are important methods to overcome these two obstacles and promote the application of anammox 9 the realization of natural enrichment of anaob is the key to promote the application of anammox process in real wastewater 8 sludge granulation is one of the optimal choices to achieve the enrichment and retention of anaob 10 then proper reactor configuration is one of the key conditions for forming granular sludge and enriching anaob 10 however the natural enrichment of anaob in real nmw wastewater has not yet been realized 7 hence the innovation of reactor configuration to realize the enrichment and granulation of anaob is an important way to promote the application of anammox process in real nmw wastewater preventing nitrite oxidation in partial nitrification pn process is a necessary condition to realize the stable supply of nitrite and anammox process 11 12 the inhibition strategies of nitrite oxidation include nitrite oxidation inhibitor 12 operation optimization intermittent aeration 13 micro aeration 14 etc ultrasonic treatment 15 fa control 7 etc when applying nitrite oxidation inhibitor ultrasonic treatment or fa control strategy in low ammonia wastewater the potential pollutants inhibitors ammonia nitrogen etc are added or energy consumption ultrasonic is increased and the performance pn process will face the risk of performance deterioration after long term operation 11 12 then the comprehensive control strategy integrating ph value aeration rate and aeration time control is considered to be the most effective strategy to achieve nob inhibition in low ammonia wastewater 11 generally there are two types anammox based processes single stage and multi stage 16 although the installation efforts of single stage anammox based process are less multi stage anammox based process has more significant advantages in good system stability and easy promotion when treating unstable ammonia wastewater 7 in a study on nmw wastewater treatment influent ammonia and nitrate were removed by pn a process and denitrification process respectively and 62 of nitrogen was autotrophic removed 7 moreover the proportion of autotrophic nitrogen removal can be further increased by replacing denitrification process with partial denitrification pd process and supplying nitrite to anammox process which will significantly reduce operating costs such as organic agent consumption aeration energy consumption and sludge disposal currently only one single stage pn pd anammox process has been reported but its long term stability of nitrogen removal efficiency is poor 17 in previous studies many start up and operational strategies for pd pn and anammox processes were developed in treating stable simulated wastewater 2 7 18 19 however the ingredients of real nmw wastewater were complicated thus it is unknown whether these strategies can achieve ideal results in treating nmw wastewater the feasibility of treating nmw wastewater with three stage pn a denitrification process has been confirmed which achieving pn and anammox processes through the addition of ammonia nitrogen and mature anaerobic ammonia oxidation fillers respectively but the feasibility of long term stable operation of pn a process in treating nmw wastewater has not been verified in practice 7 furthermore a stable cod n ratio is crucial for the implementation of the pd process 17 while the nitrate in real nmw wastewater is highly unstable which poses a huge challenge to the implementation and stable operation of the pd process in this study a novel three stage ppa system was developed to treat real nmw wastewater which included two pilot scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs and a pilot scale upflow porous plate anaerobic reactor uppar were used for pd pn and anammox this study aimed to i determine the feasibility of establish pd pn and anammox process using activated sludge ii realize stable and efficient nitrite accumulation in pd and pn process through strategy innovation iii reveal the mechanism of uppar promoting anammox granulation and natural enrichment of anaob iv evaluate the long term 208 days efficiency and

pilot scale device consists of pd reactor pn reactor anammox reactor intermediate water tank and control system fig 1 the pd and pn reactors are sequencing batch reactor sbr with effective volume of 14 83 m3 and 14 45 m3 respectively and the volume exchange rates of those two reactors are 45 in the anammox reactor uppar reactor the natural enrichment retention and granulation of anaob were achieved in alternating high low shear zones by adding multistage porous plates the automatic control system achieves the control of ph dissolved oxygen do and hydraulic retention time hrt in each reactor by adjusting the control pump and valve the ppa system was installed at the site of the guanxi nmw wastewater wwtps nitrification denitrification process in longnan city jiangxi province china with a wastewater treatment capacity of 50 m3 d this pilot scale device is operated in two modes in mode i the pd pn and anammox reactors were started and operated in treating real nmw wastewater respectively in mode ii these three reactors in stable operation were combined into a ppa system and used to treat real nmw wastewater the real nmw wastewater passes through pd pn and anammox reactors one by one and nitrate and ammonia in the wastewater are sequentially removed 2 2 characteristics of wastewater and inoculum the residual sludge obtained from the wwtps was added to the pd pn and anammox reactors respectively after inoculation the mixed solution volatile suspended solids mlvss of these reactors were 2 8 g l the influent of the pilot scale device is real nmw wastewater with ammonia of 92 36 mg l cod of 3 2 mg l nitrate of 43 16 mg l and ph of 8 5 0 5 moreover to avoid effects of rees the concentration of rees is decrease to a low level 0 24 0 74 mg l by precipitation

into three stages start up stage bi long term operation stage b ii and strategy optimization stage b iii and its operating cycle includes feeding stirring settling discharging and idling for 20 min 120 min 30 min 10 min 10 min respectively moreover the individual operation of the am reactor is divided into three stages inoculum acclimatization stage ci start up stage c ii and long term operation stage c iii furthermore the operation of ppa system is divided into two stages operation optimization stage di and long term operation stage d ii through the automatic control system the control of influent cod n ratio and ph is achieved by adjusting the flow rate of sodium acetate and sodium hydroxide dosing pumps the detailed operating parameters of pilot scale pd pn and anammox reactors are summarized in table 1 in this study the ph do strategy the real time cod n ratio control rtcrc strategy and the uppar strategy are strategies for establishing pd pn and anammox processes in real nmw wastewater respectively which is first posted in treating synthetic nmw wastewater 20 22 and improved based on actual operation in this study in the ph do strategy the ph in pn reactor is remained at 7 5 the do of 0 7 mg l and aeration 30 min interval 30 min in start up stage and the do of 0 1 mg l and aeration 25 min interval 35 min in long term operation stage through this strategy nob is inhibited through the lack of do and the delayed restore of anaerobic nob active after aeration intervals while aob is selectively enriched at appropriate ph and do in the rtcrc strategy the cod n ratio decreased from 5 0 to 2 1 in the first 20 days and then remained at 2 1 base on the real time nitrate concentration that before feeding in the uppar strategy under reflux ratio of 2 the natural enrichment retention and granulation of anaob were achieved in alternating high low shear zones by adding multistage porous plates details of these three strategies have been provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are daily measured via standard methods 23 moreover the ph value in water sample and reactor are measured by

process to explore the evolution of microbial community structure before and after strategy optimization and joint operation these sludge samples are subjected to high throughput sequencing details for sludge sample processing and high throughput sequencing were shown in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of stable pilot scale pd process in nmw wastewater 3 1 1 start up stage of pd reactor the start up and operational performance of the pilot scale pd process is shown in fig 2 in this study sodium acetate organic carbon was injected after feeding in stage a i days 1 20 the cod n ratio was gradually reduced from 5 to 2 1 to achieve nitrite accumulation fig 2a within the first 8 days of the pd operation the ph and cod n ratio of are maintained at 8 0 mg l and 5 0 respectively fig 2b c the effluent nitrate is decreased to a very low level 0 2 mg l fig 2a indicated that the denitrification performance was fully recovered with the cod n ratio gradually reduced to 2 1 days 9 20 the nitrite in effluent gradually increased from 0 24 mg l to 16 6 mg l fig 2a and the nitrite accumulation rate nar also increased from 0 47 to 31 9 fig 2c which means the accumulation of nitrite can be initially achieved in real nmw wastewater 3 1 2 strategy optimization stag of pd reactor the stage a ii days 21 71 is the strategy adjustment stage on days 21 31 nar was stable at 28 6 4 2 fig 2b however under the same strategy the nar of lab scale pd process achieved 60 22 hence the operation strategy of pd process needs to be adjusted to cope with the complex actual nmw wastewater and increase the nar consecutive rainfall on days 28 29 and days 33 34 resulted in a significant drop in influent nitrate fig 2a nar was reduced from 26 96 to 0 03 fig 2c since the cod n ratio and the dosage of sodium acetate are fixed fig 2b the reduction of influent nitrate results in a rapid increase in the actual cod n ratio in the short term fig 2c which leads to the further removal of nitrite by denitrifying bacteria then the nar was always in low level 6 2 1 0 on days 36 44 fig 2c means that the performance of pd process deteriorated after continuous short term shock high ph value 9 0 9 2 is regarded as an important way to improve the stability of pd process and alleviate the deterioration of pd process 24 25 therefore on days 44 61 the ph value in the pd reactor was set to 9 0 0 2 fig 2a and the nar gradually increased from 4 4 to 21 8 fig 2c however as the rainfall on days 46 51 and 55 the nar then decreased again to a lower level 3 8 3 4 fig 2c this implies that the high ph strategy can only achieve the temporary recovery of pd process efficiency but still cannot cope with the continuous short term shock of nmw wastewater after the rtcrc strategy was applied the effluent nitrite gradually increased from 4 4 mg l to 15 2 mg l fig 2a and the nar also increased to a higher level 26 5 4 9 fig 2c confirmed that the rtcrc strategy can recover the deteriorated pd process 3 1 3 recovery and long term operation stage of pd reactor on days 31 and 51 the influent nitrate was decreased due to rainfall hence the real cod n ratio rapidly increased and significantly exceeding its set value and then the nar decreased to a low level fig 2c therefore in stage a iii days 61 105 the rtcrc strategy was applied the injection volume of cdo is determined by the influent nitrate before feeding in each cycle through the automatic control system rather than the influent nitrate during sampling details shown in the supplementary materials on days 61 70 the real cod n ratio is close to the theoretical cod n ratio the nar gradually increased and maintained at a high level 25 5 1 1 fig 2c confirmed that the rtcrc strategy is an effective strategy for pd process treating real nmw wastewater on days 71 105 to determine the role of high ph in restoring pd process the ph value was decreased from 9 0 to 8 0 nar further increased to 53 7 5 3 fig 2c indicating that a high ph of 9 0 was beneficial for pd process in short time but was unbeneficial for it in long time in situ nitrogen and cod determination and high throughput sequencing were carried out in pd reactor on days 1 19 69 and 105 fig 2d f the nitrite on days 1 19 and 69 basically remains unchanged within 90 120 min of stirring fig 2d indicating that the above strategies can achieve nitrite accumulation the accumulation rate and ratio of nitrite on day 69 are significantly higher than those on days 1 and 19 fig 2d shows that the key to enhance the resistance of short term shock is the rtcrc strategy rather than the high ph strategy the initial cod concentration the first sample obtained after uniform mixing on day 69 is significantly higher than that on days 1 and 19 fig 2e which confirms that the rtcrc strategy may be to achieve the efficient accumulation of nitrite by reducing the consumption of cod by non functional bacteria in the main genus of pd reactor relative abundance 2 the theura is classified to partial denitrification bacteria 26 and the simplicispira thermomonas and acidovorax are classified to complete denitrifying bacteria 2 26 28 compared with sample on day 1 the abundance of theura and simplicispira on day 19 decreased while the abundance of thermomonas and acidovorax increased fig 2f which showed that the high ph strategy only has a certain inhibition on dominant non functional bacteria but has a significant inhibition on functional bacteria on day 69 the abundance of theura gradually recovered and approached that on day 1 while abundance of other three main non functional bacteria decreased significantly fig 2f therefore selective and efficient enrichment of pd functional bacteria in real nmw wastewater was achieved by rtcrc strategy 3 2 establishment of stable pilot scale pn process in nmw wastewater 3 2 1 start up stage of pn reactor in stage bi days 1 18 with ph of 7 5 0 2 hrt of 12 h and do of 0 7 mg l aeration 30 min every 30 min nitrate and ammonia in effluent were gradually decreased fig 3a b the effluent nitrite was increased to a high level fig 3b and nar was increased from 19 7 to 90 1 fig 3c nar over 90 means that pn process was started 21 hence the ph do strategy is an effective strategy to start up pn process under the continuous short term shock of ammonia in influent 3 2 2 strategy optimization stag of pn reactor in stage b ii days 19 49 with do of 0 1 mg l and hrt of 6 h the effluent ammonia gradually decreased from 27 0 mg l to a low level 0 9 0 4 mg l after a short time rise fig 3a then the nar increased to a high level 95 2 1 9 on days 19 38 fig 3c but decreased to 87 4 fig 3c with the influent ammonia decreased from 120 3 19 6 mg l to 96 4 8 8 mg l on days 38 49 the fa is positively correlated with influent ammonia 21 moreover napr on day 49 was significantly higher than that on day 29 fig 3e indicated that the activity of nob was increased due to the decrease in nob inhibition caused by fa therefore it is necessary to optimize strategies to further inhibit the growth of nob 3 2 3 long term operation stage of pn reactor according to the nitrogen in situ determination on day 49 shown in the supplementary materials nitrate was produced after stirring for 3 h extending the aeration interval appropriately is believed to help strengthen the inhibition of nob 21 thus in stage b iii days 50 60 with the hrt reduced to 4 h and the aeration mode adjusted to 25 min of aeration every 35 min the effluent nitrate gradually approached and basically remained consistent with influent nitrite fig 3b and the nar increased and stabilized at a high level 99 5 0 8 fig 3c moreover the influent ammonia 113 9 6 0 mg l in stage b iii was higher than that in days 39 49 but lower than that in days 19 39 fig 3a while the average nar 99 5 in stage b iii was significantly higher than that in days 39 49 95 3 and days 19 39 91 9 fig 3c therefore the extending the aeration interval is an efficient and sustainable strategy for achieving long term stable operation of the pn process in real nmw wastewater furthermore the abundance of nitrospira the only found nob in samples and napr are decreased significantly fig 3d e hence through the extending the aeration interval the inhibition of nob was enhanced and its negative effect caused by the decrease in fa has been eliminated interestingly the abundance of nitrosomonas the only found aob in samples on day 60 was higher than that on day 49 fig 3f while the average snpr increased from 9 9 mg l h to 17 2 mg l h on days 49 60 fig 3d means that extending the aeration interval not only enhanced the inhibition of nob but also promoted the activity of aob 3 3 establishment of stable pilot scale anammox process in nmw wastewater 3 3 1 inoculum acclimatization stage of anammox reactor the start up and stable operation of a pilot scale anammox process in uppar reactor have been successfully realized in real nmw wastewater fig 4 in stage ci days 1 39 with the hrt of 72 h and the nitrite to ammonia ratio in influent of 0 4 the tn in effluent was mostly lower than that in influent the nre increases first and then decreases fig 4a and the nitrate in effluent first decreases and then gradually approaches that in influent fig 4b then the abundance of denitrifying bacteria thanura aridibacter and thermomonas 6 1 8 9 at this stage 2 is significantly higher than that of anaob candidatus kuenenia 0 0 7 fig 4d e therefore endogenous denitrification is the main pathway for nitrogen removal at this stage moreover nitrosomonas and nitrospirus are the only aob and nob found in the reactor respectively and their abundance were increased in stage ci fig 4g which is beneficial for the enrichment of anaob via create an anaerobic environment on days 34 39 the nitrate in effluent gradually approached that in influent fig 4c and actual values of the no2 removal to nh4 removal ratio and the no3 production to nh4 removal ratio gradually approached their theoretical values fig 4d indicated that anammox process gradually became the main nitrogen removal pathway 3 3 2 start up stage of anammox reactor in stage c ii days 40 70 the nitrite nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen ratio in influent is set to 1 3 the anr is increased from 20 8 to 92 4 the nre is increased from 23 5 to 67 6 nrr is increased from 0 001 to 0 11 kgn m3 d fig 4b and the abundance of candidatus kuennia was increased from 0 7 to 3 3 fig 4e hence the anr and nre over 90 and 60 means that anammox process has been successfully started 3 3 3 long term operation stage of anammox reactor in stage c iii days 71 95 with the hrt of 24 h and the nitrite nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen ratio in influent of 1 3 the influent ammonia suddenly decreased from 135 9 mg l to 73 0 mg l and then recovered to 113 1 mg l on days 73 89 fig 4a and the nre first decreased from 67 7 to 42 4 and then recovered to 65 3 fig 4b shown that the anammox process using uppar reactor has great resistance to ammonia shock after startup then the significant increase in the abundance of candidatus kuennia and the decrease in the abundance of other bacteria fig 4e g confirm that the natural enrichment anaob was achieved in the uppar reactor 3 3 4 granulation in anammox reactor uppar reactor is a uasb reactor that adds three porous plates with a decreasing number of holes from bottom to top to achieve local high speed water flow shear force at low reflux speeds to promote granulation formation 19 the sludge images of each stage provided in supplementary materials shown the formation process of anammox granular sludge in the uppar reactor in stage ci the sludge color changes from brown to gray and it presents a fine sand morphology size of 0 2 0 8 mm indicated the end of cell lysis by inert bacteria and the beginning of sludge granulation in stage c ii the sludge color gradually changed to light red and deep red and the sludge particle size significantly increased to 0 2 1 0 mm revealed the rapid accumulation of anaob and the acceleration of sludge granulation in stage c iii a large number of bright red particles with sizes exceeding 2 mm are found confirmed that the uppar reactor is an effective device for realizing sludge granulation in real nmw wastewater moreover anaerolineaceae is an anaerobic filamentous bacterium that plays a key role in sludge granulation and maintaining the stability of granular sludge 29 in stage c ii the abundance of unclassified anaerolineaceae was increased rapidly and maintained at a high level 2 6 3 0 fig 4g shown that it is an important way to achieve sludge granulation in uppar reactor that promote the growth of filamentous bacteria according to the ftir graph the peaks at 873 cm 1 and 1425 cm 1 are the most two peaks with the most significant increase fig 4h which were classified as characteristic absorption peaks of Î± d glucose and the a helix in the secondary structure of protein and play a key role in backbone support and cell aggregation in anammox granular sludge respectively 30 31 therefore it is an important way for uppar reactors to achieve sludge granulation in real nmw wastewater that promote the generation of Î± d glucose and a helix 3 4 performance of pilot scale ppa system after some exploratory attempts in stage d days 120 208 the anammox reactor was connected with pd and pn reactors to verify the performance of the ppa system in treating real nmw wastewater 3 4 1 operation optimization stage in stage di days 120 175 the hrt is reduced from 24 h to 12 h to enhance the performance of ppa system and further enrich functional bacteria with the hrt was reduced on days 127 132 140 and 156 the ammonia nitrite and total nitrogen in the effluent quickly returned to low levels after a brief increase fig 5a b the ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre would return to normal levels after a brief decrease fig 5b which means that the ppa system has good adaptability to hrt changes then tnrr gradually increased from 0 12 kgn m3 d to 0 29 kgn m3 d fig 5c indicated that the efficiency of the ppa system has been significantly improved with the shortening of hrt it is worth noting that under the shock of influent ammonia on days 130 137 and 150 the effluent nitrite temporarily increased to about 20 mg l and then decreased to a low level after 3 days fig 5a however after a similar shock in ammonia on the 167th day the effluent nitrite only increased to 15 mg l and decreased to 0 06 mg l on the second day fig 5a which confirmed that the stability of the ppa system would gradually increase with the extension of operation time and the enrichment of functional bacteria 3 4 2 long term operation stage in stage d ii days 176 208 with the hrt was shortened to 11 h the feed pump of anammox reached the maximum actual flow ammonia removal and nitrate removal remain basically unchanged fig 5b implied that there is still great potential for improvement in the efficiency of the ppa system the influent ammonia was decreased at day 182 and increased at day 200 fig 5a while the ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre were remained basically stable fig 5b c indicated that the long term stable and efficient nitrogen removal was achieved by ppa system in treat variable real nmw wastewater averages of ammonia removal nitrate removal and nre in the ppa system were 98 8 66 1 and 87 0 respectively and maximum values of them of 100 77 4 and 91 7 respectively fig 5b c then the nre average of ppa system is higher than that of the single stage pn pd anammox process 85 3 17 means that the performance of ppa system is better than that of single stage pn pd anammox process moreover the average value of tnlr 0 31 kgn m3 d in stage d iii is lower than that on days 156 175 hrt is 12 h 0 32 kgn m3 d while the average value of tnrr 0 272 kgn m3 d in stage d iii is higher than that on days 156 175 0 267 kgn m3 d fig 5d revealed that shortening of hrt rather than increasing tnlr leads to the increase of tnrr in ppa system 3 4 3 nitrogen conversion rate and functional bacteria on the begin and end of stage d nitrogen conversion rate of pd and pn reactors were determined by in situ measurement on days 128 183 the nitrite production rate in pd reactor was increased from 17 9 mg l h to 61 2 mg l h and the time for nitrite accumulation to reach its maximum was shortened from 60 min to 30 min fig 5e f similarly on days 120 184 the nitrite accumulation rate in pn reactor is increased from 8 6 mg l h to 13 7 mg l h and the time when the ratio of nitrite to ammonia reaches 1 3 is shortened from 150 min to 90 min fig 5h k therefore the nitrogen conversion rate in pd and pn processes were significantly improved due to those advanced operating strategies moreover when the mixing time of 120 min the nitrate on day 184 5 5 mg l is lower than that on day 120 5 8 mg l fig 5h k means that the activity of nob was efficiently suppressed for a long time in real nmw wastewater through the optimized ph do strategy then the influent ammonia on day 184 80 mg l is much lower than that on day 120 123 mg l fig 5a indicated the inhibition of optimized ph do strategy on nob is less affected by the influent ammonia furthermore in the uppar reactor the abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased significantly from 16 8 day 120 to 48 3 day 208 in summary through the real time cod n control strategy the optimized ph do strategy and the uppar reactor the nitrogen conversion rate and functional bacterial abundance in pd pn and anammox reactors have been improved in long term operation respectively 3 4 4 influence of hrt on the performance of ppa system in order to clearly reveal the influence of hrt on the performance of ppa system statistical analysis was performed on nre nrr and nrcra under each hrt fig 5d f the nre average first decreased slowly and then increased significantly with the increase of hrt and the nre average reached the minimum when hrt of 16 h fig 5j the increase in the abundance of anaob on days 120 140 was significantly lower than that on days 140 175 and days 173 208 fig 5i hence maybe the lag in the growth of functional bacteria caused the decrease of nre average when hrt of 18 h and 16 h then the nre average when hrt of 12 h 81 9 and 11 h 86 6 were apparently higher than that when het of 14 24 h 72 4 79 1 fig 5j the abundance of nob was in high level on days 120 140 4 0 5 1 and in low level on days 173 208 0 5 0 7 fig 5i means that the shortening hrt improved the nre via by accelerating the wash out of nob in anammox granular sludge anaob is located inside and nob is located outside 19 in the ppa system the influent of anammox reactor is the effluent of the pn reactor and its do was lower than 0 1 mg l in pn reactor thus the nob on the surface of anammox granular sludge has lost its role in creating an anaerobic environment during the start up phase and limited the efficiency of the ppa system by increasing nitrate production shortening hrt is an effective way to facilitate granular sludge formation and functional bacterial enrichment by increasing water flow shear force 32 therefore the shortening of hrt may promote the washing out of surface nob and the enrichment of anaob in granular sludge by increasing the shear force on granule sludge 3 5 economic analyses of ppa system the economy of the nitrogen removal process was evaluated through the consumption of reagents and electrical energy and the amount of activated sludge generated per 1m3 of nmw wastewater calculated based on ammonia of 120 mg l and nitrate of 40 mg l processed during the stable operation stage for every 1 m3 of nmw wastewater treated 552 g of oxygen and 456 g of cod are consumed and 107 6 g of biomass is produced in the traditional nitrification and denitrification process 235 6 g of oxygen and 164 7 g of cod are consumed and 51 1 g of biomass is produced in the pn anammox denitrification process 7 and 200 4 g of oxygen and 45 6 g of cod are consumed and 26 4 g of biomass is produced in the ppa system fig 6 therefore the oxygen consumption cod consumption and biomass production of the ppa system are reduced by 64 90 and 76 respectively compared to the nitrification and denitrification process and by 15 72 and 48 respectively compared to the pn anammox denitrification process compared to the pn anammox denitrification process the ppa system converts the influent nitrate into nitrite through pd process and reducing 1 cod consumption by reducing the cod n ratio from 4 5 to 2 1 2 biomass production by inhibiting the growth of other heterotrophic unfunctional bacteria 3 oxygen consumption in pn process due to the supply of nitrite in pd process 3 6 characteristics and application prospects of the ppa system in this study a novel three stage pd pn anammox process was successfully constructed to achieve stable efficient energy saving and cost reducing real nmw wastewater treatment firstly the maximum autotrophic nitrogen removal was achieved through pd and pn processes and significant reduced aeration energy consumption carbon source consumption and biomass production secondly the instability of unstable influent ammonia and nitrate nitrogen to the nre of ppa system was weakened by the combination of pd pn and anammox processes thirdly the excess of cod and the reduction of nitrite caused by the instability of influent nitrate were avoided through a rtcrc strategy fourthly the inhibition of the ph do strategy on nob was enhanced and the efficient nitrite accumulation at low fa concentrations 1 1 0 2 mg l was achieved via extending the aeration interval fifthly the anammox sludge particles with size over 2 mm were formed in nmw wastewater through the uppar reactor sixthly in the uppar reactor nob was promoted to form granular sludge during the start up stage of anammox process and selectively washed out during the combined operation stage to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of the ppa system seventh the main ways to achieve anammox sludge granulation in uppar reactor include adding filamentous bacteria Î± d glucose and a helix finally the average of nre in the ppa system 87 0 is higher than that in the single stage pn pd anammox process 85 3 and the pn anammox pd anammox process 84 9 and the average of effluent ammonia 1 0 mg l in the ppa system is significantly lower than that of pn a denitrification process 4 0 mg l and integrated pd pn anammox process about 20 0 mg l 7 17 33 in the ppa system the pd process is responsible for removing the influent nitrate and supplying nitrite for anammox process the pn process is responsible for ensuring stable nitrite to ammonia ratio in the influent of anammox through the adjustment of hrt and the anammox process is responsible for the autotrophic removal of nitrogen moreover through the combination of three processes not only the proportion of nitrogen autotrophic removal from nmw wastewater was increased achieve energy saving and consumption reducing but also the excellent nre and good robustness of the ppa system efficiency increasing and quality improving were achieved in another study the pn anammox process has been proven to be capable of continuously treating simulated nmw wastewater using multistage baffled reactors 34 therefore the principle of ppa systems can be used to upgrade and transform current wwtps in the form of multistage baffled reactors by adding baffles to oxidation ditches 4 conclusions in this study a novel three stage pd pn anammox combined ppa system is developed to achieve efficiency increasing quality improving energy saving and consumption reducing through strategy and device innovation the efficient anr 98 9 1 8 and nre 87 0 2 3 the natural enrichment of anaob the abundance increased from 0 to 48 4 and the granulation of anammox sludge size 2 mm are realized in ppa system in the treatment of highly variable real nmw wastewater then the stable inhibition of nob by the improved ph do strategy under long term low fa concentration ensures the application of the anammox process in treating low ammonia nitrogen wastewater moreover in uppar reactor the granulation of anammox is achieved by adding specific bacteria macromolecules and protein secondary structures

12412,owing to the outstanding properties including non toxicity large surface area bactericidal ability and versatile surface chemistry ti3c2tx mxene based adsorbents and membranes have been widely explored in drinking water and wastewater treatment at the same time with the rapid increase in mxene applications it is inevitable that mxene will find its way into water and wastewater treatment systems it is therefore imperative to assess its potential for disinfection by products dbps formation and physicochemical transformation by chlorination this study demonstrated that ti3c2tx mxene has a high formation potential of dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetic acid dcaa during the chlorination and chloramination procedures few layered ti3c2tx with

number of publications on mxenes has rapidly increased from 24 in 2014 to 2633 in 2021 a recent market report published by gii research indicates that the current global mxene market was valued at 26 4 million in 2021 with projected growth to reach 121 5 million by 2027 13 similar to graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes 14 16 it is foreseeable that the release of mxenes to the drinking water and wastewater systems will increase as their production and applications continue to expand chlorination and chloramination are widely used disinfection methods for wastewater and drinking water treatment worldwide 17 18 however a significant disadvantage of using chlorine containing disinfectants in drinking water treatment is the unintended and unavoidably formation of various disinfection byproducts dbps through the reaction of chlorine with natural organic matters noms 19 20 dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloacetonitriles hans have been reported to be

studies have demonstrated that even active carbon ac may serve as a precursor for dbps due to the presence of oxygen containing functionalities 25 other carbon materials such as fullerene graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes and biochar have also been reported to act as dbps precursors during chlorination or chloramination 26 29 another drawback associated with chlorination is the residual

carbon containing nanomaterials mxene may serve as a precursor for dbps when it comes into contact with chlorine during drinking water pretreatment and household drinking water treatment in addition the physiochemical properties of mxene may undergo changes during chlorination which can affect its fate in environment therefore it is necessary to assess its potential for dbps formation and the

at room temperature 25 1 c for 3 days afterwards water samples were collected and filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m membrane to remove any solid materials the chlorine residual was then quenched with ascorbic

result and discussion 3 1 formation of dbps with ti3c2tx mxene the x ray diffraction patterns of the samples confirmed the successful synthesis of f ti3c2tx and m ti3c2tx mxenes fig 1 the xrd pattern of m ti3c2tx showed characteristic diffraction peaks at 8 9 18 2 27 8 34 3 43 2 and 60 6o consistent with literature data 39 40 in sharp contrast all the diffraction peaks except the one corresponding to the 002 lattice plane of f ti3c2tx sample weakened significantly additionally the 002 peak shifted to a lower 2Î¸ value accompanied by an obvious peak intensity enhancement indicating an expansion of the lattice parameter 41 these results provided clear evidence for the successful synthesis of multi layered and few layered ti3c2tx mxene the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of both ti3c2tx samples exhibited an iv type with h3 hysteresis loop fig s2 demonstrating the existence of mesopores the specific surface area of f ti3c2tx and m ti3c2tx calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method were determined to be 17 33 and 4 8 m2 g table s1 respectively the relatively high specific surface area and the presence of mesopores suggest that ti3c2tx has a potential for high adsorption capacity for organic contaminants to assess whether the formation of dbps would be underestimated the adsorption of dbps specifically tcm dcaa and dcan on m ti3c2tx and f ti3c2tx was evaluated the results confirmed that no significant adsorption was observed suggesting the underestimation of dbps production was negligible as shown in fig 2 it was evident that chloramination resulted in a lower formation of dbps compared to chlorination in both ti3c2tx samples similar to the formation of dbps with go and carbon nanotubes 27 28 42 all three dbps produced in f ti3c2tx under both chlorination and chloramination were higher than that in m ti3c2tx demonstrating that f ti3c2tx has a greater capacity than m ti3c2tx to produce dbps during the disinfection process after three days of reaction the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan in the f ti3c2tx sample under chlorination were measured as 16 80 9 50 and 22 66 Î¼g l respectively this indicates that dcan is more readily formed than the other two dbps notably the concentration of dcan exceeded the world health organization s who limit of 20 Î¼g l highlighting the potential health risks associated with the application of mxene in water treatment considering the cumulative effect of tcm and dcaa in the liver that may lead to cancer it is important not to overlook the toxicological risks and lifetime cancer risks associated with long term exposure to low concentration of dbps 43 44 a similar trend was observed for the m ti3c2tx sample where the concentration of tcm dcaa and dcan after three days reaction were determined to be 10 36 7 03 and 17 75 Î¼g l respectively it is noteworthy that the bet surface area of f ti3c2tx was 3 6 times larger than that of m ti3c2tx interestingly the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan formed in the f ti3c2tx sample were 1 6 1 35 and 1 27 times higher respectively than those in the m ti3c2tx sample the higher concentration of dbps formed in the f ti3c2tx sample could be potentially be attributed to its larger surface area the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan formed from chloramination in the f ti3c2tx sample were determined to be 8 38 6 98 and 5 49 Î¼g l respectively the observed lower dbps formation under chloramination compared to chlorination can be attributed to the reduced presence of free chlorine resulting from monochloramine hydrolysis 45 46 of particular significance is the remarkable reduction in the concentration of dcan formed under chloramination which was only one fifth of the concentration produced under chlorination this finding suggests that the generation of dcan is strongly influenced by the concertation of free chlorine the formation of tcm dcaa and dcan under chloramination in the m ti3c2tx sample followed a similar trend with lower concentrations observed the time dependent formation of dbps during chlorination in the presence of mxene samples is shown in fig 3a and fig s3 the concentrations of tcm and dcan in f ti3c2tx exhibited a consistent trend steadily increasing as the chlorination time extended as depicted in fig 3a the formation of dcaa in f ti3c2tx was observed to be faster compared to tcm and dcan the concentration of dcaa rapidly increased within the first 10 h and then reached a plateau with further prolongation of the reaction time a similar trend was observed for the formation of the three dbps in m ti3c2tx mxene fig s3a given that the typical residual chlorine in drinking water ranges from 1 to 4 mg l the potential formation of dbps in mxene samples was assessed at lower cl2 concentrations the concentrations of tcm and dcaa in both the f ti3c2tx and m ti3c2tx samples exhibited a linear correlation with the chlorine dose with r2 values larger than 0 95 fig 3b and fig s3b however a significant concentration increase of dcan was observed in both samples when the chlorine dose increased from 10 to 20 mg l the values of toc aox and don were also determined to evaluate the dbps formation potential of ti3c2tx the effects of chlorine dose on toc were examined and shown in fig 4a and fig s4a it was observed that toc exhibited a linear correlation with chlorine dose higher toc promoted the formation of dbps the formation of aox under chlorination with ti3c2tx samples is displayed in fig 4b and fig s4b it is notable that the concentration of aox increased significantly with the increase in chlorine dose even at a chlorine dose as low as 1 0 mg l lower than the regulated residual free chlorine levels set by the us epa the concentration of aox also reached 17 6 Î¼g l the concentration of don at different chlorine doses is presented in fig 4c and fig s4c revealing an increase in don don concentration with higher chlorine doses ranging from 0 to 0 1 mg l conversely the contribution of don leached by ti3c2tx itself was found to be negligible these results confirm that chlorine reacts with the ti3c2tx leading to its decomposition and the subsequent formation of chlorinated organic compounds 3 2 mechanism of dbps formation with ti3c2tx the morphologies of the ti3c2tx samples before and after chlorination were characterized by using sem and tem as shown in fig s5 the chlorination process caused significant morphological changes of the ti3c2tx samples confirming the reaction between ti3c2tx samples and chlorine the smooth surface of the pristine samples became very rough after chlorination and tiny holes formed on the ti3c2tx nanosheets fig s5 d and h these holes were attributed to the etching of the nanosheets by free chlorine to get information on the formation mechanism of dbps with ti3c2tx under chlorination the mxene samples were characterized by using ftir to determine if ccl bonds were formed as shown in fig 5a the peak around 595 cm 1 was associated with the oti deformation vibration while the peak at and 1623 cm 1 corresponded to the bending vibration of oh demonstrating the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of f ti3c2tx after chlorination the intensity of the peak at 1623 cm 1 decreased suggesting a reaction between oh and chlorine which could potentially promote the formation of dcaa 27 42 however the peaks attributed to ccl bonds at 798 and 622 cm 1 were too faint to be clearly distinguished the raman spectrum fig 5b of f ti3c2tx showed three prominent characteristic peaks at 155 427 and 616 cm 1 corresponding to the vibrations of tic o and the eg vibrations of the carbon atom in mxene with oh terminal groups respectively 47 49 after chlorination the peaks at around427 and 616 cm 1 were almost disappeared suggesting the destruction of tic bonds to reveal the potential change in surface chemical composition and valence states of the elements the f ti3c2tx samples before and after chlorination were further characterized by using xps the xps survey spectra confirmed that the f ti3c2tx was mainly composed of f ti o and c elements with minimal amounts of n and cl elements fig s6 and table s2 the presence of f element was attributed to the strong stability of tif bond in aqueous solutions upon chlorination the c element content in f ti3c2tx dropped significantly from 42 35 to 31 54 while the o element content increased from 18 15 to 46 33 this indicated that the reaction between f ti3c2tx and chlorine was mainly through tic bond as ticl bonds are not stable in aqueous solutions the cl element content decreased after chlorination these results highlighted the distinct behavior of mxene compared to graphene oxide which forms chlorinated graphene 27 28 the results were consistent with the ftir analysis the sharp decrease in f element content was attributed to the decomposition of the ti3c2tx as evidenced by sem and tem analyses the significant increase of o element content was ascribed to the formation of tio2 on the surfaces of the mxene samples the increase in o element content in m t3c2tx after chlorination was less pronounced compared to f t3c2tx suggesting its relatively weaker reactivity with chlorine the high resolution xps spectra of c 1s o1s ti 2p and n1s peaks are presented in fig 6 the high resolution c 1s xps spectra of all samples fig 6a could be deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to tic 281 6 ev cc 248 8 ev c o c n 286 4 ev and o c o 288 8 ev the peak corresponding to cti dropped significantly after chlorination indicating the reduction in tic bonds the high resolution o 1s xps spectra fig 6b could be deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to tio c oh co and o c oh after chlorination the peak associated with tio increased significantly indicating the formation of tio2 38 49 50 the high resolution ti 2p xps spectra fig 6c showed an enhanced peak related to tio2 suggesting the oxidation of the mxene surface during chlorination in the case of f ti3c2tx samples the ti 2p xps spectra indicated the disappearance of peaks related to tic tin and tif after chlorination indicating the formation of tio2 on the mxene surface ti3c2tx mxene material always contained a small amount of nitrogen which might attribute to the use of n2 as protection gas during the synthesis of mxene precursor 51 the n 1s spectra of f ti3c2tx fig 6d before and after chlorination showed four main peaks at 396 5 ev 399 ev 400 2 ev 401 5 ev respectively which were attributed to nti c n c pyridinic n and graphitic n respectively 52 although f ti3c2tx contains less nitrogen 2 44 it still contains nitrogen with unsaturated bonds c n c after chlorination the relative content of c n c in f ti3c2tx significantly decreased table s4 during the chlorination process these unsaturated bonds readily form cyanide intermediates which can be further converted to dcan 44 53 this explains why dcan is easier to form compared to the other two dbps in addition the intermediates formed during the chlorination of f ti3c2tx were analyzed using hplc ms fig 7 shows the formation of various organic compounds during the chlorination process the molecular formulas of these intermediates with high m z values are listed in table 1 the possible structures of some intermediates with high m z values were deduced and are provided in table s3 these intermediates may contain unsaturated bonds such as hydrocarbon c c alkyne c c carbonyl c o imine c n nitrile c n as well as oxygen containing groups such as aldehyde cho and methoxy ch3o in addition the intermediates formed during the chlorination of f ti3c2tx were analyzed using hplc ms fig 7 shows the formation of various organic compounds during the chlorination process the molecular formulas of these intermediates are listed in table 1 the possible structures of some intermediates with high m z values were deduced and are provided in table s3 these intermediates may contain unsaturated bonds such as hydrocarbon c c alkyne cc carbonyl c o imine c n nitrile cn as well as oxygen containing groups such as aldehyde cho and methoxy ch3o among these intermediates oxygen containing functional group and conjugated double bonds are the most effective precursors for the formation of tcm additionally some intermediates may have a chcl2 co r structure which serves as a precursor for dcaa 54 55 the formation of dcan primarily involves a decarboxylation process chlorine replaces the hydrogen on the amino group forming a chlorinated amino acid 56 which is subsequently dechlorinated and decarboxylated to produce compounds with carbon nitrogen double bonds r ch nh or r ch ncl these compounds are further hydrolyzed to aldehydes r cho which react with chlorine to form nitrile intermediates ultimately converting to dcan 57 based on these results it can be concluded that the formation of dbps primarily occurs through the attack of chlorine on the tic bonds resulting in the formation of tio bonds and the chlorinated organic compounds in aqueous solutions because tic bond is weaker than the cc bond in graphene mxene is more susceptible to be oxidized by cl2 compared to carbon materials leading to a higher propensity for dbps formation 25 58 4 conclusions in summary this work studied the dbps formation potential of mxene providing insights into the potential environmental risks associated with carbon containing nanomaterials the results showed that mxene exhibited a high dbps formation potential leading to the formation of thm dcaa and dcan upon reaction with chlorine therefore the application of mxene in drinking water treatment may pose adverse health effects the chlorine contacting time and chlorine dose were found to significantly influence dbps formation the dbps formation potential of mxene remained high even at a low chlorine concentrations unlike activated carbon mxene did not exhibit adsorption capabilities towards released dbps the dbps were formed through the destruction of tic bonds in mxene as the destruction of tic bonds result in the collapse of the 2d structure of mxene the formation of dbps continues until the complete transformation of mxene into tio2 since tio2 is a naturally occurring mineral with low toxicity the potential adverse effect of the mxene after chlorination should primarily focus on the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12412,owing to the outstanding properties including non toxicity large surface area bactericidal ability and versatile surface chemistry ti3c2tx mxene based adsorbents and membranes have been widely explored in drinking water and wastewater treatment at the same time with the rapid increase in mxene applications it is inevitable that mxene will find its way into water and wastewater treatment systems it is therefore imperative to assess its potential for disinfection by products dbps formation and physicochemical transformation by chlorination this study demonstrated that ti3c2tx mxene has a high formation potential of dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetic acid dcaa during the chlorination and chloramination procedures few layered ti3c2tx with

samples exhibited an iv type with h3 hysteresis loop fig s2 demonstrating the existence of mesopores the specific surface area of f ti3c2tx and m ti3c2tx calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method were determined to be 17 33 and 4 8 m2 g table s1 respectively the relatively high specific surface area and the presence of mesopores suggest that ti3c2tx has a potential for high adsorption capacity for organic contaminants to assess whether the formation of dbps would be underestimated the adsorption of dbps specifically tcm dcaa and dcan on m ti3c2tx and f ti3c2tx was evaluated the results confirmed that no significant adsorption was observed suggesting the underestimation of dbps production was negligible as shown in fig 2 it was evident that chloramination resulted in a lower formation of dbps compared to chlorination in both ti3c2tx samples similar to the formation of dbps with go and carbon nanotubes 27 28 42 all three dbps produced in f ti3c2tx under both chlorination and chloramination were higher than that in m ti3c2tx demonstrating that f ti3c2tx has a greater capacity than m ti3c2tx to produce dbps during the disinfection process after three days of reaction the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan in the f ti3c2tx sample under chlorination were measured as 16 80 9 50 and 22 66 Î¼g l respectively this indicates that dcan is more readily formed than the other two dbps notably the concentration of dcan exceeded the world health organization s who limit of 20 Î¼g l highlighting the potential health risks associated with the application of mxene in water treatment considering the cumulative effect of tcm and dcaa in the liver that may lead to cancer it is important not to overlook the toxicological risks and lifetime cancer risks associated with long term exposure to low concentration of dbps 43 44 a similar trend was observed for the m ti3c2tx sample where the concentration of tcm dcaa and dcan after three days reaction were determined to be 10 36 7 03 and 17 75 Î¼g l respectively it is noteworthy that the bet surface area of f ti3c2tx was 3 6 times larger than that of m ti3c2tx interestingly the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan formed in the f ti3c2tx sample were 1 6 1 35 and 1 27 times higher respectively than those in the m ti3c2tx sample the higher concentration of dbps formed in the f ti3c2tx sample could be potentially be attributed to its larger surface area the concentrations of tcm dcaa and dcan formed from chloramination in the f ti3c2tx sample were determined to be 8 38 6 98 and 5 49 Î¼g l respectively the observed lower dbps formation under chloramination compared to chlorination can be attributed to the reduced presence of free chlorine resulting from monochloramine hydrolysis 45 46 of particular significance is the remarkable reduction in the concentration of dcan formed under chloramination which was only one fifth of the concentration produced under chlorination this finding suggests that the generation of dcan is strongly influenced by the concertation of free chlorine the formation of tcm dcaa and dcan under chloramination in the m ti3c2tx sample followed a similar trend with lower concentrations observed the time dependent formation of dbps during chlorination in the presence of mxene samples is shown in fig 3a and fig s3 the concentrations of tcm and dcan in f ti3c2tx exhibited a consistent trend steadily increasing as the chlorination time extended as depicted in fig 3a the formation of dcaa in f ti3c2tx was observed to be faster compared to tcm and dcan the concentration of dcaa rapidly increased within the first 10 h and then reached a plateau with further prolongation of the reaction time a similar trend was observed for the formation of the three dbps in m ti3c2tx mxene fig s3a given that the typical residual chlorine in drinking water ranges from 1 to 4 mg l the potential formation of dbps in mxene samples was assessed at lower cl2 concentrations the concentrations of tcm and dcaa in both the f ti3c2tx and m ti3c2tx samples exhibited a linear correlation with the chlorine dose with r2 values larger than 0 95 fig 3b and fig s3b however a significant concentration increase of dcan was observed in both samples when the chlorine dose increased from 10 to 20 mg l the values of toc aox and don were also determined to evaluate the dbps formation potential of ti3c2tx the effects of chlorine dose on toc were examined and shown in fig 4a and fig s4a it was observed that toc exhibited a linear correlation with chlorine dose higher toc promoted the formation of dbps the formation of aox under chlorination with ti3c2tx samples is displayed in fig 4b and fig s4b it is notable that the concentration of aox increased significantly with the increase in chlorine dose even at a chlorine dose as low as 1 0 mg l lower than the regulated residual free chlorine levels set by the us epa the concentration of aox also reached 17 6 Î¼g l the concentration of don at different chlorine doses is presented in fig 4c and fig s4c revealing an increase in don don concentration with higher chlorine doses ranging from 0 to 0 1 mg l conversely the contribution of don leached by ti3c2tx itself was found to be negligible these results confirm that chlorine reacts with the ti3c2tx leading to its decomposition and the subsequent formation of chlorinated organic compounds 3 2 mechanism of dbps formation with ti3c2tx the morphologies of the ti3c2tx samples before and after chlorination were characterized by using sem and tem as shown in fig s5 the chlorination process caused significant morphological changes of the ti3c2tx samples confirming the reaction between ti3c2tx samples and chlorine the smooth surface of the pristine samples became very rough after chlorination and tiny holes formed on the ti3c2tx nanosheets fig s5 d and h these holes were attributed to the etching of the nanosheets by free chlorine to get information on the formation mechanism of dbps with ti3c2tx under chlorination the mxene samples were characterized by using ftir to determine if ccl bonds were formed as shown in fig 5a the peak around 595 cm 1 was associated with the oti deformation vibration while the peak at and 1623 cm 1 corresponded to the bending vibration of oh demonstrating the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of f ti3c2tx after chlorination the intensity of the peak at 1623 cm 1 decreased suggesting a reaction between oh and chlorine which could potentially promote the formation of dcaa 27 42 however the peaks attributed to ccl bonds at 798 and 622 cm 1 were too faint to be clearly distinguished the raman spectrum fig 5b of f ti3c2tx showed three prominent characteristic peaks at 155 427 and 616 cm 1 corresponding to the vibrations of tic o and the eg vibrations of the carbon atom in mxene with oh terminal groups respectively 47 49 after chlorination the peaks at around427 and 616 cm 1 were almost disappeared suggesting the destruction of tic bonds to reveal the potential change in surface chemical composition and valence states of the elements the f ti3c2tx samples before and after chlorination were further characterized by using xps the xps survey spectra confirmed that the f ti3c2tx was mainly composed of f ti o and c elements with minimal amounts of n and cl elements fig s6 and table s2 the presence of f element was attributed to the strong stability of tif bond in aqueous solutions upon chlorination the c element content in f ti3c2tx dropped significantly from 42 35 to 31 54 while the o element content increased from 18 15 to 46 33 this indicated that the reaction between f ti3c2tx and chlorine was mainly through tic bond as ticl bonds are not stable in aqueous solutions the cl element content decreased after chlorination these results highlighted the distinct behavior of mxene compared to graphene oxide which forms chlorinated graphene 27 28 the results were consistent with the ftir analysis the sharp decrease in f element content was attributed to the decomposition of the ti3c2tx as evidenced by sem and tem analyses the significant increase of o element content was ascribed to the formation of tio2 on the surfaces of the mxene samples the increase in o element content in m t3c2tx after chlorination was less pronounced compared to f t3c2tx suggesting its relatively weaker reactivity with chlorine the high resolution xps spectra of c 1s o1s ti 2p and n1s peaks are presented in fig 6 the high resolution c 1s xps spectra of all samples fig 6a could be deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to tic 281 6 ev cc 248 8 ev c o c n 286 4 ev and o c o 288 8 ev the peak corresponding to cti dropped significantly after chlorination indicating the reduction in tic bonds the high resolution o 1s xps spectra fig 6b could be deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to tio c oh co and o c oh after chlorination the peak associated with tio increased significantly indicating the formation of tio2 38 49 50 the high resolution ti 2p xps spectra fig 6c showed an enhanced peak related to tio2 suggesting the oxidation of the mxene surface during chlorination in the case of f ti3c2tx samples the ti 2p xps spectra indicated the disappearance of peaks related to tic tin and tif after chlorination indicating the formation of tio2 on the mxene surface ti3c2tx mxene material always contained a small amount of nitrogen which might attribute to the use of n2 as protection gas during the synthesis of mxene precursor 51 the n 1s spectra of f ti3c2tx fig 6d before and after chlorination showed four main peaks at 396 5 ev 399 ev 400 2 ev 401 5 ev respectively which were attributed to nti c n c pyridinic n and graphitic n respectively 52 although f ti3c2tx contains less nitrogen 2 44 it still contains nitrogen with unsaturated bonds c n c after chlorination the relative content of c n c in f ti3c2tx significantly decreased table s4 during the chlorination process these unsaturated bonds readily form cyanide intermediates which can be further converted to dcan 44 53 this explains why dcan is easier to form compared to the other two dbps in addition the intermediates formed during the chlorination of f ti3c2tx were analyzed using hplc ms fig 7 shows the formation of various organic compounds during the chlorination process the molecular formulas of these intermediates with high m z values are listed in table 1 the possible structures of some intermediates with high m z values were deduced and are provided in table s3 these intermediates may contain unsaturated bonds such as hydrocarbon c c alkyne c c carbonyl c o imine c n nitrile c n as well as oxygen containing groups such as aldehyde cho and methoxy ch3o in addition the intermediates formed during the chlorination of f ti3c2tx were analyzed using hplc ms fig 7 shows the formation of various organic compounds during the chlorination process the molecular formulas of these intermediates are listed in table 1 the possible structures of some intermediates with high m z values were deduced and are provided in table s3 these intermediates may contain unsaturated bonds such as hydrocarbon c c alkyne cc carbonyl c o imine c n nitrile cn as well as oxygen containing groups such as aldehyde cho and methoxy ch3o among these intermediates oxygen containing functional group and conjugated double bonds are the most effective precursors for the formation of tcm additionally some intermediates may have a chcl2 co r structure which serves as a precursor for dcaa 54 55 the formation of dcan primarily involves a decarboxylation process chlorine replaces the hydrogen on the amino group forming a chlorinated amino acid 56 which is subsequently dechlorinated and decarboxylated to produce compounds with carbon nitrogen double bonds r ch nh or r ch ncl these compounds are further hydrolyzed to aldehydes r cho which react with chlorine to form nitrile intermediates ultimately converting to dcan 57 based on these results it can be concluded that the formation of dbps primarily occurs through the attack of chlorine on the tic bonds resulting in the formation of tio bonds and the chlorinated organic compounds in aqueous solutions because tic bond is weaker than the cc bond in graphene mxene is more susceptible to be oxidized by cl2 compared to carbon materials leading to a higher propensity for dbps formation 25 58 4 conclusions in summary this work studied the dbps formation potential of mxene providing insights into the potential environmental risks associated with carbon containing nanomaterials the results showed that mxene exhibited a high dbps formation potential leading to the formation of thm dcaa and dcan upon reaction with chlorine therefore the application of mxene in drinking water treatment may pose adverse health effects the chlorine contacting time and chlorine dose were found to significantly influence dbps formation the dbps formation potential of mxene remained high even at a low chlorine concentrations unlike activated carbon mxene did not exhibit adsorption capabilities towards released dbps the dbps were formed through the destruction of tic bonds in mxene as the destruction of tic bonds result in the collapse of the 2d structure of mxene the formation of dbps continues until the complete transformation of mxene into tio2 since tio2 is a naturally occurring mineral with low toxicity the potential adverse effect of the mxene after chlorination should primarily focus on the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12413,viscous oil separation and its highly efficient recovery is a great challenge in oil water separation applications membrane separation was considered as a prospective strategy for oil water separation but membrane contamination caused by the oil droplets restricted its applications significantly we here propose a nondispersive solvent extraction strategy to efficiently recover viscous lubricant oil from emulsions via a polydopamine modified pvdf janus membrane the incorporated thin polydopamine layer facilitates the adsorption and diffusion of surfactant stabilized oil droplets through the membrane we studied the influence of polydopamine coating time the flow rate on both feed and extraction sides the weight content of lubricant oil on the recovery of oil the optimized membrane exhibited a 10 h accumulative flux 1595 g m 2 for viscous lubricant oil in water emulsion which was 70 higher than the contrast pvdf membrane the current study might significantly advance application of this novel method for highly efficient separation and recovery of viscous oils from oil water mixtures graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nondispersive solvent extraction oil water separation janus membrane membrane fouling abbreviations pvdf poly vinylidene fluoride pda polydopamine wca water contact angle sls sodium laurylsulfonate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction separation of oil water mixtures is of highly important in modern days owing to the oil leakage accidents industrial emissions increased and more strict regulations many techniques have been employed for oily sewage separations such as adsorbents skimmers distillation bioremediation and membrane separation 1 2 among them membrane technology attracted more attentions owing to its simple operation highly efficient and energy saving characteristics 3 6 however highly efficient separation of viscous oily sewage through separation membranes is still a great challenge owing to the commonly encountered membrane fouling particularly for viscous oil water mixtures 7 9 in order to alleviate membrane fouling hydration layer was constructed on the membranes through different methods such as in situ mineralization grafting and in situ incorporation 10 16 by taking advantage of this hydration layer anti adhesion properties of membranes towards oils were greatly enhanced 17 21 however long term antifouling performance of membranes was still not satisfied especially when viscous oils were used frequent membrane cleaning was therefore needed which will increase operation cost and physiochemical requirements for membrane materials recent years joule heat and photothermal effect assisted oil cleanup through adsorption 22 24 or membrane separation 25 27 has offered another way for viscous oil water mixture separations in these processes temperature of oil water mixtures was elevated by external electric or sun light 28 30 therefore oil viscosity was significantly decreased however the relatively complex material construction limited its large scale usage nondispersive solvent extraction based on membrane contactor has been used for the removal of organic molecules from water solutions and recoveries of high added value metals from wastewaters 31 37 during the separation process feed solution and receiving solution was introduced on either side of a membrane organic molecules were then adsorbed and diffused through the membrane driven by the chemical potential difference 38 40 the main diffuse resistance ascribe to the membrane pore size porosity thickness and membrane hydrophilicity hydrophobicity as well in our previous work we used a porous and hydrophobic nanofibrous membrane in the nondispersive solvent extraction process to adsorb and transfer viscous oils from feed to receiving solution 41 in this process the commonly encountered membrane fouling benefited oil adsorption and transmission in addition extracted oil can be easily recovered therefore it might be a promising way for efficient separation and recovery of viscous oil and water mixtures however the oil transmission rate was relatively low owing to the hydrophobic properties of the membrane which makes the availability of feed difficult therefore a relatively hydrophilic membrane surface might enhance the oil transmission rate but a complete hydrophilic membrane is not suitable for use in this process because hydrophilic membrane cannot reject both water or oil phase stable oil water interface is therefore cannot be formed based on these considerations a membrane with a hydrophobic substrate and thin hydrophilic coating layer might facilitate the oil droplets availability and finally enhance separation performance in the current study a janus polydopamine modified poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf nanofibrous membrane was prepared the thin polydopamine layer slightly decreased hydrophobic property of pvdf membrane and therefore enhanced the diffusion of oil in water emulsion into the membrane moreover adhesion force of this janus membrane towards oil was enhanced due to the bio glue property of polydopamine cumulative oil flux was increased from 336 g m 2 pvdf membrane to 446 g m 2 janus membrane in addition effect of flow rate of solutions at both sides has also been investigated the optimal cumulative oil flux can be as high as 876 g m 2 the strategy in this study may offer an effective method to separate and recover viscous oils from aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf mw 180000 was bought from sigma aldrich usa n hexane 97 was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical china n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 5 trichloromethane and hydrochloric acid hcl 36 0 38 0 were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent china dopamine hydrochloride 98 sodium laurylsulfonate sls 98 and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane 99 9 were obtained from aladdin industrial china lubricant was got from sinopec lubricant china 2 2 fabrication of membranes pvdf membrane solution is obtained by adding 25 g pvdf into 75 g dmf and stirred at 80 c for at least 4 h pvdf nanofibrous membranes was prepared according to strategy reported in our previous research 42 electrospinning parameters of pvdf membrane are as follows the pushing speed of the syringe is 1 0 ml h 1 distance from receiver to needle is about 15 0 cm and the applied voltage at the needle is about 16 5 kv negative voltage is controlled at around 3 0 kv this obtained pvdf nanofibrous membrane was used as the substrate membrane to construct pvdf pda janus membrane the process of pvdf pda janus membrane preparation is shown in schematic 1 the m0 pvdf nanofibrous membrane were sandwiched between two filter cups membrane thickness was about 145 Î¼m the dopamine aqueous solution was obtained by adding 2 g dopamine into 150 ml of 10 mm tris hcl solution ph around 8 5 the dopamine solution was then poured into the upper filter cup for membrane modification with different times 0 5 h 1 h 5 h the corresponding obtained membrane was named as m1 m2 m3 respectively the membranes prepared using the above methods are washed with deionized water to take out unreacted dopamine and finally dried at 60 c 2 3 preparation and separation of oil in water emulsions 1 vol 5 vol 10 vol emulsion were obtained by adjusting volume of lubricant and deionized water with surfactant of 0 1 g l 1 under the condition of continuous stirring at 1000 rpm overnight separation experiments were carried out according to our previous method 41 briefly a membrane with area of 6 15 cm2 is mounted in the device where the modified side faces the emulsion side the emulsion and extractant circulated on both sides of the membranes respectively it should be noted that the emulsion side needs to flow first in order to avoid leakage of n hexane while ensuring that the pressure on emulsion side is greater than or equal to n hexane side during separation process notably the m1 m2 and m3 membrane needs to be moistened with di water before use to avoid oil contaminating when the dry membrane is used 2 4 characterizations membrane surface morphology was studied via scanning electron microscopy sem 4800 japan pore size analyzer is used to test the change in pore size before and after the modification of the membrane xps axis ultra dld britain was used to determine the elements on the surface of the membrane and their content the variation of the contact angle of the membrane surface were determined by a contact angle measuring instrument oca25 germany microscopic infrared spectrometer cary660 620 usa was exploited to assay functional group of membranes the separation performance of the membrane is demonstrated mainly by the content of the lubricant in the extractant using a uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 china zeta potential meter surpass 3 austria was used to measure potential of membranes the dispersion of oil droplets in emulsions was observed by polarized light microscopy bx51 japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and physicochemical properties of membranes fig 1 shows that surface morphology of m1 membrane does not change significantly compared with pristine pvdf nanofibrous membrane m0 after polydopamine coating both m0 and m1 membranes exhibited highly porous structure with relatively large pore size with the extension of modification time amount of polydopamine on membrane surface gradually increased and began to grow between the nanofibers large polydopamine sheets can be clearly found on membrane surface m3 when modification time was 5 h the reason for polydopamine sheets formation on membrane surface was mainly due to the existent air in the porous pvdf nanofibrous membrane therefore dopamine aqueous solution cannot penetrate into the hydrophobic membrane under low pressure 6 cm water height and then polydopamine sheet formed on membrane surface 43 however the existence of large amount of polydopamine sheets will decrease oil transition therefore m1 membrane was preferred in the separation experiments fig 2a shows the cross sectional micrographs of the different membranes the thickness of the original pvdf nanofiber membrane m0 is about 145 5 Î¼m and the thicknesses of m1 m2 m3 are 140 4 147 5 and 147 3 Î¼m respectively it can be found that the thickness of the membranes did not change before and after the pda modification we further tested the pore size of the membrane using pore size analyzer results in fig 2b showed that there is almost no difference between the pore size of the modified membranes and m0 membranes and the pore sizes are all distributed between 600 and 800 nm this result also confirms that pda only modifies the membrane surface and does not enter the membrane pore after polydopamine modification hydrophilicity gradually increases with modification time water contact angle wca of m1 127 6 was below m0 140 2 fig 2a it was further decreased to 75 3 m3 if modification time was extended to 5 h fig 3a hydrophilicity enhancement attributed to hydrophilic property of dopamine layer 44 45 the enhanced hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membranes towards oil in water emulsion notably lower side wca of all the membranes was kept as 140 3 fig 3a indicating the janus property of pvdf pda membrane fig 3b showed that there is a merged peak at 3100 3600 cm 1 which is owed to the nh and oh groups on polydopamine 46 47 in addition a distinct absorption peak is also observed at 1640 cm 1 which is owed to the cc stretching in polydopamine xps measurement was further used to confirm the existence of polydopamine layer on pvdf membrane nearly no n element can be detected in m0 membrane while its content was gradually increased from 0 5 to 7 2 as dopamine modification time extended from 0 5 h to 5 h fig 3c and table 1 meanwhile o element content was also increased from 1 1 to 15 9 compared with m0 and m3 especially f element content in m3 membrane was as low as 2 5 which was greatly lower than m0 membrane 48 4 the c n and o elements content was correspondingly increased to 74 4 7 2 and 15 9 respectively table 1 the reason for this might because of the large number of polydopamine sheets on the surface of the m3 membrane see fig 1 although enhanced surface hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membrane to emulsion thick hydrophilic layer on membrane surface prevents the penetration of oil into membrane only when the polydopamine layer was thin enough the pvdf pda membrane can be used as a janus membrane with both enhanced water availability and oil transmission 48 49 therefore we further measured oil contact angle of underwater uoca of m0 and m1 fig 4a showed the initial uoca of m1 120 was higher than m0 35 however oil droplets can still pin onto the m1 membrane and finally sucked in the membrane due to bio glue property of polydopamine the two three phase contact point kept unchanged during the penetration process which was typical directional transmission phenomenon using janus membrane 50 51 the corresponding videos of oil penetration in m0 video s1 and m1 video s2 membrane can be found in the support information although enhanced surface hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membrane to emulsion thick hydrophilic layer on membrane surface prevents the penetration of oil into membrane only when the polydopamine layer was thin enough the pvdf pda membrane can be used as a janus membrane with both enhanced water availability and oil transmission 48 49 therefore we further measured oil contact angle of underwater uoca of m0 and m1 fig 4a showed the initial uoca of m1 120 was higher than m0 35 however oil droplets can still pin onto the m1 membrane and finally sucked in the membrane due to bio glue property of polydopamine the two three phase contact point kept unchanged during the penetration process which was typical directional transmission phenomenon using janus membrane 50 51 the corresponding videos of oil penetration in m0 video s1 and m1 video s2 membrane can be found in the support information in fact the first contact with membranes was not bare oil droplets but oil droplets stabilized by sodium laurylsulfonate the outward sulfonate groups formed a hydration shell which are inclinely adsorbed to the hydrated pda surface to minimize the interfacial energy for the hydrophobic pvdf surface higher adsorption barrier is required for the approach and intrusion of surfactant stabilized oil droplets fig 4b the janus membrane with hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface greatly facilitates the availability of oil in water emulsions 52 moreover membrane surface charge was slightly enhanced after polydopamine incorporation fig 5 the enhanced surface charge property can facilitate the demulsification of emulsion at membrane 53 54 3 2 membrane separation performance and oil recovery sls stabilized lubricant emulsion was used to assess the membrane separation properties due to its relatively high viscosity of lubricant oil 370 mpa s optical photograph of emulsion is shown in fig 6a the oil droplets were uniformly dispersed in water with size in the scope of 1 6 Î¼m fig 6b results in fig 6c showed that m1 membrane exhibited highest cumulative extractions 275 mg during 10 h of separation under a flow rate of 0 16 m s at both sides which was about 33 increase compared with m0 membrane 207 mg corresponding flux increased from 336 g m 2 m0 to 446 g m 2 m1 as shown in fig 6d the increased oil transmission was mainly because of enhanced membrane hydrophilicity after polydopamine introduction on membrane surface figs 3 and 4 and demulsification property these results indicated that janus structure of membrane hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface does benefit the oil droplets availability and then enhance membrane separation performance the decrease of cumulative extraction of m2 and m3 was mainly due to the polydopamine sheets block as shown in fig 1 according to the above results m1 was the optimal membrane therefore we further compared performance of m1 and m0 membrane under different separation conditions besides membrane property separation parameters also have a great effect on nondispersive solvent extraction process especially flow rate on both sides 33 36 results in fig 7 showed that m1 always outperforms m0 at flow rate of 0 16 m s 0 26 m s or 0 43 m s cumulative flux of m0 can reach 336 g m 2 443 g m 2 586 g m 2 respectively the cumulative flux of m1 was about 1 3 1 4 times of m0 at the same flow rate meanwhile cumulative flux of m1 was also increased with the increase of flow rate on both sides the reason might due to enhanced oil adsorption and demulsification at elected shear force in both sides flow rate 55 56 these results further proved that the prepared janus membrane is indeed beneficial to the nondispersive solvent extraction process and can effectively improve the oil transmission the janus structure has nearly no effect on the stability of the oil water interface because the primary membrane remained hydrophobic fig 3a the introduced thin polydopamine layer on membrane surface was just responsible for the reduction of oil droplets availability difficulty fig 4 in addition nondispersive solvent extraction can be carried out at relatively high flow rate and the porous membrane was stable enough during separation the above results confirmed the influence of flow rate on performance of nondispersive solvent extraction process but it is still unclear that which side of flow rate played the dominate role for separation performance therefore we evaluated the separation performance at different flow rate at one side with constant flow rate at the other side results in fig 8a and c showed that flux increased from 446 g m 2 to 876 g m 2 when flow rate at emulsion side increased from 0 16 m s to 0 43 m s with constant n hexane side flow rate 0 16 m s these results indicated that emulsion side flow rate played an important role for oil transmission the reason might be similar with that discussed above enhanced lubricant oil adsorption and demulsification at elected shear force however if emulsion side flow rate was kept unchanged 0 16 m s there was no great difference can be found at different n hexane flow rate fig 8b and d the reason might attribute to the great solubility of oil in n hexane the above results suggested that oil flux in nondispersive solvent extraction process was mainly dependent on the flow rate of the emulsion side the above results also confirmed that the availability and adsorption of oil droplets on membrane surface was the determining step for oil transmission therefore it is important to manipulate the membrane surface properties in nondispersive solvent extraction process we also performed the separation of emulsions with high concentrations e g 5 and 10 using m1 membranes at 0 43 m s flow rate on emulsion side and 0 16 m s on n hexane side results showed that the prepared janus membrane was also suitable for high concentration emulsions and the flux from 876 g m 2 to 1595 g m 2 when the emulsion concentration was increased to 5 and 10 fig 9 cumulative oil flux did not change significantly for 10 emulsion compared to 5 emulsion which might due to the amount of oil adsorbed by the membrane exceeded its transmission in general we strongly believe that proper adjustment of the flow rate on both sides afterwards can effectively further improve the oil flux finally lubricant oil is recovered from the received lubricant oil hexane mixed solution by distillation at 65 3 c the water content of the recovered oil was measured to be about 190 40 mg l 1 which is almost indistinguishable from the original lubricant oil 160 60 mg l 1 this demonstrates that viscous lubricants not only can be separated from oil in water emulsions but also can be recovered efficiently 4 conclusions janus pvdf pda nanofibrous membrane was fabricated through polydopamine coating on pvdf nanofibrous membrane the introduced layer of polydopamine significantly improved the oil flux for oil in water emulsion during nondispersive membranes solvent extraction surface hydrophilicity enhancement facilitated the membrane availability towards oil in water emulsion therefore oil adsorption and subsequent transmission was significantly enhanced the cumulative oil flux of pvdf pda janus nanofibrous membrane can be as high as 1595 g m 2 by using 10 lubricant oil in water emulsion which was 1 7 times than pristine m0 moreover flow rate of emulsion side played dominate role for oil flux enhancement compared with flow rate of extraction side n hexane side this study might offer an efficient method for separation and recovery of viscous oils from oil water mixtures the

available on request 1 introduction separation of oil water mixtures is of highly important in modern days owing to the oil leakage accidents industrial emissions increased and more strict regulations many techniques have been employed for oily sewage separations such as adsorbents skimmers distillation bioremediation and membrane separation 1 2 among them membrane technology attracted more attentions owing to its simple operation highly efficient and energy saving characteristics 3 6 however highly efficient separation of viscous oily sewage through separation membranes is still a great challenge owing to the commonly encountered membrane fouling particularly for viscous oil water mixtures 7 9 in order to alleviate membrane fouling hydration layer was constructed on the membranes through different methods such as in situ mineralization grafting and in situ incorporation 10 16 by taking advantage of this hydration layer anti adhesion properties of membranes towards oils were greatly enhanced 17 21 however long term antifouling performance of membranes was still not satisfied especially when viscous oils were used frequent membrane cleaning was therefore needed which will increase operation cost and physiochemical requirements for membrane materials recent years joule heat and photothermal effect assisted oil cleanup through adsorption 22 24 or membrane separation 25 27 has offered another way for viscous oil water mixture separations in these processes temperature of oil water mixtures was elevated by external electric or sun light 28 30 therefore oil viscosity was significantly decreased however the relatively complex material construction limited its large scale usage nondispersive solvent extraction based on membrane contactor has been used for the removal of organic molecules from water solutions and recoveries of high added value metals from wastewaters 31 37 during the separation process feed solution and receiving solution was introduced on either side of a membrane organic molecules were then adsorbed and diffused through the membrane driven by the chemical potential difference 38 40 the main diffuse resistance ascribe to the membrane pore size porosity thickness and membrane hydrophilicity hydrophobicity as well in our previous work we used a porous and hydrophobic nanofibrous membrane in the nondispersive solvent extraction process to adsorb and transfer viscous oils from feed to receiving solution 41 in this process the commonly encountered membrane fouling benefited oil adsorption and transmission in addition extracted oil can be easily recovered therefore it might be a promising way for efficient separation and recovery of viscous oil and water mixtures however the oil transmission rate was relatively low owing to the hydrophobic properties of the membrane which makes the availability of feed difficult therefore a relatively hydrophilic membrane surface might enhance the oil transmission rate but a complete hydrophilic membrane is not suitable for use in this process because hydrophilic membrane cannot reject both water or oil phase stable oil water interface is therefore cannot be formed based on these considerations a membrane with a hydrophobic substrate and thin hydrophilic coating layer might facilitate the oil droplets availability and finally enhance separation performance in the current study a janus polydopamine modified poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf nanofibrous membrane was prepared the thin polydopamine layer slightly decreased hydrophobic property of pvdf membrane and therefore enhanced the diffusion of oil in water emulsion into the membrane moreover adhesion force of this janus membrane towards oil was enhanced due to the bio glue property of polydopamine cumulative oil flux was increased from 336 g m 2 pvdf membrane to 446 g m 2 janus membrane in addition effect of flow rate of solutions at both sides has also been investigated the optimal cumulative oil flux can be as high as 876 g m 2 the strategy in this study may offer an effective method to separate and recover viscous oils from aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf mw 180000 was bought from sigma aldrich usa n hexane 97 was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical china n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 5 trichloromethane and hydrochloric acid hcl 36 0 38 0 were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent china dopamine hydrochloride 98 sodium laurylsulfonate sls 98 and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane 99 9 were obtained from aladdin industrial china lubricant was got from sinopec lubricant china 2 2 fabrication of membranes pvdf membrane solution is obtained by adding 25 g pvdf into 75 g dmf and stirred at 80 c for at least 4 h pvdf nanofibrous membranes was prepared according to strategy reported in our previous research 42 electrospinning parameters of pvdf membrane are as follows the pushing speed of the syringe is 1 0 ml h 1 distance from receiver to needle is about 15 0 cm and the applied voltage at the needle is about 16 5 kv negative voltage is controlled at around 3 0 kv this obtained pvdf nanofibrous membrane was used as the substrate membrane to construct pvdf pda janus membrane the process of pvdf pda janus membrane preparation is shown in schematic 1 the m0 pvdf nanofibrous membrane were sandwiched between two filter cups membrane thickness was about 145 Î¼m the dopamine aqueous solution was obtained by adding 2 g dopamine into 150 ml of 10 mm tris hcl solution ph around 8 5 the dopamine solution was then poured into the upper filter cup for membrane modification with different times 0 5 h 1 h 5 h the corresponding obtained membrane was named as m1 m2 m3 respectively the membranes prepared using the above methods are washed with deionized water to take out unreacted dopamine and finally dried at 60 c 2 3 preparation and separation of oil in water emulsions 1 vol 5 vol 10 vol emulsion were obtained by adjusting volume of lubricant and deionized water with surfactant of 0 1 g l 1 under the condition of continuous stirring at 1000 rpm overnight separation experiments were carried out according to our previous method 41 briefly a membrane with area of 6 15 cm2 is mounted in the device where the modified side faces the emulsion side the emulsion and extractant circulated on both sides of the membranes respectively it should be noted that the emulsion side needs to flow first in order to avoid leakage of n hexane while ensuring that the pressure on emulsion side is greater than or equal to n hexane side during separation process notably the m1 m2 and m3 membrane needs to be moistened with di water before use to avoid oil contaminating when the dry membrane is used 2 4 characterizations membrane surface morphology was studied via scanning electron microscopy sem 4800 japan pore size analyzer is used to test the change in pore size before and after the modification of the membrane xps axis ultra dld britain was used to determine the elements on the surface of the membrane and their content the variation of the contact angle of the membrane surface were determined by a contact angle measuring instrument oca25 germany microscopic infrared spectrometer cary660 620 usa was exploited to assay functional group of membranes the separation performance of the membrane is demonstrated mainly by the content of the lubricant in the extractant using a uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 china zeta potential meter surpass 3 austria was used to measure potential of membranes the dispersion of oil droplets in emulsions was observed by polarized light microscopy bx51 japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and physicochemical properties of membranes fig 1 shows that surface morphology of m1 membrane does not change significantly compared with pristine pvdf nanofibrous membrane m0 after polydopamine coating both m0 and m1 membranes exhibited highly porous structure with relatively large pore size with the extension of modification time amount of polydopamine on membrane surface gradually increased and began to grow between the nanofibers large polydopamine sheets can be clearly found on membrane surface m3 when modification time was 5 h the reason for polydopamine sheets formation on membrane surface was mainly due to the existent air in the porous pvdf nanofibrous membrane therefore dopamine aqueous solution cannot penetrate into the hydrophobic membrane under low pressure 6 cm water height and then polydopamine sheet formed on membrane surface 43 however the existence of large amount of polydopamine sheets will decrease oil transition therefore m1 membrane was preferred in the separation experiments fig 2a shows the cross sectional micrographs of the different membranes the thickness of the original pvdf nanofiber membrane m0 is about 145 5 Î¼m and the thicknesses of m1 m2 m3 are 140 4 147 5 and 147 3 Î¼m respectively it can be found that the thickness of the membranes did not change before and after the pda modification we further tested the pore size of the membrane using pore size analyzer results in fig 2b showed that there is almost no difference between the pore size of the modified membranes and m0 membranes and the pore sizes are all distributed between 600 and 800 nm this result also confirms that pda only modifies the membrane surface and does not enter the membrane pore after polydopamine modification hydrophilicity gradually increases with modification time water contact angle wca of m1 127 6 was below m0 140 2 fig 2a it was further decreased to 75 3 m3 if modification time was extended to 5 h fig 3a hydrophilicity enhancement attributed to hydrophilic property of dopamine layer 44 45 the enhanced hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membranes towards oil in water emulsion notably lower side wca of all the membranes was kept as 140 3 fig 3a indicating the janus property of pvdf pda membrane fig 3b showed that there is a merged peak at 3100 3600 cm 1 which is owed to the nh and oh groups on polydopamine 46 47 in addition a distinct absorption peak is also observed at 1640 cm 1 which is owed to the cc stretching in polydopamine xps measurement was further used to confirm the existence of polydopamine layer on pvdf membrane nearly no n element can be detected in m0 membrane while its content was gradually increased from 0 5 to 7 2 as dopamine modification time extended from 0 5 h to 5 h fig 3c and table 1 meanwhile o element content was also increased from 1 1 to 15 9 compared with m0 and m3 especially f element content in m3 membrane was as low as 2 5 which was greatly lower than m0 membrane 48 4 the c n and o elements content was correspondingly increased to 74 4 7 2 and 15 9 respectively table 1 the reason for this might because of the large number of polydopamine sheets on the surface of the m3 membrane see fig 1 although enhanced surface hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membrane to emulsion thick hydrophilic layer on membrane surface prevents the penetration of oil into membrane only when the polydopamine layer was thin enough the pvdf pda membrane can be used as a janus membrane with both enhanced water availability and oil transmission 48 49 therefore we further measured oil contact angle of underwater uoca of m0 and m1 fig 4a showed the initial uoca of m1 120 was higher than m0 35 however oil droplets can still pin onto the m1 membrane and finally sucked in the membrane due to bio glue property of polydopamine the two three phase contact point kept unchanged during the penetration process which was typical directional transmission phenomenon using janus membrane 50 51 the corresponding videos of oil penetration in m0 video s1 and m1 video s2 membrane can be found in the support information although enhanced surface hydrophilicity can facilitate the availability of membrane to emulsion thick hydrophilic layer on membrane surface prevents the penetration of oil into membrane only when the polydopamine layer was thin enough the pvdf pda membrane can be used as a janus membrane with both enhanced water availability and oil transmission 48 49 therefore we further measured oil contact angle of underwater uoca of m0 and m1 fig 4a showed the initial uoca of m1 120 was higher than m0 35 however oil droplets can still pin onto the m1 membrane and finally sucked in the membrane due to bio glue property of polydopamine the two three phase contact point kept unchanged during the penetration process which was typical directional transmission phenomenon using janus membrane 50 51 the corresponding videos of oil penetration in m0 video s1 and m1 video s2 membrane can be found in the support information in fact the first contact with membranes was not bare oil droplets but oil droplets stabilized by sodium laurylsulfonate the outward sulfonate groups formed a hydration shell which are inclinely adsorbed to the hydrated pda surface to minimize the interfacial energy for the hydrophobic pvdf surface higher adsorption barrier is required for the approach and intrusion of surfactant stabilized oil droplets fig 4b the janus membrane with hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface greatly facilitates the availability of oil in water emulsions 52 moreover membrane surface charge was slightly enhanced after polydopamine incorporation fig 5 the enhanced surface charge property can facilitate the demulsification of emulsion at membrane 53 54 3 2 membrane separation performance and oil recovery sls stabilized lubricant emulsion was used to assess the membrane separation properties due to its relatively high viscosity of lubricant oil 370 mpa s optical photograph of emulsion is shown in fig 6a the oil droplets were uniformly dispersed in water with size in the scope of 1 6 Î¼m fig 6b results in fig 6c showed that m1 membrane exhibited highest cumulative extractions 275 mg during 10 h of separation under a flow rate of 0 16 m s at both sides which was about 33 increase compared with m0 membrane 207 mg corresponding flux increased from 336 g m 2 m0 to 446 g m 2 m1 as shown in fig 6d the increased oil transmission was mainly because of enhanced membrane hydrophilicity after polydopamine introduction on membrane surface figs 3 and 4 and demulsification property these results indicated that janus structure of membrane hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface does benefit the oil droplets availability and then enhance membrane separation performance the decrease of cumulative extraction of m2 and m3 was mainly due to the polydopamine sheets block as shown in fig 1 according to the above results m1 was the optimal membrane therefore we further compared performance of m1 and m0 membrane under different separation conditions besides membrane property separation parameters also have a great effect on nondispersive solvent extraction process especially flow rate on both sides 33 36 results in fig 7 showed that m1 always outperforms m0 at flow rate of 0 16 m s 0 26 m s or 0 43 m s cumulative flux of m0 can reach 336 g m 2 443 g m 2 586 g m 2 respectively the cumulative flux of m1 was about 1 3 1 4 times of m0 at the same flow rate meanwhile cumulative flux of m1 was also increased with the increase of flow rate on both sides the reason might due to enhanced oil adsorption and demulsification at elected shear force in both sides flow rate 55 56 these results further proved that the prepared janus membrane is indeed beneficial to the nondispersive solvent extraction process and can effectively improve the oil transmission the janus structure has nearly no effect on the stability of the oil water interface because the primary membrane remained hydrophobic fig 3a the introduced thin polydopamine layer on membrane surface was just responsible for the reduction of oil droplets availability difficulty fig 4 in addition nondispersive solvent extraction can be carried out at relatively high flow rate and the porous membrane was stable enough during separation the above results confirmed the influence of flow rate on performance of nondispersive solvent extraction process but it is still unclear that which side of flow rate played the dominate role for separation performance therefore we evaluated the separation performance at different flow rate at one side with constant flow rate at the other side results in fig 8a and c showed that flux increased from 446 g m 2 to 876 g m 2 when flow rate at emulsion side increased from 0 16 m s to 0 43 m s with constant n hexane side flow rate 0 16 m s these results indicated that emulsion side flow rate played an important role for oil transmission the reason might be similar with that discussed above enhanced lubricant oil adsorption and demulsification at elected shear force however if emulsion side flow rate was kept unchanged 0 16 m s there was no great difference can be found at different n hexane flow rate fig 8b and d the reason might attribute to the great solubility of oil in n hexane the above results suggested that oil flux in nondispersive solvent extraction process was mainly dependent on the flow rate of the emulsion side the above results also confirmed that the availability and adsorption of oil droplets on membrane surface was the determining step for oil transmission therefore it is important to manipulate the membrane surface properties in nondispersive solvent extraction process we also performed the separation of emulsions with high concentrations e g 5 and 10 using m1 membranes at 0 43 m s flow rate on emulsion side and 0 16 m s on n hexane side results showed that the prepared janus membrane was also suitable for high concentration emulsions and the flux from 876 g m 2 to 1595 g m 2 when the emulsion concentration was increased to 5 and 10 fig 9 cumulative oil flux did not change significantly for 10 emulsion compared to 5 emulsion which might due to the amount of oil adsorbed by the membrane exceeded its transmission in general we strongly believe that proper adjustment of the flow rate on both sides afterwards can effectively further improve the oil flux finally lubricant oil is recovered from the received lubricant oil hexane mixed solution by distillation at 65 3 c the water content of the recovered oil was measured to be about 190 40 mg l 1 which is almost indistinguishable from the original lubricant oil 160 60 mg l 1 this demonstrates that viscous lubricants not only can be separated from oil in water emulsions but also can be recovered efficiently 4 conclusions janus pvdf pda nanofibrous membrane was fabricated through polydopamine coating on pvdf nanofibrous membrane the introduced layer of polydopamine significantly improved the oil flux for oil in water emulsion during nondispersive membranes solvent extraction surface hydrophilicity enhancement facilitated the membrane availability towards oil in water emulsion therefore oil adsorption and subsequent transmission was significantly enhanced the cumulative oil flux of pvdf pda janus nanofibrous membrane can be as high as 1595 g m 2 by using 10 lubricant oil in water emulsion which was 1 7 times than pristine m0 moreover flow rate of emulsion side played dominate role for oil flux enhancement compared with flow rate of extraction side n hexane side this study might offer an efficient method for separation and recovery of viscous oils from oil water mixtures the

12414,hydrolysis of waste activated sludge was is the limiting step in the anaerobic fermentation process in view of this this study evaluated the feasibility of a combination of free nitrous acid fna and sodium citrate sc pretreatment to promote was hydrolysis and anaerobic fermentation the results showed that the combined treatment of fna and sc could promote the decomposition of was under the conditions of 2 504 mg l fna and 0 25 g g total suspended solids of sc pretreatment for 5 h the soluble chemical oxygen demand release rate dd scod was 1 86 and 1 42 times that of fna and sc pretreatment alone meanwhile the contribution rate of intracellular organic compounds reached 84 18 the maximum short chain fatty acids yield was obtained at the 8th day of fermentation which was 580 34 mg cod g volatile suspended solids the protein utilization rate of combined pretreatment was increased to 74 10 which was much higher than that of single treatment moreover fna sc also changed the activities of key enzymes increasing the activities of protease and Î± glucosidase but inhibiting the activities of coenzyme f420 microbial analysis showed that the combined pretreatment significantly changed the composition of microbial community and effectively enriched acid producing bacteria such as petrimonas and macellibacteroides graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords waste activated sludge free nitrous acid sodium citrate short chain fatty acids microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the activated sludge method is now widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world as the mainstream wastewater treatment process this method achieves the removal of contaminants through the physiological activities of microorganisms and produces a large amount of waste activated sludge was by products 1 was contains harmful substances such as pathogenic bacteria nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals which can pose a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment if not disposed of properly meanwhile sludge is also rich in organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins and fats which can be recycled as a source of carbon 2 therefore was has the dual properties of waste and resource anaerobic fermentation as a means of was resource utilization can produce short chain fatty acids scfas h2 and ch4 as resource substances while disposing of sludge in a rational manner 3 however organic matter in the sludge is present in the extracellular polymeric substances eps and intracellular while the tight eps structure and semi rigid cell walls make it difficult for the cells to break down which hinders the efflux of cell contents thus the hydrolysis stage is the limiting stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation which seriously affects the fermentation efficiency the essence of pretreatment is to accelerate the disintegration of was and provide a richer substrate for microorganisms using biological chemical physical and coupled methods can transform the complex organic components of sludge into structurally simple and easily degradable small molecules and eliminate the hydrolysis resistance of certain organic macromolecules 4 therefore after pretreatment the hydrolysis step is accelerated and anaerobic bacteria have easier access to sufficient substrates thus increasing the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation for scfas production in recent years strong oxidants such as cao2 h2o2 o3 and kmno4 have been investigated to break the eps to accelerate production scfas but these drugs are usually regulated due to their toxicity corrosiveness or explosiveness which are not conducive to widespread use 5 free nitrite acid fna a protonated form of nitrite has the advantage of being green and renewable which has led to widespread interest in fna based pretreatment technologies 6 7 at the parts per million ppm level fna and its derivatives can react with lipids proteins carbohydrates and deoxyribonucleic acid dna in cells and eps effectively disrupting microbial cell membranes releasing intracellular macromolecular organic matter and providing substrate for acid producing bacteria 8 effective cell lysis of sludge can be achieved by fna pretreatment alone 1 2 mg n l pretreatment of sludge for 24 48 h can inactivate 50 80 of cells 9 however related studies have shown that a large number of tolerant cells are still in steady state after fna pretreatment and their destruction of extracellular polymers is extremely limited which in turn limits the hydrolytic acid production efficiency 3 04 mg n l fna pretreated sludge macromolecules such as humic substances in eps cannot be hydrolyzed 10 11 therefore more and more scholars have used physical freezing 12 thermal 13 ultrasound 14 and chemical fenton method 15 h2o2 16 rhamnolipids 17 methods coupled with fna pretreatment to effectively enhance the hydrolysis acid production and methanogenesis processes sodium citrate sc is a food additive and pretreatment with it has the advantages of high treatment efficiency low cost and no secondary contamination it has become an important sludge pretreatment by damaging and destroying sludge eps decomposing cell walls and cell membranes and causing cell rupture zhang et al used sc with lysozyme to treat sludge containing polymeric aluminum chloride pac and sc significantly destroyed the sludge floc structure caused by pac and the yield of vfas reached 588 4 mg cod g vss after anaerobic fermentation 18 however the study of sc coupled with fna pretreatment to enhance acid production from anaerobic sludge fermentation has not been reported yet in this study was obtained from wwtps were used to evaluate the effectiveness of this combined pretreatment method by investigating organic matter release scfas production enzymatic activity and microbial community structure moreover many current studies set the fna pretreatment time on 12 48 h which greatly slowed down the treatment process 9 19 s zahedi et al suggested that the optimal treatment effect could also be achieved with fna pretreatment time of 5 h 20 in summary this study used sc and fna pretreatment means to enhance sludge anaerobic fermentation and investigated the sludge disintegration effect at short pretreatment time 5 h aiming to reduce the time cost and provide theoretical basis and technical support for the resource utilization of residual sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of was the was in this study was collected in a secondary sedimentation tank at a wwtp in guangzhou china the sludge was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c after settling for 24 h and then it was used as substrate the main characteristics of was are shown in table 1 results are the averages and their deviations of triplicate measurements 2 2 combined fna and sc hydrolysis experiment based on the results of previous optimization tests 21 four experimental groups were set up and the design of the experimental group was shown in table 2 the experiment was conducted in four identical clean flasks with the working volume of 700 ml at the temperature of 30 1 c guaranteed by the whole temperature vibrator the control group was not treated the fna group was adjusted to ph 5 5 firstly then 2 mol l nano2 solution was added to make the fna concentration of 2 504 mg l according to our preliminary experiment the effect of adjusting ph to 5 5 alone on sludge hydrolysis is negligible the sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss was added into sc group 21 after adding a sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss into fna sc group the ph was adjusted to 5 5 and then the fna dosage in this study was set as 2 504 mg l the pretreatment experiments were carried out for 5 h and samples were taken at the end then the ph of fna group and fna sc group was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 other groups were not treated the anaerobic condition was realized by injecting n2 for 10 min after pretreatment and ph adjustment 2 3 analytical methods scod tss vss ph soluble proteins polysaccharides po4 3 p and nh4 n were determined by standard methods 22 different fractions of eps were extracted according to the means of previous studies 23 the concentration and composition of scfas were determined determined with a tianmei gc7980 gas chromatograph the detector was a flame ionization detector fid and the column was a j w db fatwax ui chromatographic column california agilent usa protease Î± glucosidase and coenzyme f420 activity and content were assayed using kits wuhan mskbio china in order to evaluate the contribution of extracellular polymer dissolution and intracellular substance release to organic matter in sludge supernatant the sources of dissolved organic matter under different conditions were analyzed and calculated according to eqs 1 3 24 1 microbial cells release dom treated dom raw eps raw eps treated 2 relative release contribution of cells microbial cells release dom

mg l epsraw is the eps content in the raw sludge mg l relative release contribution of cells is the relative contribution rate of intracellular release relative release contribution of eps is the relative release contribution rate of extracellular polymer 2 4 microbial community analysis in the implementation of this work sludge samples were collected during the fermentation stabilization period for dna extraction the collected samples were entrusted to magi gene guangdong co ltd polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was performed using 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 as the characteristic primers corresponding to the regions 16 s rdna v3 and v4 respectively the reaction system for pcr was 25 Î¼l of 2 premix taq 1 Î¼l of primer f 10 um 1 Î¼l

the 16 s rrna sequences with similarity over 97 of the 16 s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus for microbial community analysis 25 based on the otu classification the alpha diversity index of the microbial community was calculated 2 5 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicate the error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge solubilization and hydrolysis dd scod can be used to evaluate the degree of sludge disintegration by pretreatment method and the higher dd scod indicates the higher degree of sludge floc disintegration and the more organic matter release 26 from fig 1 a it can be seen that the dd scod of the three pretreatment groups was much higher than that of the control group after 5 h pretreatment among them the dd scod of the fna sc reached 10 23 which was 1 86 and 1 42 times higher than that of fna 5 51 and sc 7 14 alone sc destroyed eps structure by complexing metal cations 21 and the cell membrane was further exposed to the harsh environment fna diffused to the cellular membrane and caused damage the bacterial cell structure finally leading to cell lysis 7 thus fna coupled with sc had a synergistic effect on sludge disintegration the composition of organic matter in eps is closely related to the sludge cracking fig 1 b and c showed the protein content and percentage of each eps layer under different pretreatment conditions compared with the control group the total eps of the experimental group increased total eps of the fna sc pretreatment group achieved a maximum value of 809 63 mg cod l it can be seen that the effect of fna pretreatment on loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps was not significant because compared with eps fna would act more directly on the cell membrane and the presence of eps would have a negative effect on fna pretreatment notably the sc pretreatment group greatly increased the content of tb eps and the percentage of tb eps was significantly higher than the other two experimental groups this is because when the sc dosing amount is greater than 0 1 g g it disrupts both eps and cell membrane causing the release of intracellular substances 27 the released intracellular material was partly converted into tb eps and partly released into soluble eps s eps although tb eps was a compact layer it was easily affected by pretreatment to release into s eps layer therefore the combined pretreatment of fna sc can compensate the shortcomings of the two separate treatments and promote the release of organic matter however the combined treatment also increased the percentage of lb eps it has been suggested that lb eps has the potential to adsorb dissolved organic matter despite its sparse structure and the increase in lb eps is not conducive to the increase in s eps 26 however the increase of organic matter in sludge supernatant was determined by both extractable eps lb eps tb eps and intracellular material release so further analysis of organic matter release from extracellular polymers is needed to determine their contribution to dissolved organic matter and to resolve the cracking pattern of sludge under different treatment conditions the specific sources of sludge organic matter can be divided into the fraction contributed by eps and the fraction contributed by intracellular fig 1 d shows the results of the calculation of specific sources of sludge organic matter in the form of contribution intracellular contribution was lower than eps contribution for both fna and sc pretreatment alone but for different reasons the destruction of cell membrane by fna was better than eps which hindered the release of intracellular material which is consistent with the results in fig 1 a the destruction of eps by sc through complexation of metal ions was much lower than eps although it could also destroy cell membrane at high dosing levels under the combined pretreatment the intracellular and eps contributions were 84 18 and 15 82 respectively and this intracellular contribution was much higher than that of the alone treatment group therefore the combined treatment was able to improve the cell membrane disruption effect and accelerate the efflux of cell contents 3 2 effect on the production of scfas 3 2 1 yield of scfas the variation of scfas production with time under different pretreatment conditions is shown in fig 2 a it can be observed that the control group produced almost no scfas and all three pretreatments in the experimental group promoted the production of scfas by was to varying degrees but the effect of fna treatment was not significant similar to the results obtained by li et al using fna pretreatment alone 8 the yield of scfas with fna sc and fna sc pretreatments increased within 8 d to 103 77 444 98 and 580 34 mg cod g vss which were 5 06 21 72 and 28 32 times higher than that of the control group 20 49 mg cod g vss respectively the enhanced acid production values of the combined pretreatment were 31 59 mg cod g vss higher than the sum of the enhanced values of the two individual pretreatment modalities compared to the control group these results clearly confirm that the combination of fna pretreatment and sc pretreatment played a synergistic role in promoting acid production from was which may be due to the combination of these two pretreatments leading to more leaching of degradable biological substrates the combined pretreatment resulted in significantly higher production of scfas than the thermal sc pretreatment 354 5 mg cod g vss 28 fna rhamnolipids 352 62 mg cod g vss 17 and 1 8 mg fna l pretreatment 195 7 mg cod g vss 8 the results indicated that the combined fna sc pretreatment was an efficient pretreatment for the accumulation of scfas production extractable eps from the residual sludge was used as an indicator to evaluate the effect of pretreatment methods on anaerobic fermentation intensification a correlation analysis was performed between the total extractable eps content of the pretreated residual sludge lb eps tb eps and the final scfas production fig 2 b a significant linear relationship can be seen r2 0 9945 this further supports the correlation that pretreatment promotes acid production from residual sludge anaerobic fermentation by destroying eps structure and sludge lysis cells in the sludge floc as shown in fig 3 different letters indicate significant differences among group at Î± 0 05 as determined by duncan s multiple range test the fna group and the control group did not possess significant differences while the rest of the groups differed significantly from each other this indicates that the effect of different pretreatment methods on the production of scfas was significant 3 2 2 organic material utilization fig 4 showed the effects of various pretreatments on tss removal and protein utilization which reflects the efficiency of organic matter utilization during anaerobic fermentation the tss removal rate of the control group at the end of fermentation was only 7 83 which was caused by the complex eps structure wrapped around the sludge cells it can be seen that the pretreatment methods of the experimental groups all promoted the tss removal among them the combined pretreatment had the highest tss removal rate of 33 40 which was 4 27 times higher than that of the control group 17 30 and 12 60 higher than that of the fna pretreatment 16 10 and sc pretreatment 20 80 respectively protein as the main biodegradable substrate of was and its massive hydrolysis facilitated the accumulation of scfas 29 protein utilization is an indicator of the extent to which protein is utilized by microorganism it was calculated by subtracting the protein remaining on the last day from the protein maximum and dividing by the maximum apparently the different pretreatments all improved the protein utilization which increased from 10 40 in the control group to 17 70 in the fna pretreatment 62 30 in the sc pretreatment and 74 10 in the combined pretreatment which was consistent with the yield of scfas the above results indicated that the combined pretreatment was more effective in converting the released organic matter into scfas during anaerobic fermentation 3 2 3 analysis of key enzyme activities the activities of protease Î± glucosidase and coenzyme f420 were measured to investigate the specific effects of different pretreatment methods on the residual sludge hydrolysis process as shown in fig 5 the activities of all three enzymes in the control group were set to 100 compared with the control group the pretreatment in the experimental group caused coenzyme f420 activity to show different magnitudes of decreases 31 3 and 10 respectively coenzyme f420 belongs to intracellular enzymes and is associated with methanogenic processes and its activity can reflect the methanogenic potential of was 30 therefore the decrease in coenzyme f420 activity is beneficial to inhibit the occurrence of methanogenic processes and further accumulation of scfas it can be seen that sc pretreatment had almost no inhibitory effect on coenzyme f420 activity while the activity of coenzyme f420 in both fna and fna sc pretreatment groups was lower than that in the blank and sc groups so the inhibitory effect on coenzyme f420 activity was mainly from the fna dosing proteases and Î± glucosidases play a key role in the breakdown of proteins and polysaccharides during was fermentation where proteases break the peptide bonds in protein molecules and Î± glucosidases break the Î± 1 4 glycosidic bonds of oligosaccharide substrates to release glucose 31 as can be seen the three pretreatments in the experimental group were able to promote protease activity rising to 126 108 and 118 respectively this is because it is a large number of extracellular enzymes e g hydrolases that are immobilized in eps by adsorption so pretreatment can release hydrolases immobilized in it while disrupting the eps structure 32 notably the fna treatment reduced the activity of a glucosidase which decreased to 87 which may explain the lower yield of scfas both protease and a glucosidase activities were higher in the combined pretreatment than in the sc pretreatment while coenzyme f420 activity was lower than in the sc pretreatment group which is consistent with the results observed for acid production from was fermentation confirming that the co treatment was able to improve the production of scfas by altering the activity of key hydrolytic enzymes in this way 3 3 effect on nh4 n and po4 3 p release due to the presence of large amounts of proteins in was the microbial cell membranes in was consisting of phospholipid bilayers and the presence of polyphosphate particles in microorganisms nh4 n and po4 3 p are released from was during anaerobic process 33 as shown in fig 6 a the nh4 n concentration in all experimental groups showed a gradual increase with fermentation time indicating that dissolved proteins were continuously hydrolyzed and converted into small molecules of organic matter during the fermentation process to provide the required substrate for acid producing bacteria the release of nh4 n in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group which was attributed to the fact that on the one hand the pretreatment promoted more protein dissolution into the liquid phase and its degradation rate was higher than that in the solid phase on the other hand the pretreatment disrupted the network structure of eps and released the hydrolytic enzyme thus increasing its contact with the substrate and improving the protein conversion efficiency it is noteworthy that fna pretreatment released the most nh4 n 188 62 mg l which was 2 58 times higher than that of the control group 73 19 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that fna significantly increased the protease activity releasing more nh4 n as shown in fig 6 b po4 3 p concentrations in both control and fna groups were shown to rise to a certain height and stabilize which was due to the effect of anaerobic phosphorus release the initial phosphate concentrations of the fna sc pretreatment and sc pretreatment were high one because the sc complexed the ions in the metal phosphorus precipitation and released a large amount of inorganic phosphorus the other reason was that the lysis of the cells made a large amount of substances containing organic phosphorus such as phospholipid bilayer and dna released into the supernatant which was eventually converted into po4 3 p by microbial action 34 after that the two pretreatments showed a decreasing trend which may be due to the deflocculate of sc with metal ions and the regeneration of metallic phosphorus precipitation the content of phosphate after anaerobic fermentation in this result was much lower than in existing studies 35 37 which makes further utilization of the fermentation broth possible 3 4 effect on microbial community structure illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to test the microbial community compositions and succession fig 7 showed the bacterial community composition at the phylum and class levels at phylum level the dominant bacteria are both bacteroidetes and proteobacteria bacteroidetes is an important phylum of anaerobic fermentation which mainly includes metabolic activities such as fermentation of carbohydrates utilization of nitrogenous substances proteins and biotransformation of bile acids and other steroids whose main by products of anaerobic fermentation are acetic acid and isovaleric acid it also has a significant role in denitrification 38 proteobacteria on the other hand have the function of promoting cytolysis releasing intracellular organic matter and degrading macromolecular organic matter proteins and polysaccharides etc 39 it can be seen that the abundance of bacteroidetes in the fna and fna sc groups were 43 52 and 39 06 respectively which were significantly higher than those in the blank 29 36 and sc groups 25 89 which further explains the degradation of fna during anaerobic fermentation unlike the other groups the abundance of firmicutes reached 32 22 in the fna sc group firmicutes have thicker cell membrane walls and are more resistant to harsh environments and firmicutes can produce scfas from substrates such as proteins lipids lignin cellulose sugars and amino acids that are widely available in anaerobic fermentation systems 40 the coupling of fna and sc treatment was able to kill the more vulnerable bacteria thus allowing the enrichment of firmicutes which is beneficial for the anaerobic fermentation acid production process at class level the dominant phylum in all four groups was bacteroidia with 27 53 42 94 24 27 and 38 65 respectively bacteroidia is the dominant class of bacteroidetes which can produce acetate as a substrate from amino acids released by protein hydrolysis during anaerobic fermentation 41 compared to others the enrichment of clostridia bacilli and campylobacteria in the fna sc group was very significant with 12 86 19 12 and 7 8 respectively clostridia bacilli and campylobacteria all belong to firmicutes which have a strong hydrolytic ability to produce scfas with sugar as a substrate 42 among them clostridia is able to increase the rate of sludge hydrolysis by releasing hydrolytic enzymes that promote the degradation of a variety of complex organic matter including proteins and carbohydrates and produce propionic acid and acetic acid by the propionic acid pathway 43 this is in line with the results of a rapid increase in the percentage of firmicutes in the fna sc group at phylum level at genus level the population abundance of the fna sc group differed significantly from the other groups fig 8 the dominant species in the fna sc group were petrimonas trichococcus macellibacteroides and arcobacter with abundances of 16 26 17 72 11 60 and 7 80 respectively but in both petrimonas and macellibacteroides were derived from bacteroidia where both petrimonas and macellibacteroides produced acetic acid mainly through fermentation of carbohydrates 44 in addition sedimentibacter in the fna sc group is the dominant genus of hydrogen producing acetic acid producing bacteria capable of using protein as a substrate and acetic acid as the main anaerobic fermentation product 45 it can be seen that the combined pretreatment of fna and sc can effectively enrich acid producing bacteria spp the main reason for this is that the combined pretreatment releases a large amount of biodegradable substrates in the sludge which provides a favorable environment for hydrolysis and acid producing related bacteria this also confirmed that the high level of accumulation of scfas was not a coincidence 3 5 environmental benefit analysis and underlying application conventional production of scfas for commercialization is mainly achieved through chemical routes 46 and the use of non renewable and costly petrochemicals undoubtedly increases the cost and environmental pollution problems in contrast anaerobic fermentation of wastewater treatment plant sludge solids into scfas not only reduces the solid waste production but also provides a means of cheap scfas production the produced scfas can also be used as an external carbon source to remove biological nutrients n and p in sewage thus realizing the sustainable development of internal production in wwtps this has a promising development moreover sc is an environmentally friendly and easily degraded food additive while fna can be generated from the original location of fermentation solution after sludge acclimation both of which are environmentally friendly agents in addition as a widely used food additive the mass production of sc also leads to the production of sc wastewater this study provides theoretical guidance for the combined fermentation of sc wastewater and was and realizes the synchronous treatment of sc wastewater and the resource utilization of sludge overall the combined fna sc pretreatment anaerobic fermentation for scfas production has high economic and environmental benefits 4 conclusions in this study the feasibility of combined treatment with fna coupled with sc to enhance the hydrolytic decomposition of was was evaluated the highest yield of scfas was achieved at 580 34 mg cod g vss with fna dosage of 2 504 mg l and sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss the combined pretreatment significantly enhanced the eps structure and cell wall disruption prompting more soluble substrates to be released into the liquid phase for scfas production in addition combined pretreatment increased the activity of protease and a glucosidase and downgraded the activity of coenzyme f420 which facilitated the accumulation of acid production the abundance of bacteria e g petrimonas and macellibacteroides capable of hydrolyzing and producing scfas was significantly enriched under combined pretreatment which is consistent with the results observed for organic matter utilization and scfas moreover after a simple economic benefit analysis the combined fna sc pretreatment was an efficient and cost effective treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

12414,hydrolysis of waste activated sludge was is the limiting step in the anaerobic fermentation process in view of this this study evaluated the feasibility of a combination of free nitrous acid fna and sodium citrate sc pretreatment to promote was hydrolysis and anaerobic fermentation the results showed that the combined treatment of fna and sc could promote the decomposition of was under the conditions of 2 504 mg l fna and 0 25 g g total suspended solids of sc pretreatment for 5 h the soluble chemical oxygen demand release rate dd scod was 1 86 and 1 42 times that of fna and sc pretreatment alone meanwhile the contribution rate of intracellular organic compounds reached 84 18 the maximum short chain fatty acids yield was obtained at the 8th day of fermentation which was 580 34 mg cod g volatile suspended solids the protein utilization rate of combined pretreatment was increased to 74 10 which was much higher than that of single treatment moreover fna sc also changed the activities of key enzymes increasing the activities of protease and Î± glucosidase but inhibiting the activities of coenzyme f420 microbial analysis showed that the combined pretreatment significantly changed the composition of microbial community and effectively enriched acid producing bacteria such as petrimonas and macellibacteroides graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords waste activated sludge free nitrous acid sodium citrate short chain fatty acids microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the activated sludge method is now widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world as the mainstream wastewater treatment process this method achieves the removal of contaminants through the physiological activities of microorganisms and produces a large amount of waste activated sludge was by products 1 was contains harmful substances such as pathogenic bacteria nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals which can pose a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment if not disposed of properly meanwhile sludge is also rich in organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins and fats which can be recycled as a source of carbon 2 therefore was has the dual properties of waste and resource anaerobic fermentation as a means of was resource utilization can produce short chain fatty acids scfas h2 and ch4 as resource substances while disposing of sludge in a rational manner 3 however organic matter in the sludge is present in the extracellular polymeric substances eps and intracellular while the tight eps structure and semi rigid cell walls make it difficult for the cells to break down which hinders the efflux of cell contents thus the hydrolysis stage is the limiting stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation which seriously affects the fermentation efficiency the essence of pretreatment is to accelerate the disintegration of was and provide a richer substrate for microorganisms using biological chemical physical and coupled methods can transform the complex organic components of sludge into structurally simple and easily degradable small molecules and eliminate the hydrolysis resistance of certain organic macromolecules 4 therefore after pretreatment the hydrolysis step is accelerated and anaerobic bacteria have easier access to sufficient substrates thus increasing the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation for scfas production in recent years strong oxidants such as cao2 h2o2 o3 and kmno4 have been investigated to break the eps to accelerate production scfas but these drugs are usually regulated due to their toxicity corrosiveness or explosiveness which are not conducive to widespread use 5 free nitrite acid fna a protonated form of nitrite has the advantage of being green and renewable which has led to widespread interest in fna based pretreatment technologies 6 7 at the parts per million ppm level fna and its derivatives can react with lipids proteins carbohydrates and deoxyribonucleic acid dna in cells and eps effectively disrupting microbial cell membranes releasing intracellular macromolecular organic matter and providing substrate for acid producing bacteria 8 effective cell lysis of sludge can be achieved by fna pretreatment alone 1 2 mg n l pretreatment of sludge for 24 48 h can inactivate 50 80 of cells 9 however related studies have shown that a large number of tolerant cells are still in steady state after fna pretreatment and their destruction of extracellular polymers is extremely limited which in turn limits the hydrolytic acid production efficiency 3 04 mg n l fna pretreated sludge macromolecules such as humic substances in eps cannot be hydrolyzed 10 11 therefore more and more scholars have used physical freezing 12 thermal 13 ultrasound 14 and chemical fenton method 15 h2o2 16 rhamnolipids 17 methods coupled with fna pretreatment to effectively enhance the hydrolysis acid production and methanogenesis processes sodium citrate sc is a food additive and pretreatment with it has the advantages of high treatment efficiency low cost and no secondary contamination it has become an important sludge pretreatment by damaging and destroying sludge eps decomposing cell walls and cell membranes and causing cell rupture zhang et al used sc with lysozyme to treat sludge containing polymeric aluminum chloride pac and sc significantly destroyed the sludge floc structure caused by pac and the yield of vfas reached 588 4 mg cod g vss after anaerobic fermentation 18 however the study of sc coupled with fna pretreatment to enhance acid production from anaerobic sludge fermentation has not been reported yet in this study was obtained from wwtps were used to evaluate the effectiveness of this combined pretreatment method by investigating organic matter release scfas production enzymatic activity and microbial community structure moreover many current studies set the fna pretreatment time on 12 48 h which greatly slowed down the treatment process 9 19 s zahedi et al suggested that the optimal treatment effect could also be achieved with fna pretreatment time of 5 h 20 in summary this study used sc and fna pretreatment means to enhance sludge anaerobic fermentation and investigated the sludge disintegration effect at short pretreatment time 5 h aiming to reduce the time cost and provide theoretical basis and technical support for the resource utilization of residual sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of was the was in this study was collected in a secondary sedimentation tank at a wwtp in guangzhou china the sludge was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c after settling for 24 h and then it was used as substrate the main characteristics of was are shown in table 1 results are the averages and their deviations of triplicate measurements 2 2 combined fna and sc hydrolysis experiment based on the results of previous optimization tests 21 four experimental groups were set up and the design of the experimental group was shown in table 2 the experiment was conducted in four identical clean flasks with the working volume of 700 ml at the temperature of 30 1 c guaranteed by the whole temperature vibrator the control group was not treated the fna group was adjusted to ph 5 5 firstly then 2 mol l nano2 solution was added to make the fna concentration of 2 504 mg l according to our preliminary experiment the effect of adjusting ph to 5 5 alone on sludge hydrolysis is negligible the sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss was added into sc group 21 after adding a sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss into fna sc group the ph was adjusted to 5 5 and then the fna dosage in this study was set as 2 504 mg l the pretreatment experiments were carried out for 5 h and samples were taken at the end then the ph of fna group and fna sc group was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 other groups were not treated the anaerobic condition was realized by injecting n2 for 10 min after pretreatment and ph adjustment 2 3 analytical methods scod tss vss ph soluble proteins polysaccharides po4 3 p and nh4 n were determined by standard methods 22 different fractions of eps were extracted according to the means of previous studies 23 the concentration and composition of scfas were determined determined with a tianmei gc7980 gas chromatograph the detector was a flame ionization detector fid and the column was a j w db fatwax ui chromatographic column california agilent usa protease Î± glucosidase and coenzyme f420 activity and content were assayed using kits wuhan mskbio china in order to evaluate the contribution of extracellular polymer dissolution and intracellular substance release to organic matter in sludge supernatant the sources of dissolved organic matter under different conditions were analyzed and calculated according to eqs 1 3 24 1 microbial cells release dom treated dom raw eps raw eps treated 2 relative release contribution of cells microbial cells release dom treated dom raw 100 3 relative release contribution of eps epsraw epstreated dom treated dom raw 100 where microbial cells release is the amount of intracellular substance released mg l domtreated is the content of dissolved organic matter in the experimental group mg l domraw is the content of dissolved organic matter in the raw sludge mg l epstreated is the eps content in the experimental group mg l epsraw is the eps content in the raw sludge mg l relative release contribution of cells is the relative contribution rate of intracellular release relative release contribution of eps is the relative release contribution rate of extracellular polymer 2 4 microbial community analysis in the implementation of this work sludge samples were collected during the fermentation stabilization period for dna extraction the collected samples were entrusted to magi gene guangdong co ltd polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was performed using 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 as the characteristic primers corresponding to the regions 16 s rdna v3 and v4 respectively the reaction system for pcr was 25 Î¼l of 2 premix taq 1 Î¼l of primer f 10 um 1 Î¼l

the 16 s rrna sequences with similarity over 97 of the 16 s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus for microbial community analysis 25 based on the otu classification the alpha diversity index of the microbial community was calculated 2 5 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicate the error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge solubilization and hydrolysis dd scod can be used to evaluate the degree of sludge disintegration by pretreatment method and the higher dd scod indicates the higher degree of sludge floc disintegration and the more organic matter release 26 from fig 1 a it can be seen that the dd scod of the three pretreatment groups was much higher than that of the control group after 5 h pretreatment among them the dd scod of the fna sc reached 10 23 which was 1 86 and 1 42 times higher than that of fna 5 51 and sc 7 14 alone sc destroyed eps structure by complexing metal cations 21 and the cell membrane was further exposed to the harsh environment fna diffused to the cellular membrane and caused damage the bacterial cell structure finally leading to cell lysis 7 thus fna coupled with sc had a synergistic effect on sludge disintegration the composition of organic matter in eps is closely related to the sludge cracking fig 1 b and c showed the protein content and percentage of each eps layer under different pretreatment conditions compared with the control group the total eps of the experimental group increased total eps of the fna sc pretreatment group achieved a maximum value of 809 63 mg cod l it can be seen that the effect of fna pretreatment on loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps was not significant because compared with eps fna would act more directly on the cell membrane and the presence of eps would have a negative effect on fna pretreatment notably the sc pretreatment group greatly increased the content of tb eps and the percentage of tb eps was significantly higher than the other two experimental groups this is because when the sc dosing amount is greater than 0 1 g g it disrupts both eps and cell membrane causing the release of intracellular substances 27 the released intracellular material was partly converted into tb eps and partly released into soluble eps s eps although tb eps was a compact layer it was easily affected by pretreatment to release into s eps layer therefore the combined pretreatment of fna sc can compensate the shortcomings of the two separate treatments and promote the release of organic matter however the combined treatment also increased the percentage of lb eps it has been suggested that lb eps has the potential to adsorb dissolved organic matter despite its sparse structure and the increase in lb eps is not conducive to the increase in s eps 26 however the increase of organic matter in sludge supernatant was determined by both extractable eps lb eps tb eps and intracellular material release so further analysis of organic matter release from extracellular polymers is needed to determine their contribution to dissolved organic matter and to resolve the cracking pattern of sludge under different treatment conditions the specific sources of sludge organic matter can be divided into the fraction contributed by eps and the fraction contributed by intracellular fig 1 d shows the results of the calculation of specific sources of sludge organic matter in the form of contribution intracellular contribution was lower than eps contribution for both fna and sc pretreatment alone but for different reasons the destruction of cell membrane by fna was better than eps which hindered the release of intracellular material which is consistent with the results in fig 1 a the destruction of eps by sc through complexation of metal ions was much lower than eps although it could also destroy cell membrane at high dosing levels under the combined pretreatment the intracellular and eps contributions were 84 18 and 15 82 respectively and this intracellular contribution was much higher than that of the alone treatment group therefore the combined treatment was able to improve the cell membrane disruption effect and accelerate the efflux of cell contents 3 2 effect on the production of scfas 3 2 1 yield of scfas the variation of scfas production with time under different pretreatment conditions is shown in fig 2 a it can be observed that the control group produced almost no scfas and all three pretreatments in the experimental group promoted the production of scfas by was to varying degrees but the effect of fna treatment was not significant similar to the results obtained by li et al using fna pretreatment alone 8 the yield of scfas with fna sc and fna sc pretreatments increased within 8 d to 103 77 444 98 and 580 34 mg cod g vss which were 5 06 21 72 and 28 32 times higher than that of the control group 20 49 mg cod g vss respectively the enhanced acid production values of the combined pretreatment were 31 59 mg cod g vss higher than the sum of the enhanced values of the two individual pretreatment modalities compared to the control group these results clearly confirm that the combination of fna pretreatment and sc pretreatment played a synergistic role in promoting acid production from was which may be due to the combination of these two pretreatments leading to more leaching of degradable biological substrates the combined pretreatment resulted in significantly higher production of scfas than the thermal sc pretreatment 354 5 mg cod g vss 28 fna rhamnolipids 352 62 mg cod g vss 17 and 1 8 mg fna l pretreatment 195 7 mg cod g vss 8 the results indicated that the combined fna sc pretreatment was an efficient pretreatment for the accumulation of scfas production extractable eps from the residual sludge was used as an indicator to evaluate the effect of pretreatment methods on anaerobic fermentation intensification a correlation analysis was performed between the total extractable eps content of the pretreated residual sludge lb eps tb eps and the final scfas production fig 2 b a significant linear relationship can be seen r2 0 9945 this further supports the correlation that pretreatment promotes acid production from residual sludge anaerobic fermentation by destroying eps structure and sludge lysis cells in the sludge floc as shown in fig 3 different letters indicate significant differences among group at Î± 0 05 as determined by duncan s multiple range test the fna group and the control group did not possess significant differences while the rest of the groups differed significantly from each other this indicates that the effect of different pretreatment methods on the production of scfas was significant 3 2 2 organic material utilization fig 4 showed the effects of various pretreatments on tss removal and protein utilization which reflects the efficiency of organic matter utilization during anaerobic fermentation the tss removal rate of the control group at the end of fermentation was only 7 83 which was caused by the complex eps structure wrapped around the sludge cells it can be seen that the pretreatment methods of the experimental groups all promoted the tss removal among them the combined pretreatment had the highest tss removal rate of 33 40 which was 4 27 times higher than that of the control group 17 30 and 12 60 higher than that of the fna pretreatment 16 10 and sc pretreatment 20 80 respectively protein as the main biodegradable substrate of was and its massive hydrolysis facilitated the accumulation of scfas 29 protein utilization is an indicator of the extent to which protein is utilized by microorganism it was calculated by subtracting the protein remaining on the last day from the protein maximum and dividing by the maximum apparently the different pretreatments all improved the protein utilization which increased from 10 40 in the control group to 17 70 in the fna pretreatment 62 30 in the sc pretreatment and 74 10 in the combined pretreatment which was consistent with the yield of scfas the above results indicated that the combined pretreatment was more effective in converting the released organic matter into scfas during anaerobic fermentation 3 2 3 analysis of key enzyme activities the activities of protease Î± glucosidase and coenzyme f420 were measured to investigate the specific effects of different pretreatment methods on the residual sludge hydrolysis process as shown in fig 5 the activities of all three enzymes in the control group were set to 100 compared with the control group the pretreatment in the experimental group caused coenzyme f420 activity to show different magnitudes of decreases 31 3 and 10 respectively coenzyme f420 belongs to intracellular enzymes and is associated with methanogenic processes and its activity can reflect the methanogenic potential of was 30 therefore the decrease in coenzyme f420 activity is beneficial to inhibit the occurrence of methanogenic processes and further accumulation of scfas it can be seen that sc pretreatment had almost no inhibitory effect on coenzyme f420 activity while the activity of coenzyme f420 in both fna and fna sc pretreatment groups was lower than that in the blank and sc groups so the inhibitory effect on coenzyme f420 activity was mainly from the fna dosing proteases and Î± glucosidases play a key role in the breakdown of proteins and polysaccharides during was fermentation where proteases break the peptide bonds in protein molecules and Î± glucosidases break the Î± 1 4 glycosidic bonds of oligosaccharide substrates to release glucose 31 as can be seen the three pretreatments in the experimental group were able to promote protease activity rising to 126 108 and 118 respectively this is because it is a large number of extracellular enzymes e g hydrolases that are immobilized in eps by adsorption so pretreatment can release hydrolases immobilized in it while disrupting the eps structure 32 notably the fna treatment reduced the activity of a glucosidase which decreased to 87 which may explain the lower yield of scfas both protease and a glucosidase activities were higher in the combined pretreatment than in the sc pretreatment while coenzyme f420 activity was lower than in the sc pretreatment group which is consistent with the results observed for acid production from was fermentation confirming that the co treatment was able to improve the production of scfas by altering the activity of key hydrolytic enzymes in this way 3 3 effect on nh4 n and po4 3 p release due to the presence of large amounts of proteins in was the microbial cell membranes in was consisting of phospholipid bilayers and the presence of polyphosphate particles in microorganisms nh4 n and po4 3 p are released from was during anaerobic process 33 as shown in fig 6 a the nh4 n concentration in all experimental groups showed a gradual increase with fermentation time indicating that dissolved proteins were continuously hydrolyzed and converted into small molecules of organic matter during the fermentation process to provide the required substrate for acid producing bacteria the release of nh4 n in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group which was attributed to the fact that on the one hand the pretreatment promoted more protein dissolution into the liquid phase and its degradation rate was higher than that in the solid phase on the other hand the pretreatment disrupted the network structure of eps and released the hydrolytic enzyme thus increasing its contact with the substrate and improving the protein conversion efficiency it is noteworthy that fna pretreatment released the most nh4 n 188 62 mg l which was 2 58 times higher than that of the control group 73 19 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that fna significantly increased the protease activity releasing more nh4 n as shown in fig 6 b po4 3 p concentrations in both control and fna groups were shown to rise to a certain height and stabilize which was due to the effect of anaerobic phosphorus release the initial phosphate concentrations of the fna sc pretreatment and sc pretreatment were high one because the sc complexed the ions in the metal phosphorus precipitation and released a large amount of inorganic phosphorus the other reason was that the lysis of the cells made a large amount of substances containing organic phosphorus such as phospholipid bilayer and dna released into the supernatant which was eventually converted into po4 3 p by microbial action 34 after that the two pretreatments showed a decreasing trend which may be due to the deflocculate of sc with metal ions and the regeneration of metallic phosphorus precipitation the content of phosphate after anaerobic fermentation in this result was much lower than in existing studies 35 37 which makes further utilization of the fermentation broth possible 3 4 effect on microbial community structure illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to test the microbial community compositions and succession fig 7 showed the bacterial community composition at the phylum and class levels at phylum level the dominant bacteria are both bacteroidetes and

can be seen that the abundance of bacteroidetes in the fna and fna sc groups were 43 52 and 39 06 respectively which were significantly higher than those in the blank 29 36 and sc groups 25 89 which further explains the degradation of fna during anaerobic fermentation unlike the other groups the abundance of firmicutes reached 32 22 in the fna sc group firmicutes have thicker cell membrane walls and are more resistant to harsh environments and firmicutes can produce scfas from substrates such as proteins lipids lignin cellulose sugars and amino acids that are widely available in anaerobic

sc group at phylum level at genus level the population abundance of the fna sc group differed significantly from the other groups fig 8 the dominant species in the fna sc group were petrimonas trichococcus macellibacteroides and arcobacter with abundances of 16 26 17 72 11 60 and 7 80 respectively but in both petrimonas and macellibacteroides were derived from bacteroidia where both petrimonas and macellibacteroides produced acetic acid mainly through fermentation of carbohydrates 44 in addition sedimentibacter in the fna sc group is the dominant genus of hydrogen producing acetic acid producing bacteria capable of using protein as a substrate and acetic acid as the main anaerobic fermentation product 45 it can be seen that the combined pretreatment of fna and sc can effectively enrich acid producing bacteria spp the main reason for this is that the combined pretreatment releases a large amount of biodegradable substrates in the sludge which provides a favorable environment for hydrolysis and acid producing related bacteria this also confirmed that the high level of accumulation of scfas was not a coincidence 3 5 environmental benefit analysis and underlying application conventional production of scfas for commercialization is mainly achieved through chemical routes 46 and the use of non renewable and costly petrochemicals undoubtedly increases the cost and environmental pollution problems in contrast anaerobic fermentation of wastewater treatment plant sludge solids into scfas not only reduces the solid waste production but also provides a means of cheap scfas production the produced scfas can also be used as an external carbon source to remove biological nutrients n and p in sewage thus realizing the sustainable development of internal production in wwtps this has a promising development moreover sc is an environmentally friendly and easily degraded food additive while fna can be generated from the original location of fermentation solution after sludge acclimation both of which are environmentally friendly agents in addition as a widely used food additive the mass production of sc also leads to the production of sc wastewater this study provides theoretical guidance for the combined fermentation of sc wastewater and was and realizes the synchronous treatment of sc wastewater and the resource utilization of sludge overall the combined fna sc pretreatment anaerobic fermentation for scfas production has high economic and environmental benefits 4 conclusions in this study the feasibility of combined treatment with fna coupled with sc to enhance the hydrolytic decomposition of was was evaluated the highest yield of scfas was achieved at 580 34 mg cod g vss with fna dosage of 2 504 mg l and sc dosage of 0 25 g g tss the combined pretreatment significantly enhanced the eps structure and cell wall disruption prompting more soluble substrates to be released into the liquid phase for scfas production in addition combined pretreatment increased the activity of protease and a glucosidase and downgraded the activity of coenzyme f420 which facilitated the accumulation of acid production the abundance of bacteria e g petrimonas and macellibacteroides capable of hydrolyzing and producing scfas was significantly enriched under combined pretreatment which is consistent with the results observed for organic matter utilization and scfas moreover after a simple economic benefit analysis the combined fna sc pretreatment was an efficient and cost effective treatment declaration of competing interest the authors
