comparison researches are performed to demonstrate the availability of the designed finite time output feedback path following strategy keywords finite time output feedback control path following fteso homogeneous 1 introduction among the motion control researches of marine surface vehicle msv the path following control problem has been a hot topic currently zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 miao et al 2017a xiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016a as a result of its extensive applications prospect in marine development underwater topographical surveying and naval operation the path following is described as that the vehicle reaches and follows predefined path without demanding that the temporal information is known fossen 2011 the path following control of vehicle is comprised of geometric and dynamic assignments for the whole system the geometric assignments is able to be resolved by developing guidance law to produce reference yaw angle and the dynamic assignments can also be settled via controller design such that the vehicle accomplishes expected navigation task the guidance law plays a pivotal role in path following control problem where the los guidance algorithm is discussed more detail than others due to its simplicity and intuitiveness lapierre et al 2006 and has been widely used for dealing with path following problem of vehicle at the beginning of the study the conventional los guidance approach was raised to minimize the cross track error between the ship and the desired route fossen 2003 subsequently all kinds of improved los guidance algorithms were put forward such as the proportional los guidance algorithm fossen and pettersen 2014 the integral los guidance algorithm caharija et al 2016 the adaptive integral los guidance algorithm fossen and lekkas 2017 these guidance algorithms can resist the influence of external environment disturbances in addition as the underactuated msv has no sway actuator the external environment disturbances would induce the sideslip angle which affects tracking error convergence and even lead to system instability from this consideration researchers put forward numerous improved los based methods to deal with the problem such as the predictor based guidance approach liu et al 2016a adaptive sideslip compensation fossen et al 2015 the los guidance algorithm based on extended state observer eso estimation liu et al 2016b 2017 the finite time sideslip observer estimation wang et al 2017 2018 and the finite time predictor based los method yu et al 2019 which were applied to compensate the unknown sideslip angle then solved the sideslip problem another key technology of path following is concerning the controller designing because the external environment disturbances can largely affect the vessel s speed and maneuver ability which brings challenge to the controller design and the robustness anti model uncertain and disturbances is of great importance for marine vehicles the vast literatures regarding the path following controller were proposed by researchers the sliding mode control smc method based global finite time tracking control synthesis was designed for underactuated uuvs under the condition of model parameter perturbation and unknown current disturbance in yan et al 2015 where path tracking errors could converge to zero in finite time the literature miao et al 2017b investigated the curve path tracking control of underactuated auvs considering multiple uncertainties where the model parameter perturbations and unknown environment disturbances were estimated by reduced order linear eso the iterative neural network control approach based on predictor was introduced to deal with the path following issue of msvs under the circumstance of system uncertainties and environment interferences in liu et al 2016c the robust adaptive tracking control strategy based on fuzzy unknown observer for the underactuated surface vehicle was put forward and the fuzzy unknown observer was invented to exactly compensate the lumped unknowns wang and sun 2019 the path following control scheme in view of the novel neural observer was proposed for underactuated usvs where the system uncertainties and unknown lumped interferences were handled through the radial basis function neural network rbfnn and nonlinear neural disturbance observer nndo separately wan et al 2019 the literatures miao et al 2017b liu et al 2016c wang and sun 2019 wan et al 2019 could effectively deal with the model uncertain and unknown disturbances although above results has robustness for the uncertainties and disturbances unfortunately the above path following control methods are on account of state feedback that is to say all signals are required known realistically due to the limitation of hull space and cost the most vessels are not equipped with speed sensor or the sensor has noise contamination the velocity of vessel is unavailable for the feedback control consequently the output feedback path following control method is crucial in application but there are really few researches concerning the path following control of underactuated vehicle with incompletely known state in peng and wang 2017 an eso was devised to observe the unavailable speeds and system uncertainty including interior model uncertainty and exterior environment disturbance a model predictive control mpc approach was put forward to resolve the path following control issue of underactuated ship considering the conditions of input constraints uncertain parameters external disturbances and unknown velocity where the norrbin model was regarded as the internal model and was utilized to address the input saturation linear eso leso was to estimate the total unknowns and the nonlinear observer and leso were exploited to estimate the velocities li et al 2020 the path following control scheme combing with a heading surge guidance for usv was proposed dealing with the unknown dynamics and unmeasured velocity problem where the finite time velocity observer was utilized to observe the unmeasured speed and the unknown dynamics were estimated by wavelet neural network qu et al 2020 the above literatures both solve the path following problem without unknown velocity nevertheless it should be pointed out that there are few researches concerning the path following issue of underactuated msv from the finite time control perspective despite the finite time theory has the advantage of faster convergence and higher precision characteristic jin 2016 li et al 2015 harshavarthini et al 2019 zong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 for example the finite time reliable attitude tracking control was designed for nonlinear quadrotor model harshavarthini et al 2019 which guarantee the attitude tracking and stability performance of the system the feasible annular finite time h filters are designed by resorting to a delay dependent lyapunov functional approach and it is proved that the filtering error system fes has a good performance in attenuating the external disturbances zong et al 2020 the event triggered robust fuzzy adaptive prescribed performance finite time control strategy is presented for a class of strict feedback nonlinear systems with external disturbances and the disturbance observer estimate the external disturbance and fuzzy approximation errors sun et al 2020 what s more the study on finite time control of underactuated vehicle s path following issue is a challenging problem the literature nie and lin 2020 proposed the finite time control approach combing with adaptive fuzzy technique achieving the finite time tracking of desired path for underactuated vehicle and the tracking errors converge to small region near zero within finite time the finite time path following control strategy with surge heading guidance was constructed where the finite time uncertainty observer was applied to observe complicate unknowns which had strong robustness property wang et al 2019 the finite time path following synthesis based on a new hyperbolic tangent los guidance was devised for underactuated msv guaranteeing the globally finite time stability of the entire system where the complicated unknowns were estimated by finite time unknown observer wang and ahn 2020 it is a pity that these studies were based on the research of state feedback and did not consider the velocity unavailable in nie and lin 2020 wang et al 2019 wang and ahn 2020 inspired by above researches this paper aims to resolve the finite time output feedback path following control issue of underactuated msv considering the factors of the velocity unavailable unknown dynamic and unknown external environment disturbances first of all the finite time extended state observer fteso is developed to observe the unknown speeds and total compound disturbances including the unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances subsequently the velocity observation based los guidance method is designed to acquire the reference yaw angle where sideslip angle is obtained by the velocity observation in the next part the finite time output feedback path following controllers are established to track the predefined path eventually it is demonstrated that the designed finite time output feedback path following control strategy is capable of ensuring the tracking errors precisely converge to near zero in the finitely short time the main characteristics of the paper are generalized as below 1 the observation errors of fteso are demonstrated to accurately converge to zero within finite time according to homogeneous theory which enhances the robustness of the system 2 the finite time los guidance law based on velocity observation can not only derive the yaw angle to track the desired one but also meet the requirement of finite time convergence and decrease the convergence time of yaw angle tracking error 3 compared to the asymptotically output feedback path following control method the constructed finite time output feedback control strategy exists three advantages i e faster tracking response higher precision performance and stronger anti interference ability the remainder of the paper is arranged as below the preliminary and the problem formation are introduced in part 2 part 3 designs the finite time output feedback path following control strategy containing the fteso and the finite time los guidance law based on velocity observation the stability analysis is put forward in part 4 the simulation experience and comparisons are depicted in part 5 to prove the availability of raised control strategy lastly part 6 comes to the conclusion 2 preliminary and problem formation 2 1 model of underactuated msv the kinematics equation of underactuated msv is described as below wang et al 2018 1 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r usually the generic assumption is required assumption 1 1 the center of gravity coincides with the center of buoyancy 2 the mass distribution of the msv is homogenous and the vessel is rigid body 3 the shape structure of the msv is starboard symmetric 4 the heave pitch and roll motions are neglected in path following on the horizontal plane the dynamic equation of underactuated msv is described as below 2 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u τ u τ w u m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v τ w v m 33 r m 11 m 22 u v d 33 r τ r τ w r where m 11 m 22 m 33 denote the ship inertia including added mass in surge sway and yaw d 11 d 22 d 33 denote the hydrodynamic damping which can be obtained by using system identification x y ψ represent surge position sway position and yaw angle of vessel in inertial coordinate system u v r denote the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angle velocity of vessel in body coordinate system the surge force τ u and yaw moment τ r are the control inputs τ w u τ w v τ w r represent the unknown external time varying environment disturbances in surge sway yaw direction remark 1 the global positioning system gps artemis microwave position reference system and underwater acoustic position reference system are usually used to obtain accurate position measurement values the velocity information of a ship can be measured by doppler velocity logs dvls however in many cases due to the limitation of cabin space and cost doppler log may not be installed or the sensor may fail or be polluted by noise resulting in inaccurate measurement value in this case the simplest way to obtain the ship speed information is to conduct numerical differentiation on the measured value of ship position however if there are noise signals in the position measurements the differential operation will amplify these noise signals which will greatly affect the path tracking accuracy of underactuated surface ships 2 2 the tracking error dynamics of underactuated msv the path following depiction is given in fig 1 as below the path parameter is denoted by θ to obtain the path following error a new reference coordinate system is introduced i e serret frenet sf coordinate system the origin of sf coordinate system is chosen as an arbitrary point p f θ on the predefined path the x axis and y axis of sf coordinate system are tangent and normal to the path the sf coordinate system and the inertial coordinate system differ by ψ f which expressed as ψ f atan 2 y f x f with f θ p x y denotes the vessel s position in inertial coordinate system as shown in fig 1 p f x f y f is defined as the position of the motional target point along the predefined path in inertial coordinate system the path following error equation established in the sf coordinate system is written as follows 3 x e y e cos ψ f sin ψ f sin ψ f cos ψ f x x f y y f where x e denotes the along track error and y e denotes the cross track error by solving the time differential of 3 we can obtain the location tracking error dynamic equation described in sf coordinate system as below 4 x e y e u cos ψ ψ f v sin ψ ψ f ψ f y e θ x f 2 y f 2 u sin ψ ψ f v cos ψ ψ f ψ f x e consider the underactuated msv model 1 and 2 under the condition of unknown external disturbances unknown dynamic and unavailable velocity the control target of the paper is to drive the vessel to track the desired planar path at the constant surge velocity within finite time through designing the guidance law and output feedback path following control law 3 finite time output feedback path following control design the finite time output feedback path following control strategy consist of three parts fteso the velocity observation based finite time los guidance law and finite time output feedback path following controller firstly the fteso is developed to cover the unknown velocity and unknown lumped disturbances subsequently the velocity observation based finite time los guidance law is to obtain the path parameter update law and reference yaw angle lastly the finite time output feedback path following controller is established via backstepping method to track the predefined path 3 1 fteso design the model of underactuated marine surface vessel in 1 and 2 can be formulated as follows 5 η r ψ υ m υ f τ τ w where η x y ψ t υ u v r t m d i a g m 11 m 22 m 33 τ τ u 0 τ r t τ w τ w u τ w v τ w r t f f u t u v r f v t u v r f r t u v r t has the model parameter uncertainties which are theoretically formulated as follows f u t u v r m 22 v r d 11 u f v t u v r m 11 u r d 22 v f r t u v r m 11 m 22 u v d 33 r r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 is the rotation matrix from body coordinate system to inertial coordinate system in order to facilitate the fteso let ϑ r ψ υ the model of vessel can be represented as below 6 η ϑ ϑ σ r ψ m 1 τ where ϑ ϑ u ϑ v ϑ r t σ r ψ m 1 f τ w r ψ s υ s 0 r 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 assumption 1 the variation rate of lumped disturbances σ is unknown yet bounded i e σ σ m where σ m denotes the positive constant assumption 2 the signal of vessel is bounded and there exist a positive definite constant ε and a compact set ω 1 such that ω 1 η ϑ η ϑ η ε ϑ ε η ε ϑ ε holds remark 2 the external environment disturbances imposing on the vehicle are induced by winds waves and ocean currents and it is usually considered that the disturbances are superimposed by the low frequency period signal wang et al 2016 hence the assumption 1 is rational furthermore the vehicle is the rigid body hence the states of underactuated msv are supposed to be bounded as its motion proceeds consequently the assumption 2 is reasonable the fteso described by 6 is designed as follows 7 η ˆ ϑ ˆ k 1 s i g α 1 η χ 1 sgn η ϑ ˆ σ ˆ r ψ m 1 τ k 2 s i g α 2 η χ 2 sgn η σ ˆ k 3 s i g α 3 η χ 3 sgn η where η ˆ is the observation of the vessel s position η ϑ ˆ is the observation of

of vessel is known the estimation errors are defined by the difference between of estimation value and actual value the total disturbances of the system are estimated as the extended state of the system and the finite time extended state observer can be realized the design parameters α 1 k i i 1 2 3 χ i i 1 2 3 of fteso are given based on the lyapunov stability theory and finite time theory together with 6 and 7 the observation error dynamic system of fteso is represented as 8 η ϑ k 1 s i g α 1 η χ 1 sgn η ϑ σ 1 k 2 s i g α 2 η χ 2 sgn η σ σ k 3 s i g α 3 η χ 3 sgn η subsequently the stability theory of observation error subsystem 8 is given as below theorem 1 for the underactuated msv model described in 6 with the unknown dynamic and unknown exterior disturbances under the assumption 1 and 2 the fteso is established in 7 to observe the unknown velocity and unknown lumped disturbances simultaneously and the observation error of fteso is able to converge to zero within finite time proof if we omit the term χ 1 sgn η χ 2 sgn η and σ χ 3 sgn η at the same time then the observation error dynamic of fteso can be written as 9 η ϑ k 1 s i g α 1 η ϑ σ k 2 s i g α 2 η σ k 3

k r 6 k r 1 0 001 k u 10 k u 1 0 001 the comparative simulation experience results are depicted by different lines in figs 2 10 it is known from fig 2 that the three control strategies enable the vehicle to follow the predefined path and the finite time extended state observer based los fteso los guidance method perform better than extended state observer based los eso los guidance method and finite time los ft los it is indicated from fig 3 that the along track error and cross track error are able to converge to zero via fteso los guidance method which perform better than the other two guidance methods from the view of the convergence effectiveness the along track error converges to zero within 0 1 s and the cross track error converges to zero within 20 s by fteso los yet the converge times of along track error and cross track error are 0 2 s and 70 s by eso los guidance law and the corresponding convergence times are 0 3 s and 40 s by ft los separately which indicates that the fteso los guidance method has faster convergence speed than the other two guidance methods fig 4 demonstrates the performance of vessel s velocity and the surge velocity can track the expected velocity produced by three guidance laws combined with the corresponding controllers but the convergence times by finite time output feedback control scheme are shorter than the other two the yaw angle and reference yaw angle of three guidance laws are displayed in fig 5 and the yaw angle tracking errors are shown in fig 6 which also illustrates the detail of surge velocity tracking error and yaw rate tracking error and the yaw angle tracking errors have obvious oscillation via the eso los guidance law and ft los the control forces and moments of three control strategies are described in fig 7 fig 8 depicts the position estimation errors and attitude estimation errors and fig 9 displays the disturbances estimation errors it can be observed that the fteso remarkably accelerate the converge speed and can achieve accurate tracking property on the basis of both convergence speed and anti interference capability fig 10 shows the disturbances estimation errors of finite time ft disturbance observer in summary the proposed finite time output feedback path following control strategy based on fteso has higher tracking accuracy shorter tracking time and stronger anti disturbance capability 6 conclusion the finite time output feedback path following control strategy based on the fteso has been established for underactuated msv with velocity unavailable unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances in this paper the designed fteso has been demonstrated to converge to zero within the finite time in accordance with the homogeneous theory and can estimate the unknown velocities and unknown lumped disturbances including the unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances according to the velocity observation the finite time los guidance law has been established which is capable of obtaining the reference yaw angle and satisfy the requirement of finite time convergence the finite time output feedback path following controllers have been devised through the backstepping approach it has been certified that the raised finite time output feedback path following control scheme render the vehicle to follow the reference path moving at a predefined speed and tracking errors are capable of converging to arbitrarily small region near the origin within finite time on the light of finite time theory and lyapunov stability theory lastly simulation experience and comparisons have indicated the efficiency of the raised control scheme the finite time output feedback path following control scheme can be extend to the multi agent wen et al 2017 zhao et al 2016b and the actuator or sensor failures zhao et al 2019 sakthivel et al 2017 is also the important character for the marine mission hence they would be the topic of our future research credit

20970,the paper designs a finite time output feedback path following control strategy of underactuated marine surface vehicle msv with the unavailable velocity the unknown dynamic and unknown external environment disturbances firstly a new finite time extended state observer fteso is devised to accurately observe the unknown velocity and unknown lumped disturbances within finite time secondly depending on the output of fteso the velocity observation based finite time los guidance approach is raised to acquire the reference yaw angle thirdly the finite time output feedback path following controllers are constructed through the backstepping method to track the desired path with precise tracking performance it has been demonstrated that the observation error of fteso is capable of converging to zero and the path following error is able to converge to an arbitrarily small domain near zero in finite time according to the homogeneous theory and the lyapunov theory simulation comparison researches are performed to demonstrate the availability of the designed finite time output feedback path following strategy keywords finite time output feedback control path following fteso homogeneous 1 introduction among the motion control researches of marine surface vehicle msv the path following control problem has been a hot topic currently zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 miao et al 2017a xiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016a as a result of its extensive applications prospect in marine development underwater topographical surveying and naval operation the path following is described as that the vehicle reaches and follows predefined path without demanding that the temporal information is known fossen 2011 the path following control of vehicle is comprised of geometric and dynamic assignments for the whole system the geometric assignments is able to be resolved by developing guidance law to produce reference yaw angle and the dynamic assignments can also be settled via controller design such that the vehicle accomplishes expected navigation task the guidance law plays a pivotal role in path following control problem where the los guidance algorithm is discussed more detail than others due to its simplicity and intuitiveness lapierre et al 2006 and has been widely used for dealing with path following problem of vehicle at the beginning of the study the conventional los guidance approach was raised to minimize the cross track error between the ship and the desired route fossen 2003 subsequently all kinds of improved los guidance algorithms were put forward such as the proportional los guidance algorithm fossen and pettersen 2014 the integral los guidance algorithm caharija et al 2016 the adaptive integral los guidance algorithm fossen and lekkas 2017 these guidance algorithms can resist the influence of external environment disturbances in addition as the underactuated msv has no sway actuator the external environment disturbances would induce the sideslip angle which affects tracking error convergence and even lead to system instability from this consideration researchers put forward numerous improved los based methods to deal with the problem such as the predictor based guidance approach liu et al 2016a adaptive sideslip compensation fossen et al 2015 the los guidance algorithm based on extended state observer eso estimation liu et al 2016b 2017 the finite time sideslip observer estimation wang et al 2017 2018 and the finite time predictor based los method yu et al 2019 which were applied to compensate the unknown sideslip angle then solved the sideslip problem another key technology of path following is concerning the controller designing because the external environment disturbances can largely affect the vessel s speed and maneuver ability which brings challenge to the controller design and the robustness anti model uncertain and disturbances is of great importance for marine vehicles the vast literatures regarding the path following controller were proposed by researchers the sliding mode control smc method based global finite time tracking control synthesis was designed for underactuated uuvs under the condition of model parameter perturbation and unknown current disturbance in yan et al 2015 where path tracking errors could converge to zero in finite time the literature miao et al 2017b investigated the curve path tracking control of underactuated auvs considering multiple uncertainties where the model parameter perturbations and unknown environment disturbances were estimated by reduced order linear eso the iterative neural network control approach based on predictor was introduced to deal with the path following issue of msvs under the circumstance of system uncertainties and environment interferences in liu et al 2016c the robust adaptive tracking control strategy based on fuzzy unknown observer for the underactuated surface vehicle was put forward and the fuzzy unknown observer was invented to exactly compensate the lumped unknowns wang and sun 2019 the path following control scheme in view of the novel neural observer was proposed for underactuated usvs where the system uncertainties and unknown lumped interferences were handled through the radial basis function neural network rbfnn and nonlinear neural disturbance observer nndo separately wan et al 2019 the literatures miao et al 2017b liu et al 2016c wang and sun 2019 wan et al 2019 could effectively deal with the model uncertain and unknown disturbances although above results has robustness for the uncertainties and disturbances unfortunately the above path following control methods are on account of state feedback that is to say all signals are required known realistically due to the limitation of hull space and cost the most vessels are not equipped with speed sensor or the sensor has noise contamination the velocity of vessel is unavailable for the feedback control consequently the output feedback path following control method is crucial in application but there are really few researches concerning the path following control of underactuated vehicle with incompletely known state in peng and wang 2017 an eso was devised to observe the unavailable speeds and system uncertainty including interior model uncertainty and exterior environment disturbance a model predictive control mpc approach was put forward to resolve the path following control issue of underactuated ship considering the conditions of input constraints uncertain parameters external disturbances and unknown velocity where the norrbin model was regarded as the internal model and was utilized to address the input saturation linear eso leso was to estimate the total unknowns and the nonlinear observer and leso were exploited to estimate the velocities li et al 2020 the path following control scheme combing with a heading surge guidance for usv was proposed dealing with the unknown dynamics and unmeasured velocity problem where the finite time velocity observer was utilized to observe the unmeasured speed and the unknown dynamics were estimated by wavelet neural network qu et al 2020 the above literatures both solve the path following problem without unknown velocity nevertheless it should be pointed out that there are few researches concerning the path following issue of underactuated msv from the finite time control perspective despite the finite time theory has the advantage of faster convergence and higher precision characteristic jin 2016 li et al 2015 harshavarthini et al 2019 zong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 for example the finite time reliable attitude tracking control was designed for nonlinear quadrotor model harshavarthini et al 2019 which guarantee the attitude tracking and stability performance of the system the feasible annular finite time h filters are designed by resorting to a delay dependent lyapunov functional approach and it is proved that the filtering error system fes has a good performance in attenuating the external disturbances zong et al 2020 the event triggered robust fuzzy adaptive prescribed performance finite time control strategy is presented for a class of strict feedback nonlinear systems with external disturbances and the disturbance observer estimate the external disturbance and fuzzy approximation errors sun et al 2020 what s more the study on finite time control of underactuated vehicle s path following issue is a challenging problem the literature nie and lin 2020 proposed the finite time control approach combing with adaptive fuzzy technique achieving the finite time tracking of desired path for underactuated vehicle and the tracking errors converge to small region near zero within finite time the finite time path following control strategy with surge heading guidance was constructed where the finite time uncertainty observer was applied to observe complicate unknowns which had strong robustness property wang et al 2019 the finite time path following synthesis based on a new hyperbolic tangent los guidance was devised for underactuated msv guaranteeing the globally finite time stability of the entire system where the complicated unknowns were estimated by finite time unknown observer wang and ahn 2020 it is a pity that these studies were based on the research of state feedback and did not consider the velocity unavailable in nie and lin 2020 wang et al 2019 wang and ahn 2020 inspired by above researches this paper aims to resolve the finite time output feedback path following control issue of underactuated msv considering the factors of the velocity unavailable unknown dynamic and unknown external environment disturbances first of all the finite time extended state observer fteso is developed to observe the unknown speeds and total compound disturbances including the unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances subsequently the velocity observation based los guidance method is designed to acquire the reference yaw angle where sideslip angle is obtained by the velocity observation in the next part the finite time output feedback path following controllers are established to track the predefined path eventually it is demonstrated that the designed finite time output feedback path following control strategy is capable of ensuring the tracking errors precisely converge to near zero in the finitely short time the main characteristics of the paper are generalized as below 1 the observation errors of fteso are demonstrated to accurately converge to zero within finite time according to homogeneous theory which enhances the robustness of the system 2 the finite time los guidance law based on velocity observation can not only derive the yaw angle to track the desired one but also meet the requirement of finite time convergence and decrease the convergence time of yaw angle tracking error 3 compared to the asymptotically output feedback path following control method the constructed finite time output feedback control strategy exists three advantages i e faster tracking response higher precision performance and stronger anti interference ability the remainder of the paper is arranged as below the preliminary and the problem formation are introduced in part 2 part 3 designs the finite time output feedback path following control strategy containing the fteso and the finite time los guidance law based on velocity observation the stability analysis is put forward in part 4 the simulation experience and comparisons are depicted in part 5 to prove the availability of raised control strategy lastly part 6 comes to the conclusion 2 preliminary and problem formation 2 1 model of underactuated msv the kinematics equation of underactuated msv is described as below wang et al 2018 1 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r usually the generic assumption is required assumption 1 1 the center of gravity coincides with the center of buoyancy 2 the mass distribution of the msv is homogenous and the vessel is rigid body 3 the shape structure of the msv is starboard symmetric 4 the heave pitch and roll motions are neglected in path following on the horizontal plane the dynamic equation of underactuated msv is described as below 2 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u τ u τ w u m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v τ w v m 33 r m 11 m 22 u v d 33 r τ r τ w r where m 11 m 22 m 33 denote the ship inertia including added mass in surge sway and yaw d 11 d 22 d 33 denote the hydrodynamic damping which can be obtained by using system identification x y ψ represent surge position sway position and yaw angle of vessel in inertial coordinate system u v r denote the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angle velocity of vessel in body coordinate system the surge force τ u and yaw moment τ r are the control inputs τ w u τ w v τ w r represent the unknown external time varying environment disturbances in surge sway yaw direction remark 1 the global positioning system gps artemis microwave position reference system and underwater acoustic position reference system are usually used to obtain accurate position measurement values the velocity information of a ship can be measured by doppler velocity logs dvls however in many cases due to the limitation of cabin space and cost doppler log may not be installed or the sensor may fail or be polluted by noise resulting in inaccurate measurement value in this case the simplest way to obtain the ship speed information is to conduct numerical differentiation on the measured value of ship position however if there are noise signals in the position measurements the differential operation will amplify these noise signals which will greatly affect the path tracking accuracy of underactuated surface ships 2 2 the tracking error dynamics of underactuated msv the path following depiction is given in fig 1 as below the path parameter is denoted by θ to obtain the path following error a new reference coordinate system is introduced i e serret frenet sf coordinate system the origin of sf coordinate system is chosen as an arbitrary point p f θ on the

vehicle to follow the predefined path and the finite time extended state observer based los fteso los guidance method perform better than extended state observer based los eso los guidance method and finite time los ft los it is indicated from fig 3 that the along track error and cross track error are able to converge to zero via fteso los guidance method which perform better than the other two guidance methods from the view of the convergence effectiveness the along track error converges to zero within 0 1 s and the cross track error converges to zero within 20 s by fteso los yet the converge times of along track error and cross track error are 0 2 s and 70 s by eso los guidance law and the corresponding convergence times are 0 3 s and 40 s by ft los separately which indicates that the fteso los guidance method has faster convergence speed than the other two guidance methods fig 4 demonstrates the performance of vessel s velocity and the surge velocity can track the expected velocity produced by three guidance laws combined with the corresponding controllers but the convergence times by finite time output feedback control scheme are shorter than the other two the yaw angle and reference yaw angle of three guidance laws are displayed in fig 5 and the yaw angle tracking errors are shown in fig 6 which also illustrates the detail of surge velocity tracking error and yaw rate tracking error and the yaw angle tracking errors have obvious oscillation via the eso los guidance law and ft los the control forces and moments of three control strategies are described in fig 7 fig 8 depicts the position estimation errors and attitude estimation errors and fig 9 displays the disturbances estimation errors it can be observed that the fteso remarkably accelerate the converge speed and can achieve accurate tracking property on the basis of both convergence speed and anti interference capability fig 10 shows the disturbances estimation errors of finite time ft disturbance observer in summary the proposed finite time output feedback path following control strategy based on fteso has higher tracking accuracy shorter tracking time and stronger anti disturbance capability 6 conclusion the finite time output feedback path following control strategy based on the fteso has been established for underactuated msv with velocity unavailable unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances in this paper the designed fteso has been demonstrated to converge to zero within the finite time in accordance with the homogeneous theory and can estimate the unknown velocities and unknown lumped disturbances including the unknown dynamic and external environment disturbances according to the velocity observation the finite time los guidance law has been established which is capable of obtaining the reference yaw angle and satisfy the requirement of finite time convergence the finite time output feedback path following controllers have been devised through the backstepping approach it has been certified that the raised finite time output feedback path following control scheme render the vehicle to follow the reference path moving at a predefined speed and tracking errors are capable of converging to arbitrarily small region near the origin within finite time on the light of finite time theory and lyapunov stability theory lastly simulation experience and comparisons have indicated the efficiency of the raised control scheme the finite time output feedback path following control scheme can be extend to the multi agent wen et al 2017 zhao et al 2016b and the actuator or sensor failures zhao et al 2019 sakthivel et al 2017 is also the important character for the marine mission hence they would be the topic of our future research credit

20971,many countries engaged in polar research are commissioning polar research and supply vessels prsvs inter alia britain s rrs sir david attenborough and australia s rsv nuyina the prevalent climate change has placed the arctic and antarctic regions in the forefront of operations requiring specialist ships to support and deploy research activities this study focuses on prsvs and examines potential means of assessing their capabilities by identifying and gathering sources of information into a database further this study presents established models of ship performance assessment in the academic literature links are drawn between these models prsv characteristics and the need for scientific capabilities and transport logistics in polar science an adapted model is then applied to the data collected enabling the assessment of prsv capabilities the assessment is based on the following key characteristics 1 icebreaking 2 logistics 3 science and 4 ship size each using attributes from the database to provide a normalised score data pertaining to five prsvs are examined and the results are depicted as a radar diagram the results show the general applicability of the model keywords polar research and supply vessel prsv capability assessment polar engineering polar operations climate change ice going ship 1 introduction modern polar research vessels are launched commissioned or planned by countries involved in polar exploration and science climate change has placed the arctic and antarctic in the forefront of research since these regions are unique for investigating past climates of the earth kennicutt ii et al 2019 for examples of recent extensive polar research expeditions see the british antarctic survey 2015 and the multidisciplinary drifting observatory for the study of arctic climate change mosaic 2020 as key locations for scientific operations the polar regions require ice strengthened vessels with cargo freight and crew capabilities for transport from mainland home countries to remote polar research stations prsvs are one off ships built by specialist shipyards prsvs are usually government owned operated and managed such vessels typically have a project planning duration of 5 years building costs ranging from usd 100 400 m and average economic operational lifetime from 30 to 50 years a specimen of large project cargo is the german research station neumayer iii alfred wegener institut awi 2020a which was designed and fabricated in germany it was transported to the shelf ice in the antarctic by the polar research and supply vessel rv polarstern the flagship of german polar research the combined weight of the station and facilities was 3500 tonnes awi 2020a in addition to supplying the antarctic station with food spares and equipment the vessel conducts research in polar waters and operates in arctic waters during the northern summer awi 2017 this example highlights the dependency of stations and scientific projects on the maritime support deploying specialist vessels the capability of supporting a particular station with a specific amount of supplies is a key criterion and may influence the final design of a prsv newbuilding hence the starting point of this study is countries that operate permanent stations on the antarctic continent fig 1 identifies the actors on the world map despite prsv newbuilding activity and actuality across nations australian antarctic division 2020 british antarctic survey 2017 ccg 2018 havforskningsinstituttet 2020 kopri 2014 sanap 2012 the term polar research vessel is barely covered in the literature and similar notations are used interchangeably the rv kronprins haakon is called ice going research vessel as well as polar research vessel fincantieri s p a 2017 mikelborg 2015 australia s newbuilding is presented as icebreaking antarctic supply and research vessel asrv knud e hansen a s 2017 and rv polarstern is titled polar research and supply vessel bmbf 2016 knust 2017 for consistency this study refers to all types of this vessel as prsv the foregoing notations state the vessel s three main objectives icebreaking logistics supply and polar science due to the actuality and planning of new prsvs and given the lack of combined sources of information this study explores and compiles a base for assessing the capabilities of current and planned prsv this in turn will facilitate defining this type of vessel and elaborate on the main characteristics the research question is what are the capabilities of a prsv and how can they be assessed the aim of this research question is twofold viz to identify key characteristics of a prsv and use these to develop a framework model based on selected criteria this study explores and presents key capabilities of a sample of current prsvs as well as proposing a blueprint for evaluating prsv design such a model will be an asset for present and future stakeholders involved in or considering conducting research activities in the arctic and or antarctic regions this model and data attribute explanation see appendix 3 can contribute to compiling an evaluation tool for 1 an ex post evaluation of existing prsv 2 the planning process for future replacement and renewal of prsvs and 3 enabling closer cooperation and data exchange among the prsv stakeholders polar expedition passenger vessels tourism military surface ships submarines and the russian nuclear powered icebreaking business are excluded from this study considerations on prsvs plus the societal environmental impact of their equipment resulting from building activities and end of life re cycling are beyond the scope of this study considerations on ship intact and damage stability cargo properties other than stowage e g dangerous goods which may be relevant when assessing ship design features are beyond the scope of this paper not addressed are ethical considerations related to research activities on the sea floor in the sea on the surface in air land and on ice in polar areas the study is structured as follows section 2 reviews the literature on ship assessment section 3 presents the applied research methodology section 4 presents the results by gathering the data into a model and applying it to selected vessel information obtained from the research section 5 discusses the findings of the research and explains the constraints the final two sections provide a conclusion as well as recommendations for further research 2 literature review of ship assessment 2 1 capabilities and performance hafeez et al 2002 regard capability as the ability to utilise resources to perform a task or an activity hence a resource is anything tangible or intangible owned by or acquired by a firm the capabilities are regarded as what the vessel is able to do lu 2007 specified in certain attributes that can be noted and are close or equal to resources one example is the scientific equipment on board a prsv which might be considered a resource represented by a physical sensor on board however the same equipment enables the vessel to take samples from deep water down to 11 000 m thus it can be regarded as a capability according to strand 2018 capabilities refer to attributes and answerable to can it do something whereas performance is a result of capabilities put to use 2 2 sustainability assessment of marine technologies a holistic model of the sustainability analysis of ships was presented by cabezas basurko et al 2008 basurko and mesbahi 2014 further developed a model of assessing marine technologies viz an eight step approach including a first scope step which enables the limitation and framing of the study showings attributes another example of a step included in the modelling is sustainability indices as the results of their respective sustainability dimension modelling these might require normalization to make them comparable with external frames such as potential legislation limits in section 4 basurko and mesbahi s model is adapted and applied to explore prsv capability assessment providing individual scores for the itemised ship components such a model also provides an option to weight priorities enhancing flexibility 2 3 shipping kpi according to issar and navon 2016 p 74 for improving operation performance measured kpis need to be critical accurate and significant bimco 2018 adds that they must be observable and quantifiable sensitive to change transparent and easy to understand as well as robust to manipulation wang and hu 2016 point out that having kpis that can be benchmarked to peers is extremely valuable and trends should be visible these key attributes are used in the shipping kpi system bimco 2018 see fig 2 fig 2 shows a bottom up kpi system designed for ship operators and relevant stakeholders three levels of indicators are displayed the lowest level shows the performance indicators pi acting primarily as a data collector the middle level is kpi which combines pis and normalises in the form of a key performance indicator kpi the normalization at this stage ranks from 0 to 100 with 0 being unacceptable and 100 being outstanding performance one pi may be used for the calculation of multiple kpis the kpi rating is effectuated using a normalization formula where kpitarget is the value achieving a rating of 100 and the kpiminreq is the rating value of zero the top level shipping performance indicators spi provides information about overall performance bimco 2018 the final spis are grouped in dimensions covering the relevant activities the focus is on the operation and excludes a life cycle approach concerning the building or the disposal bimco 2018 duru et al 2012 focused on the generation of the spi using the unweighted average park et al 2016 introduced the kpi method on dynamic positioning systems dps dp enabling more accurate performance measurements on vessel station keeping and probably applicable for prsvs as well this study recognizes the importance of certain aspects sustainability which kpi refers to in section 4 the next section describes the research approach including the procedure of prsv data collection 3 research methodology to address the how and what research question the adopted research strategy employs a qualitative exploratory case study technique yin 2014 data acquisition included dialogues interviews and a survey of available primary and secondary literature kothari 2003 surbhi 2016 combining existing findings brocke et al 2009 fig 3 depicts the research approach previous work done in this field created the starting point of the investigation of prsv an extra starting point was provided by existing scientific bases in the antarctic that indicate which countries to focus the initial search on a further starting point stemmed from an overview of the major icebreakers of the world according to the united states coast guard featuring 127 icebreakers above 10 000 hp uscg 2017 this list was skimmed battaglia 2008 for possible prsvs and 16 were identified and selected for investigation see fig 4 the original information was structured and stored in an excel database the creation was an iterative process since information about the prsv varied in quality and quantity this led to decisions regarding abstraction of information common ground had to be established but sometimes details were omitted as similar detailed information was not obtainable for other prsvs this would have led to a convolution of the database and was thus avoided a specific example of this predicament is multibeam echo sounders mbes which are installed on most prsvs but vary in their operating frequencies depth rating or data quality data quality from a mbes depends among others on installed on board locations and possible fouling of prsv s underwater hull thus it was decided to alter the type of data from specific information to boolean statements of yes and no in many attribute categories comments were added in brackets where they were deemed necessary after identifying the scientific link to the antarctic the existence of databases was sought after in particular the european region was found to be rich in research agreements and common projects one of these is the eurofleets2 project which has a vessel database linked to it see e g eurocean 2016 it also publishes reports about the status of research vessels and their foreseeable evolution eurofleets2 2014 as reports and database were closely related cross checks on the research vessels were performed a test on the rv polarstern revealed differences in both sources it was decided to add one more cross reference using the operator s website for the vessel alfred wegener institut 2020 an explanation or source of error about deviations between data sources cannot always be given although shipowners or authorities websites are generally less specific than both the database and the report they are assumed to contain the most accurate information 3 1 database feeding fig 5 depicts the process of data acquisition the vessels were chosen in sequence beginning with those where data was already present from the previous work step 1 after the selection data sources were reviewed step 2 although vessel registries contain basic information e g length draught beam gt the official website of the owning or operating organisation often provided detailed aspects of the vessel articles about the design and fabrication were sourced from magazines and technical journals on account of the vast amount of sources data conflicts were discovered regularly concerning mismatches of stated values even in basic attributes such as main dimensions accordingly a hierarchy of credibility had to be established the first tier is obtained from the vessel registries provided data can be accessed the second tier comprises official operator and owner websites plus builder websites of current newbuildings the builders of older vessels were not considered on this tier due to possible refits in the off season and drydocking periods the third tier contained the remaining sources the collected data were compared with data from prsv already in the list step 3 if there was any sufficient overlap with existing data from entries in the database a new attribute was added step 4 this also included backtracking this kind of information for other vessels and finalising the data entries for the new prsv as well as modifying the old one with new attributes step 5 due to this cross referencing most of the vessels were processed in sequence at this point only vessels with less information available remained these were added to the then frozen database thus no additional attributes would be added in the database and only data matching the existing field would be accepted the basis of the attributes covers research vessels from the united kingdom rrv sir david attenborough norway rsv kronprins haakon germany rv polarstern and australia rsv nuyina 3 2 group boundary decisions processing these vessels data revealed ambiguities regarding allocating certain vessels hovering between the collected data ranges of prsv and oceanographic research vessels the authors decided on a judgemental basis which vessels to include and exclude based on the polar class of newbuildings old vessels were included due to the absence of this class before its first appearance in 2007 vessels under polar class pc5 would be excluded from the database this threshold value was chosen because it is the first one to classify the vessel for year round operation in medium first year ice while pc6 and 7 refer only to summer autumn operations iacs 2006 this resulted in the exclusion of the peruvian newbuilding bap carrasco which only has polar class 7 dnv gl 2017a a further judgemental observation was the absence of a typical icebreaker bow revealing the normal shape for non ice going ocean sailing vessels an additional criterion concerned the featuring of the mission and capability trinity of science logistics and icebreaking accordingly the french polar institute s vessel fns l astrolabe was excluded since its main mission only stated defence and support ipev 2017 another boundary is given by the transition from icebreaker to prsv the canadian ccgs john g diefenbaker planned to be completed in 2029 berthiaume 2020 is more powerful than most of the other prsvs in the group with 34 mw propulsion power and icebreaking capabilities of 2 5 m at 3 knots the decisive feature to include it in the final list was the presence of a large moonpool for scientific instrumentation 1 1 due to the rapid development of large autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and their operation see table 2 and section 5 features linked to moonpool is under reconsideration and the presence of logistics facilities nevertheless the capabilities of the vessel differ widely from the other considered vessels and might therefore influence the ability to apply the correct scale when assessing the capability 3 3 study limitations the chosen method and procedure for data collection entail some constraints although much of the data were available on websites and database documents some investigated vessels are part of the country s armed forces thus information is classified additionally major sources of information about chinese japanese argentinian and russian vessels were sometimes available only in their own languages although english translations were offered they were often incomplete or incomprehensible hence the quality of the collected data constrains the conducted study the numerous sources and often vague descriptions made it difficult to decide which source to trust if the stated attributes conflicted with each other a lot of the data have been collected in boolean format which makes the further development into quantifiable attributes challenging the literature was scrutinized for prsv on board scientific equipment and it was recognized that much of the instrumentation is portable and could be installed on a prsv on a project basis the database still aims to cover the main scientific areas of equipment used on prsv further refinement into permanent equipment and operational capabilities for example linked to data accessibility and vessel communication abilities via satellites in polar areas could have led to more nuanced results and a score see section 4 that better reflects the capabilities additionally current trends of robotics drones and future capabilities should be considered maslanik et al 2002 moreover this study estimated the scientific laboratory spaces the foregoing circumstances for scientific capabilities may have led to skewed numbers in the scientific scores as will be discussed in section 4 further details of ship cranes and their arrangement helicopters and boats were collected but were not incorporated into logistical capabilities icebreaking attributes should reflect the ability of the vessels in this field but their technical nature made consideration difficult in the scope of this study in particular the conversion of ice classes referencing of external literature allows for interpretation and may have a significant impact on the icebreaking capability score summing up in lieu of the rather modest exploratory purpose of this study it was decided to clean interpret and judge the collected data according to what can be logically understood and assumed battaglia 2008 thus the results obtained and presented in this study should be interpreted with care 4 results fig 6 shows the countries with antarctic scientific bases and prsvs the corresponding prsvs are listed in table 1 green antarctic scientific base and prsv present green striped only prsv present blue antarctic scientific base present orange base and prsv which did not meet the green green striped nor blue criteria and are part of regular oceanographic research vessels 18 vessels were included in the final list and used as a frame for the data collection based on these vessels 57 attributes were established see appendices 2 and 3 4 1 developing an exploratory model for prsv capabilities the model depicted in fig 7 applies adapted concepts from basurko and mesbahi 2014 and bimco 2018 as presented in section 2 the identified and established key characteristics of prsvs are 1 icebreaking 2 logistics 3 science capabilities additionally a fourth key characteristic ship size was included to reflect vessel scaling in the model section 4 2 details key characteristics societal aspects beyond ship personnel facilities no of personnel see appendix 1 were not investigated and the environmental aspects are subtly integrated with attributes and not considered separately step 1 in fig 7 defines the scope of the assessment the corresponding attributes step 2 that fit the purpose may be incorporated into the key characteristic next data from the database are assigned to the chosen attributes adjustments to the data may be necessary to allow for assessment a step detailed in section 4 3 some attributes were collected as a boolean type e g is the type of equipment present or not whereas other attributes were collected in numerical form e g propulsion power and level icebreaking step 4 will vary slightly depending on the type of data gathered most of the data will be assessed using the averaging method this is especially true for the boolean type of data that is used in groups other types are calculated using the normalization method see shipping kpi model in section 2 using maximum and minimum values from the prsv to normalize the specific attributes value in relation to its group if the key characteristics had sub groups respective score these are weighted according to the number of attributes corresponding to this score step 5 the result is represented by three indices each a number between 0 and 100 indicating the degree of sophistication or capability in the respective area 4 2 presentation of the four key characteristics 4 2 1 icebreaking capability this key characteristic comprises three attributes viz ice class icebreaking and propulsion power ice class is a numerical representation of the polar classes adapted to the group of prsv thus the boundaries are set by the maximum and minimum polar class or equivalent of the investigated vessels accordingly the maximum value is 2 and the minimum is 6 deciding on equivalent values is a process presented in section 4 3 the icebreaking attribute refers to the thickness level of the ice that prsv can break by going at a certain speed commonly 3 knots this often includes a snow layer on top which has not been noted in the databases this attribute considers the thickness of level icebreaking and does not account for the vessel speed the propulsion power is also considered as the polar class notation per se does not take this into consideration nyseth and bertelsen 2014 stated values are explicitly targeted at propulsion and not at the general output of the engines all values are normalised using the minimum and maximum values and the final score is an average of the three sub scores 4 2 2 scientific capability the category with the highest number of attributes mostly aggregated in the boolean format contains information about scientific equipment 11 attributes see appendix 2 present on board the vessel this includes a second part listing vessel specifics 7 attributes such as the presence of a moonpool dynamic positioning systems drop keels rovs and auvs finally the laboratory space is evaluated by comparing the sizes m2 precise information about laboratory space metrics is given in section 4 3 the three individual scores are weighted according to their number of attributes and combined into a final score 4 2 3 logistic capability this category has many potential attributes but only one which delivered consistent information the cargo hold volume expressed in cubic metres additionally a second consideration in this key characteristic is the container capacity measured in twenty foot equivalent unit teu which is stated for some but not all prsvs additional consideration was given to extra cargo tenders helicopter capacity additional holds for aviation or base fuel and cranes generally the information in this area lacked specificity and was discarded from calculations 4 2 4 size of ship the model was initially concerned with the foregoing three key characteristics but since the results lacked a way of placing them in perspective the key characteristic ship size was added ideally the gross tonnage gt would be a fitting reflection of most interior spaces unfortunately some newbuildings e g rsv nuyina did not have such information available and substitutes had to be taken into consideration displacement and the main dimensions were considered schneekluth and bertram 1998 as displacement is essentially a measure of weight rather than size it was discarded this was also influenced by the different icebreaker design which naturally features heavy steel plating however some prsvs like the rv polarstern are built with a double hull further increasing the weight creating a volume by multiplication did not seem to reflect the special prsv hull forms in an appropriate way the final assessment method is the creation of individual scales for length breadth and draught in a normalised way the final score is then determined by averaging the three resulting values 4 3 database attribute adaption to use some of the attributes in the model the values had to be made comparable a selection of these deemed important ones are presented below 4 3 1 laboratory spaces this attribute displays a large variation in detail for the investigated vessels in some cases only the total area is given whereas other sources present all the laboratories on the prsv in great detail in rare cases laboratories were only mentioned and neither presented nor accurately described space is an important criterion for research vessels and has been studied before and seen in relation with other features like deck space ship noise or accommodation subbaiah et al 2016 consequently the importance of the spaces is reflected in the model through the inclusion of absolute numbers the following assumptions were established to render the information into comparable numbers the size of a single laboratory is set to 20 m2 unless otherwise expressed containerised lab spaces are calculated as 14 5 m2 per teu 4 3 2 ice classes in 2007 the polar classes were published by the iacs to uniformize the various ice classing rules and regulations iacs 2006 any direct comparison is difficult due to the varying criteria in these rules some classifications consider engine power while others only focus on structural strength the polar class was developed by experts in major ice classifications therefore it offers a suitable way to compare prsvs daley 2014 comparisons of ice classes across classification societies

system failure while the equipment class could be collected in a reliable manner for most vessels the influence on the actual capabilities of the vessel is relatively scarce as they are mostly concerned with reliability instead of accuracy of position for this reason the detailed information in the database was reduced to a boolean type for the assessment 4 3 4 other attributes during the data collection many items of information were split up with the aim of categorizing as much as possible however some attributes derived in this way can hardly be considered a workable definition of information one example is biological nets and trawling gear which were initially kept as separate entries but since neither of the objects is fixed to a specific vessel and they are dependent on available winches they were combined into one item in the evaluation similar steps were taken regarding the acoustic instrumentation where the attribute sonar was deleted as it was too general 4 4 application of the model this section applies the developed model from section 4 1 to five ships with the most complete information in the database it features the rsv aurora australis rsv nuyina rrs sir david attenborough rv polarstern and rv kronprins haakon the selected attributes for evaluation with the corresponding values are shown in table 2 the individual scores are combined into a matrix table 3 providing an overview of the capabilities of the selected prsv successively they are mapped into the four aspects and depicted in a radar diagram see fig 8 the results show a large difference in size logistics and icebreaking but are quite similar as regards the science capabilities only the rsv aurora australis ranks behind the other vessels possibly due to her age 5 discussion the approach for exploring and modelling the capabilities of prsvs was developed by adapting the insight provided by basurko and mesbahi 2014 and using characteristics from the shipping kpi standard by bimco 2018 the result albeit exploratory is important because it indicates the viability of capability assessments for prsvs the model is built up in flexible modules of key characteristics that do not interact with each other nor are they aggregated in a final score adding new key characteristics is therefore simple as long as the underlying database supplies the necessary information while the model copes reasonably well with past data collected in this study there is limited ability to assess capabilities in the future the prsv economic lifetime may span over the next thirty years and beyond this means that polar research and polar base supply demands that are as yet unknown need to be considered and incorporated into the prsv designs currently the proposed model does not reflect these capabilities to include such capabilities requires additional attributes to those dealt with in this study which would naturally influence the scores of all other vessels in the group thus attributes and their possible interaction must be scrutinized also in relation to their weighting and to the importance for the scope of a prsv table 2 shows that scientific capabilities were found to be largely comparable across prsvs nevertheless current polar research pilot projects are testing new methods of scientific investigations the project ocean infinity 2018 uses multiple autonomous underwater vehicles auv simultaneously hosted by one prsv to multiply the area of data collection thus increasing productivity and possibly shorten expedition time unmanned surface vehicles usv can be used to transmit the vast amounts of data between a host prsv and its auvs the scientific operation is then performed by a group of vehicles instead of a single prsv and extensive artificial intelligence systems are used to provide autonomy to the auvs interestingly this concept could not be evaluated in this proposed model if numerous survey capabilities are to be assessed the attribute type auv would have to be further developed including reflection of how such extensive survey capability should be added to the model with the correct significant weighting currently there is no upper limit on vessels to add to the model possible future advanced icebreakers with large laboratory space and extensive equipment in all areas could for example distort the comparability of the other prsvs in such a database since their scores would be pressed down thus losing a lot of the ability to gain information at a glance across prsvs even the attempt to establish an upper limit providing a frame for the group on collected data proved much more complex for prsvs than for many commercial shipping classes for example a panamax bulk carrier is stated to be between 60 000 and 75 000 tonnes deadweight with a width restriction of 32 5 m stopford 2009 to put this into perspective the gt range of the group of prsvs considered in this study is from 4000 to 16 000 and their length varies from 80 m to 167 m the relative differences among prsvs are thus frequently larger and more extreme than in many other commercial shipping classes thus the limits presented in this study see table 2 were defined with a certain elasticity and focused on creating a border to the comparatively large group of oceanographic research vessels or global research vessels eurocean 2016 a prsv database proposed in this study see appendix 2 for excerpts for three prsvs could aim at providing information about the complete group of such vessels current databases were found to focus on regional units or mixing them with other classes of research vessels unifying prsv data into one database established according to a common sourcing hierarchy would provide potential users with an overall impression of the capabilities of a prsv in question 6 conclusion this study examined current and planned polar research and supply vessels the research questions was what are the capabilities of prsvs and how can they be assessed this question is explored through the development of a model mapping the identified capabilities of size icebreaking science and logistics capabilities on a normalised scale and by allowing assessments within the boundaries of each capability group the study achieved its exploratory aim and scope by providing a model a framed group of five prsvs and an excerpt of a database containing key characteristics of some prsvs this study aimed to explore the prsv sector where data was found to be scattered inconsistent and sometimes contradicting the group of prsvs was not framed in the literature and the sources contained data of varying quality and quantity the assessment of capabilities of prsvs will depend on the availability of reliable specific data as a first step in this study the range of such data was identified and gathered in a database the database explanation and reference as well as excerpts of data for three prsvs comprises the practical contribution of this study providing possibilities for further development and application the theoretical contribution of this study stems from the developed model which is adapted from the already established academic literature and enables the basic capability assessment of prsvs 7 recommendations for further research further research may enrich and validate the exploratory results presented this can be achieved by considering future possibilities of science refining the icebreaking assessment and generally increasing the number of attributes that define prsvs moreover the possibility for a viable business case for privately owned prsvs could be explored during data collection the science cases of the british vessel rrs sir david attenborough indicated a need for research vessels as the need for research platforms is currently higher than the supply nerc 2014 the ocean facilities exchange group ofeg is a barter exchange and co operation platform for european research vessels including france germany netherlands norway spain and the uk ofeg features a vessel database and advances ship barter requests with ship requirement profiles research in this area could survey the market and propose solutions to this possible prsv shortage a possible enhanced validated and transparent prsv data base could be useful for further collaboration between prsvs owners and managers for conducting

20971,many countries engaged in polar research are commissioning polar research and supply vessels prsvs inter alia britain s rrs sir david attenborough and australia s rsv nuyina the prevalent climate change has placed the arctic and antarctic regions in the forefront of operations requiring specialist ships to support and deploy research activities this study focuses on prsvs and examines potential means of assessing their capabilities by identifying and gathering sources of information into a database further this study presents established models of ship performance assessment in the academic literature links are drawn between these models prsv characteristics and the need for scientific capabilities and transport logistics in polar science an adapted model is then applied to the data collected enabling the assessment of prsv capabilities the assessment is based on the following key characteristics 1 icebreaking 2 logistics 3 science and 4 ship size each using attributes from the database to provide a normalised score data pertaining to five prsvs are examined and the results are depicted as a radar diagram the results show the general applicability of the model keywords polar research and supply vessel prsv capability assessment polar engineering polar operations climate change ice going ship 1 introduction modern polar research vessels are launched commissioned or planned by countries involved in polar exploration and science climate change has placed the arctic and antarctic in the forefront of research since these regions are unique for investigating past climates of the earth kennicutt ii et al 2019 for examples of recent extensive polar research expeditions see the british antarctic survey 2015 and the multidisciplinary drifting observatory for the study of arctic climate change mosaic 2020 as key locations for scientific operations the polar regions require ice strengthened vessels with cargo freight and crew capabilities for transport from mainland home countries to remote polar research stations prsvs are one off ships built by specialist shipyards prsvs are usually government owned operated and managed such vessels typically have a project planning duration of 5 years building costs ranging from usd 100 400 m and average economic operational lifetime from 30 to 50 years a specimen of large project cargo is the german research station neumayer iii alfred wegener institut awi 2020a which was designed and fabricated in germany it was transported to the shelf ice in the antarctic by the polar research and supply vessel rv polarstern the flagship of german polar research the combined weight of the station and facilities was 3500 tonnes awi 2020a in addition to supplying the antarctic station with food spares and equipment the vessel conducts research in polar waters and operates in arctic waters during the northern summer awi 2017 this example highlights the dependency of stations and scientific projects on the maritime support deploying specialist vessels the capability of supporting a particular station with a specific amount of supplies is a key criterion and may influence the final design of a prsv newbuilding hence the starting point of this study is countries that operate permanent stations on the antarctic continent fig 1 identifies the actors on the world map despite prsv newbuilding activity and actuality across nations australian antarctic division 2020 british antarctic survey 2017 ccg 2018 havforskningsinstituttet 2020 kopri 2014 sanap 2012 the term polar research vessel is barely covered in the literature and similar notations are used interchangeably the rv kronprins haakon is called ice going research vessel as well as polar research vessel fincantieri s p a 2017 mikelborg 2015 australia s newbuilding is presented as icebreaking antarctic supply and research vessel asrv knud e hansen a s 2017 and rv polarstern is titled polar research and supply vessel bmbf 2016 knust 2017 for consistency this study refers to all types of this vessel as prsv the foregoing notations state the vessel s three main objectives icebreaking logistics supply and polar science due to the actuality and planning of new prsvs and given the lack of combined sources of information this study explores and compiles a base for assessing the capabilities of current and planned prsv this in turn will facilitate defining this type of vessel and elaborate on the main characteristics the research question is what are the capabilities of a prsv and how can they be assessed the aim of this research question is twofold viz to identify key characteristics of a prsv and use these to develop a framework model based on selected criteria this study explores and presents key capabilities of a sample of current prsvs as well as proposing a blueprint for evaluating prsv design such a model will be an asset for present and future stakeholders involved in or considering conducting research activities in the arctic and or antarctic regions this model and data attribute explanation see appendix 3 can contribute to compiling an evaluation tool for 1 an ex post evaluation of existing prsv 2 the planning process for future replacement and renewal of prsvs and 3 enabling closer cooperation and data exchange among the prsv stakeholders polar expedition passenger vessels tourism military surface ships submarines and the russian nuclear powered icebreaking business are excluded from this study considerations on prsvs plus the societal environmental impact of their equipment resulting from building activities and end of life re cycling are beyond the scope of this study considerations on ship intact and damage stability cargo properties other than stowage e g dangerous goods which may be relevant when assessing ship design features are beyond the scope of this paper not addressed are ethical considerations related to research activities on the sea floor in the sea on the surface in air land and on ice in polar areas the study is structured as follows section 2 reviews the literature on ship assessment section 3 presents the applied research methodology section 4 presents the results by gathering the data into a model and applying it to selected vessel information obtained from the research section 5 discusses the findings of the research and explains the constraints the final two sections provide a conclusion as well as recommendations for further research 2 literature review of ship assessment 2 1 capabilities and performance hafeez et al 2002 regard capability as the ability to utilise resources to perform a task or an activity hence a resource is anything tangible or intangible owned by or acquired by a firm the capabilities are regarded as what the vessel is able to do lu 2007 specified in certain attributes that can be noted and are close or equal to resources one example is the scientific equipment on board a prsv which might be considered a resource represented by a physical sensor on board however the same equipment enables the vessel to take samples from deep water down to 11 000 m thus it can be regarded as a capability according to strand 2018 capabilities refer to attributes and answerable to can it do something whereas performance is a result of capabilities put to use 2 2 sustainability assessment of marine technologies a holistic model of the sustainability analysis of ships was presented by cabezas basurko et al 2008 basurko and mesbahi 2014 further developed a model of assessing marine technologies viz an eight step approach including a first scope step which enables the limitation and framing of the study showings attributes another example of a step included in the modelling is sustainability indices as the results of their respective sustainability dimension modelling these might require normalization to make them comparable with external frames such as potential legislation limits in section 4 basurko and mesbahi s model is adapted and applied to explore prsv capability assessment providing individual scores for the itemised ship components such a model also provides an option to weight priorities enhancing flexibility 2 3 shipping kpi according to issar and navon 2016 p 74 for improving operation performance measured kpis need to be critical accurate and significant bimco 2018 adds that they must be observable and quantifiable sensitive to change transparent and easy to understand as well as robust to manipulation wang and hu 2016 point out that having kpis that can be benchmarked to peers is extremely valuable and trends should be visible these key attributes are used in the shipping kpi system bimco 2018 see fig 2 fig 2 shows a bottom up kpi system designed for ship operators and relevant stakeholders three levels of indicators are displayed the lowest level shows the performance indicators pi acting primarily as a data collector the middle level is kpi which combines pis and normalises in the form of a key performance indicator kpi the normalization at this stage ranks from 0 to 100 with 0 being unacceptable and 100 being outstanding performance one pi may be used for the calculation of multiple kpis the kpi rating is effectuated using a normalization formula where kpitarget is the value achieving a rating of 100 and the kpiminreq is the rating value of zero the top level shipping performance indicators spi provides information about overall performance bimco 2018 the final spis are grouped in dimensions covering the relevant activities the focus is on the operation and excludes a life cycle approach concerning the building or the disposal bimco 2018 duru et al 2012 focused on the generation of the spi using the unweighted average park et al 2016 introduced the kpi method on dynamic positioning systems dps dp enabling more accurate performance measurements on vessel station keeping and probably applicable for prsvs as well this study recognizes the importance of certain aspects sustainability which kpi refers to in section 4 the next section describes the research approach including the procedure of prsv data collection 3 research methodology to address the how and what research question the adopted research strategy employs a qualitative exploratory case study technique yin 2014 data acquisition included dialogues interviews and a survey of available primary and secondary literature kothari 2003 surbhi 2016 combining existing findings brocke et al 2009 fig 3 depicts the research approach previous work done in this field created the starting point of the investigation of prsv an extra starting point was provided by existing scientific bases in the antarctic that indicate which countries to focus the initial search on a further starting point stemmed from an overview of the major icebreakers of the world according to the united states coast guard featuring 127 icebreakers above 10 000 hp uscg 2017 this list was skimmed battaglia 2008 for possible prsvs and 16 were identified and selected for investigation see fig 4 the original information was structured and stored in an excel database the creation was an iterative process since information about the prsv varied in quality and quantity this led to decisions regarding abstraction of information common ground had to be established but sometimes details were omitted as similar detailed information was not obtainable for other prsvs this would have led to a convolution of the database and was thus avoided a specific example of this predicament is multibeam echo sounders mbes which are installed on most prsvs but vary in their operating frequencies depth rating or data quality data quality from a mbes depends among others on installed on board locations and possible fouling of prsv s underwater hull thus it was decided to alter the type of data from specific information to boolean statements of yes and no in many attribute categories comments were added in brackets where they were deemed necessary after identifying the scientific link to the antarctic the existence of databases was sought after in particular the european region was found to be rich in research agreements and common projects one of these is the eurofleets2 project which has a vessel database linked to it see e g eurocean 2016 it also publishes reports about the status of research vessels and their foreseeable evolution eurofleets2 2014 as reports and database were closely related cross checks on the research vessels were performed a test on the rv polarstern revealed differences in both sources it was decided to add one more cross reference using the operator s website for the vessel alfred wegener institut 2020 an explanation or source of error about deviations between data sources cannot always be given although shipowners or authorities websites are generally less specific than both the database and the report they are assumed to contain the most accurate information 3 1 database feeding fig 5 depicts the process of data acquisition the vessels were chosen in sequence beginning with those where data was already present from the previous work step 1 after the selection data sources were reviewed step 2 although vessel registries contain basic information e g length draught beam gt the official website of the owning or operating organisation often provided detailed aspects of the vessel articles about the design and fabrication were sourced from magazines and technical journals on account of the vast amount of sources data conflicts were discovered regularly concerning mismatches of stated values even in basic attributes such as main dimensions accordingly a hierarchy of credibility had to be established the first tier is obtained from the vessel registries provided data can be accessed the second tier comprises official operator and owner websites plus builder websites of current newbuildings the builders of older vessels were not considered on this tier due to possible refits in the off season and drydocking periods the third tier contained the remaining sources the collected data were compared with data from prsv already in the list step 3 if there was any sufficient overlap with existing data from entries in the database a new attribute was added step 4 this also included backtracking this kind of information for other vessels and finalising the data entries for the new prsv as well as modifying the old one with new attributes step 5 due to this cross referencing most of the vessels were processed in sequence at this point only vessels with less information available remained these were added to the then frozen database thus no additional attributes would be added in the database and only data matching the existing field would be accepted the basis of the attributes covers research vessels from the united kingdom rrv sir david attenborough norway rsv kronprins haakon germany rv polarstern and australia rsv nuyina 3 2 group boundary decisions processing these vessels data revealed ambiguities regarding allocating certain vessels hovering between the collected data ranges of prsv and oceanographic research vessels the authors decided on a judgemental basis which vessels to include and exclude based on the polar class of newbuildings old vessels were included due to the absence of this class before its first appearance in 2007 vessels under polar class pc5 would be excluded from the database this threshold value was chosen because it is the first one to classify the vessel for year round operation in medium first year ice while pc6 and 7 refer only to summer autumn operations iacs 2006 this resulted in the exclusion of the peruvian newbuilding bap carrasco which only has polar class 7 dnv gl 2017a a further judgemental observation was the absence of a typical icebreaker bow revealing the normal shape for non ice going ocean sailing vessels an additional criterion concerned the featuring of the mission and capability trinity of science logistics and icebreaking accordingly the french polar institute s vessel fns l astrolabe was excluded since its main mission only stated defence and support ipev 2017 another boundary is given by the transition from icebreaker to prsv the canadian ccgs john g diefenbaker planned to be completed in 2029 berthiaume 2020 is more powerful than most of the other prsvs in the group with 34 mw propulsion power and icebreaking capabilities of 2 5 m at 3 knots the decisive feature to include it in the final list was the presence of a large moonpool for scientific instrumentation 1 1 due to the rapid development of large autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and their operation see table 2 and section 5 features linked to moonpool is under reconsideration and the presence of logistics facilities nevertheless the capabilities of the vessel differ widely from the other considered vessels and might therefore influence the ability to apply the correct scale when assessing the capability 3 3 study limitations the chosen method and procedure for data collection entail some constraints although much of the data were available on websites and database documents some investigated vessels are part of the country s armed forces thus information is classified additionally major sources of information about chinese japanese argentinian and russian vessels were sometimes available only in their own languages although english translations were offered they were often incomplete or incomprehensible hence the quality of the collected data constrains the conducted study the numerous sources and often vague descriptions made it difficult to decide which source to trust if the stated attributes conflicted with each other a lot of the data have been collected in boolean format which makes the further development into quantifiable attributes challenging the literature was scrutinized for prsv on board scientific equipment and it was recognized that much of the instrumentation is portable and could be installed on a prsv on a project basis the database still aims to cover the main scientific areas of equipment used on prsv further refinement into permanent equipment and operational capabilities for example linked to data accessibility and vessel communication abilities via satellites in polar areas could have led to more nuanced results and a score see section 4 that better reflects the capabilities additionally current trends of robotics drones and future capabilities should be considered maslanik et al 2002 moreover this study estimated the scientific laboratory spaces the foregoing circumstances for scientific capabilities may have led to skewed numbers in the scientific scores as will be discussed in section 4 further details of ship cranes and their arrangement helicopters and boats were collected but were not incorporated into logistical capabilities icebreaking attributes should reflect the ability of the vessels in this field but their technical nature made consideration difficult in the scope of this study in particular the conversion of ice classes referencing of external literature allows for interpretation and may have a significant impact on the icebreaking capability score summing up in lieu of the rather modest exploratory purpose of this study it was decided to clean interpret and judge the collected data according to what can be logically understood and assumed battaglia 2008 thus the results obtained and presented in this study should be interpreted with care 4 results fig 6 shows the countries with antarctic scientific bases and prsvs the corresponding prsvs are listed in table 1 green antarctic scientific base and prsv present green striped only prsv present blue antarctic scientific base present orange base and prsv which did not meet the green green striped nor blue criteria and are part of regular oceanographic research vessels 18 vessels were included in the final list and used as a frame for the data collection based on these vessels 57 attributes were established see appendices 2 and 3 4 1 developing an exploratory model for prsv capabilities the model depicted in fig 7 applies adapted concepts from basurko and mesbahi 2014 and bimco 2018 as presented in section 2 the identified and established key characteristics of prsvs are 1 icebreaking 2 logistics 3 science capabilities additionally a fourth key characteristic ship size was included to reflect vessel scaling in the model section 4 2 details key characteristics societal aspects beyond ship personnel facilities no of personnel see appendix 1 were not investigated and the environmental aspects are subtly integrated with attributes and not considered separately step 1 in fig 7 defines the scope of the assessment the corresponding attributes step 2 that fit the purpose may be incorporated into the key characteristic next data from the database are assigned to the chosen attributes adjustments to the data may be necessary to allow for assessment a step detailed in section 4 3 some attributes were collected as a boolean type e g is the type of equipment present or not whereas other attributes were collected in numerical form e g propulsion power and level icebreaking step 4 will vary slightly depending on the type of data gathered most of the data will be assessed using the averaging method this is especially true for the boolean type of data that is used in groups other types are calculated using the normalization method see shipping kpi model in section 2 using maximum and minimum values from the prsv to normalize the specific attributes value in relation to its group if the key characteristics had sub groups respective score these are weighted according to the number of attributes corresponding to this score step 5 the result is represented by three indices each a number between 0 and 100 indicating the degree of sophistication or capability in the respective area 4 2 presentation of the four key characteristics 4 2 1 icebreaking capability this key characteristic comprises three attributes viz ice class icebreaking and propulsion power ice class is a numerical representation of the polar classes adapted to the group of prsv thus the boundaries are set by the maximum and minimum polar class or equivalent of the investigated vessels accordingly the maximum value is 2 and the minimum is 6 deciding on equivalent values is a process presented in section 4 3 the icebreaking attribute refers to the thickness level of the ice that prsv can break by going at a certain speed commonly 3 knots this often includes a snow layer on top which has not been noted in the databases this attribute considers the thickness of level icebreaking and does not account for the vessel speed the propulsion power is also considered as the polar class notation per se does not take this into consideration nyseth and bertelsen 2014 stated values are explicitly targeted at propulsion and not at the general output of the engines all values are normalised using the minimum and maximum values and the final score is an average of the three sub scores 4 2 2 scientific capability the category with the highest number of attributes mostly aggregated in the boolean format contains information about scientific equipment 11 attributes see appendix 2 present on board the vessel this includes a second part listing vessel specifics 7 attributes such as the presence of a moonpool dynamic positioning systems drop keels rovs and auvs finally the laboratory space is evaluated by comparing the sizes m2 precise information about laboratory space metrics is given in section 4 3 the three individual scores are weighted according to their number of attributes and combined into a final score 4 2 3 logistic capability this category has many potential attributes but only one which delivered consistent information the cargo hold volume expressed in cubic metres additionally a second consideration in this key characteristic is the container capacity measured in twenty foot equivalent unit teu which is stated for some but not all prsvs additional consideration was given to extra cargo tenders helicopter capacity additional holds for aviation or base fuel and cranes generally the information in this area lacked specificity and was discarded from calculations 4 2 4 size of ship the model was initially concerned with the foregoing three key characteristics but since the results lacked a way of placing them in perspective the key characteristic ship size was added ideally the gross tonnage gt would be a fitting reflection of most interior spaces unfortunately some newbuildings e g rsv nuyina did not have such information available and substitutes had to be taken into consideration displacement and the main dimensions were considered schneekluth and bertram 1998 as displacement is essentially a measure of weight rather than size it was discarded this was also influenced by the different icebreaker design which naturally features heavy steel plating however some prsvs like the rv polarstern are built with a double hull further increasing the weight creating a volume by multiplication did not seem to reflect the special prsv hull forms in an appropriate way the final assessment method is the creation of individual scales for length breadth and draught in a normalised way the final score is then determined by averaging the three resulting values 4 3 database attribute adaption to use some of the attributes in the model the values had to be made comparable a selection of these deemed important ones are presented below 4 3 1 laboratory spaces this attribute displays a large variation in detail for the investigated vessels in some cases only the total area is given whereas other sources present all the laboratories on the prsv in great detail in rare cases laboratories were only mentioned and neither presented nor accurately described space is an important criterion for research vessels and has been studied before and seen in relation with other features like deck space ship noise or accommodation subbaiah et al 2016 consequently the importance of the spaces is reflected in the model through the inclusion of absolute numbers the following assumptions were established to render the information into comparable numbers the size of a single laboratory is set to 20 m2 unless otherwise expressed containerised lab spaces are calculated as 14 5 m2 per teu 4 3 2 ice classes in 2007 the polar classes were published by the iacs to uniformize the various ice classing rules and regulations iacs 2006 any direct comparison is difficult due to the varying criteria in these rules some classifications consider engine power while others only focus on structural strength the polar class was developed by experts in major ice classifications therefore it offers a suitable way to compare prsvs daley 2014 comparisons of ice classes across classification societies are only possible on a case by case basis and should not generalised vessels that needed adjusting were rsv aurora australis 1as baltic classes mv xue long 1as baltic classes rrs ernest shackleton 1a1

this study due their technical nature see suominen et al 2013 4 3 3 dynamic positioning dynamic positioning capabilities are subject to evaluation and framing by classification societies the imo 1994 proposed three equipment classes based on redundancy equipment class 1 no redundancy single fault can lead to loss of position equipment class 2 redundancy no single fault of active components or systems will lead to positioning loss components like cables pipes valves are allowed as causes equipment class 3 as in class 2 but it also must withstand fire or flooding in any compartment without system failure while the equipment class could be collected in a reliable manner for most vessels the influence on the actual capabilities of the vessel is relatively scarce as they are mostly concerned with reliability instead of accuracy of position for this reason the detailed information in the database was reduced to a boolean type for the assessment 4 3 4 other attributes during the data collection many items of information were split up with the aim of categorizing as much as possible however some attributes derived in this way can hardly be considered a workable definition of information one example is biological nets and trawling gear which were initially kept as separate entries but since neither of the objects is fixed to a specific vessel and they are dependent on available winches they were combined into one item in the evaluation similar steps were taken regarding the acoustic instrumentation where the attribute sonar was deleted as it was too general 4 4 application of the model this section applies the developed model from section 4 1 to five ships with the most complete information in the database it features the rsv aurora australis rsv nuyina rrs sir david attenborough rv polarstern and rv kronprins haakon the selected attributes for evaluation with the corresponding values are shown in table 2 the individual scores are combined into a matrix table 3 providing an overview of the capabilities of the selected prsv successively they are mapped into the four aspects and depicted in a radar diagram see fig 8 the results show a large difference in size logistics and icebreaking but are quite similar as regards the science capabilities only the rsv aurora australis ranks behind the other vessels possibly due to her age 5 discussion the approach for exploring and modelling the capabilities of prsvs was developed by adapting the insight provided by basurko and mesbahi 2014 and using characteristics from the shipping kpi standard by bimco 2018 the result albeit exploratory is important because it indicates the viability of capability assessments for prsvs the model is built up in flexible modules of key characteristics that do not interact with each other nor are they aggregated in a final score adding new key characteristics is therefore simple as long as the underlying database supplies the necessary information while the model copes reasonably well with past data collected in this study there is limited ability to assess capabilities in the future the prsv economic lifetime may span over the next thirty years and beyond this means that polar research and polar base supply demands that are as yet unknown need to be considered and incorporated into the prsv designs currently the proposed model does not reflect these capabilities to include such capabilities requires additional attributes to those dealt with in this study which would naturally influence the scores of all other vessels in the group thus attributes and their possible interaction must be scrutinized also in relation to their weighting and to the importance for the scope of a prsv table 2 shows that scientific capabilities were found to be largely comparable across prsvs nevertheless current polar research pilot projects are testing new methods of scientific investigations the project ocean infinity 2018 uses multiple autonomous underwater vehicles auv simultaneously hosted by one prsv to multiply the area of data collection thus increasing productivity and possibly shorten expedition time unmanned surface vehicles usv can be used to transmit the vast amounts of data between a host prsv and its auvs the scientific operation is then performed by a group of vehicles instead of a single prsv and extensive artificial intelligence systems are used to provide autonomy to the auvs interestingly this concept could not be evaluated in this proposed model if numerous survey capabilities are to be assessed the attribute type auv would have to be further developed including reflection of how such extensive survey capability should be added to the model with the correct significant weighting currently there is no upper limit on vessels to add to the model possible future advanced icebreakers with large laboratory space and extensive equipment in all areas could for example distort the comparability of the other prsvs in such a database since their scores would be pressed down thus losing a lot of the ability to gain information at a glance across prsvs even the attempt to establish an upper limit providing a frame for the group on collected data proved much more complex for prsvs than for many commercial shipping classes for example a panamax bulk carrier is stated to be between 60 000 and 75 000 tonnes deadweight with a width restriction of 32 5 m stopford 2009 to put this into perspective the gt range of the group of prsvs considered in this study is from 4000 to 16 000 and their length varies from 80 m to 167 m the relative differences among prsvs are thus frequently larger and more extreme than in many other commercial shipping classes thus the limits presented in this study see table 2 were defined with a certain elasticity and focused on creating a border to the comparatively large group of oceanographic research vessels or global research vessels eurocean 2016 a prsv database proposed in this study see appendix 2 for excerpts for three prsvs could aim at providing information about the complete group of such vessels current databases were found to focus on regional units or mixing them with other classes of research vessels unifying prsv data into one database established according to a common sourcing hierarchy would provide potential users with an overall impression of the capabilities of a prsv in question 6 conclusion this study examined current and planned polar research and supply vessels the research questions was what are the capabilities of prsvs and how can they be assessed this question is explored through the development of a model mapping the identified capabilities of size icebreaking science and logistics capabilities on a normalised scale and by allowing assessments within the boundaries of each capability group the study achieved its exploratory aim and scope by providing a model a framed group of five prsvs and an excerpt of a database containing key characteristics of some prsvs this study aimed to explore the prsv sector where data was found to be scattered inconsistent and sometimes contradicting the group of prsvs was not framed in the literature and the sources contained data of varying quality and quantity the assessment of capabilities of prsvs will depend on the availability of reliable specific data as a first step in this study the range of such data was identified and gathered in a database the database explanation and reference as well as excerpts of data for three prsvs comprises the practical contribution of this study providing possibilities for further development and application the theoretical contribution of this study stems from the developed model which is adapted from the already established academic literature and enables the basic capability assessment of prsvs 7 recommendations for further research further research may enrich and validate the exploratory results presented this can be achieved by considering future possibilities of science refining the icebreaking assessment and generally increasing the number of attributes that define prsvs moreover the possibility for a viable business case for privately owned prsvs could be explored during data collection the science cases of the british vessel rrs sir david attenborough indicated a need for research vessels as the need for research platforms is currently higher than the supply nerc 2014 the ocean facilities exchange group ofeg is a barter exchange and co operation platform for european research vessels including france germany netherlands norway spain and the uk ofeg features a vessel database and advances ship barter requests with ship requirement profiles research in this area could survey the market and propose solutions to this possible prsv shortage a possible enhanced validated and transparent prsv data base could be useful for further collaboration between prsvs owners and managers for conducting

20972,hydrokinetic technologies harvest renewable power by harnessing the kinetic energy of water from free flowing rivers streams dam head tailrace and irrigation channels savonius rotor is one of the simple and low cost vertical axis drag type devices used for the extraction of hydrokinetic power the main limitation of savonius hydrokinetic turbine is its low efficiency due to negative torque

maintaining a fixed v angle of 90 varying length of v edges arc radius and with a constant aspect ratio of 0 7 the simulations were carried out using commercial software ansys fluent from the

with little or low head in the range of 2 30 m elbatran et al 2018 loots et al 2015 salleh et al 2019 yah et al 2017 the savonius turbine is a drag type rotor that rotates at shallow fluid flow as compared to conventional water turbines and also it can take fluid from any direction with better starting characteristics at low speed akwa et al 2012 roy and saha 2013 zhou and rempfer 2013 it can be manufactured with two half circular buckets attached to the central rotating shaft which is fixed to the bearings savonius turbines are easy to install in the river or small irrigation channels

since its invention in 1920 many efforts were carried out to enhance the turbine performance the effect of different blade profiles deflector plates guide vanes and nozzles were studied to improve the performance parameters such as coefficient of torque ct and coefficient of power cp wong et al 2017 roy and saha 2013 documented a review on experimental investigations of the savonius rotor from the viewpoint of its design and performance many convincing parameters such as aspect ratio ar overlap ratio or blade arc angle and the number of rotor blades were investigated to enhance the performance of the savonius turbines numerous augmentation techniques for improving the performance of savonius rotor with different stages multi staging used to improve the self starting capability of the savonius turbine hayashi et al 2005 saha et al 2008 curtain design windshields nozzle deflector plate and guide box tunnel are reported in literature wong et al 2017 khan et al 2009 carried out an experimental investigation on savonius water turbines with one two and three stages it was found that cpmax value of double staged rotor was higher than one and three staged rotors nakjima et al 2008a studied the influence of direction of rotation of a savonius turbine with a horizontal axis savonius turbine it was observed that cp was continuously increasing in the anticlockwise rotation when compared to clockwise rotation until the ratio of clearance remains less than 0 73 in their follow up study nakajima et al 2008b inspected the performance of two double staged rotor blades over a single staged with and without phase change of 90 the author found that less coefficient of power cp for a two staged rotor than the single stage rotor however for two staged rotor blades with a phase change of 90 and 10 additional coefficient of power cp is increased as compared to stage one rotor blade golecha et al 2011 carried out an experimental study on a modified savonius water turbine using a single deflector plate and found that cpmax of 0 21 at a tsr of 0 82 further investigation using two deflector plates by golecha et al 2012 found that at an optimal location cp enhanced to 0 35 golecha et al 2012 investigated the influence of the separation gap ratio on the interaction between 2 rotors placed in an inline manner it was found that keeping the rotor blade nearer to the first rotor blade increases the interaction and reduces the performance as compared to keeping the turbine far away from the first turbine sarma et al 2014 carried out experimental and 3d numerical studies on a three bladed conventional kind of savonius water turbine with an aspect ratio of 0 7 found that cpmax of 0 39 at a tsr of 0 77 ahmed et al 2013 carried out experimental and piv investigation using seven different savonius rotors with equal diameter and varying blade angles in a wave channel to evaluate the optimum blade angle it was found that the energy extraction is maximum from the rpm measurements when the optimum blade curvature angle is 70 two pairs of rotors with this blade curvature were used at various depths to test the extraction of energy from the orbital motion it was found that rotor blade gives maximum output when the distance between the rotor blades is minimum birjandi et al 2013 performed an experimental study on hydrokinetic turbine using the naca 0021 airfoil sections for different water levels the results showed that cp is reduced due to partial immersion of the lift based vertical axis darrieus turbines sahim et al 2013 conducted experiments on combined darrieus and savonius water turbines it was found that even at low speed the self starting of darrieus turbine was easier due to the presence of savonius turbine the analogous turbine was studied using a deflector plate in their advanced study by sahim et al 2014 they found that performance increases by keeping the deflector plate in the upstream side of the blades bikas et al 2014 carried out an experimental investigation to evaluate the performance parameters of the savonius rotor type wave energy convertor an experiment was performed by horizontal and vertical testing of the

3 patel et al 2016 carried out an experimental investigation on the effect of aspect ratio ar and overlap ratio or on the performance of the conventional type of savonius water turbines and advised to have an end plate during the fabrication of rotor blades with an overlap ratio range of 0 1 0 15 and with an aspect ratio of greater than 1 8 would give a better result kumar and saini 2017a conducted the numerical investigation on rotor blades with the twisted profile for different twist angles of 0 12 5 25 and velocity range of 0 5 2 m s the results found that a maximum cp of 0 39 was obtained for twist angle 12 5 and at a speed of 2 m s kumar and saini 2017b also conducted numerical studies on twisted blade profiles with different blade arc angles maintaining the same angle of twist of 12 5 and found that cpmax value of 0 426 at an angle of arc of 150 elbatran et al 2017 carried out numerical studies on modified savonius rotor blades using the ducted shape of the nozzle and stated that the maximum value of cp and ct found was 0 27 and 0 37 respectively talukdar et al 2018 conducted an experimental and numerical study on two and three bladed conventional type water turbines for different immersion levels of the turbine blades they found two bladed conventional type of savonius water turbine performance is better than two bladed elliptical rotor configurations the turbine blades immersed 100 in water having superior performance than 40 and 60 immersion patel et al 2018 further analyzed the theoretical hydrodynamic performance of the savonius turbine with semi circular vanes and suggested a method for determining the best configuration of the savonius turbine system the effect of the canal geometric parameters on the efficiencies of savonius hydro turbines was studied by patel et al 2019 and the methodology for speed correction was introduced to assess the actual turbine performance the test findings show that there is a wide variation in the cpmax for all tested situations if speed correction is not considered prasad et al 2018 carried out numerical studies using the savonius rotor to evaluate the performance by placing the turbine in a numerical wave tank in the beginning performance of a savonius rotor with a diameter of 1 8 m was measured at mean wave height of 2 00 m and a mean wave duration of 12 68 s the results show that the savonius rotor shows better performance at a submergence depth of 1 0 times the diameter of the turbine compare to other submergence levels mosbahi et al 2019 worked on a helical type of savonius hydrokinetic turbine using augmentation technique and found that maximum cp of 0 14 at a tsr of 0 7 kerikous and thévenin 2019b modified the profile of the blade and varied the blade thickness on concave and convex sides to improve the performance of savonius hydrokinetic turbine the results show that for a modified savonius turbine blade there was a 12 increase in cp at a tsr of 1 1 as compared to the conventional type turbine in the further study kerikous and thévenin 2019a worked on optimization techniques for the blade profile and placing of thick deflector in front of savonius hydrokinetic turbines the results show that cp is augmented by 15 with a tsr of 1 2 mosbahi et al 2020 carried out experimental and cfd investigations on helical savonius and delta bladed darrieus turbine by varying the attachment angles the results show that cpmax of delta bladed darrieus turbine is higher than the helical savonius turbine ramadan et al 2020 carried out a case study by re designing the conventional savonius hydrokinetic turbine blade using computational fluid dynamics cfd they found that the performance was increased by 40 as compared to conventional savonius turbine at low velocity conditions alizadeh et al 2020 worked on enhancing the semi circular blade profile s performance with the use of a single barrier to depart the fluid from the returning blade profile of the savonius turbine to increase its performance the results show that with a barrier in its optimum position the cpmax increases by 18 as compared to without barrier case saini and saini 2020b carried out cfd investigations on hybrid turbine a combination of savonius and darrieus turbine by varying the inlet water velocities ranging from 0 5 to 2 0 m s and evaluated the performance parameters the hybrid rotor and single darrieus rotor were also compared based on their performance the results show that cpmax of a hybrid turbine is 37 97 higher than the single darrieus rotor the summary of different studies on savonius blade profiles with water as a working medium reported by various researchers are presented in table 1 the main limitations reported by various researchers are savonius hydrokinetic turbines have lower efficiency due to negative torque developed by the returning blade without augmentation techniques literature review reveals that several experimental and numerical studies have been performed by different authors using conventional alizadeh et al 2020 kacprzak et al 2013 mahmoud et al 2012 patel et al 2016 roy and ducoin 2016 talukdar et al 2018 elliptical

channel with curved or semi circular shaped blade profiles table 2 shows the optimization techniques and numerical investigation carriedout by various researchers to improve the performance of semicircular blade profiles table 2 shows various blade optimization techniques and numerical investigations carried out by different researchers using commercial software to increase the performance of semi circular blade profiles however studies on performance evaluation of conventional savonius rotor having v shaped blade profiles with varying straight edges and arc radius is not reported in open literature therefore in the present work an experimental study was conducted on different v shaped blade profiles with varying straight edges and arc radius fig 1 a which was validated using a three dimensional unsteady numerical investigation by ansys fluent 14 5 the modified blade profiles selected in this study are expected to reduce the negative torque generated at the returning blade profile by reducing the width of arc and providing the two tangent straight edges to the arc on the returning blade profile in order to reduce the drag the modified v shaped rotor blade profiles with small arc and two tangent straight edges give the path to the movement of fluid towards advancing blade profile were expected to increase the torque developed by the advancing blade side hence there is a need to study the influence of rotor blade with different v shaped blade profiles by varying straight edges and arc radius experimentally and numerically the numerical and experimental results of v shaped blade profiles are compared with the numerical result of the semi circular blade profile using a similar geometric parameter the following are the objectives of the present work i to conduct an experimental study of five different configurations of v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 to v5 in a multipurpose tilting water flume ii to study the performance of the above rotor blade configurations using three dimensional unsteady numerical simulations using sliding mesh technique smt and compare with numerical results of the semi circular blade profile iii to study the variation of coefficient of torque ct with respect to the angle of rotation θ of the turbine blade for semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade configurations using polar plots iv to study the flow

multipurpose tilting flume having four supporting structure at the right and left side of the flume the sidewalls of the tilting flume are made from transparent acrylic glass material to visualize the flow inside the flume two monoblock pumps are provided at the right bottom side of the flume to circulate the water from downstream outlet reservoir to upstream inlet reservoir the flow rate is measured by using pre calibrated rectangular notch cd 0 6 provided at the exit of the flume and two control valves are provided to regulate the flow a height gauge is fixed on the flume to measure the depth of water hw and the width of the flume wc is 215 mm the product of depth of water hw and width of the flume wc is known as the wetted area aw hwwc of the flume using equation 6 the actual

rotor blades v1 v5 shown in fig 2 f are individually positioned inside the tilting flume fig 2 c positioning of the turbine in the tilting flume is essential from the viewpoint of free stream water current stability two pumps 2 hp sharp make are used to supply the water to the flume from the outlet reservoir to the inlet reservoir the flow regulators are used to regulate the flow rate of these pumps and water flow rate is measured by using rectangular notch fixed at the outlet of the flume and coefficient of discharge cd is 0 6 the experimental test rig is placed 3 6 m away from the inlet of the tilting flume where fully developed flow is available the kinetic energy of the flowing water and drag force difference between advancing and returning blade profiles drives the rotor blades a rope break type of dynamometer fig 2 b is used for loading the rotor shaft using a weighing pan spring balance and pulleys the torque generated by the rotor is determined by gradually applying the

performance parameters such as tsr ct and cp are 1 8 2 4 and 2 6 the calculations of uncertainty are based on moffat 1988 4 three dimensional numerical simulation 4 1 creation of geometry fig 3 shows the three dimensional computational domain with a rotor blade created using ansys design modeler this computational domain is similar to a rectangular irrigation channel with two side walls one bottom wall and the top surface is exposed to the atmosphere the computational domain is having two zones one is a rotating zone and the second one is a stationary zone the rotating zone is created by using an enclosure with a cushion radius of 14 4 mm i e 1 5 times the diameter of the turbine blade kumar and saini 2017a 2017b saini and saini 2018 shashikumar et al 2020 similarly a stationary zone rectangular domain was made by using the enclosure with a nonuniform cushion on the rotor blade and rotating zones respectively the interface created between rotating zone and stationary zone using boolean operation the rotor blade is placed at a distance of three times the diameter of the turbine blade from the front and rear faces of the computational domain sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 and the width of the domain is same as that of a width of the flume wc 215 mm 4 2 meshing the geometric model is imported to ansys workbench and the tetrahedral mesh applied for both rotating and stationary zones fine mesh is given to the rotating zone to capture the detailed physics and the coarse mesh is provided to the stationary zone mosbahi et al 2019 2020a inflation has given to blade profile with a first layer thickness of 0 04 mm and a growth rate of 1 2 to achieve a better mesh resolution and to study the boundary layer effect as shown in fig 4 it is found that non dimensional wall distance y value is less than 1 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a talukdar et al 2018 the quality of mesh given in terms of orthogonality skewness and aspect ratio of 0 86 0 21 and 2 1 respectively all these values are in the acceptable range ansys fluent 14 5 user s guide 2013 sarma et al 2014 4 3 boundary conditions after the completion of meshing using ansys workbench the various essential boundary conditions are given to the computational domain the front face of the three dimensional computational domain is considered as a velocity inlet vw 0 3090 m s and the rear face of the domain is taken as a pressure outlet boundary condition zero gauge pressure kumar and saini 2017a 2017b sarma et al 2014 the right left and bottom face of the domain is considered as a wall no slip wall bc

conditions elbatran et al 2017 john et al 2020 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b mosbahi et al 2019 2020a 2020b sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 the different boundary conditions used in the present simulation are listed in table 5 4 4 grid independence study grid independence study was carried out for a different number of mesh element sizes such as 794124 962432 1159705 1250103 1332064 and 1462049 as the number of mesh elements increases from 794124 to 962432 there is a change in the value of ct with respect to tsr similarly from 962432 to 1159705 the difference in the value of ct is decreased and with the increase in number of mesh elements from 1159705 1250103 1332064 to 1462049 the change in the value of ct is negligible therefore the 1159705 mesh elements are considered as a baseline and optimum number of mesh elements for the present simulation to reduce the computational time fig 5 a shows the variation of ct with respect to the angle of rotation of the turbine blade b expanded view of ctmax therefore the element size of 1159705 is taken for the present numerical simulation to reduce computational time the values of ct for a varying number of mesh elements and percentage difference is presented in table 6 the time step of 1 turbine blade rotate 1 in each time step is taken for the present numerical simulation based on the previous literature elbatran et al 2017 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 and the average value ct is calculated by taking the average value of last one revolution of the turbine blade based on the results of earlier studies ghosh et al 2015 goh et al 2016 kerikous and thévenin 2019a 2019b kumar and saini 2017a 2017b mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 4 5 governing equations the governing equations 9 13 for the unsteady viscous and incompressible turbulent flow are the navier stokes equations which can be written in the following form elbatran et al 2017 malalasekera 2007

ui u v w are the velocity components in the directions of xi x y z ρw is the density of water in kg m3 ω represents specific turbulence dissipation μw represents the dynamic viscosity of water in kg m s k is the turbulence kinetic energy γk and γ ω are the effective diffusivity for k and ω gk is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients and g ω represents the generation of ω yk and yω represents the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence while dω is the cross diffusion term 4 6 selection of the turbulence model various turbulence models available are based on the reynolds number re and configuration of the turbine blade to simulate the flow such as spalart allmaras model 1 equation realizable k ε model rng k ε model standard k ω model talukdar et al 2018 standard k ε model and sst k ω model can be used for the simulation of a turbine blade the standard k ε model is a simple turbulence model and which is more appropriate for the computation of turbulent flow this model provides better findings than spalart allmaras in turbine blade simulation studies talukdar et al 2018 furthermore it is found that both the realizable model and the rng k ε model have predicted significantly better results as compared to standard k ε and spalart allmaras model talukdar et al 2018 the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation eddy viscosity model that integrates the benefits of both k ε and k ω formulation for free stream flow and rotor blade boundary layer it is also exhibiting smaller resistant to free stream conditions as compared to other turbulence models the sst k ω model is utilized around the flow field because it is well suitable for simulating flow in the viscous sublayer wherever greater accuracy is required at the boundary layer the sst k ω model captures an extensive type of flows such as flow with adverse pressure gradients flow over airfoils rotating flows and low reynolds number re flow it has already been used extensively in similar studies by various researchers kacprzak et al 2013 mereu et al 2017 roy and ducoin 2016 shaheen et al 2015 talukdar et al 2018 hence in this study the unsteady sst k ω turbulence model is used for three dimensional numerical simulation 4 7 simulation method three dimensional transient pressure based solver with absolute velocity formulation was used for the present case it is found that the achieved dimensionless wall distance y value is less than 1 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the turbulence model used is coupled two equation sst k ω model based on previous research carried out by other researchers to capture the high separation levels and adverse pressure gradients around the blade wall kacprzak et al 2013 mereu et al 2017 roy and ducoin 2016 shaheen et al 2015 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 therefore the flow is resolved at the wall boundaries of the turbine blade to approximate the dimensionless velocity as a linear function of y the higher y leads to decreased simulation precision as the wall functions recommended by ansys will not solve the boundary layer flow problems the density ρw and viscosity of water μw is taken as 998 2 kg m3 and 0 001003 kg m s stationary zone and rotating zones are constructed using cell zone conditions and angular velocity ω is given to the rotating zone based on the experimental tsr of the rotor and axis of rotation of the rotor are y axis boundary conditions provided with an inlet velocity of 0 3090 m s and zero gauge pressure is given to the pressure outlet the various reference values are very significant in calculating the performance parameters such as ct and cp the various parameters required for reference values in ansys fluent 14 5 are the area of the turbine blade ar hrdr length l of the turbine radius of turbine blade 0 5dr viscosity μw density ρw of the water and all the calculations computed from the velocity inlet to solve unsteady three dimensional equations various solvers are available in the ansys fluent 14 5 software such as simple simplec and piso in that semi implicit scheme for pressure linked equation simple scheme uses a velocity pressure correction relationship to impose mass conservation and obtain pressure field talukdar et al 2018 this scheme ensures better stability of a solution through the combination of pressure and velocity on the other hand the simple scheme is computationally economical as compared to other schemes the convergence is quicker roy and ducoin 2016 and the spatial discretization technique selected was least square cell method through second order pressure and momentum equation the second order upwind scheme has taken for turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate to achieve more accurate results and first order implicit scheme selected for transient formulation to reduce the computational time ansys fluent 14 5 user s guide 2013 the value of 1 10 6 provided for continuity momentum and turbulence equation convergence criteria mosbahi et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2020 the standard initialization was chosen with all calculations from the velocity inlet 5 results and discussion the five different v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 of 72 mm diameter dr and an aspect ratio ar of 0 7 were tested in a multipurpose tilting water flume with an inlet water velocity vw of 0 3090 m s the performance parameters such as cp and ct with respect to tsr is calculated experimentally using rope type dynamometer test rig the semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade geometries used in the present investigation is modeled using ansys design modeler meshing is done using ansys workbench and unsteady three dimensional numerical simulations is carried out using a sliding mesh technique smt the comparative study of experimental and numerical investigation based on performance parameters with respect to tsr of different v shaped v1 v5 and semi circular blade profiles is presented in fig 6 a and b the curve for numerical simulation is matched with experimental results of all the five v shaped rotor blade configurations and compared with the numerical results of semi circular blade profile the ct of the semi circular and v shaped turbine blades v1 v5 decreases linearly with the increase of tsr as shown in fig 6 a the results of the present investigation are comparable with the previously published data alizadeh et al 2020 golecha et al 2011 ramadan et al 2020 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the cpmax values of v shaped rotor blades with respect to tip speed ratio tsr for experimental and numerical results of v shaped and semi circular blade profiles are listed in table 7 the experimental results of ctmax and cpmax of the turbine blade v4 is 0 25 and 0 22 at a tsr value of 0 87 are shown in fig 6 a and b the results show that ctmax and cpmax of the turbine blade v4 is higher than v1 v2 v3 v5 and semi circular blade profiles as shown in fig 6 a and b the cpmax value of the turbine blade v4 is 19 3 higher than the cpmax value of semi circular blade profile the relative error between experimental and numerical results for the rotor blades v1 v5 are presented in table 7 the relative error is slightly low due to the accuracy of measuring instruments used for the experimental investigations and the time step size of 1 used for the present numerical study elbatran et al 2017 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 higher the time step sizes such as 2 5 5 10 and 15 increases the error between the experimental and numerical results therefore 1 time step value is the optimum time step value shashikumar et al 2020 and the error between the numerical and experimental results is also reduced mosbahi et al 2019 2020a the average error between the experimental and numerical for cpmax is 1 82 therefore the considered numerical models seems to be capable of predicting the effect on the performance of the v shaped blade profiles and the fluid flow features around the turbine of the various v shaped configurations the flow field around the v shaped v1 v5 and semicircular blade profiles is explained by using pressure and velocity contour plots at different angular positions such as θ 0 60 and 120 in the numerical analysis section 5 1 variation of ct with respect to angle of rotation θ of the turbine blades v1 v5 and semicircular fig 7 a shows the variation of coefficient of torque ct with respect to angle of rotation θ of the rotor blade by considering last revolution of the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 for the case of cpmax with respect to expertimental tsr during the rotation turbine blade experiences positive torque ct at some angle of rotation and negative torque ct at some other rotation angle the rotor blade v4 is having a positive coefficient of torque for the angle of rotation θ in the range of θ 65 170 similarly negative coefficient of torque in the range of θ 170 to 240 at a tsr of 0 87 the semi circular v3 and v4 rotor blade profiles exhibits maximum ctmax and minimum ctmin peak coefficient of torque at a tsr of 0 9 0 79 and 0 87 as compared to other blade profiles v1 v2 and v5 the value of ctmax is higher and ctmin is lower for v4 compared to other blade profiles semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 the average value of ct for last revolution of the turbine blade v4 is higher compare to other blade profiles semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 fig 7 b shows the polar plot for semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles with respect to blade rotation θ for the case of cpmax with respect to experimental tsr the rotor blade v4 is having maximum value of ct at θ 120 θ 300 and minimum ct at θ 30 and θ 210 ostos et al 2019 6 numerical analysis in this section numerical analysis of semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 is carried out using sliding mesh technique smt the input conditions applied are explained in section 4 2 table 5 the simulation results for semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 are extracted with respect to the distribution of flow around the semi circular and v blades and maximum values of cp obtained for respective experimental values of tsr 0 91 v1 0 98 v2 0 79 v3 0 87 v4 0 81 v5 and 0 9 semicircular with an inlet water velocity of vw 0 3090 m s 6 1 pressure contour plots fig 8 a r shows the pressure contour plots for semi circular and v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 with different angular positions θ 0 60 and 120 with respect to experimental cpmax the maximum and minimum pressure values are shown on the legend with red and blue colors fig 8 a r shows that pressure drop across the rotor blade from upstream to downstream side of the computational domain the pressure found at the computational domain inlet is uniform whereas the pressure values are found to be higher in the upstream side of the turbine blade and lower pressure at the downstream side the contour plots obtained from numerical studies illustrates fluid flow direction direction of rotor blade motion and several significant zones formed during rotor blade rotation the pressure distribution patterns obtained in the present investigation for semi circular blade profile is similar to the contours obtained in the previous studies fujisawa and gotoh 1992 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b layeghmand et al 2020 ramadan et al 2020 sarma et al 2014 shaheen et al 2015 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the turbine blade extracts power from the flowing water in the channel due to high pressure zone at the front side of the advancing blade side and low pressure zone at the rear side of the advancing blade side helps in creating the pressure drop which effects the rotation of the turbine blade elbatran et al 2017 mosbahi et al 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 fig 8 a r demonstrates that the pressure at the upstream side of the flow near the blade area is highest while the downstream side has a lower pressure area shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the rotation of blade is created due to difference in values of these two pressure areas the pressure distributions around semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 at the different angular position of θ 0 60 and 120 are shown in fig 8 a r at the blade rotation angle θ 0 high pressure zone is observed at the returning blade side and low pressure zone is developed at the downstream side of the advancing blade for semicircular and v1 v5 rotor blade profiles used for the simulation ostos et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 a d g j m and p at rotation angle of θ 60 the distribution of pressure is similar to θ 0 shown in fig 8 b e h k n and q for the rotation angle of θ 120 high pressure zone is developed at the advancing blade side and low pressure zone is developed at the returning blade side ostos et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 c f i l o and r during the rotation of the rotor blades v1 and v2 at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the pressure acting on the returning blade profile side is higher due to higher straight edge profile on the returning blade side as shown in fig 8 e and h it is observed that high pressure acting on the returning blade profile develops more drag and tends to produce greater negative torque ctmin due to two complete straight edges 100 of blade profile v1 and v2 is having 81 of straight edge with a very small arc radius of 0 18l at the returning blade profile side fig 1 b and c hence at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the performance of rotor blades v1 and v2 is reduced due to greater production of ctmin the value of ctmin for the turbine blade v2 is slightly lower than v1 the net cp developed by the turbine blade v1 is lower than v2 for the rotor blades v3 and v4 at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the straight edge length on the returning side of blade profile v3 and v4 decreases by 0 62l 0 43l respectively and the arc radius of blade profile v3 and v4 is slightly increased by 0 37l and 0 56l fig 1 d and e since the turbine blade v3 is having higher straight edge on the returning blade profile than v4 it is observed that pressure acting on the returning blade profile for the turbine blade v3 is higher than v4 because of this slightly higher drag and more negative torque is developed by the turbine blade v3 than the turbine blade v4 therefore net performance of the turbine blade v3 is lower than the turbine blade v4 the rotor blade v5 is having a bigger arc radius of 0 75l and least straight edge length of 0 24l fig 1 f when compared to the rest of the profiles the arc radius of the v5 turbine blade is 4 2 2 02 and 1 4 times v2 v3 and v4 blade profiles at θ 0 the normal frontal area and curvature of the returning blade profile v5 is having slightly flatter surface which is more exposed to high pressure zone when compare to v2 v3 and v4 the width of arc at the returning blade surface is also higher as compared to v2 v3 and v4 blade profiles therefore effective negative torque developed by the returning blade profile for the turbine blade v5 is greater as compared to v2 v3 and v4 similarly due to the greater arc radius and slightly flatter surface at the advancing blade profile the positive torque developed is also lower there is a drastic reduction of the turbine blade s water retention capability during rotation due to slightly flatter surface at the advancing blade therefore the turbine blade v5 will not receive a sufficient load and it stops at threshold load this results in a reduction of net power developed by the turbine blade v5 it is observed from fig 8 o that the difference in pressure acting on the advancing and returning blade is maximum for the turbine blade v4 and it is minimum for the turbine blade v1 fig 8 f when the angle of rotation of the turbine blade is at θ 120 a similar trend of higher pressure difference between advancing and returning blade profiles is observed in the research work carried out for the enhancement of cp as reported by kumar and saini 2017a mosbahi et al 2019 ramadan et al 2020 wahyudi et al 2015 2013 zhang et al 2017b shashikumar et al 2020 the maximum power extraction is obtained for the blade profile v4 when the angle of rotation of the turbine blade is at θ 120 as shown in fig 8 o shashikumar et al 2020 the least power extraction takes place for the case of rotor blade v1 fig 8 f when compared to remaining blade profiles the arc angle of returning blade side of a semi circular blade profile fig 8 a is higher than the v4 blade profile fig 8 m due to more arc in returning blade side of semi circular blade profile high pressure zone exposed to region with more arc is higher and high pressure region adversely affects the returning blade side which in turn reduces cp ramadan et al 2020 as compared to v4 blade profile a greater negative pressure zone is formed near the tip of the advanced blade profile for the rotor blade v4 at an angle of rotation of θ 0 as shown in fig 8 m and behind the advanced blade a wide low pressure zone is created for the rotor blade v4 fig 8 m as compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 blade profiles as shown in fig 8 a d g j and p which helps in increasing the driving torque of the rotor blade v4 ramadan et al 2020 saad el deen et al 2020 due to lower arc at the returning blade profile for the rotor blade v4 as compared to semicircular blade there is a reduction of drag force and therefore negative torque developed by the v4 blade profile is lower than the semi circular blade profile the average torque generated by the turbine blade v4 thus obviously increases as illustrated in fig 7 a and b therefore the rotor blade v4 captures more power and net power developed by the turbine v4 increases at θ 0 the stagnation point on the returning side of the rotor blade v4 fig 8 m is nearer to the tip of the blade as compared to the semi circular blade profile fig 8 a leads to lower negative torque tian et al 2018 because of the greater blade curvature in the semi circular profile it is assumed that flow separation takes place earlier as compared to the v4 blade profile alom and saha 2019 shaheen et al 2015 in addition at θ 120 the area of high pressure zone generated at the advancing side of the blade profile v4 fig 8 o is more compared to semi circular blade profile fig 8 c these difference in the area of pressure zones are the main feature of improving the power produced between the semi circular fig 8 c and v shaped blade design v4 fig 8 o the rotor blade profile v4 helps to guide more fluid into the rotor s advancing blade side to enhance the positive torque generated on it as compared to the semi circular blade profile in this technique the v shaped blade profile plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of the turbine and it is the novelty of the blade profile v4 also the v4 advanced blade profile has two low pressure zones θ 0 and the semi circular blade profile has one low pressure zone as shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 m these two low pressure zones permits v4 blade profile to capture more power than the semi circular blade profile ramadan et al 2020 therefore cp of the v4 blade profile is increased up to 19 3 as compared to conventional semi circular blade profile 6 2 velocity contour plots the velocity contour plots around the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 are shown in fig 9 a r the water velocity is constant at the upstream side till it reaches the rotating zone when the turbine starts to rotate various important zones are developed i e high velocity zone and wake zone from these plots it is observed that high velocity zone is developed at the tip of the advancing side of semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 the wake zone is seen at the downstream side of the turbine blade and flow separation occurs at the tip of the returning blade fujisawa and gotoh 1992 layeghmand et al 2020 ramadan et al 2020 shaheen et al 2015 talukdar et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the zonal velocity distribution observed in the present case matches with the study cases documented by the previous researchers in their respective articles kumar and saini 2017a 2017b ramadan et al 2020 sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a there is a very low velocity zone along with high pressure zone where the flow is semi stagnant and acts as a brake ramadan et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 a d g j m and p it is noticed that when water reaches the turbine blade the velocity of water decreases at the leading edge of blade and wake zone is developed towards the downstream at different rotor angles fujisawa and gotoh 1992 shaheen et al 2015 the angle of rotation of semi circular and five different blade configurations are shown in velocity contour plots at θ 0 60 and 120 respectively corresponding to cpmax the rotor blade v4 has a greater velocity at the tip tip vortices of the advancing blade profile layeghmand et al 2020 which results in a reduced pressure at the advancing blade tip as compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 rotor blade profiles this is because of the advancing side of the rotor blade profile v4 is having two straighter edges and small arc and making it easier for the fluid flow from advancing blade tip tian et al 2018 similarly due to small arc and two straight edges at the returning blade profile v4 which reduces the pressure on the returning blade profile which results in lower negative torque and higher positive torque compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 rotor blade profiles the separation of fluid in semi circular blade profile is higher fig 9 b ramadan et al 2018 as compared to the rotor blade v4 fig 9 n which results in higher performance for the rotor blade v4 the wake formation on the concave side of the semi circular returning blade profile is found to be larger than the v4 blade profile alom and saha 2019 there is a smaller velocity zone on the v4 blade profile s returning side fig 9 m indicating its lower negative torque as compared to the semi circular blade profile fig 9 a this represents that the v4 blade profile is having higher cp as compared to semi circular blade profile due to higher arc radius at the returning side of the semi circular blade profile fig 9 a it acts as the shield in front of the incoming fluid flow which results in a deeper stagnant zone eshagh et al 2020 tian et al 2018 the stagnation point for the semi circular blade profile case is at the midpoint of returning blade side fig 9 a and not nearer to the tip of the blade as compared to the rotor blade v4 fig 9 m tian et al 2018 this increases the pressure on the returning blade profile resulting in greater negative torque for the semi circular blade case as compared to the v4 rotor blade 6 3 performance parameters of the semi circular and v shaped turbine blades v1 v5 the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 are designed and performance analysis is carried out using three dimensional transient simulations by sliding mesh technique smt from the numerical plots obtained from the cfd simulation it is observed that turbine blade torque increases for the rotor blade angle ranging between θ 60 to 170 and the further increase in blade angle ranging from θ 170 to 240 decreases the blade torque the positive coefficient of torque ct obtained when the rotor blade is at an angular position range of θ 60 to 170 is shown in pressure contour plots fig 8 a r and polar plots fig 7 b the ct increases due to the increase in pressure difference between the advancing and returning side of the turbine blade at an angular position from 60o 170 similarly the negative torque attained when the turbine blades are at an angular position range of θ 0 to 60 and θ 170 to 240 the maximum value of ct is reached when the turbine blade is at an angular position of 120 and the minimum at an angular position of θ 30 among the blade profiles semi circular and v1 v5 the ctmax and cpmax is observed for v4 and the minimum value is for the rotor blade v1 7 conclusions a numerical and experimental investigation was carried out on semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 to determine the performance parameters such as cpmax and ctmax with respect to tsr this investigation was primarily focused on small blade profiles with low velocity conditions to generate power for domestic applications the validation of the experimental study was carriedout with a numerical analysis using a sliding mesh technique with the same profile geometry models and operating conditions finally from the results obtained following conclusions are made i the optimum rotor blade profile v4 obtained from the present investigation is having cpmax of 0 22 at a tsr of 0 87 ii from the numerical results it is found that the optimum rotor blade profile v4 having v edge length 0 43 times the original length and an arc radius of 0 56 times the original length is giving better performance when compared with other rotor blade configurations semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 iii as the negative torque developed by the turbine blade v4 is lower due to lower arc at returning blade side the performance of the turbine blade increases and reaches maximum as compared to the semi circular blade profile the cpmax of v4 is 19 3 higher than the semi circular blade profile iv the present work is useful for small scale hydropower generation in a small irrigation channel with low velocity conditions v it is suggested that the present study may be extended for further experimental and cfd investigations on optimum blade profile v4 by varying operating parameters such as overlap ratio or aspect ratio ar at different v angles θ 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 with varying flow

golecha et al 2012 investigated the influence of the separation gap ratio on the interaction between 2 rotors placed in an inline manner it was found that keeping the rotor blade nearer to the first rotor blade increases the interaction and reduces the performance as compared to keeping the turbine far away from the first turbine sarma et al 2014 carried out experimental and 3d numerical studies

studied by patel et al 2019 and the methodology for speed correction was introduced to assess the actual turbine performance the test findings show that there is a wide variation in the cpmax for all tested situations if speed correction is not considered prasad et al 2018 carried out numerical studies using the savonius rotor to evaluate the performance by placing the turbine in a numerical wave tank in the beginning performance of a savonius rotor with a diameter of 1 8 m was measured at mean wave height of 2 00 m and a mean wave duration of 12 68 s the results show that the savonius rotor

conventional savonius hydrokinetic turbine blade using computational fluid dynamics cfd they found that the performance was increased by 40 as compared to conventional savonius turbine at low velocity conditions alizadeh et al 2020 worked on enhancing the semi circular blade profile s performance with the use of a single barrier to depart the fluid from the returning blade profile of the savonius

rotor and single darrieus rotor were also compared based on their performance the results show that cpmax of a hybrid turbine is 37 97 higher than the single darrieus rotor the summary of different studies on savonius blade profiles with water as a working medium reported by various researchers are presented in table 1 the main limitations reported by various researchers are savonius hydrokinetic turbines have lower efficiency due to negative torque developed by the returning blade without augmentation techniques literature review reveals that several experimental and numerical

channel with curved or semi circular shaped blade profiles table 2 shows the optimization techniques and numerical investigation carriedout by various researchers to improve the performance of semicircular blade profiles table 2 shows various blade optimization techniques and numerical investigations carried out by different researchers using commercial software to increase the performance of semi circular blade profiles however studies on performance evaluation of conventional savonius rotor having v shaped blade profiles with varying straight edges and arc radius is not reported in open literature therefore in the present work an experimental study was conducted on different v shaped blade profiles with varying straight edges and arc radius fig 1 a which was validated using a three dimensional unsteady numerical investigation by ansys fluent 14 5 the modified blade profiles selected in this study are expected to reduce the negative torque generated at the returning blade profile by reducing the width of arc and providing the two tangent straight edges to the arc on the returning blade profile in order to reduce the drag the modified v shaped rotor blade profiles with small arc and two tangent straight edges give the path to the movement of fluid towards advancing blade profile were expected to increase the torque developed by the advancing blade side hence there is a need to study the influence of rotor blade with different v shaped blade profiles by varying straight edges and arc radius experimentally and numerically the numerical and experimental results of v shaped blade profiles are compared with the numerical result of the semi circular blade profile using a similar geometric parameter the following are the objectives of the present work i to conduct an experimental study of five different configurations of v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 to v5 in a multipurpose tilting water flume ii to study the performance of the above rotor blade configurations using three dimensional unsteady numerical simulations using sliding mesh technique smt and compare with numerical results of the semi circular blade profile iii to study the variation of coefficient of torque ct with respect to the angle of rotation θ of the turbine blade for semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade configurations using polar plots iv to study the flow

pumps and water flow rate is measured by using rectangular notch fixed at the outlet of the flume and coefficient of discharge cd is 0 6 the experimental test rig is placed 3 6 m away from the inlet of the tilting flume where fully developed flow is available the kinetic energy of the flowing water and drag force difference between advancing and returning blade profiles drives the rotor blades a rope break type of dynamometer fig 2 b is used for loading the rotor shaft using a weighing pan spring balance and pulleys the torque generated by the rotor is determined by gradually applying the

rectangular domain was made by using the enclosure with a nonuniform cushion on the rotor blade and rotating zones respectively the interface created between rotating zone and stationary zone using boolean operation the rotor blade is placed at a distance of three times the diameter of the turbine blade from the front and rear faces of the computational domain sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 and the width of the domain is same as that of a width of the flume wc 215 mm 4 2 meshing the geometric model is imported to ansys workbench and the tetrahedral mesh applied for both rotating and stationary zones fine mesh is given to the rotating zone to capture the detailed physics and the coarse mesh is provided to the stationary zone mosbahi et al 2019 2020a inflation has given to blade profile with a first layer thickness of 0 04 mm and a growth rate of 1 2 to achieve a better mesh resolution and to study the boundary layer effect as shown in fig 4 it is found that non dimensional wall distance y value is less than 1 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a talukdar et al 2018 the quality of mesh given in terms of orthogonality skewness and aspect ratio of 0 86 0 21 and 2 1 respectively all these values are in the acceptable range ansys fluent 14 5 user s guide 2013 sarma et al 2014 4 3 boundary conditions after the completion of meshing using ansys workbench the various essential boundary conditions are given to the computational domain the front face of the three dimensional computational domain is considered as a velocity inlet vw 0 3090 m s and the rear face of the domain is taken as a pressure outlet boundary condition zero gauge pressure kumar and saini 2017a 2017b sarma et al 2014 the right left and bottom face of the domain is considered as a wall no slip wall bc boundary condition elbatran et al 2017 john et al 2020 saini and saini 2018 2020a 2020b sarma et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 the top surface of the computational domain considered as symmetry boundary conditions elbatran et al 2017 john et al 2020 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b mosbahi et al 2019 2020a 2020b sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 the different boundary conditions used in the present simulation are listed in table 5 4 4 grid independence study grid independence study was carried out for a different number of mesh element sizes such as 794124 962432 1159705 1250103 1332064 and 1462049 as the number of mesh elements increases from 794124 to 962432 there is a change in the value of ct with respect to tsr similarly from 962432 to 1159705 the difference in the value of ct is decreased and with the increase in number of mesh elements from 1159705 1250103 1332064 to 1462049 the change in the value of ct is negligible therefore the 1159705 mesh elements are considered as a baseline and optimum number of mesh elements for the present simulation to reduce the computational time fig 5 a shows the variation of ct with respect to the angle of rotation of the turbine blade b expanded view of ctmax therefore the element size of 1159705 is taken for the present numerical simulation to reduce computational time the values of ct for a varying number of mesh elements and percentage difference is presented in table 6 the time step of 1 turbine blade rotate 1 in each time step is taken for the present numerical simulation based on the previous literature elbatran et al 2017 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 and the average value ct is calculated by taking the average value of last one revolution of the turbine blade based on the results of earlier studies ghosh et al 2015 goh et al 2016 kerikous and thévenin 2019a 2019b kumar and saini 2017a 2017b mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 4 5 governing equations the governing equations 9 13 for the unsteady viscous and incompressible turbulent flow are the navier stokes equations which can be written in the following form elbatran et al 2017 malalasekera 2007

s k is the turbulence kinetic energy γk and γ ω are the effective diffusivity for k and ω gk is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients and g ω represents the generation of ω yk and yω represents the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence while dω is the cross diffusion term 4 6 selection of the turbulence model various turbulence models available are based on the reynolds number re and configuration of the turbine blade to simulate the flow such as spalart allmaras model 1 equation realizable k ε model rng k ε model standard k ω model talukdar et al 2018 standard k ε model and sst k ω model can be used for the simulation of a turbine blade the standard k ε model is a simple turbulence model and which is more appropriate for the computation of turbulent flow this model provides better findings than spalart allmaras in turbine blade simulation studies talukdar et al 2018 furthermore it is found that both the realizable model and the rng k ε model have predicted significantly better results as compared to standard k ε and spalart allmaras model talukdar et al 2018 the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation eddy viscosity model that integrates the benefits of both k ε and k ω formulation for free stream flow and rotor blade boundary layer it is also exhibiting smaller resistant to free stream conditions as compared to other turbulence models the sst k ω model is utilized around the flow field because it is well suitable for simulating flow in the viscous sublayer wherever greater accuracy is required at the boundary layer the sst k ω model captures an extensive type of flows such as flow with adverse pressure gradients flow over airfoils rotating flows and low reynolds number re flow it has already been used extensively in similar studies by various researchers kacprzak et al 2013 mereu et al 2017 roy and ducoin 2016 shaheen et al 2015 talukdar et al 2018 hence in this study the unsteady sst k ω turbulence model is used for three dimensional numerical simulation 4 7 simulation method three dimensional transient pressure based solver with absolute velocity formulation was used for the present case it is found that the achieved dimensionless wall distance y value is less than 1 mosbahi et al 2019 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the turbulence model used is coupled two equation sst k ω model based on previous research carried out by other researchers to capture the high separation levels and adverse pressure gradients around the blade wall kacprzak et al 2013 mereu et al 2017 roy and ducoin 2016 shaheen et al 2015 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 therefore the flow is resolved at the wall boundaries of the turbine blade to approximate the dimensionless velocity as a linear function of y the higher y leads to decreased simulation precision as the wall functions recommended by ansys will not solve the boundary layer flow problems the density ρw and viscosity of water μw is taken as 998 2 kg m3 and 0 001003 kg m s stationary zone and rotating zones are constructed using cell zone conditions and angular velocity ω is given to the rotating zone based on the experimental tsr of the rotor and axis of rotation of the rotor are y axis boundary conditions provided with an inlet velocity of 0 3090 m s and zero gauge pressure is given to the pressure outlet the various reference values are very significant in calculating the performance parameters such as ct and cp the various parameters required for reference values in ansys fluent 14 5 are the area of the turbine blade ar hrdr length l of the turbine radius of turbine blade 0 5dr viscosity μw density ρw of the water and all the calculations computed from the velocity inlet to solve unsteady three dimensional equations various solvers are available in the ansys fluent 14 5 software such as simple simplec and piso in that semi implicit scheme for pressure linked equation simple scheme uses a velocity pressure correction relationship to impose mass conservation and obtain pressure field talukdar et al 2018 this scheme ensures better stability of a solution through the combination of pressure and velocity on the other hand the simple scheme is computationally economical as compared to other schemes the convergence is quicker roy and ducoin 2016 and the spatial discretization technique selected was least square cell method through second order pressure and momentum equation the second order upwind scheme has taken for turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate to achieve more accurate results and first order implicit scheme selected for transient formulation to reduce the computational time ansys fluent 14 5 user s guide 2013 the value of 1 10 6 provided for continuity momentum and turbulence equation convergence criteria mosbahi et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2020 the standard initialization was chosen with all calculations from the velocity inlet 5 results and discussion the five different v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 of 72 mm diameter dr and an aspect ratio ar of 0 7 were tested in a multipurpose tilting water flume with an inlet water velocity vw of 0 3090 m s the performance parameters such as cp and ct with respect to tsr is calculated experimentally using rope type dynamometer test rig the semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade geometries used in the present investigation is modeled using ansys design modeler meshing is done using ansys workbench and unsteady three dimensional numerical simulations is carried out using a sliding mesh technique smt the comparative study of experimental and numerical investigation based on performance parameters with respect to tsr of different v shaped v1 v5 and semi circular blade profiles is presented in fig 6 a and b the curve for numerical simulation is matched with experimental results of all the five v shaped rotor blade configurations and compared with the numerical results of semi circular blade profile the ct of the semi circular and v shaped turbine blades v1 v5 decreases linearly with the increase of tsr as shown in fig 6 a the results of the present investigation are comparable with the previously published data alizadeh et al 2020 golecha et al 2011 ramadan et al 2020 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the cpmax values of v shaped rotor blades with respect to tip speed ratio tsr for experimental and numerical results of v shaped and semi circular blade profiles are listed in table 7 the experimental results of ctmax and cpmax of the turbine blade v4 is 0 25 and 0 22 at a tsr value of 0 87 are shown in fig 6 a and b the results show that ctmax and cpmax of the turbine blade v4 is higher than v1 v2 v3 v5 and semi circular blade profiles as shown in fig 6 a and b the cpmax value of the turbine blade v4 is 19 3 higher than the cpmax value of semi circular blade profile the relative error between experimental and numerical results for the rotor blades v1 v5 are presented in table 7 the relative error is slightly low due to the accuracy of measuring instruments used for the experimental investigations and the time step size of 1 used for the present numerical study elbatran et al 2017 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 higher the time step sizes such as 2 5 5 10 and 15 increases the error between the experimental and numerical results therefore 1 time step value is the optimum time step value shashikumar et al 2020 and the error between the numerical and experimental results is also reduced mosbahi et al 2019 2020a the average error between the experimental and numerical for cpmax is 1 82 therefore the considered numerical models seems to be capable of predicting the effect on the performance of the v shaped blade profiles and the fluid flow features around the turbine of the various v shaped configurations the flow field around the v shaped v1 v5 and semicircular blade profiles is explained by using pressure and velocity contour plots at different angular positions such as θ 0 60 and 120 in the numerical analysis section 5 1 variation of ct with respect to angle of rotation θ of the turbine blades v1 v5 and semicircular fig 7 a shows the variation of coefficient of torque ct with respect to angle of rotation θ of the rotor blade by considering last revolution of the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 for the case of cpmax with respect to expertimental tsr during the rotation turbine blade experiences positive torque ct at some angle of rotation and negative torque ct at some other rotation angle the rotor blade v4 is having a positive coefficient of torque for the angle of rotation θ in the range of θ 65 170 similarly negative coefficient of torque in the range of θ 170 to 240 at a tsr of 0 87 the semi circular v3 and v4 rotor blade profiles exhibits maximum ctmax and minimum ctmin peak coefficient of torque at a tsr of 0 9 0 79 and 0 87 as compared to other blade profiles v1 v2 and v5 the value of ctmax is higher and ctmin is lower for v4 compared to other blade profiles semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 the average value of ct for last revolution of the turbine blade v4 is higher compare to other blade profiles semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 fig 7 b shows the polar plot for semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles with respect to blade rotation θ for the case of cpmax with respect to experimental tsr the rotor blade v4 is having maximum value of ct at θ 120 θ 300 and minimum ct at θ 30 and θ 210 ostos et al 2019 6 numerical analysis in this section numerical analysis of semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 is carried out using sliding mesh technique smt the input conditions applied are explained in section 4 2 table 5 the simulation results for semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 are extracted with respect to the distribution of flow around the semi circular and v blades and maximum values of cp obtained for respective experimental values of tsr 0 91 v1 0 98 v2 0 79 v3 0 87 v4 0 81 v5 and 0 9 semicircular with an inlet water velocity of vw 0 3090 m s 6 1 pressure contour plots fig 8 a r shows the pressure contour plots for semi circular and v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 with different angular positions θ 0 60 and 120 with respect to experimental cpmax the maximum and minimum pressure values are shown on the legend with red and blue colors fig 8 a r shows that pressure drop across the rotor blade from upstream to downstream side of the computational domain the pressure found at the computational domain inlet is uniform whereas the pressure values are found to be higher in the upstream side of the turbine blade and lower pressure at the downstream side the contour plots obtained from numerical studies illustrates fluid flow direction direction of rotor blade motion and several significant zones formed during rotor blade rotation the pressure distribution patterns obtained in the present investigation for semi circular blade profile is similar to the contours obtained in the previous studies fujisawa and gotoh 1992 kumar and saini 2017a 2017b layeghmand et al 2020 ramadan et al 2020 sarma et al 2014 shaheen et al 2015 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the turbine blade extracts power from the flowing water in the channel due to high pressure zone at the front side of the advancing blade side and low pressure zone at the rear side of the advancing blade side helps in creating the pressure drop which effects the rotation of the turbine blade elbatran et al 2017 mosbahi et al 2020a shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 fig 8 a r demonstrates that the pressure at the upstream side of the flow near the blade area is highest while the downstream side has a lower pressure area shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 the rotation of blade is created due to difference in values of these two pressure areas the pressure distributions around semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 at the different angular position of θ 0 60 and 120 are shown in fig 8 a r at the blade rotation angle θ 0 high pressure zone is observed at the returning blade side and low pressure zone is developed at the downstream side of the advancing blade for semicircular and v1 v5 rotor blade profiles used for the simulation ostos et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 a d g j m and p at rotation angle of θ 60 the distribution of pressure is similar to θ 0 shown in fig 8 b e h k n and q for the rotation angle of θ 120 high pressure zone is developed at the advancing blade side and low pressure zone is developed at the returning blade side ostos et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 c f i l o and r during the rotation of the rotor blades v1 and v2 at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the pressure acting on the returning blade profile side is higher due to higher straight edge profile on the returning blade side as shown in fig 8 e and h it is observed that high pressure acting on the returning blade profile develops more drag and tends to produce greater negative torque ctmin due to two complete straight edges 100 of blade profile v1 and v2 is having 81 of straight edge with a very small arc radius of 0 18l at the returning blade profile side fig 1 b and c hence at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the performance of rotor blades v1 and v2 is reduced due to greater production of ctmin the value of ctmin for the turbine blade v2 is slightly lower than v1 the net cp developed by the turbine blade v1 is lower than v2 for the rotor blades v3 and v4 at an angle of rotation of θ 60 the straight edge length on the returning side of blade profile v3 and v4 decreases by 0 62l 0 43l respectively and the arc radius of blade profile v3 and v4 is slightly increased by 0 37l and 0 56l fig 1 d and e since the turbine blade v3 is having higher straight edge on the returning blade profile than v4 it is observed that pressure acting on the returning blade profile for the turbine blade v3 is higher than v4 because of this slightly higher drag and more negative torque is developed by the turbine blade v3 than the turbine blade v4 therefore net performance of the turbine blade v3 is lower than the turbine blade v4 the rotor blade v5 is having a bigger arc radius of 0 75l and least straight edge length of 0 24l fig 1 f when compared to the rest of the profiles the arc radius of the v5 turbine blade is 4 2 2 02 and 1 4 times v2 v3 and v4 blade profiles at θ 0 the normal frontal area and curvature of the returning blade profile v5 is having slightly flatter surface which is more exposed to high pressure zone when compare to v2 v3 and v4 the width of arc at the returning blade surface is also higher as compared to v2 v3 and v4 blade profiles therefore effective negative torque developed by the returning blade profile for the turbine blade v5 is greater as compared to v2 v3 and v4 similarly due to the greater arc radius and slightly flatter surface at the advancing blade profile the positive torque developed is also lower there is a drastic reduction of the turbine blade s water retention capability during rotation due to slightly flatter surface at the advancing blade therefore the turbine blade v5 will not receive a sufficient load and it stops at threshold load this results in a reduction of net power developed by the turbine blade v5 it is observed from fig 8 o that the difference in pressure acting on the advancing and returning blade is maximum for the turbine blade v4 and it is minimum for the turbine blade v1 fig 8 f when the angle of rotation of the turbine blade is at θ 120 a similar trend of higher pressure difference between advancing and returning blade profiles is observed in the research work carried out for the enhancement of cp as reported by kumar and saini 2017a mosbahi et al 2019 ramadan et al 2020 wahyudi et al 2015 2013 zhang et al 2017b shashikumar et al 2020 the maximum power extraction is obtained for the blade profile v4 when the angle of rotation of the turbine blade is at θ 120 as shown in fig 8 o shashikumar et al 2020 the least power extraction takes place for the case of rotor blade v1 fig 8 f when compared to remaining blade profiles the arc angle of returning blade side of a semi circular blade profile fig 8 a is higher than the v4 blade profile fig 8 m due to more arc in returning blade side of semi circular blade profile high pressure zone exposed to region with more arc is higher and high pressure region adversely affects the returning blade side which in turn reduces cp ramadan et al 2020 as compared to v4 blade profile a greater negative pressure zone is formed near the tip of the advanced blade profile for the rotor blade v4 at an angle of rotation of θ 0 as shown in fig 8 m and behind the advanced blade a wide low pressure zone is created for the rotor blade v4 fig 8 m as compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 blade profiles as shown in fig 8 a d g j and p which helps in increasing the driving torque of the rotor blade v4 ramadan et al 2020 saad el deen et al 2020 due to lower arc at the returning blade profile for the rotor blade v4 as compared to semicircular blade there is a reduction of drag force and therefore negative torque developed by the v4 blade profile is lower than the semi circular blade profile the average torque generated by the turbine blade v4 thus obviously increases as illustrated in fig 7 a and b therefore the rotor blade v4 captures more power and net power developed by the turbine v4 increases at θ 0 the stagnation point on the returning side of the rotor blade v4 fig 8 m is nearer to the tip of the blade as compared to the semi circular blade profile fig 8 a leads to lower negative torque tian et al 2018 because of the greater blade curvature in the semi circular profile it is assumed that flow separation takes place earlier as compared to the v4 blade profile alom and saha 2019 shaheen et al 2015 in addition at θ 120 the area of high pressure zone generated at the advancing side of the blade profile v4 fig 8 o is more compared to semi circular blade profile fig 8 c these difference in the area of pressure zones are the main feature of improving the power produced between the semi circular fig 8 c and v shaped blade design v4 fig 8 o the rotor blade profile v4 helps to guide more fluid into the rotor s advancing blade side to enhance the positive torque generated on it as compared to the semi circular blade profile in this technique the v shaped blade profile plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of the turbine and it is the novelty of the blade profile v4 also the v4 advanced blade profile has two low pressure zones θ 0 and the semi circular blade profile has one low pressure zone as shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 m these two low pressure zones permits v4 blade profile to capture more power than the semi circular blade profile ramadan et al 2020 therefore cp of the v4 blade profile is increased up to 19 3 as compared to conventional semi circular blade profile 6 2 velocity contour plots the velocity contour plots around the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade profiles v1 v5 are shown in fig 9 a r the water velocity is constant at the upstream side till it reaches the rotating zone when the turbine starts to rotate various important zones are developed i e high velocity zone and wake zone from these plots it is observed that high velocity zone is developed at the tip of the advancing side of semi circular and v shaped blade profiles v1 v5 the wake zone is seen at the downstream side of the turbine blade and flow separation occurs at the tip of the returning blade fujisawa and gotoh 1992 layeghmand et al 2020 ramadan et al 2020 shaheen et al 2015 talukdar et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the zonal velocity distribution observed in the present case matches with the study cases documented by the previous researchers in their respective articles kumar and saini 2017a 2017b ramadan et al 2020 sarma et al 2014 shashikumar et al 2020 talukdar et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a there is a very low velocity zone along with high pressure zone where the flow is semi stagnant and acts as a brake ramadan et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 a d g j m and p it is noticed that when water reaches the turbine blade the velocity of water decreases at the leading edge of blade and wake zone is developed towards the downstream at different rotor angles fujisawa and gotoh 1992 shaheen et al 2015 the angle of rotation of semi circular and five different blade configurations are shown in velocity contour plots at θ 0 60 and 120 respectively corresponding to cpmax the rotor blade v4 has a greater velocity at the tip tip vortices of the advancing blade profile layeghmand et al 2020 which results in a reduced pressure at the advancing blade tip as compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 rotor blade profiles this is because of the advancing side of the rotor blade profile v4 is having two straighter edges and small arc and making it easier for the fluid flow from advancing blade tip tian et al 2018 similarly due to small arc and two straight edges at the returning blade profile v4 which reduces the pressure on the returning blade profile which results in lower negative torque and higher positive torque compared to semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 rotor blade profiles the separation of fluid in semi circular blade profile is higher fig 9 b ramadan et al 2018 as compared to the rotor blade v4 fig 9 n which results in higher performance for the rotor blade v4 the wake formation on the concave side of the semi circular returning blade profile is found to be larger than the v4 blade profile alom and saha 2019 there is a smaller velocity zone on the v4 blade profile s returning side fig 9 m indicating its lower negative torque as compared to the semi circular blade profile fig 9 a this represents that the v4 blade profile is having higher cp as compared to semi circular blade profile due to higher arc radius at the returning side of the semi circular blade profile fig 9 a it acts as the shield in front of the incoming fluid flow which results in a deeper stagnant zone eshagh et al 2020 tian et al 2018 the stagnation point for the semi circular blade profile case is at the midpoint of returning blade side fig 9 a and not nearer to the tip of the blade as compared to the rotor blade v4 fig 9 m tian et al 2018 this increases the pressure on the returning blade profile resulting in greater negative torque for the semi circular blade case as compared to the v4 rotor blade 6 3 performance parameters of the semi circular and v shaped turbine blades v1 v5 the semi circular and v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 are designed and performance analysis is carried out using three dimensional transient simulations by sliding mesh technique smt from the numerical plots obtained from the cfd simulation it is observed that turbine blade torque increases for the rotor blade angle ranging between θ 60 to 170 and the further increase in blade angle ranging from θ 170 to 240 decreases the blade torque the positive coefficient of torque ct obtained when the rotor blade is at an angular position range of θ 60 to 170 is shown in pressure contour plots fig 8 a r and polar plots fig 7 b the ct increases due to the increase in pressure difference between the advancing and returning side of the turbine blade at an angular position from 60o 170 similarly the negative torque attained when the turbine blades are at an angular position range of θ 0 to 60 and θ 170 to 240 the maximum value of ct is reached when the turbine blade is at an angular position of 120 and the minimum at an angular position of θ 30 among the blade profiles semi circular and v1 v5 the ctmax and cpmax is observed for v4 and the minimum value is for the rotor blade v1 7 conclusions a numerical and experimental investigation was carried out on semi circular and five different v shaped rotor blade configurations v1 v5 to determine the performance parameters such as cpmax and ctmax with respect to tsr this investigation was primarily focused on small blade profiles with low velocity conditions to generate power for domestic applications the validation of the experimental study was carriedout with a numerical analysis using a sliding mesh technique with the same profile geometry models and operating conditions finally from the results obtained following conclusions are made i the optimum rotor blade profile v4 obtained from the present investigation is having cpmax of 0 22 at a tsr of 0 87 ii from the numerical results it is found that the optimum rotor blade profile v4 having v edge length 0 43 times the original length and an arc radius of 0 56 times the original length is giving better performance when compared with other rotor blade configurations semi circular v1 v2 v3 and v5 iii as the negative torque developed by the turbine blade v4 is lower due to lower arc at returning blade side the performance of the turbine blade increases and reaches maximum as compared to the semi circular blade profile the cpmax of v4 is 19 3 higher than the semi circular blade profile iv the present work is useful for small scale hydropower generation in a small irrigation channel with low velocity conditions v it is suggested that the present study may be extended for further experimental and cfd investigations on optimum blade profile v4 by varying operating parameters such as overlap ratio or aspect ratio ar at different v angles θ 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 with varying flow

20973,the marine riser is the key equipment connecting the floating platform with the seabed wellhead and the vortex induced vibration viv is the main cause of its fatigue damage which contains complex and substantial dynamics content marine risers are operated for a long time as time goes by marine organisms will attach on the marine riser surfaces thus significantly affect their surface

explored to provide a scientific theoretical basis and a practical engineering method for vibration control of a rough marine riser keywords fluid structure interaction vortex induced vibration marine riser numerical simulation surface roughness 1 introduction marine riser is a key part of the deep sea oil and gas exploitation system it is an important transportation component connecting the submarine oil field and the offshore platform and is known as the lifeline of offshore oil vortex induced vibration viv is a typical phenomenon of the riser dynamic response when vortex shedding frequency is near the riser natural frequency the vortex shedding frequency no longer increases with the inflow velocity but follows the natural vibration frequency of the riser structure this phenomenon is called lock in at this moment the vibration response amplitudes of the riser in the streamwise and transverse direction increase significantly often cause fatigue damage or even failure of the riser williamson and govardhan 2008 marine risers are basic long term operation components over time marine organisms will adsorb on the surface of the riser and directly affect its surface roughness when the marine riser is at a high reynolds number the effect of surface roughness on the riser viv needs to be further studied and discussed some studies indicate that compared with a smooth riser with the increase of the surface roughness of the riser the frequency of the vortex shedding from the rear edge of the rough riser increased kiu et al 2011 meanwhile the starting point of the riser lock in interval tends to advance so does the ending point of the lock in interval and the lock in interval tends to shrink gao et al 2015 the increase of the vortex shedding frequency of the rough riser may directly accelerate the fatigue damage or even the failure of the riser reduce the safety during the riser operation and increase the possibility of causing significant economic losses and serious environmental pollution further research on the mechanism of the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of the riser will help us to accurately predict the viv response of the marine riser and improve the safety of the riser early studies on the marine riser viv mainly started from an elastic smooth cylindrical structure the most representative ones who systematically studied the elastic smooth cylindrical cylinders viv with different mass ratios govardhan and williamson 2000 2002 2004 khalak and williamson 1999 found out characteristics of the elastic cylindrical cylinders viv such as lock in hysteresis jumping and intermittent interestingly jauvtis and williamson jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 found that when the mass ratio m 7 0 the amplitude of the vibration response in the transverse direction of the two degree of freedom 2 dof cylinder was equivalent to that in the transverse direction of the 1 dof cylinder when the mass ratio m 2 6 the vibration response amplitude of the 2 dof cylinder viv in the transverse direction would generate the super upper branch pattern with maximum vibration response amplitude reaching 1 5 d d is the diameter of the cylinder accompanied by the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern many researchers zhou et al 1999 han et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 guilmineau and queutey 2004 wanderley et al 2008 pan et al 2007 gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2010 kang et al 2017 have carried out the numerical simulation of a smooth cylindrical cylinder viv by using the cfd method based on physical experimental research the characteristics of an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv such as response branches the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch vortex shedding pattern and vibration frequency have been successfully captured however at present the research on the riser viv mainly focuses on smooth cylinder while rough cylinder viv is rarely studied over time different sizes roughness has been formed on the riser surface during the service period the surface roughness of the marine riser is generally between 1 10 4 2 10 2 gao et al 2015 in recent years effects of surface roughness on hydrodynamic characteristics especially vortex induced vibration of marine risers have been studied according to the existing theoretical research and experimental results achenbach 2015 nakamura and tomonari 1982 bearman and harvey 1993 okajima et al 1999 allen and henning 2001 bernitsas et al 2008 gao et al 2018a 2018b the influence of surface roughness on the dynamic characteristics of a riser cannot be ignored as for the study of the surface roughness of the riser early studies mainly focused on the flow field around a stationary cylinder with different roughnesses in the air environment achenbach 2015 nakamura and tomonari 1982 bearman and harvey 1993 okajima et al 1999 achenbach 2015 found that as the surface roughness of a fixed cylinder increases its boundary layer separation points gradually move to the rear edge of the cylinder leading to a faster transition from laminar to turbulent flow when the boundary layer on the surface of a cylinder transitions from laminar to turbulent flow the resistance of the cylinder suddenly drops under the critical reynolds number causing resistance crisis with the increase of surface roughness the critical reynolds number corresponding to the resistance crisis decreases nakamura and tomonari 1982 measured the mean pressure distribution and strouhal number st of smooth cylinders the cylinders with dispersed roughness and the cylinders with a rough narrow band in the range of reynolds number 4 0 l04 to 1 7 l06 respectively a pressure distribution similarity parameter related to a cylinder with dispersed roughness is proposed in a supercritical range it was also observed that when the surface roughness of the cylinder exceeds 0 003 the critical and supercritical regions were reduced to a very small region bearman and harvey 1993 discussed the influence of the fixed cylinder surface roughness on st number and found that within the subcritical reynolds number range the st number of rough cylinders was higher than that of the smooth cylinder but the trend was opposite after entering the critical reynolds number okajima et al 1999 found that within the subcritical reynolds number range the amplitude of a rough cylinder viv is smaller than that of a smooth cylinder however in the critical reynolds number range viv amplitude of the rough cylinder is greater than that of the smooth cylinder at present there are many experimental studies on the rough cylinder in the air but few on the characteristics of the rough cylinder in the water allen and henning 2001 studied the influence of surface roughness on the cylinder viv within the critical and supercritical reynolds number the results show that the surface roughness has no significant effect on the viv response this is because in the critical reynolds number range the resistance of a smooth cylinder is low and the smooth cylinder viv is almost nonexistent kiu et al 2011 studied the influence of surface roughness on the response amplitude and hydrodynamic force of the cylinder viv the results show that with the increase of the surface roughness the maximum response amplitude and the maximum average resistance coefficient of the cylinder viv gradually decrease and approach to a certain constant value the starting point of cylinder structure lock in interval gradually delayed but with high roughness the width of the lock in interval decreased obviously also the st number increased slightly with the increase of surface roughness bernitasas et al 2008 studied an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv with rough bands through physical experiments the results show that the flow characteristics of the fluid near the cylinder depend on the width roughness size of sand grains and location of the rough bands the roughness magnitude and distribution can be used to enhance or restrain the viv amplitude and increase or decrease the range of the lock in interval respectively gao et al 2015 studied the influence of surface roughness on the riser viv by using a physical experiment method and compared the resistance lift force tension vortex shedding frequency vibration frequency and displacement response of the risers with different surface roughness the results showed that in a low reduced velocity range the lock in of riser in the streamwise direction occurs earlier than that in the transverse direction so the viv response in the streamwise direction is greater than that in the transverse direction compared with the smooth riser the rough riser has smaller vibration response narrower lock in interval and higher vortex shedding frequency gao et al 2018a 2018b carried out a numerical simulation study on an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv with 2 dof considering the rough surface at a low reynolds number re 5000 and analyzed the influence of different surface roughness on the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch as well as the corresponding wake vortex shedding patterns from the perspective of research status the current research work mainly focuses on the influence of surface roughness on the hydrodynamic force of a fixed cylinder in air or water but there are few studies on the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of an elastic cylinder and even fewer research results on the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of a three dimensional 3d riser in terms of the numerical simulation research of a rough cylinder some numerical simulations have been carried out on the rough cylinder viv in the range of low reynolds number re 5000 gao et al 2018a 2018b however no further study on the high reynolds number range at a high reynolds number does a rough cylinder produce a super upper branch what is the effect of surface roughness on super upper branch what about the wake vortex shedding pattern in view of the above background based on the bidirectional fluid structure coupling method of cfd and csd this study takes a rough cylinder as the research object and systematically studies the viv characteristics of a rough cylinder at a high reynolds number effects of surface roughness on the dynamic characteristics vibration response vibration trajectory and wake vortex shedding pattern of a rough cylinder are analyzed the unique nonlinear dynamic behavior of a rough cylinder viv is revealed and the mechanism of influence of surface roughness on the rough cylinder viv is explored 2 mathematical model 2 1 fluid governing equations in this study the unsteady and incompressible rans equation was used to solve the hydrodynamic characteristics of the fluid domain the rans equation is written as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j

respectively and time s ij is the mean strain rate tensor that is computed by equation 3 in the present work equations 1 and 2 are solved by adopting the rans code packaged in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software fluent the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is used for modeling the reynolds stress tensor u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor defined by equation 4 the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the pressure staggering option presto scheme and quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinetics quick are used to discretize pressure and momentum respectively a second order upwind scheme is used for the turbulent kinetic energy and a first order upwind for specific dissipation a second order implicit method is used for the time domain 2 2 transient dynamic equations the dynamic equations of vibration of a cylindrical structure are as follows 5 m x t c x t k x t f x t 6 m y t c y t k y t f y t where x is the displacement in the streamwise direction y is the displacement in the transverse direction m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness respectively the relationship between damping c and damping ratio ξ is c 2 ξ k m m a in which m a is added mass all these parameters are consistent with the experiment reported by jauvits and williamson 2004 f x t and f y t are the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction respectively equations 5 and 6 are solved by using the newmark β method the concrete solution process is illustrated with the example of transverse vibration of cylinder the key of newmark β method is to establish the recursion relation from the state variables y t y t y t at time t to the state variables y t δ t y t δ t y t δ t at time t δt thus starting from the initial state variables y 0 y 0 y 0 at time t 0 the state vector of each time can be calculated step by step according to equation 6 the state variables y t δ t y t δ t and y t δ t at time t δt satisfies the following relation 7 m y t δ t c y t δ t k y t δ t f y t δ t according to the assumption of newmark β method the velocity and displacement at time t δt are as follows 8 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t 9 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t 2 equations 7 9 are the basic equations for newmark β method where γ 0 5 and β 0 25 in the actual calculation we can first get y t δ t in terms of y t δ t from equation 9 and then substitute the equation 8 to get y t δ t in terms of y t δ t substitute them all into equation 7 to get a system of equations with only y t δ t and solve it to get the displacement variable y t δ t of at time t δt then substituted y t δ t into equations 8 and 9 to obtain the velocity and acceleration at time t δt after the above calculation the displacement at time t δt can be calculated as follows 10 k y t δ t f y t δ t in equation 10 f y is the payload in the y direction and k is the effective stiffness the specific expression is as follows 11 f y t δ t f y t δ t m α 0 y t α 2 y t α 3 y t c α 1 y t α 4 y t α 5 y t 12 k k α 0 m α 1 c the acceleration and velocity at time t δt are as follows 13 y t δ t α 0 y t δ t y t α 2 y t α 3 y t 14 y t δ t y t α 6 y t α 7 y t δ t in the above equation α 0 1 β δ t 2 α 1 γ β δ t α 2 1 β δ t α 3 1 2 β 1 α 4 γ β 1 α 5 δ t 2 γ β 2 α 6 δ t 1 γ and α 7 γ δ t 2 3 law of the wall modified for roughness the equivalent sand roughness model proposed by schlichting and gersten 1997 is shown in fig 1 in the figure u is the incoming flow velocity k s is the roughness surface height and the shaded part represents the structural surface the equivalent sand roughness model uses a layer of tightly packed spheres to represent the equivalent sand roughness surface the spheres have the average roughness surface height blevins and coughran 2009 kiu and stappenbelt 2011 chang et al 2011 all adopted the equivalent sand model to conduct physical experiments to study the viv characteristics of a rough cylindrical cylinder and obtained ideal experimental results a viscous sublayer can only be fully formed on a hydraulically smooth wall in the transition region of the rough wall if the roughness element is slightly higher than the viscous sublayer then the roughness element will interfere with the viscous sublayer and the viscous sublayer will be destroyed at this point the viscous effect of the fluid will be low or even negligible so the effect of roughness on the wall y needs to be corrected assuming that the roughness has a blocking effect which is about 50 of the rough surface height k s then y y k s 2 under the consideration of the roughness the cylinder roughness will affect the boundary layer flow and have a direct impact on the vortex shedding frequency separation point and hydrodynamic force the wall correction algorithm proposed by jimenez 2004 blocken et al 2007 and pattanapol et al 2007 estimated the shear stress of a rough cylindrical cylinder wall the specific equation is as follow 15 u p u τ w ρ 1 κ ln e ρ u y p μ δ b where u p is the mean velocity tangential to the wall of the center point p of the wall adjacent grid y p is the distance between the rough surface and the center of the adjacent grid u c μ 0 25 k 0 5 c μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and k is the turbulent kinetic energy at the center of an adjacent grid on a rough surface empirical constant e 9 793 von karman constant κ 0 41 δb is used to correct the deviation of the logarithmic law origin caused by the roughness its value is determined by the type of rough surface including sand rivet thread rib wire mesh etc and the height k s of rough surface k s has a dimensionless value of k s ρ k s u μ currently no δb function expression is universally applicable to all types of rough surfaces the current literature norton and heideman 1983 achenbach 1971 often abstracts the rough surface of actual marine risers as sand grain rough surface so this paper mainly considers the rough surface of uniform sand grain δb function is as follows when k s 2 25 δb 0 when 2 25 k s 90 δ b 1 κ ln k s 2 25 87 75 c s k s sin 0 4258 ln k s 0 811 when k s 90 δ b 1 κ ln 1 c s k s where c s is the roughness constant for the equivalent sand roughness model c s 0 5 2 4 dynamic grid update method in order to realize the numerical simulation of the riser viv two problems need to be solved 1 how to realize the boundary motion of the riser in the flow field and 2 how to make the fluid mesh deformation motion under the premise of ensuring the quality the cylinder boundary shape remains unchanged during the viv so it is only necessary to call the dynamic mesh macro define cg motion name dt vel omega time dtime on the commercial software fluent secondary development platform to realize the cylinder boundary motion caused by viv where the name is the name of the dynamic mesh macro dt is a pointer to the boundary of motion vel is the translational velocity of the movement boundary including the three components of vel 0 vel 1 vel 2 which correspond to the translational velocity of x y and z respectively omega is the angular velocity of the motion boundary including omega 0 omega 1 and omega 2 which correspond to the angular velocity of x y and z respectively time is the time corresponding to the current flow field dtime is the time step by programming a udf program to call define cg motion name dt vel omega time dtime to pass the velocity of the cylinder in the x and y directions to the variables vel 0 vel 1 special attention should be paid to ensure that the displacement of a cylinder in the flow field matches the displacement calculated by the cylinder vibration response solver according to the equation 9 the velocity at time t δt in the y direction is v e l 1 y t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t and the corresponding velocity at time t δt in the x direction is v e l 0 x t 1 2 β x t β x t δ t δ t instead of v e l 0 x t δ t and v e l 1 y t δ t which is crucial for the stability and accuracy of the calculation in the process of the cylinder viv the boundary motion of the cylinder occurs at each time step in order to ensure the quality of the near wall mesh at each time step the boundary motion of the riser needs to be diffused out so that the near wall grid remains as static as possible relative to the boundary of the riser the mesh motion was governed by the diffusion equation feng et al 2016 16 γ u 0 where u is the mesh displacement velocity the boundary conditions for equation 16 are obtained from the user prescribed or computed boundary motion for deforming boundaries the boundary conditions were such that the mesh motion was tangential to the boundary i e the normal velocity component vanished the laplace equation in equation 16 describes how the prescribed boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh the diffusion coefficient γ in equation 16 can be used to control how the boundary motion affects the interior mesh motion a constant coefficient means that the boundary motion diffuses uniformly throughout the mesh with a non uniform diffusion coefficient mesh nodes in regions with high diffusivity tend to move together i e with less relative motion for diffusivity based on boundary distance the diffusion coefficient γ is given by equation 17 17 γ 1 d θ where d is a normalized boundary distance the boundary distance based diffusion equation 17 controls how the boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the domain as a function of boundary distance decreasing the diffusivity away from the moving boundary causes those regions to absorb more mesh motion resulting in better mesh quality near the moving boundary this is particularly helpful for a moving boundary that has pronounced geometrical features such as sharp corners along with a prescribed motion that is predominantly rotational the diffusion coefficient γ is adjusted by the diffusion parameter θ a range of 0 2 has been shown to be of practical use a value of 0 the default value specifies that γ 1 and yields uniform diffusion of the boundary motion throughout the mesh a higher value of θ preserves a larger region of the mesh near the moving boundary and causes the region away from the moving boundary to absorb more motion 2 5 the fluid structure coupling interactive calculation method the flow chart of the bidirectional fluid structure coupling interactive calculation method is shown in fig 2 the whole process includes two parts the fluid calculation part and the riser structure calculation part as shown in the process of each time step iteration rans code and sst k ω method are firstly used to solve equations 1 and 2 to obtain the flow field variable information including the flow force of the riser structure and the shear stress of the rough cylinder near the wall is corrected according to equation 9 secondly using udf program the macro compute force and moment domain dt body centroid force moment is called to obtain the resistance and the lift force of the cylinder in the x direction and in the y direction respectively and the calculated results are substituted into equations 5 and 6 then based on newmark β method the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylindrical structure are obtained by solving equations 5 and 6 finally the velocity of the cylinder structure is transferred to the cylinder boundary through the udf program calling macro define cg motion to realize the cylinder boundary motion and the diffusion smoothing method is used to update the flow field grid the calculation is repeated until the riser vibration is stable the flow chart of interactive iterative solution between the fluid domain and the solid domain is shown in fig 3 starting from time step t n the initial condition is used to calculate the flow field variable information of time step t n δt and the flow force is inserted into the structural dynamic model and then the cylinder displacement of time step t n δt is calculated finally the cylinder displacement is transmitted to the flow field calculation of time step t n 2δt and so on so that the coupling action between the fluid and the cylinder structure can be correctly calculated 3 computational domain and mesh strategy 3 1 computational domain the setting of the calculation domain has a crucial influence on the numerical simulation of the flow field and a reasonable setting of the computational domain is helpful for the accuracy and speed of the calculation a schematic diagram of a cylindrical structure viv calculation model is shown in fig 4 the center of the cylinder is at the origin of the coordinate system the distance between the inlet and the center of the cylinder is 20 d and d is the cylinder diameter the distance from the left or right side to the center of the cylindrical structure is also 20 d and the distance between the outlet and the center of the cylindrical structure is 40 d the upper and lower boundaries are symmetrical u y 0 v 0 the outlet boundary is the pressure outflow u x 0 v x 0 the hydrostatic pressure is set to be 0 all the computations are initialized with a static body and this initialization condition is critical to capture the super upper branch in the numerical simulation at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04d wanderley and soares 2015 k and m are the stiffness and the mass of the cylinder respectively for the convenience of direct comparison with the experiment of jauvtis and willamson 2004 the simulation parameters here are the same as the parameters used in the experiment i e d 0 0381 m m m m d 2 6 where m d 0 25ρπd 2 mass damping factor m c a ζ 0 013 where c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient the natural frequency in water f n 0 4 3 2 grid partitioning the purpose of grid partitioning is usually to provide a set of computable meshes for the flow field the further requirement of the grid is satisfied for the requirements of accuracy and speed of calculation for viv problems grid partitioning needs certain characteristics there are strict requirements for the mesh near the cylinder and at the wake of the cylinder we used the boundary layer mesh to calculate the flow field near the cylinder especially the flow field in contact with the cylinder so that the force of the cylinder could be accurately calculated and the accuracy of this force was essential for calculating vivs the mesh of the entire flow field is a structured mesh of hexahedrons the grid near the cylinder is dense the further away from the cylinder the sparser the grid becomes as shown in fig 5 a we adopted this grid partitioning strategy on one hand because the flow field near the cylinder was more marked so that a relatively dense mesh was needed to better simulate the flow field and on the other hand the flow field of the area away from the cylinder was relatively stable such that a sparse grid could simulate the flow field well for the sake of the accuracy and speed of calculation the first layer of the grid must meet the condition of y y μ ρ τ w 1 see fig 5 b where y is the distance from the first layer of the grid to the wall τ w is the shear stress on the wall μ is dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density of the fluid the dynamic viscosity is μ 0 0009784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid is ρ 995 3 kg m3 in order to ensure that the numerical results are not affected by the mesh size a mesh dependence study is carried out here five different meshes are used to simulate the case of u 6 00 and the results are compared with the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 table 1 shows the mesh numbers the ratio of the transverse vibration amplitude to the diameter the transverse response frequency a y d error and f y f n error computed using the five mesh systems by comparing the results calculated by the five mesh systems with the experimental results it can be concluded that the results predicted by mesh 4 and mesh 5 is within the acceptable range in addition considering the computational efficiency mesh 4 system is selected in this study the cylindrical structure was divided into 160 grids at the circumference in accordance with the above grid partitioning strategy the entire flow field grid consisted of 226800 quadrilateral elements 4 results and discussion the actual surface roughness ks d of the marine riser is within the range of 1 0 10 4 2 0 10 2 gao et al 2018a 2018b in order to facilitate the comparative study the characteristics of the rough cylinder viv with three different surface roughness are systematically studied as shown in table 2 in this study the reduced velocity set for numerical simulation of the rough cylindrical cylinder viv changes from 2 0 to 14 0 at an interval of 0 5 each roughness corresponds to 25 working conditions and there are total of 75 calculation examples the reynolds number ranges from 1500 to 10500 4 1 response characteristics of rough cylindrical cylinder viv fig 6 is the comparison diagram of the vibration amplitude in the streamwise and transverse directions of the rough cylinder at different reduced velocities a x and a y are the vibration amplitude in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively a x 2 x x r m s d and a y 2 y r m s d x is the average displacement in the x direction rms represents the root mean square operation and d is the diameter of the cylinder jauvtis et al 2001 fig 6 lists the numerical simulation results of the rough cylinder viv with different roughness the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 and the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the cylinders used in jauvtis and williamson experiments were smooth cylinders k s d 0 00 as shown in fig 6 a when the reduced velocity is low u 2 0 3 0 with the increase of surface roughness the vibration amplitude of the cylinder in the streamwise direction increases the maximum vibration amplitude of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is about 0 141d while that of the smooth cylinder is about 0 112d when the reduced velocity is higher u 3 5 14 0 the vibration amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder with the increase of surface roughness the maximum amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction decreases first and then increases the maximum amplitude of the smooth cylinder in the streamwise direction is 0 305 d the maximum amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 was 0 205d 0 167d and 0 207d respectively similar to the smooth cylinder the rough cylinder viv has streamwise symmetric branch ss and antisymmetric streamwise branch as as shown in fig 6 b when the roughness k s d 0 005 or 0 01 each vibration branch of the rough cylinder viv in the transverse direction is similar to that of the smooth cylinder ss as initial branch i super upper branch su and lower branch l also exist but the corresponding super upper branch of the rough cylinder is shorter the maximum transverse vibration amplitude was only 1 203d and 1 016d respectively when the surface roughness k s d 0 02 the rough cylinder viv in the transverse direction only has the initial branch and the lower branch moreover the starting point of the initial branch and the lower branch moved forward compared with the smooth cylinder and the rough cylinder with a small surface roughness the vibration amplitude of the lower branch increased significantly the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch of the rough cylinder with the surface roughness k s d 0 02 was 0 879d gao et al 2018a 2018b failed to observe the existence of super upper branch in the study of rough cylinder viv however the present study of the rough cylinder viv captures the super upper branch and concludes the variation law of super upper branch with the increase of surface roughness gao et al 2018a 2018b believed that compared with the smooth cylinder rough cylinder has smaller viv displacement response and narrower lock in interval the present study on the rough cylinder viv shows that the maximum viv amplitude of the rough cylinder decreases with the increase of the surface roughness however when the surface roughness is low the lock in interval does not change significantly when the surface roughness is large the lock in interval decreases obviously when the surface roughness of the cylinder is small surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch decreases slightly when the surface roughness of the cylinder is large surface roughness k s d 0 02 the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch increases significantly the research conclusions of this study are different from those of gao et al 2018a 2018b which are mainly caused by two reasons first the reynolds number corresponding to the studies of gao et al 2018a 2018b is constant at 5000 while the reynolds number range in this study is from 1500 to 10500 second the reduced velocity u u f nw d in this study varied by changing the magnitude of the incoming flow velocity u the reduced velocity used by gao et al 2018a 2018b varied by changing the natural frequency f nw of the cylinder in still water fig 7 shows the ratio of the transverse vibration frequency to the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water at different reduced velocities fig 7 illustrates the numerical simulation results of the rough cylinder viv with different roughness the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 and the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 as shown in fig 7 when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 compared with the smooth cylinder the viv frequency ratio curve of the rough cylinder has four obvious branches the first frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the ss branch and the antisymmetric streamwise branch the second frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the initial branch and the super upper branch respectively the third frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the lower branch the fourth frequency branch indicates that the cylinder is in a non lock in interval where the vibration frequency is consistent with the st frequency it should be noted that the cylinder viv may be single frequency vibration or multi frequency vibration but only the points of the main frequency are given in fig 7 when the rough cylinder is in the first frequency branch the viv frequency of the rough cylinder is 0 5 0 6 times its natural frequency in still water similar to that of the smooth cylinder when the rough cylinder just enters the second frequency branch the viv frequency of the rough cylinder is consistent with the st frequency which is similar to that of the smooth cylinder as can be seen from fig 7 the frequency of the rough cylinder viv almost coincides with the st frequency f st 0 20 f st 0 26 in a straight line there is a law that requires special attention when the surface roughness k s d 0 02 the st frequency of the rough cylinder will increase which is contrary to the law of the flow around the fixed cylinder however it is consistent with the conclusion of gao et al 2018a 2018b that with the increase of surface roughness the st number tends to increase thereafter with the gradual increase of the reduced velocity the ratio of the vibration frequency of the rough cylinder to its natural frequency in still water is close to 1 0 at this moment the vibration of the rough cylinder enters lock in state for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the transverse vibration amplitude falls on the super upper branch with the increase of reduced velocity the rough cylinder with larger surface roughness will enter the lower branch earlier when the cylinder viv is located in the lower branch the viv frequency rises to the third frequency branch as shown in figs 6 b and 7 for the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 the ratio of its viv frequency to the natural frequency in still water is about 1 3 for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 the ratio of its viv frequency to the natural frequency in still water is about 1 14 with the further increase of the reduced velocity the viv frequency of the rough cylinder rises to the fourth frequency branch at this moment the vibration frequency of the rough cylinder is again consistent with the st frequency and is in the non lock in interval with the increase of reduced velocity the rougher the surface roughness the earlier the cylinder enters the fourth frequency branch in general compared with the smooth cylinder the viv characteristics of the rough cylinder tend to advance in other words the reduced velocity corresponding to the viv characteristic of the rough cylinder is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder the vibration frequency of the lower branch of the rough cylinder with larger surface roughness is significantly reduced and is closer to its natural frequency in still water 4 2 duration curve of force and response of rough cylinder fig 8 show the duration curves of the lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacement y d and streamwise displacement x d of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 01 under different reduced velocities the duration curve of force and response of rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in fig s1 s2 in the supporting information it can be seen from fig 8 and fig s1 s2 that within the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 the rough cylinder experiences four rounds of multi frequency vibration which is mainly manifested as a chaotic force and vibration response of the rough cylinder when u 2 5 the cylinder is in the first round of multi frequency vibration at this moment the streamwise vibration of the rough cylinder is in the resonance stage and its force is also multi frequency when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the first frequency branch to the second frequency branch the cylinder enters the second round of multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the second round multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 4 0 4 0 and 3 5 at this moment the rough cylinder viv begins to enter the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the second frequency branch to the third frequency branch the cylinder enters the third round of multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the third round of multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 6 5 5 5 and 5 5 at this moment the rough cylinder viv is in the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the third frequency branch to the fourth frequency branch the rough cylinder enters the fourth round multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the fourth round multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 12 0 12 5 12 0 12 5 10 5 11 0 at this time the cylinder viv will leave the lock in interval and return to the vibration at st frequency in addition to the four rounds multi frequency vibration mentioned above the cylinder vibrates steadily and regularly in the other reduced velocity range similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinder viv also has the phenomenon of phase switch that is the phase difference between lift force and transverse vibration suddenly changes from almost 0 180 except for the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 with the increase of surface roughness the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch of the cylinder viv gradually decreases and the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 0 0 005 and 0 01 is 8 5 7 0 and 6 5 respectively for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch is 10 0 4 3 characteristics of rough cylinder viv trajectory fig 9 show the viv trajectories of the rough cylinder under different reduced velocities the viv trajectories of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in fig s3 s4 in the supporting information from fig 9 and s3 s4 it can be seen that in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinder mainly conducts viv with the shape of 8 and there is also the phenomenon of chaotic motion trajectory the rough cylinder undergoes four rounds chaotic trajectory combined with fig 8 and s1 s2 it can be seen that the chaotic vibration trajectories of the rough cylinder are closely related to its multi frequency vibration and mainly occurs in the process of the different frequency branch switching the reduced velocity range corresponding to the chaotic motion of different rough cylinder is shown in table 3 the results of surface roughness k s d 0 00 in table 3 are obtained from the numerical simulation results of han et al 2018 when u 2 5 the rough cylinder will undergo the first round chaotic vibration at this time the streamwise vibration frequency is locked to the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water and the transverse vibration frequency is affected by the streamwise vibration frequency which shows multi frequency vibration and causes the cylinder trajectory to become chaotic when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the first frequency branch to the second frequency branch the cylinder enters into the second round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the second round chaotic vibration is u 4 0 4 0 and 3 5 respectively at which time the rough cylinder starts to enter the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the second frequency branch to the third frequency branch the cylinder enters into the third round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the third round chaotic vibration is u 6 5 5 5 5 5 6 5 respectively at which time the rough cylinders are still in the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the third frequency branch to the fourth frequency branch the cylinder enters into the fourth round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the fourth round chaotic vibration is u 6 5 5 5 5 5 6 5 respectively at this time the cylinder viv will leave the lock in interval and return to the vibration with st frequency in addition to the chaotic vibrations of the above four rounds the vibration trajectory of the rough cylinder in the other reduced velocity range is shaped like an 8 or a crescent shape it is worth noting that when the reduced velocity u 5 5 6 5 the vibration trajectory of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is droplet shape compared with the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder corresponding to chaotic motion tends to advance and one more round of chaotic motion occurs 4 4 vortex shedding wake characteristics of the rough cylinder fig 10 are the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder at different reduced velocities the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in figs s5 s6 in the supporting information as shown in fig 10 and s5 s6 similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinders also exist ss 2s 2t and 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 however the reduced velocity range of various wake vortex shedding patterns of the rough cylinders is different from that of smooth cylinders which is mainly related to the amplitude of the streamwise and transverse vibration and the phase difference of the transverse vibration response and the lift force in addition the rough cylinders also produce two wake vortex shedding pattern that smooth cylinders do not have namely p s and 2c the reduced velocity ranges corresponding to the wake vortex shedding pattern of each rough cylinder are shown in table 4 the results of roughness k s d 0 00 in the table 4 are obtained from the numerical simulation results of han et al 2018 when the reduced velocity u 2 5 the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 is p s when the reduced velocity u 3 0 the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is 2c it can be seen from table 4 and fig 10 and s5 s6 that with the increase of surface roughness the reduced velocity range corresponding to the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder is gradually reduced indicating that the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the generation of 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder different from smooth cylinder rough cylinder also produces 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the lower reduced velocity range however in the higher reduced velocity range when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the generation of 2p wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder which change to 2s wake vortex shedding pattern gao et al 2018a 2018b believed that compared with smooth cylinders surface roughness had no effect on the wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder the present study of rough cylinder viv shows that the surface roughness has a significant effect on the wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder the reason why these two conclusions are so different is that the reynolds number corresponding to these two studies is different which leads to the different influence degree of surface roughness on the viscous sublayer of cylinder surface 5 conclusion in this study a modified model of velocity gradient on a rough cylindrical wall is introduced to compile a program for calculating velocity gradient on a rough riser wall and the model is embedded into a numerical program for calculating cylinder viv the rough cylinder viv with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 0 02 in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 were systematically studied the numerical results of the rough cylinder viv are compared with those of the smooth cylinder viv and it is found that the rough cylinder viv also has ss branch as branch initial branch super upper branch and lower branch compared with the smooth cylinder the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder corresponding with multiple frequencies and chaotic motions tends to move forward and there is one more round chaotic motion when the reduced velocity is low the reduced velocity range of multi frequency and chaotic motion of the rough cylinder is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder and the surface roughness of the cylinder has effects of inhibiting chaotic motion when the reduced velocity is high compared with the smooth cylinder the reduced velocity range of the rough cylinder corresponding with chaotic motion tends to increase and the surface roughness of the cylinder has effects of promoting chaotic motion similar to the smooth cylinder in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 the rough cylinder also has 2s 2t and 2p wake vortex shedding patterns however the reduced velocity of various wake vortex shedding patterns of the rough cylinder are different from that of the smooth cylinder which is mainly related to the vibration amplitude of the streamwise and transverse directions and the phase differences of the transverse vibration response and the lift force in addition rough cylinders also produce two wake vortex shedding patterns that smooth cylinders do not have namely p s and 2c with the increase of roughness the reduced velocity range corresponding to the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder is gradually reduced indicating that the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the formation of 2t wake vortex shedding pattern different from smooth cylinder rough cylinder also produces 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the low reduced velocity range but in the high reduced velocity range when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 the surface roughness of cylinder will suppress the generation of 2p wake vortex shedding pattern which changes to 2s wake vortex shedding pattern credit authorship contribution statement xiangxi han resources conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original

20973,the marine riser is the key equipment connecting the floating platform with the seabed wellhead and the vortex induced vibration viv is the main cause of its fatigue damage which contains complex and substantial dynamics content marine risers are operated for a long time as time goes by marine organisms will attach on the marine riser surfaces thus significantly affect their surface roughness of the riser the increased surface roughness makes the dynamic characteristics of the riser viv more abundant and complex including jumping multi frequency vibration broadband vibration resonance and other dynamic contents in this study based on the bidirectional fluid structure coupling method of computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational structure dynamics csd the modified model of rough wall velocity gradient is introduced and the calculation program of a rough cylinder wall velocity gradient is compiled and embedded into the numerical calculation program of a smooth

explored to provide a scientific theoretical basis and a practical engineering method for vibration control of a rough marine riser keywords fluid structure interaction vortex induced vibration marine riser numerical simulation surface roughness 1 introduction marine riser is a key part of the deep sea oil and gas exploitation system it is an important transportation component connecting the submarine oil field and the offshore platform and is known as the lifeline of offshore oil vortex induced vibration viv is a typical phenomenon of the riser dynamic response when vortex shedding frequency is near the riser natural frequency the vortex shedding frequency no longer increases with the inflow velocity but follows the natural vibration frequency of the riser structure this phenomenon is called lock in at this moment the vibration response amplitudes of the riser in the streamwise and transverse direction increase significantly often cause fatigue damage or even failure of the riser williamson and govardhan 2008 marine risers are basic long term operation components over time marine organisms will adsorb on the surface of the riser and directly affect its surface roughness when the marine riser is at a high reynolds number the effect of surface roughness on the riser viv needs to be further studied and discussed some studies indicate that compared with a smooth riser with the increase of the surface roughness of the riser the frequency of the vortex shedding from the rear edge of the rough riser increased kiu et al 2011 meanwhile the starting point of the riser lock in interval tends to advance so does the ending point of the lock in interval and the lock in interval tends to shrink gao et al 2015 the increase of the vortex shedding frequency of the rough riser may directly accelerate the fatigue damage or even the failure of the riser reduce the safety during the riser operation and increase the possibility of causing significant economic losses and serious environmental pollution further research on the mechanism of the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of the riser will help us to accurately predict the viv response of the marine riser and improve the safety of the riser early studies on the marine riser viv mainly started from an elastic smooth cylindrical structure the most representative ones who systematically studied the elastic smooth cylindrical cylinders viv with different mass ratios govardhan and williamson 2000 2002 2004 khalak and williamson 1999 found out characteristics of the elastic cylindrical cylinders viv such as lock in hysteresis jumping and intermittent interestingly jauvtis and williamson jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 found that when the mass ratio m 7 0 the amplitude of the vibration response in the transverse direction of the two degree of freedom 2 dof cylinder was equivalent to that in the transverse direction of the 1 dof cylinder when the mass ratio m 2 6 the vibration response amplitude of the 2 dof cylinder viv in the transverse direction would generate the super upper branch pattern with maximum vibration response amplitude reaching 1 5 d d is the diameter of the cylinder accompanied by the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern many researchers zhou et al 1999 han et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 guilmineau and queutey 2004 wanderley et al 2008 pan et al 2007 gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2010 kang et al 2017 have carried out the numerical simulation of a smooth cylindrical cylinder viv by using the cfd method based on physical experimental research the characteristics of an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv such as response branches the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch vortex shedding pattern and vibration frequency have been successfully captured however at present the research on the riser viv mainly focuses on smooth cylinder while rough cylinder viv is rarely studied over time different sizes roughness has been formed on the riser surface during the service period the surface roughness of the marine riser is generally between 1 10 4 2 10 2 gao et al 2015 in recent years effects of surface roughness on hydrodynamic characteristics especially vortex induced vibration of marine risers have been studied according to the existing theoretical research and experimental results achenbach 2015 nakamura and tomonari 1982 bearman and harvey 1993 okajima et al 1999 allen and henning 2001 bernitsas et al 2008 gao et al 2018a 2018b the influence of surface roughness on the dynamic characteristics of a riser cannot be ignored as for the study of the surface roughness of the riser early studies mainly focused on the flow field around a stationary cylinder with different roughnesses in the air environment achenbach 2015 nakamura and tomonari 1982 bearman and harvey 1993 okajima et al 1999 achenbach 2015 found that as the surface roughness of a fixed cylinder increases its boundary layer separation points gradually move to the rear edge of the cylinder leading to a faster transition from laminar to turbulent flow when the boundary layer on the surface of a cylinder transitions from laminar to turbulent flow the resistance of the cylinder suddenly drops under the critical reynolds number causing resistance crisis with the increase of surface roughness the critical reynolds number corresponding to the resistance crisis decreases nakamura and tomonari 1982 measured the mean pressure distribution and strouhal number st of smooth cylinders the cylinders with dispersed roughness and the cylinders with a rough narrow band in the range of reynolds number 4 0 l04 to 1 7 l06 respectively a pressure distribution similarity parameter related to a cylinder with dispersed roughness is proposed in a supercritical range it was also observed that when the surface roughness of the cylinder exceeds 0 003 the critical and supercritical regions were reduced to a very small region bearman and harvey 1993 discussed the influence of the fixed cylinder surface roughness on st number and found that within the subcritical reynolds number range the st number of rough cylinders was higher than that of the smooth cylinder but the trend was opposite after entering the critical reynolds number okajima et al 1999 found that within the subcritical reynolds number range the amplitude of a rough cylinder viv is smaller than that of a smooth cylinder however in the critical reynolds number range viv amplitude of the rough cylinder is greater than that of the smooth cylinder at present there are many experimental studies on the rough cylinder in the air but few on the characteristics of the rough cylinder in the water allen and henning 2001 studied the influence of surface roughness on the cylinder viv within the critical and supercritical reynolds number the results show that the surface roughness has no significant effect on the viv response this is because in the critical reynolds number range the resistance of a smooth cylinder is low and the smooth cylinder viv is almost nonexistent kiu et al 2011 studied the influence of surface roughness on the response amplitude and hydrodynamic force of the cylinder viv the results show that with the increase of the surface roughness the maximum response amplitude and the maximum average resistance coefficient of the cylinder viv gradually decrease and approach to a certain constant value the starting point of cylinder structure lock in interval gradually delayed but with high roughness the width of the lock in interval decreased obviously also the st number increased slightly with the increase of surface roughness bernitasas et al 2008 studied an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv with rough bands through physical experiments the results show that the flow characteristics of the fluid near the cylinder depend on the width roughness size of sand grains and location of the rough bands the roughness magnitude and distribution can be used to enhance or restrain the viv amplitude and increase or decrease the range of the lock in interval respectively gao et al 2015 studied the influence of surface roughness on the riser viv by using a physical experiment method and compared the resistance lift force tension vortex shedding frequency vibration frequency and displacement response of the risers with different surface roughness the results showed that in a low reduced velocity range the lock in of riser in the streamwise direction occurs earlier than that in the transverse direction so the viv response in the streamwise direction is greater than that in the transverse direction compared with the smooth riser the rough riser has smaller vibration response narrower lock in interval and higher vortex shedding frequency gao et al 2018a 2018b carried out a numerical simulation study on an elastic cylindrical cylinder viv with 2 dof considering the rough surface at a low reynolds number re 5000 and analyzed the influence of different surface roughness on the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch as well as the corresponding wake vortex shedding patterns from the perspective of research status the current research work mainly focuses on the influence of surface roughness on the hydrodynamic force of a fixed cylinder in air or water but there are few studies on the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of an elastic cylinder and even fewer research results on the influence of surface roughness on the viv characteristics of a three dimensional 3d riser in terms of the numerical simulation research of a rough cylinder some numerical simulations have been carried out on the rough cylinder viv in the range of low reynolds number re 5000 gao et al 2018a 2018b however no further study on the high reynolds number range at a high reynolds number does a rough cylinder produce a super upper branch what is the effect of surface roughness on super upper branch what about the wake vortex shedding pattern in view of the above background based on the bidirectional fluid structure coupling method of cfd and csd this study takes a rough cylinder as the research object and systematically studies the viv characteristics of a rough cylinder at a high reynolds number effects of surface roughness on the dynamic characteristics vibration response vibration trajectory and wake vortex shedding pattern of a rough cylinder are analyzed the unique nonlinear dynamic behavior of a rough cylinder viv is revealed and the mechanism of influence of surface roughness on the rough cylinder viv is explored 2 mathematical model 2 1 fluid governing equations in this study the unsteady and incompressible rans equation was used to solve the hydrodynamic characteristics of the fluid domain the rans equation is written as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j

respectively and time s ij is the mean strain rate tensor that is computed by equation 3 in the present work equations 1 and 2 are solved by adopting the rans code packaged in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software fluent the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is used for modeling the reynolds stress tensor u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor defined by equation 4 the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the pressure staggering option presto scheme and quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinetics quick are used to discretize pressure and momentum respectively a second order upwind scheme is used for the turbulent kinetic energy and a first order upwind for specific dissipation a second order implicit method is used for the time domain 2 2 transient dynamic equations the dynamic equations of vibration of a cylindrical structure are as follows 5 m x t c x

respectively the relationship between damping c and damping ratio ξ is c 2 ξ k m m a in which m a is added mass all these parameters are consistent with the experiment reported by jauvits and williamson 2004 f x t and f y t are the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction respectively equations 5 and 6 are solved by using the newmark β method the concrete solution process is illustrated with the example of transverse vibration of cylinder the key of newmark β method is to establish the recursion relation from the state variables y t y t y t at time t to the state variables y t δ t y t δ t y t δ t at time t δt thus starting from the initial state variables y 0 y 0 y 0 at time t 0 the state vector of each time can be calculated step by step according to equation 6 the state variables y t δ t y t δ t and y t δ t at time t δt satisfies the following relation 7 m y t δ t c y t δ t k y t δ t f y t δ t according to the assumption of newmark β method the velocity and displacement at time t δt are as follows 8 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t 9 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t 2 equations 7 9 are the basic equations for newmark β method where γ 0 5 and β 0 25 in the actual calculation we can first get y t δ t in terms of y t δ t from equation 9 and then substitute the equation 8 to get y t δ t in terms of y t δ t substitute them all into equation 7 to get a system of equations with only y t δ t and solve it to get the displacement variable y t δ t of at time t δt then substituted y t δ t into equations 8 and 9 to obtain the velocity and acceleration at time t δt after the above calculation the displacement at time t δt can be calculated as follows 10 k y t δ t f y t δ t in equation 10 f y is the payload in the y direction and k is the effective stiffness the specific expression is as follows 11 f y t δ t f y t δ t m α 0 y t α 2 y t α 3 y t c α 1 y t α 4 y t α 5 y t 12 k k α 0 m α 1 c the acceleration and velocity at time t δt are as follows 13 y t δ t α 0 y t δ t y t α 2 y t α 3 y t 14 y t δ t y t α 6 y t α 7 y t δ t in the above equation α 0 1 β δ t 2 α 1 γ β δ t α 2 1 β δ t α 3 1 2 β 1 α 4 γ β 1 α 5 δ t 2 γ β 2 α 6 δ t 1 γ and α 7 γ δ t 2 3 law of the wall modified for roughness the equivalent sand roughness model proposed by schlichting and gersten 1997 is shown in fig 1 in the figure u is the incoming flow velocity k s is the roughness surface height and the shaded part represents the structural surface the equivalent sand roughness model uses a layer of tightly packed spheres to represent the equivalent sand roughness surface the spheres have the average roughness surface height blevins and coughran 2009 kiu and stappenbelt 2011 chang et al 2011 all adopted the equivalent sand model to conduct physical experiments to study the viv characteristics of a rough cylindrical cylinder and obtained ideal experimental results a viscous sublayer can only be fully formed on a hydraulically smooth wall in the transition region of the rough wall if the roughness element is slightly higher than the viscous sublayer then the roughness element will interfere with the viscous sublayer and the viscous sublayer will be destroyed at this point the viscous effect of the fluid will be low or even negligible so the effect of roughness on the wall y needs to be corrected assuming that the roughness has a blocking effect which is about 50 of the rough surface height k s then y y k s 2 under the consideration of the roughness the cylinder roughness will affect the boundary layer flow and have a direct impact on the vortex shedding frequency separation point and hydrodynamic force the wall correction algorithm proposed by jimenez 2004 blocken et al 2007 and pattanapol et al 2007 estimated the shear stress of a rough cylindrical cylinder wall the specific equation is as follow 15 u p u τ w ρ 1 κ ln e ρ u y p μ δ b where u p is the mean velocity tangential to the wall of the center point p of the wall adjacent grid y p is the distance between the rough surface and the center of the adjacent grid u c μ 0 25 k 0 5 c μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and k is the turbulent kinetic energy at the center of an adjacent grid on a rough surface empirical constant e 9 793 von karman constant κ 0 41 δb is used to correct the deviation of the logarithmic law origin caused by the roughness its value is determined by the type of rough surface including sand rivet thread rib wire mesh etc and the height k s of rough surface k s has a dimensionless value of k s ρ k s u μ currently no δb function expression is universally applicable to all types of rough surfaces the current literature norton and heideman 1983 achenbach 1971 often abstracts the rough surface of actual marine risers as sand grain rough surface so this paper mainly considers the rough surface of uniform sand grain δb function is as follows when k s 2 25 δb 0 when 2 25 k s 90 δ b 1 κ ln k s 2 25 87 75 c s k s sin 0 4258 ln k s 0 811 when k s 90 δ b 1 κ ln 1 c s k s where c s is the roughness constant for the equivalent sand roughness model c s 0 5 2 4 dynamic grid update method in order to realize the numerical simulation of the riser viv two problems need to be solved 1 how to realize the boundary motion of the riser in the flow field and 2 how to make the fluid mesh deformation motion under the premise of ensuring the quality the cylinder boundary shape remains unchanged during the viv so it is only necessary to call the dynamic mesh macro define cg motion name dt vel omega time dtime on the commercial software fluent secondary development platform to realize the cylinder boundary motion caused by viv where the name is the name of the dynamic mesh macro dt is a pointer to the boundary of motion vel is the translational velocity of the movement boundary including the three components of vel 0 vel 1 vel 2 which correspond to the translational velocity of x y and z respectively omega is the angular velocity of the motion boundary including omega 0 omega 1 and omega 2 which correspond to the angular velocity of x y and z respectively time is the time corresponding to the current flow field dtime is the time step by programming a udf program to call define cg motion name dt vel omega time dtime to pass the velocity of the cylinder in the x and y directions to the variables vel 0 vel 1 special attention should be paid to ensure that the displacement of a cylinder in the flow field matches the displacement calculated by the cylinder vibration response solver according to the equation 9 the velocity at time t δt in the y direction is v e l 1 y t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t and the corresponding velocity at time t δt in the x direction is v e l 0 x t 1 2 β x t β x t δ t δ t instead of v e l 0 x t δ t and v e l 1 y t δ t which is crucial for the stability and accuracy of the calculation in the process of the cylinder viv the boundary motion of the cylinder occurs at each time step in order to ensure the quality of the near wall mesh at each time step the boundary motion of the riser needs to be diffused out so that the near wall grid remains as static as possible relative to the boundary of the riser the mesh motion was governed by the diffusion equation feng et al 2016 16 γ u 0 where u is the mesh displacement velocity the boundary conditions for equation 16 are obtained from the user prescribed or computed boundary motion for deforming boundaries the boundary conditions were such that the mesh motion was tangential to the boundary i e the normal velocity component vanished the laplace equation in equation 16 describes how the prescribed boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh the diffusion coefficient γ in equation 16 can be used to control how the boundary motion affects the interior mesh motion a constant coefficient means that the boundary motion diffuses uniformly throughout the mesh with a non uniform diffusion coefficient mesh nodes in regions with high diffusivity tend to move together i e with less relative motion for diffusivity based on boundary distance the diffusion coefficient γ is given by equation 17 17 γ 1 d θ where d is a normalized boundary distance the boundary distance based diffusion equation 17 controls how the boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the domain as a function of boundary distance decreasing the diffusivity away from the moving boundary causes those regions to absorb more mesh motion resulting in better mesh quality near the moving boundary this is particularly helpful for a moving boundary that has pronounced geometrical features such as sharp corners along with a prescribed motion that is predominantly rotational the diffusion coefficient γ is adjusted by the diffusion parameter θ a range of 0 2 has been shown to be of practical use a value of 0 the default value specifies that γ 1 and yields uniform diffusion of the boundary motion throughout the mesh a higher value of θ preserves a larger region of the mesh near the moving boundary and causes the region away from the moving boundary to absorb more motion 2 5 the fluid structure coupling interactive calculation method the flow chart of the bidirectional fluid structure coupling interactive calculation method is shown in fig 2 the whole process includes two parts the fluid calculation part and the riser structure calculation part as shown in the process of each time step iteration rans code and sst k ω method are firstly used to solve equations 1 and 2 to obtain the flow field variable information including the flow force of the riser structure and the shear stress of the rough cylinder near the wall is corrected according to equation 9 secondly using udf program the macro compute force and moment domain dt body centroid force moment is called to obtain the resistance and the lift force of the cylinder in the x direction and in the y direction respectively and the calculated results are substituted into equations 5 and 6 then based on newmark β method the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylindrical structure are obtained by solving equations 5 and 6 finally the velocity of the cylinder structure is transferred to the cylinder boundary through the udf program calling macro define cg motion to realize the cylinder boundary motion and the diffusion smoothing method is used to update the flow field grid the calculation is repeated until the riser vibration is stable the flow chart of interactive iterative solution between the fluid domain and the solid domain is shown in fig 3 starting from time step t n the initial condition is used to calculate the flow field variable information of time step t n δt and the flow force is inserted into the structural dynamic model and then the cylinder displacement of time step t n δt is calculated finally the cylinder displacement is transmitted to the flow field calculation of time step t n 2δt and so on so that the coupling action between the fluid and the cylinder structure can be correctly calculated 3 computational domain and mesh strategy 3 1 computational domain the setting of the calculation domain has a crucial influence on the numerical simulation of the flow field and a reasonable setting of the computational domain is helpful for the accuracy and speed of the calculation a schematic diagram of a cylindrical structure viv calculation model is shown in fig 4 the center of the cylinder is at the origin of the coordinate system the distance between the inlet and the center of the cylinder is 20 d and d is the cylinder diameter the distance from the left or right side to the center of the cylindrical structure is also 20 d and the distance between the outlet and the center of the cylindrical structure is 40 d the upper and lower boundaries are symmetrical u y 0 v 0 the outlet boundary is the pressure outflow u x 0 v x 0 the hydrostatic pressure is set to be 0 all the computations are initialized with a static body and this initialization condition is critical to capture the super upper branch in the numerical simulation at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04d wanderley and soares 2015 k and m are the stiffness and the mass of the cylinder respectively for the convenience of direct comparison with the experiment of jauvtis and willamson 2004 the simulation parameters here are the same as the parameters used in the experiment i e d 0 0381 m m m m d 2 6 where m d 0 25ρπd 2 mass damping factor m c a ζ 0 013 where c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient the natural frequency in water f n 0 4 3 2 grid partitioning the purpose of grid partitioning is usually to provide a set of computable meshes for the flow field the further requirement of the grid is satisfied for the requirements of accuracy and speed of calculation for viv problems grid partitioning needs certain characteristics there are strict requirements for the mesh near the cylinder and at the wake of the cylinder we used the boundary layer mesh to calculate the flow field near the cylinder especially the flow field in contact with the cylinder so that the force of the cylinder could be accurately calculated and the accuracy of this force was essential for calculating vivs the mesh of the entire flow field is a structured mesh of hexahedrons the grid near the cylinder is dense the further away from the cylinder the sparser the grid becomes as shown in fig 5 a we adopted this grid partitioning strategy on one hand because the flow field near the cylinder was more marked so that a relatively dense mesh was needed to better simulate the flow field and on the other hand the flow field of the area away from the cylinder was relatively stable such that a sparse grid could simulate the flow field well for the sake of the accuracy and speed of calculation the first layer of the grid must meet the condition of y y μ ρ τ w 1 see fig 5 b where y is the distance from the first layer of the grid to the wall τ w is the shear stress on the wall μ is dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density of the fluid the dynamic viscosity is μ 0 0009784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid is ρ 995 3 kg m3 in order to ensure that the numerical results are not affected by the mesh size a mesh dependence study is carried out here five different meshes are used to simulate the case of u 6 00 and the results are compared with the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 table 1 shows the mesh numbers the ratio of the transverse vibration amplitude to the diameter the transverse response frequency a y d error and f y f n error computed using the five mesh systems by comparing the results calculated by the five mesh systems with the experimental results it can be concluded that the results predicted by mesh 4 and mesh 5 is within the acceptable range in addition considering the computational efficiency mesh 4 system is selected in this study the cylindrical structure was divided into 160 grids at the circumference in accordance with the above grid partitioning strategy the entire flow field grid consisted of 226800 quadrilateral elements 4 results and discussion the actual surface roughness ks d of the marine riser is within the range of 1 0 10 4 2 0 10 2 gao et al 2018a 2018b in order to facilitate the comparative study the characteristics of the rough cylinder viv with three different surface roughness are systematically studied as shown in table 2 in this study the reduced velocity set for numerical simulation of the rough cylindrical cylinder viv changes from 2 0 to 14 0 at an interval of 0 5 each roughness corresponds to 25 working conditions and there are total of 75 calculation examples the reynolds number ranges from 1500 to 10500 4 1 response characteristics of rough cylindrical cylinder viv fig 6 is the comparison diagram of the vibration amplitude in the streamwise and transverse directions of the rough cylinder at different reduced velocities a x and a y are the vibration amplitude in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively a x 2 x x r m s d and a y 2 y r m s d x is the average displacement in the x direction rms represents the root mean square operation and d is the diameter of the cylinder jauvtis et al 2001 fig 6 lists the numerical simulation results of the rough cylinder viv with different roughness the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 and the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the cylinders used in jauvtis and williamson experiments were smooth cylinders k s d 0 00 as shown in fig 6 a when the reduced velocity is low u 2 0 3 0 with the increase of surface roughness the vibration amplitude of the cylinder in the streamwise direction increases the maximum vibration amplitude of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is about 0 141d while that of the smooth cylinder is about 0 112d when the reduced velocity is higher u 3 5 14 0 the vibration amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder with the increase of surface roughness the maximum amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction decreases first and then increases the maximum amplitude of the smooth cylinder in the streamwise direction is 0 305 d the maximum amplitude of the rough cylinder in the streamwise direction with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 was 0 205d 0 167d and 0 207d respectively similar to the smooth cylinder the rough cylinder viv has streamwise symmetric branch ss and antisymmetric streamwise branch as as shown in fig 6 b when the roughness k s d 0 005 or 0 01 each vibration branch of the rough cylinder viv in the transverse direction is similar to that of the smooth cylinder ss as initial branch i super upper branch su and lower branch l also exist but the corresponding super upper branch of the rough cylinder is shorter the maximum transverse vibration amplitude was only 1 203d and 1 016d respectively when the surface roughness k s d 0 02 the rough cylinder viv in the transverse direction only has the initial branch and the lower branch moreover the starting point of the initial branch and the lower branch moved forward compared with the smooth cylinder and the rough cylinder with a small surface roughness the vibration amplitude of the lower branch increased significantly the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch of the rough cylinder with the surface roughness k s d 0 02 was 0 879d gao et al 2018a 2018b failed to observe the existence of super upper branch in the study of rough cylinder viv however the present study of the rough cylinder viv captures the super upper branch and concludes the variation law of super upper branch with the increase of surface roughness gao et al 2018a 2018b believed that compared with the smooth cylinder rough cylinder has smaller viv displacement response and narrower lock in interval the present study on the rough cylinder viv shows that the maximum viv amplitude of the rough cylinder decreases with the increase of the surface roughness however when the surface roughness is low the lock in interval does not change significantly when the surface roughness is large the lock in interval decreases obviously when the surface roughness of the cylinder is small surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch decreases slightly when the surface roughness of the cylinder is large surface roughness k s d 0 02 the maximum vibration amplitude of the lower branch increases significantly the research conclusions of this study are different from those of gao et al 2018a 2018b which are mainly caused by two reasons first the reynolds number corresponding to the studies of gao et al 2018a 2018b is constant at 5000 while the reynolds number range in this study is from 1500 to 10500 second the reduced velocity u u f nw d in this study varied by changing the magnitude of the incoming flow velocity u the reduced velocity used by gao et al 2018a 2018b varied by changing the natural frequency f nw of the cylinder in still water fig 7 shows the ratio of the transverse vibration frequency to the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water at different reduced velocities fig 7 illustrates the numerical simulation results of the rough cylinder viv with different roughness the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 and the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 as shown in fig 7 when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 compared with the smooth cylinder the viv frequency ratio curve of the rough cylinder has four obvious branches the first frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the ss branch and the antisymmetric streamwise branch the second frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the initial branch and the super upper branch respectively the third frequency branch from left to right corresponds to the lower branch the fourth frequency branch indicates that the cylinder is in a non lock in interval where the vibration frequency is consistent with the st frequency it should be noted that the cylinder viv may be single frequency vibration or multi frequency vibration but only the points of the main frequency are given in fig 7 when the rough cylinder is in the first frequency branch the viv frequency of the rough cylinder is 0 5 0 6 times its natural frequency in still water similar to that of the smooth cylinder when the rough cylinder just enters the second frequency branch the viv frequency of the rough cylinder is consistent with the st frequency which is similar to that of the smooth cylinder as can be seen from fig 7 the frequency of the rough cylinder viv almost coincides with the st frequency f st 0 20 f st 0 26 in a straight line there is a law that requires special attention when the surface roughness k s d 0 02 the st frequency of the rough cylinder will increase which is contrary to the law of the flow around the fixed cylinder however it is consistent with the conclusion of gao et al 2018a 2018b that with the increase of surface roughness the st number tends to increase thereafter with the gradual increase of the reduced velocity the ratio of the vibration frequency of the rough cylinder to its natural frequency in still water is close to 1 0 at this moment the vibration of the rough cylinder enters lock in state for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the transverse vibration amplitude falls on the super upper branch with the increase of reduced velocity the rough cylinder with larger surface roughness will enter the lower branch earlier when the cylinder viv is located in the lower branch the viv frequency rises to the third frequency branch as shown in figs 6 b and 7 for the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 the ratio of its viv frequency to the natural frequency in still water is about 1 3 for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 the ratio of its viv frequency to the natural frequency in still water is about 1 14 with the further increase of the reduced velocity the viv frequency of the rough cylinder rises to the fourth frequency branch at this moment the vibration frequency of the rough cylinder is again consistent with the st frequency and is in the non lock in interval with the increase of reduced velocity the rougher the surface roughness the earlier the cylinder enters the fourth frequency branch in general compared with the smooth cylinder the viv characteristics of the rough cylinder tend to advance in other words the reduced velocity corresponding to the viv characteristic of the rough cylinder is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder the vibration frequency of the lower branch of the rough cylinder with larger surface roughness is significantly reduced and is closer to its natural frequency in still water 4 2 duration curve of force and response of rough cylinder fig 8 show the duration curves of the lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacement y d and streamwise displacement x d of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 01 under different reduced velocities the duration curve of force and response of rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in fig s1 s2 in the supporting information it can be seen from fig 8 and fig s1 s2 that within the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 the rough cylinder experiences four rounds of multi frequency vibration which is mainly manifested as a chaotic force and vibration response of the rough cylinder when u 2 5 the cylinder is in the first round of multi frequency vibration at this moment the streamwise vibration of the rough cylinder is in the resonance stage and its force is also multi frequency when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the first frequency branch to the second frequency branch the cylinder enters the second round of multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the second round multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 4 0 4 0 and 3 5 at this moment the rough cylinder viv begins to enter the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the second frequency branch to the third frequency branch the cylinder enters the third round of multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the third round of multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 6 5 5 5 and 5 5 at this moment the rough cylinder viv is in the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv is converted from the third frequency branch to the fourth frequency branch the rough cylinder enters the fourth round multi frequency vibration the reduced velocity corresponding to the fourth round multi frequency vibration of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 successively is u 12 0 12 5 12 0 12 5 10 5 11 0 at this time the cylinder viv will leave the lock in interval and return to the vibration at st frequency in addition to the four rounds multi frequency vibration mentioned above the cylinder vibrates steadily and regularly in the other reduced velocity range similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinder viv also has the phenomenon of phase switch that is the phase difference between lift force and transverse vibration suddenly changes from almost 0 180 except for the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 with the increase of surface roughness the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch of the cylinder viv gradually decreases and the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 0 0 005 and 0 01 is 8 5 7 0 and 6 5 respectively for a rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 the reduced velocity corresponding to phase switch is 10 0 4 3 characteristics of rough cylinder viv trajectory fig 9 show the viv trajectories of the rough cylinder under different reduced velocities the viv trajectories of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in fig s3 s4 in the supporting information from fig 9 and s3 s4 it can be seen that in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinder mainly conducts viv with the shape of 8 and there is also the phenomenon of chaotic motion trajectory the rough cylinder undergoes four rounds chaotic trajectory combined with fig 8 and s1 s2 it can be seen that the chaotic vibration trajectories of the rough cylinder are closely related to its multi frequency vibration and mainly occurs in the process of the different frequency branch switching the reduced velocity range corresponding to the chaotic motion of different rough cylinder is shown in table 3 the results of surface roughness k s d 0 00 in table 3 are obtained from the numerical simulation results of han et al 2018 when u 2 5 the rough cylinder will undergo the first round chaotic vibration at this time the streamwise vibration frequency is locked to the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water and the transverse vibration frequency is affected by the streamwise vibration frequency which shows multi frequency vibration and causes the cylinder trajectory to become chaotic when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the first frequency branch to the second frequency branch the cylinder enters into the second round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the second round chaotic vibration is u 4 0 4 0 and 3 5 respectively at which time the rough cylinder starts to enter the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the second frequency branch to the third frequency branch the cylinder enters into the third round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the third round chaotic vibration is u 6 5 5 5 5 5 6 5 respectively at which time the rough cylinders are still in the lock in interval when the rough cylinder viv transforms from the third frequency branch to the fourth frequency branch the cylinder enters into the fourth round chaotic vibration the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 corresponding to the fourth round chaotic vibration is u 6 5 5 5 5 5 6 5 respectively at this time the cylinder viv will leave the lock in interval and return to the vibration with st frequency in addition to the chaotic vibrations of the above four rounds the vibration trajectory of the rough cylinder in the other reduced velocity range is shaped like an 8 or a crescent shape it is worth noting that when the reduced velocity u 5 5 6 5 the vibration trajectory of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is droplet shape compared with the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder corresponding to chaotic motion tends to advance and one more round of chaotic motion occurs 4 4 vortex shedding wake characteristics of the rough cylinder fig 10 are the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder at different reduced velocities the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 02 can be found in figs s5 s6 in the supporting information as shown in fig 10 and s5 s6 similar to the numerical simulation results of the smooth cylinder of han et al 2018 the rough cylinders also exist ss 2s 2t and 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 however the reduced velocity range of various wake vortex shedding patterns of the rough cylinders is different from that of smooth cylinders which is mainly related to the amplitude of the streamwise and transverse vibration and the phase difference of the transverse vibration response and the lift force in addition the rough cylinders also produce two wake vortex shedding pattern that smooth cylinders do not have namely p s and 2c the reduced velocity ranges corresponding to the wake vortex shedding pattern of each rough cylinder are shown in table 4 the results of roughness k s d 0 00 in the table 4 are obtained from the numerical simulation results of han et al 2018 when the reduced velocity u 2 5 the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 is p s when the reduced velocity u 3 0 the wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder with surface roughness k s d 0 02 is 2c it can be seen from table 4 and fig 10 and s5 s6 that with the increase of surface roughness the reduced velocity range corresponding to the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder is gradually reduced indicating that the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the generation of 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder different from smooth cylinder rough cylinder also produces 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the lower reduced velocity range however in the higher reduced velocity range when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the generation of 2p wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder which change to 2s wake vortex shedding pattern gao et al 2018a 2018b believed that compared with smooth cylinders surface roughness had no effect on the wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder the present study of rough cylinder viv shows that the surface roughness has a significant effect on the wake vortex shedding pattern of the cylinder the reason why these two conclusions are so different is that the reynolds number corresponding to these two studies is different which leads to the different influence degree of surface roughness on the viscous sublayer of cylinder surface 5 conclusion in this study a modified model of velocity gradient on a rough cylindrical wall is introduced to compile a program for calculating velocity gradient on a rough riser wall and the model is embedded into a numerical program for calculating cylinder viv the rough cylinder viv with surface roughness k s d 0 005 0 01 0 02 in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 were systematically studied the numerical results of the rough cylinder viv are compared with those of the smooth cylinder viv and it is found that the rough cylinder viv also has ss branch as branch initial branch super upper branch and lower branch compared with the smooth cylinder the reduced velocity of the rough cylinder corresponding with multiple frequencies and chaotic motions tends to move forward and there is one more round chaotic motion when the reduced velocity is low the reduced velocity range of multi frequency and chaotic motion of the rough cylinder is smaller than that of the smooth cylinder and the surface roughness of the cylinder has effects of inhibiting chaotic motion when the reduced velocity is high compared with the smooth cylinder the reduced velocity range of the rough cylinder corresponding with chaotic motion tends to increase and the surface roughness of the cylinder has effects of promoting chaotic motion similar to the smooth cylinder in the range of reduced velocity u 2 0 14 0 the rough cylinder also has 2s 2t and 2p wake vortex shedding patterns however the reduced velocity of various wake vortex shedding patterns of the rough cylinder are different from that of the smooth cylinder which is mainly related to the vibration amplitude of the streamwise and transverse directions and the phase differences of the transverse vibration response and the lift force in addition rough cylinders also produce two wake vortex shedding patterns that smooth cylinders do not have namely p s and 2c with the increase of roughness the reduced velocity range corresponding to the 2t wake vortex shedding pattern of the rough cylinder is gradually reduced indicating that the surface roughness of the cylinder will inhibit the formation of 2t wake vortex shedding pattern different from smooth cylinder rough cylinder also produces 2p wake vortex shedding pattern in the low reduced velocity range but in the high reduced velocity range when the surface roughness k s d 0 005 and 0 01 the surface roughness of cylinder will suppress the generation of 2p wake vortex shedding pattern which changes to 2s wake vortex shedding pattern credit authorship contribution statement xiangxi han resources conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original

20974,pumpjet propulsor pjp is widely used in various underwater vehicles recently two types of pjp the stator rotor pjp the rotor is behind the stator and the rotor stator pjp the rotor is in front of the stator are designed to investigate the difference of the hydrodynamic performance between those two pjps numerical simulations based on the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes model are carried out results show that the rotor stator pjp has a better balanced torque character than that of the stator rotor pjp in addition the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces acting on each rotor blade is the stator blade passage frequency and its harmonics while that of each stator blade is the rotor blade passage frequency and its harmonics the wake vortex structure and the evolution mechanism of both pjps are discussed and compared spiral precession and double helix breakdown of hub vortex are observed for the stator rotor pjp the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet for both pjps is discussed the short wave instability and the mutual inductance instability of tip vortices for pjps are discussed the instability of tip and hub vortices of the rotor stator pjp is more likely to occur keywords pumpjet propulsor hydrodynamic performance unsteady forces the vortex evolution 1 introduction in recent years various novel propellers such as the waterjet the ducted propeller and pumpjet have been employed on both ships and underwater vehicles among them considerable attention has been paid to the pumpjet propulsor pjp due to its superior hydrodynamic cavitation and noise performance henderson 1974 mc cormick et al defined that the pjp consists of a stationary blade row or called as stator a rotating blade row or called as rotor and a shroud enclosing them eisenhuth and mc cormick 2012 herderson suggested that pjp is similar with the ducted fan engine used for aeroplane and is a rotating propeller operated in a close fitting duct henderson et al 1964 in addition wang et al proposed a new type of pjp that consists of two contra rotating vane systems and a stator vane system which is installed behind the rotors wang et al ruxu in this paper pjp is defined as a hydrodynamic propulsor that consists of a stator a rotor and a duct nouri et al 2013 the supporting fin is not included in the definition since supporting fins may not be needed for some pjps the new type of pjp such as the contra rotating pjp are not included here the stator is a stationary vane system which is fixed within the duct the rotor is a rotating vane system operating within the duct the duct is an axisymmetric shroud that is coaxial with the rotor and stator according to the relative position of the rotor and stator pjp can be divided into two types the stator rotor pjp which means the rotor is behind the stator is abbreviated to the s r pjp and the rotor stator pjp is abbreviated to the r s pjp the r s pjp is also called as the post swirl pjp and the s r pjp is called as the pre swirl pjp the schematic diagram of those two types of pjps is shown as fig 1 the pjp has a great hydrodynamic performance compared with the single propeller the stator can produce counter torque to balance the rotating torque caused by the rotor in addition the single rotor reduces the mechanical complexities of conventional contra rotating propellers das et al 2006 therefore since the birth of the pumpjet propeller research of pjp black bruce et al 1974 has grown rapidly at the beginning the research of hydrodynamic performances of pjp was mainly focused on the experiment suryanarayana et al did a lot of works in this field which contains the experiment of pjp in the wind tunnel and the cavitation water tunnel suryanarayana et al rao suryanarayana et al ramji suryanarayana et al saiju in their experiment propulsor characteristics the self propulsor point of the pjp model and tunnel blockage effects were studied in addition some theories of pjp were developed theoretical derivations of the energy relationships illustrated that values of propulsive efficiency approaching 100 were attainable using modern state of the art pjps evanbar and thurston recently with the rapid growth of computing power more and more researchers use computational fluid dynamics cfd method to study the hydrodynamic performance of pjp a lot of work has been done on the study of flow simulation of the r s pjp cfd analysis of two high speed underwater bodies fitted with a r s pjp was carried out to examine the flow phenomenon of pjp das et al 2006 the flow of a r s pjp with several different accelerating and decelerating ducts were calculated and discussed using cfd huyer and dropkin 2011 the open water performance and the rotor tip flow about a r s pjp with 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades was discussed lu et al sahoo lu et al 2092 the effect of different rotor tip clearances on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp was numerically studied qin et al ke the hydrodynamic performance of a post swirl pjp with 13 rotor blades and 11 stator blades under the openwater and behind hull condition was studied the obtained results show that the stator can create additional thrust in the behind hull condition shirazi et al 2019 in addition the panel method combined with tip leakage vortex model is also used to predict the steady state hydrodynamic characteristics of pjp wang et al 2019 based on the study of hydrodynamic performance some people studied the hydrodynamic noise of the r s pjp qin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 as for the research of the s r pjp there are relatively fewer studies this type of propeller was originally called as the duct propeller with pre swirl stators and was considered as a kind of ducted propeller instead of a pjp huyer et al conducted a wind tunnel experiment of a pre swirl pjp to measure the steady wake flow using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in addition the pjp model was tested in a water tunnel to measure the force the effect of different stator geometries on the flow of pjp was discussed huyer et al 2012 rao et al studied frequency characteristics of unsteady forces arising from hydrodynamic interactions between the rotor and stators of a pjp with pre swirl stators qiang rao et al 2013 in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the study of the evolution of propeller wake vortex most of them are focused on the single propeller and the duct propeller felli et al felli et al 2011 experimentally studied the evolution of tip and the hub vortices in the wake of a e779a propeller model flow velocities were measured by laser doppler velocimeter ldv and visualizations of vortices were performed by means of two high speed cameras additional experiments about vortex of propellers were carried out using both hydrophones and 2d piv particle image velocimetry felli et al 2002 2006 2008 furthermore large eddy simulation les has been used for simulations of the wake vortex of propeller kumar et al kumar mahesh studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller using les the morphology and evolution of tip and hub vortices were well captured although decent predictions were obtained simulations were very time consuming the mesh size used for les simulation is 181 million in his research in addition posa et al posa et al balaras simulated wake vortices of a 7 blade notional submarine propeller using les in which a cylindrical grid composed of about 840 million nodes is used an overall computational cost of about 1 5 million core hours is needed for one case hence les simulation is so time consuming and expensive that it is difficult to widely used in engineering then the hybrid rans les models reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation large eddy simulation which include detached eddy simulation des shur et al 1999 the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes spalart et al 2006 the stress blended eddy simulation sbes menter 2016 have been developed to avoid the high resolution requirements of les the wake vortices of ducted and non ducted propellers are compared based on the des method gong et al 2018 additional research using des for marine propellers can be found in references muscari et al 2013 mascio et al 2014 dubbioso et al 2013 in the research of pjp qin et al 2019 studied a the wake vortices of a r s pjp 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades using des results showed that the sawtooth duct has a significant effect on the morphology of wake vortices of pjp li et al 2020 compared different hybrid rans les models in terms of wake vortices simulation of a s r pjp as discussed before numerous researchers have investigated the hydrodynamic performance of the r s pjp and the s r pjp however to the authors best knowledge there is little work that directly compares the hydrodynamic performance of those two types of pjp it is worthwhile to investigate the difference of the flow field between the r s pjp and the s r pjp in this paper a study is carried out to investigate differences of the hydrodynamic performance and wake vortices between those two types of pjp this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the background of pjp the numerical methodology is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the model the numerical set up in addition simulation results are compared with the experimental data for validation in section 4 differences of the hydrodynamic performance between the r s pjp and the s r pjp are discussed from three aspects hydrodynamic coefficients unsteady forces and the vortex structure and evolution finally conclusions are made in section 5 2 numerical methodology in this paper the pumpjet propulsor is working under water and only the hydrodynamic performance is discussed in the case of non cavitation therefore the flow is an incompressible and single phase fluid flow the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations can be written as the continuity equation and momentum conservations as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j s j where ρ is the fluid density x i and x j i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 are the cartesian coordinate components respectively u i and u j are the components of the absolute velocity in the inertial system p is the pressure and t is the time ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stresses s j is defined as the generalised source term μ is the dynamic viscosity firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps are predicted based on unsteady rans simulation combined with the shear stress transport sst k ω model the sst k ω turbulence model was designed to give a highly accurate prediction of the onset and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients by the inclusion of transport effects into the formulation of the eddy viscosity this results in a major improvement in terms of flow separation predictions based on the research of bardina et al bardina et al coakley the sst k ω model does the best overall job in predicting the complex flow involving separation compared with the k ε turbulence model and the one equation model of spalart and allmaras hence this model was selected to simulate the flow of pumpjet propulsor in a lot of studies lu et al sahoo lu et al 2092 qin et al ke qin et al 2019 motallebi nejad et al 2017 additional details about this model can be found in the reference menter 1994 then improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes model shur et al 2008 is used in this paper to precisely capture the structure and evaluation of vortices

different pjp models the s r pjp and the r s pjp are presented parameters of pjps are shown in table 1 in the table n r is the numbe of rotor blades and n s denotes the number of stator blades d r is the mean diameter of rotor blade and d d is the maximum diameter of the duct l d is the length of the duct the s r pjp with 6 rotor blades and 8 stator blades is designed for a big underwater vehicle a 1 20 scale up model is used here the scale of the numerical model is 1 20 of that of the experimental model which is the same as the water tunnel test model the r s pjp with 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades is designed for a high velocity autonomous underwater vehicle auv this model is the 1 1 model fitted on the auv the average diameter of rotor blade of the s r and the r s pjp is d r 1 0 1664 m and d r 2 0 2300 m respectively the maximum diameter of duct is d d 1 0 22 m for the s r pjp while d d 2 0 26 m for the r s pjp for both models lengths of duct are same with l d 0 17 m in addition tip clearances between the rotor and duct for both models are all 1 mm fig 2 shows 3 d models of those two types of pjps note that rotor blades are painted red and stator blades are marked blue 3 2 computational domain and mesh fig 3 a and b show the computational domain used in this paper for the s r pjp and the r s pjp respectively for both models the coordinate origin is located in the center of the rotor and the size of those two computational domains is based on the maximum diameter of the duct d d as shown in fig 3 both computational domains are a cylinder with 10 d d diameter extending from 6 d d to 14 d d in the streamwise direction where d d equals to d d 1 for the s r pjp and d d 2 for the r s pjp divisions of both computational domains are the same the total domain is divided into four parts the far field domain the near field domain the rotor domain and the stator domain the selection of near field domain is key to obtain accurate prediction of the flow field around pjps with a minimized mesh size here a cylinder with 1 5d diameter and 5d length is chosen according to prior research qin et al 2019 the z axes of the near field and the far field domain coincide with the rotating axis of pjp one thing should be mentioned here is that coordinate origins of those two pjps are different due to different locations of rotor high quality structured grids are generated for both pjps and details of grids are shown in fig 4 the grid of blades can be seen in fig 4 a fig 4 b shows the duct surface mesh the topological structure of the two grids is the same outer o block grids are generated around surfaces of blades to well simulate the boundary layer fig 4 c gives the mesh in the middle section y z plane and one of its zoom in view can be seen in fig 4 d the mesh in the wake of pjp is obviously refined to obtain well capture of wake vortices as discussed before there is a tip clearance equals 1 mm between the rotor blade and the inner surface of duct with the high rotating speed of rotor blades violent flow takes place in such a small gap in order to accurately capture the generation of tip vortex the 1 mm tip clearance is divided into about 31 layers here the reynolds number of pjp is defined as re ρ c 1 0 r π n d r 2 v 2 μ where c 1 0 r is the chord length of the rotor blade at 1 0r and n is the rotational speed r s and μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity the re of the s r pjp and the r s pjp ranges form 8 5 10 5 to 1 8 10 9 in order to carry out grid independence test 3 different grids coarse medium and fine grids of the s r pjp are generated whose parameters are shown in table 2 the height of the first layer for all the three grids is the same with the mean y value of pjp surfaces equals to 5 and a growth rate of 1 05 the determine of y value had already been studied in prior research qin et al 2019 the difference of those three grids is the mesh density details of blade surface mesh of those three kinds of grids are shown in fig 6 the node number around the airfoil of blades for the coarse grid is 80 while 120 and 180 for the medium and the fine grid respectively for the fine grid considering the simulation of tip vortices a special refinement at the tip are made as shown in fig 6 c in order to accurately capture the generation and development of vortices meshes in the region around the rotor and stator blades inside the duct and the wake of pjp are obviously refined which is clearly visualized in fig 5 the maximum length of cells is defined as δ m a x m a x δ x δ y δ z where δ x δ y δ z is the length of cells in the x y and z direction respectively considering the development of wake we use the grid size at 1 d r downstream of the duct as the judgment basis for the coarse grid the maximum size of cells at 1 d r downstream of the duct is δ max 2 d r while 1 5 d r and 1 d r for the medium and fine grid the total number of cells for the coarse grid of the s r pjp is 8 38 10 6 while that of the medium and the fine grid corresponds to 1 26 10 7 and 2 46 10 7 respectively fig 4 shows the fine grid of the s r pjp and the r s pjp as for the r s pjp the total cell number equals to 1 01 10 7 and 2 57 10 7 for the medium grid and the fine grid respectively as shown in fig 3 boundary conditions of the r s and the s r pjp are similar the rotor domain of both models is set as a rotational domain with a same rotation speed of 1200 revolutions per minute rpm the inlet is set as the velocity inlet with different speed according different j values the outlet is a pressure outlet surface with an average static pressure of 1 atm atmosphere the turbulence intensity in the simulation is 5 furthermore the piso algorithm is used the pressure is discretized by the second order scheme and the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate in addition the bounded second order implicit time discretization scheme is used in the unsteady simulation the time step size is determined by using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number which is defined as c f l δ t u δ m i n δ m i n is the minimum grid size and u is calculated using the far field inlet velocity the flow of pjp is solved by ansys fluent version 16 ansys inc furthermore the overall computation cost per case using the fine grid is about 20000 core hours 3 3 validation cases the model of the s r pjp is designed by ourself to validate the cfd simulation results the hydrodynamic experiment of this s r pjp model was carried out in the water tunnel of science and technology on water jet propulsion laboratory marine design and research institute of china the experimental data of hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp can be found in references li et al 2020 the size of the experimental model is the same as that of the simulation model of the s r pjp model used in this paper one thing should be mentioned here is that there are some inevitable differences between the experimental model and numerical simulation model in experimental model for the need of tool processing there is a rounded corner with 5 mm radius at the root of blades in addition clearances between the rotor shaft and the stator shaft are also ignored in the numerical simulation therefore it is understandable if numerical simulation results are slightly different from experimental data the water tunnel has a speed that ranges 0 15 m s and test conditions for this experiment are j 0 2 1 2 with a motor speed 1200 rpm table 3 lists the definition of the non dimensional physical quantities used in the following research in the table n is the rotation speed v denotes the far field inlet flow velocity d r is the diameter of rotor blades ρ is the fluid density t r t s and t d are the thrust generated by rotor stator and duct respectively and q r and q s are the torque of rotor and stator the total thrust of the pjp is defined as k t k t r k t s k t d while the total torque of the pjp is defined as k q k q r for the s r pjp and the r s pjp the v d r and k t r etc are changed according to different models in order to validate the numerical simulation numerical results of hydrodynamic coefficients of the s r pjp are compared with the experiment data in the numerical simulation three different methods the rans simulation combined with the sst k ω turbulence model the unsteady simulation combined with the sst k ω model and the iddes simulation are carried out to simulate the flow of pjp using the medium mesh the numerical results are shown in fig 7 in the unsteady rans and iddes simulation the time step is set as the time taken for rotor blade to rotate 1 δ t 1 4 e 4 s 30 rotation cycles are calculated for each case and the average value of the last 15 cycles is taken as the final hydrodynamic coefficient numerical results are compared to the experimental data and the relative error is defined as δ k t r k t r n u m k t r e x p k t r e x p and δ k q r k q r n u m k q r e x p k q r e x p as we all know that multiple reference frame mrf model and the transient sliding mesh model are usually used in the flow simulation of turbomachinery in the rans simulation the mrf model also called as the frozen rotor approach is used while the sliding mesh model is used in unsteady rans u rans simulation in order to quantitatively evaluate the difference between those two model in predicting hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp results of rans and u rans simulation are compared in fig 7 the results show the result of u rans the blue point in the figure is more consistent with the experimental value the difference can be seen more clearly from results in table 4 at j 1 0 the design work point of the s r pjp the relative errors of rans results for k t r and k q r are 5 70 and 6 18 while results of u rans are only 2 95 and 2 69 respectively the rans predictions show a significant discrepancy with a maximum error of 7 09 hence the mrf model fails to simulate the flow for those turbomachinery with a strong rotor stator interaction such as pjp with reasonable accuracy in addition in order to accurately capture vortex structures of pjps the iddes simulation is carried out and hydrodynamic coefficient predictions are shown in fig 7 and table 4 results show that predictions of iddes are almost the same with that of u rans and have a great agreement with the experimental data as shown in table 4 the relative error of iddes is smallest in those three models δ k t r and δ k q r at j 1 0 is only 1 93 and 2 24 respectively although relative errors in the low and high j cases are relatively higher the maximum relative error of iddes results in the calculated j range 0 2 1 2 is only 4 48 considering the manufacturing error of experimental model the error is acceptable in summary the hydrodynamic performance coefficient predicted by the unsteady rans simulation and iddes simulation are all reliable compared with the experiment data for the turbo machinery with a strong rotor stator interaction such as pjp the unsteady simulation combined with the sliding mesh model is recommended 3 4 grid and time step independence tests next grid and time step independence tests are carried out for simplicity only the results of iddes are given below here three different grids of the s r pjp coarse grid medium grid and fine grid are used to simulate the flow in different j cases table 5 shows results of grid convergence analysis in the simulation a time step δ t 1 4 e 4 s the time taken for rotor blade rotate 1 is used based on the theory of roache celik et al coleman the grid convergency index gci of hydrodynamic coefficient for the s r pjp is calculated in case of j 0 4 and 1 0 according to table 5 the numerical uncertainty in the medium grid solution g c i m e d i u m 32 for the k t r k t s and k q r has a maximum uncertainty of 2 74 at j 0 4 therefore hydrodynamic coefficients shows a good convergence as the grid is refined considering the time consuming of computation the medium grid is selected in the hydrodynamic performance study and the fine grid is used in iddes simulation to simulate vortices of pjps in addition in order to carry out time step independence verification three different time steps δ t 2 t 1 t and 0 5 t are selected where t is the time taken for the rotor blades to rotate 1 iddes simulations of the s r pjp in the case j 1 0 are carried out the average of the last 15 rotation periods is taken to predict hydrodynamic coefficients results with different time steps are compared in table 6 as shown k t r and k q r increase gradually and approach to the experimental value as time step decreases in addition the effect of time step on the drag coefficient of rotor is shown as fig 8 as shown k t r slightly decreases as the time step changes from 2t to 0 5t after it becomes steady all k t r values show periodic fluctuations the prediction show good convergence with different time steps considering the rapid increase of computational cost resulted from small time step δ t 1 t is used in the rest of this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 the comparison of the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps in order to compare the hydrodynamic performance of those two pjps the flow field of the s r and the r s pjp under different work conditions are simulated the rotational speed of rotor blades for both models remains unchanged 1200 revolutions per minute rpm while the inlet flow velocity is changed according to the advance coefficient j the calculated range of j in this paper is 0 2 3 2 as discussed before the unsteady simulation combined with the sst k ω turbulence model is used to predict hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp the definition of hydrodynamic coefficients has been given before fig 9 a shows the comparison of open water efficiency η of those two pjps in the range of j 0 2 3 2 for the s r pjp the efficiency will be negative when j 1 6 which is not shown in the figure as shown the trends of η for both models are similar which increase first and then decrease with increasing j the s r pjp has a maximum η of 58 49 at j 1 0 while the r s pjp reaches its maximum η of 64 56 at j 2 0 the maximum η of the r s pjp is about 6 higher than that of the s r pjp which shows that the r s pjp has a better maximum efficiency than the s r pjp moreover the s r pjp has better efficiency under small j conditions while the r s pjp is more suitable for high j working condition it is also why the r s pjp is mainly used as the propulsion system of small and high speed auvs while the low speed and heavy duty vehicles are usually equipped with the s r pjp the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps are shown in fig 9 b and c for both models it can be seen that the thrust coefficients k t k t r and k t s all decrease with increasing j the thrust percentages provided by the rotor the stator and the duct of the s r pjp is compared with the r s pjp in fig 10 the proportion of thrust generated by rotor stator and duct in total thrust is expressed as k t r k t k t s k t and k t d k t as percentages respectively a negative value indicates that the resistance is generated rather than thrust considering the big difference of j range of those two pjps we only consider the cases at j 0 6 1 4 it can be clearly seen that the thrust distributions of those two pjps are quite different as shown for the r s pjp the thrust component percentage provided by stator varies from 21 to 26 in the case j 0 6 1 4 on the other hand for the s r pjp the stator thrust percentage varies from 19 to 37 with j changes from 0 6 to 1 4 in other words the stator of the s r pjp always provides resistance while the stator of the r s pjp always provides thrust in j 0 6 1 4 furthermore the rotor of the r s pjp provide about 60 78 of total thrust in j 0 6 1 4 while it of the s r pjp varies from 115 to 426 of total thrust hence the rotor of the s r pjp provides nearly all the thrust of the propulsor in the calculated j range this is also the most significant difference of hydrodynamic performance between the two types of pjp in addition the thrusts generated by the duct all decrease with increasing j for both pjps especially the thrust of the duct gradually changes from thrust to resistance with increasing j see fig 9 b and c for the s r pjp the duct will provide considerable resistance 289 at j 1 4 which offset most of the thrust generated by the rotor at high j cases of course this is also due to the shape of duct a careful duct design is very important in the design process of pjp the torque generated by the propeller is an important parameter for underwater vehicles which will significantly affect the maneuverability of the vehicles if the propeller provide an unbalanced torque it must be offset by adjusting the control surface to maintain a zero torque of body to maintain the attitude of the vehicle one of the significant advantages of pjp compared with single propeller is that it has good torque balance characteristic however even the pjp is well designed the torque of stator is hard to completely offset the torque generated by the rotor in this paper the moment unbalance ratio between the rotor and stator is defined as δ k q k q r k q s k q r the similar definition can be seen in another paper li et al 2020 there is an obvious difference about the moment unbalance between the r s pjp and the s r pjp see fig 11 in the figure the torque of the stator is represented as k q s owing negative value of k q s it is shown that the k q s of the s r pjp increases with increasing j which is opposite to the change trend of k q r the difference between them first decreases and then increases with increasing j with the largest value about 0 08 at j 1 6 see fig 11 a that s also why the k q changes from 9 j 0 6 to about 85 j 1 4 however k q s and k q r of the r s pjp decrease with increasing j the difference between them gradually decreases with increasing j with a maximum value of about 0 05 at j 0 6 as a result the k q decreases from about 9 j 0 6 to about 5 j 1 4 generally speaking the r s pjp has a better torque balance performance than the s r pjp the difference between the torques of the two pjps is due to the different flow field for the s r pjp the pre stator has a pre rotation effect on the incoming flow and provide a better angle of attack of rotor blades in the design process of pjp we first designed the rotor and then design the stator at the best working condition j of the rotor a proper installation angle of the pre stator blades is selected to obtain a opposite torque to the rotor to get a total torque about 0 of course our design is not perfect and the total torque equals to 0 at about j 0 8 see fig 11 a owing to the fixed installation angle of stator blades the angle of attack of stator blades will have a big change due to the rapid change of incoming flow velocity at low and high j cases further causes the big change of k q s that s the reason why the k q of the s r pjp has such a big change range for the r s pjp the post stator works in the rotating wake of the rotor hence the direction of inflow velocity for the stator blades is about a fixed value associated with the difference between the installation angle of rotor blades and that of stator blades this is also the reason why k q s remains nearly unchanged at j 0 8 2 0 in order to better understand the difference of hydrodynamic performance between those two pjps the rans flow field of pjps are compared the efficiencies η of pjps are basically the same at j 1 2 so the working condition j 1 2 is selected as the analysis object fig 12 shows contours of axial velocity components of those two pjps here three different z positions are selected for further analysis z1 is located at the inlet surface of the duct z2 is the plane in the middle of rotor and stator and z3 is right behind stator for each pjp the velocity is dimensionless divided by far field incoming velocity u the axial velocity component v a and tangential velocity component v t at different z positions viewed from back to front are shown in figs 12 and 13 for the s r pjp at z1 the axial velocity in the inlet surface of duct is obviously lower than the incoming velocity due to the existence of stator blades the stator blade has a well designed installation angle whose bending direction is opposite to rotor blades with fluid flowing through the front stator z1 z2 the tangential velocity has an obvious increase with an average value v t u increases from 0 to about 0 09 as shown in fig 13 a indicating that the front stator has a pre rotation effect on the incoming flow the direction of tangential velocity is opposite to the rotation direction of rotor blade which slightly changes the angle of attack of rotor blades and results in a better load work condition of rotor blades then when fluid flows through the second stage blade z2 z3 the average tangential velocity v t v 0 decreases from 0 09 to about 0 02 as shown in fig 13 a which indicates that the rotation of the rotor well offsets the pre rotation component brought by the front stator and keeps the wake basically axial for the r s pjp when passing through the first stage blades z1 z2 the fluid is accelerated by the rotational rotor with a a sharp increase of v t u from about 0 to 0 3 seen in fig 13 b then the v t v 0 decreases rapidly to about 0 after passing through stator blades from z2 z3 which indicates that the rear stator can recover the rotational energy of the fluid very well in addition the axial velocity in the wake of the r s pjp is larger than that of the s r pjp at the same load condition j 1 2 for the s r pjp the axial velocity first decreases due to the existence of stator blades then increases by the rotation of rotor hence the s r pjp works at a relatively low speed at the same j compared to the r s pjp which will obviously help to reduce the possibility of cavitation both pjps can recover the rotational energy in the wake very well which is also the biggest advantage of pjp compared with a conventional single propeller or a duct propeller as discussed before the total torque of the propeller is about 0 which leads to a good maneuverability for the body equipped with a pjp in summary for the r s pjp the stator is located downstream of the rotor which can neutralizes the rotational velocity component caused by rotor thus the axial outflow can be straightened and practically swirl free the hydrodynamic efficiency of propulsor is improved by recovering rotational energy in the wake for the s r pjp the stator is located upstream of the rotor which can pre whirl the flow against the rotation direction of rotor then the flow is straightened then by the rotating blades so that the flow exits axially the whirl losses is significantly reduced and thereby improving the hydrodynamic efficiency of propulsor evanbar and thurston 4 2 the comparison of unsteady forces of pjps there was a brief discussion about unsteady forces of rotor and stator for the s r pjp in one of our previous paper li et al 2020 here the unsteady force of those two pjps was compared to see if those two pjps have the same frequency characteristics of unsteady forces of blades the unsteady forces of blades based on the unsteady simulation with sst k ω turbulence model of pjps are compared in the above discussion of hydrodynamic coefficients the rotational speed is fixed here we change j by varying the rotational speed of the rotor for the s r pjp the incoming flow velocity u 3 328 m s while for the r s pjp u 9 2 m s the time history of the force of each blade of the s r pjp at the case j 0 4 is shown in fig 14 blades are named in clockwise order as blade1 2 3 in addition in order to further understand its frequency domain characteristics frequency analysis is carried out using fast fourier transform fft in frequency domain analysis frequency f is normalized by f f b p f where f b p f refers to the rotor blade passing frequency f b p f n 60 n r n r p m is the rotation speed of rotor blades in addition we define the shaft rotation frequency f n and the stator blade passing frequency f s f n n 60 and f s f n n s n r and n s is the number of rotor and stator respectively for the case j 0 4 with n 3000 rpm f n 50 h z f b p f 300 h z f s 400 h z as shown in fig 14 a unsteady forces of six rotor blades are basically divided into three groups blade 1 and 4 blade 2 and 5 blade 3 and 6 and there is a 1 3 cycle phase difference between every two groups of signals amplitudes of six forces are almost the same the frequency domain analysis shows that unlike our imagination the peak of blade thrust does not appear at n f b p f but at 400 800 and 1200 which is n f s how to understand it as shown in fig 13 a for the s r pjp the fluid is divided into 8 channels after passing through 8 front stator blades hence for the rotor blade the incoming velocity field is not a constant value u like that of the far field incoming flow but a uniformly distributed velocity field of eight channels we can imagine that each rotor blade passes through these eight channels in turn with the frequency f n so the characteristic frequency of each rotor blade unsteady force is exactly f n 8 f s in summary the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of the rotor blade is n f s which is the passing frequency of the stator blade for the unsteady force of stator blades as shown in fig 14 b the frequency domain analysis shows that the characteristic frequency of the stator blade thrust is n f b p f this is easy to understand results of the s r pjp in j 1 0 and j 1 6 are given in fig 15 and fig 16 similar conclusion can be drawn the time and frequency analysis results of unsteady forces generated by blades for the r s pjp in the case j 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 are shown in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 respectively similar frequency characteristics are found that the spectrum lines of each rotor blade unsteady force show obvious peaks at f s and its harmonics hence the interaction between rotor and stator dominates the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of rotor blades regardless of the relative position of the rotor and stator in summary for both pjps characteristic frequencies of unsteady forces acting on stator blades is n f b p f the rotor blade passing frequency and its harmonics while that of rotor blades is n f s the stator blade passing frequency and its harmonics in addition some differences are found unlike the s r pjp amplitudes of fft results of 9 stator blades for the r s pjp are almost the same furthermore for the r s pjp fft amplitudes of stator unsteady forces are bigger than that of rotor blades which is opposite to the s r pjp the stronger interaction between the rotor and stator contributes to violent fluctuations of unsteady forces of stator blades of the r s pjp the analysis of the vortex structure of pjps in the following part will help to understand these differences moreover the frequency spectrum of the rotor s unsteady force of r s pjp not only has peaks at n f s but also small peaks at n f n that is the hub frequency and its harmonics especially in the case of high j cases such as j 3 0 the peaks at n f n are hardly visible in low j cases especially for unsteady forces of the stator blades the same change trend can also be seen in the results of the s r pjp here we conjecture that the frequency at n f n is related to the development of hub vortex this conjecture will be discussed further in the next section next let s discuss the frequency characteristics of the total thrust and torque of pjps fig 20 shows fft results of the thrust and torque coefficients for the s r pjp in the case j 1 0 as shown in fig 20 b the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of rotor is different from that of each rotor blade unlike peaks at n f s for the unsteady force of each rotor blade as shown in fig 15 a the fft results of k t r shows obvious peaks at 2 f b p f 3 f b p f and 4 f b p f as for the reason although the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces of six rotor blades are the same n f s phases of different forces are different see fig 15 therefore the superposition of six signals with same frequency but different phase leads to the change of characteristic frequency for total force of rotor k t r according to the fft results approximate equations of forces of six rotor blades are given mainly focus on the first three dominant frequencies f f s 2 f s and 3 f s k t r i 0 0784 0 0033 c o s 2 π 160 t ϕ 1 i 0 0002 c o s 2 π 320 t ϕ 2 i 9 e 5 c o s 2 π 480 t ϕ 3 i i 1 2 6 ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 4 120 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 1 5 120 ϕ 1 3 ϕ 1 6 0 these three group of signals at f f s with a phase difference of 120 cancel each other out that s why the peak at f f s 160 h z disappear in the fft results of k t r similarly the amplitude at 320hz of k t r is relatively small too 1 2e 5 while ϕ 3 1 ϕ 3 4 80 ϕ 3 2 ϕ 3 5 80 ϕ 3 3 ϕ 3 6 70 phases of those three group forces at 3 f s are almost same hence the amplitude at 3 f s 480 h z is strengthened this is also why the first order main frequency of k t r is 480hz in addition the signal processing at 2 f b p f and 3 f b p f shows that the amplitude of k t r at both frequencies is slightly strengthened leading to obvious peaks at 2 f b p f and 3 f b p f here those specific equations will not be listed one by one an important thing should be noted that 480hz is the common multiple of f b p f 120 h z and f s 160 h z all the forces of rotor stator and duct have the highest peak at 4 f b p f the amplitude at 480 hz has been enhanced due to the resonance phenomenon of rotor and stator blades this resonance phenomenon has been discussed before in one of our previous paper li et al 2020 in practical application we should reasonably select the number of rotor and stator blades and pay attention to avoid this resonance phenomenon in addition the characteristic frequency of the unsteady force of duct k t d is the same as that of the k t s this is easy to understand that the duct and stator are actually interconnected as a whole obvious peaks at n f b p f can be seen in the frequency spectrum curve of stator unsteady torque k q s which is consistent with that of k t s similarly the characteristic frequency of k q r is the same as that of rotor force k t r finally the characteristic frequency of total thrust of pjp k t is almost the same as that of k t r because the force of the stator and the duct is smaller than the force provided by the rotor as shown in fig 10 in addition the fluctuation amplitude of k t s of each stator blade 8e 5 is much smaller than that of rotor blade 4e 3 as shown in fig 15 therefore the characteristic frequency of the rotor dominates the characteristic frequency of overall unsteady thrust of pjp for the r s pjp see fig 21 the frequency characteristic of k t s and k t d is similar with that of the s r pjp obvious peaks at n f b p f while some differences are found in spectrum lines of k t r and k t several peaks at n f b p f and 1 f s can be found in the line of k t r the peak at 1 f s is expected due to that the characteristic frequency of each rotor blade force is n f s as for the characteristic frequencies of n f b p f it is caused by the shedding frequency of the tip vortex this will be discussed in the following part finally the characteristic frequencies of total thrust k t of the r s pjp is n f b p f this is due to that the amplitude of peaks for k t s and k t d at a level of 1e 4 is obviously bigger than that of k t r at a level of 1e 5 hence for the r s pjp the rotor blades passing frequency and its harmonics n f b p f dominate the characteristic frequency of total unsteady thrust of propulsor 4 3 the comparison of vortex evolution of pjps des simulations of those two pjps with different work conditions are carried out to analyse the vortex structure and evolution of pjps fig 22 shows the instantaneous flow field in the y z plane of the s r pjp the tip vortex can be seen clearly as low pressure region see fig 22 a which spread from z d 0 to about 1 5 the radial position of tip vortices is about r d 0 4 the near field downstream the duct is dominated by coherent tip vortices and the blade trailing edge wake see fig 22 c as shown in the experiment felli et al 2011 the wake of an e779a propeller consists of tip vortex hub vortex and a sheet of vortices shed from blade trailing edge fig 23 gives instantaneous q surfaces of the s r pjp the wake vortex of the sr pjp is similar to e779a propeller which consists of tip vortex hub vortex in addition a sheet of vortex sheds from stator trailing edge called as stator trailing vortices can be found in stator region see fig 23 b moreover a sheet of vortex sheds from rotor blade trailing edge called as rotor trailing vortices can be found in instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude see fig 24 according the definition of vortex instability transition region of felli et al 2011 the flow field of pjp is divided into four regions stator region rotor region stable region transition region and far field region among them the division of stable and transition region is based on the identification of hub vortex instability transition the transition to instability point is defined as the position at which the hub vortex starts to deviate from the straight geometry first of all let s talk about the hub vortex the hub vortex originating from the end of hub surface appears as a straight line in the stable region the straight line means that the hub vortex maintain stable in the near field downstream the hub it is also why the region is called as stable region in the transition region the hub vortex gradually twists and deforms into a spiral geometry as the vortex moves downstream to far field region the hub vortex undergoes progressive separation and deformation until breakdown a distinctive double helix can be observed in fig 23 a clearly which is similar to the visualization of hub vortex of an single propeller felli et al 2011 the hub vortex breakdown appears as this double helix geometry split from the centerline filament whose rotation direction is the same as the rotor sarpkaya 1971 here the starting point of far field region is defined as the position that the double helix break down of hub vortex is almost completed secondly the tip vortex of the s r pjp is significantly different from that of a single propeller according to the theoretical model of widnall et al widnall 1972 the instability of tip vortex of a single propeller occurs through three modes long wave instability short wave instability and mutual inductance instability mode similarly the short wave instability is observed as a smooth sinuous wave type mode saffman 1970 as shown in fig 23 a which is also same as the captured picture in the water tunnel experiment of a single propeller felli et al 2011 a clearer image of this smooth sinuous wave type mode can be seen in fig 29 j 0 4 in felli s theory felli et al 2011 the tip vortex with short wave instability shown as the local deformation of helical filament is caused by the self induced motion but for the s r pjp the self induction of the filament may not be the only reason fig 24 a gives instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude of the s r pjp the structure of tip vortex is similar with that of a duct propeller gong et al 2018 the wake of a ducted propeller is defined as the vortex system composed of hub vortex blade vortices shear layer vortices of the duct and secondary vortical structures similarly we follow this definition the structure of the duct shear layer vortex can be seen in fig 24 a the flow passing the duct surface is similar with the flow passing an airfoil the standard near wall boundary layer is formed close to walls of the duct as shown in fig 24 c the boundary layer flow on the inner wall is disturbed in advance by the tip vortex in the rotor region tip helical filaments maintains the standard spiral shape while it is gradually twisted when approaching the trailing edge of duct due to the interaction with the duct shear layer vortex see fig 23 b at the trailing edge of duct the tip vortex is greatly disturbed by the vortices shedding from the trailing edge of duct as shown in fig 23 a next to each tip spiral filament a relatively small spiral filament called as secondary tip vortex appears which gradually collapses in a short distance in summary the interaction between the primary tip vortex and duct shear layer vortex leads to the turbulence kinetic energy disturbance of tip vortex which further leads to the distortion of tip vortex and the generation of the secondary tip vortex hence the interaction between the tip vortex and duct dominates the short wave instability in the stable region the filament of tip vortex shows a twisted spiral shape which indicates that the tip vortex has begun to transform into unstable form near the trailing edge of duct finally let s talk about the trailing edge vortex which is a complex system consisting of the stator trailing edge vortex and rotor trailing edge vortex the structure of stator blade trailing edge vortex can be seen clearly from fig 23 b a sheet of vortex sheds from each stator blade trailing edge with the development of fluid in the axial direction the sheet vortex breaks up rapidly and many small vortices are generated and gradually fade out however at the root and tip of the blade small vortices gradually merge into two large vortices which are called stator tip vortex and stator root vortex these two vortices spread to the whole stator region and then stator tip vortex gradually weakens as it enters the rotor region and finally merges into the rotor tip vortex compared with stator tip vortex the stator root vortex with relatively larger rotation strength diffuses into the rotor region significantly interactions have been observed between the stator root vortex and the rotor trailing edge vortex see fig 24 b the evolution of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet undergoes a complex process of roll up kumar mahesh the trailing edge vortex breaks into smaller fragments after complete roll up which eventually dissipate in the far field region then the far field wake which consists of only tip and hub vortices is formed however in the experiment of felli et al 2011 the roll up process of trailing edge vortex is not observed while the classic leapfrogging phenomenon is captured by a camera which is caused by the adjacent helical filaments roll up around each other this mode is called the mutual inductance instability mode which appears when two adjacent rotor tip filaments pass within a distance the evolution of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex shown in this paper is different from the experiment of felli et al while is similar to the research of kumar et al kumar mahesh in his research the wake of a marine propeller dtmb 4381 is discussed based on les simulation the propeller dtmb 4381 has weaker tip vortices compared with the e779a propeller in this paper the mutual inductance between adjacent rotor tip vortices of the s r pjp is not so strong so we infer that this is also the reason why the classic leapfrogging phenomenon is not observed in the wake evolution of rotor tip vortices for the s r pjp fig 24 b gives the close up view of the x component of vorticity in the y z plane based on the instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude shown as fig 24 a we give a schematic diagram to show the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet of the s r pjp fig 24 c in the figure circles colored with red represent rotor tip vortices and blue circles show major vortices separated from the rotor blade trailing sheet vortex in addition red and blue arrows indicate their direction of rotation and the two way arrow show the mutual inductance between rotor trailing edge vortex and rotor tip vortex for the s r pjp the roll up process of rotor trailing vortex plays a significant role in the wake evolution of vortices in the near field downstream the propeller the same as the conclusion of kumar et al kumar mahesh for a single marine propeller let s discuss the evolution process of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex in the rotor region a sheet vortex is detached from every rotor blade trailing edge due to the induce of the stator root vortex the rotor trailing edge vortex breaks rapidly into small vortices see fig 24 a some small vortices are formed in the root of the stator blade with the downstream development of fluid those small vortices are mixed with the hub vortex the main part of rotor trailing vortex represented by blue circles develops gradually from the hub stable region to the transition region the rotation direction of rotor trailing is opposite to that of tip vortex shown as opposite ω x which further induces the roll up of rotor trailing root vortex upward movement of the blue circle in the radial direction following by the roll down of rotor tip vortex downward movement of the red circle in the radial direction in the stable region the roll up process of the rotor trailing vortex is not so obvious while with vortices moving into the transient region the previous rotor trailing vortex gets closer and closer to the latter rotor tip vortex the strong interaction between them makes the rotor trailing vortex split into two part see fig 24 c this also makes the rotor tip vortex becomes more unstable characterized by severe distortion and even collapse of spiral filaments a part of the rotor trailing vortex is attracted to the next tip vortex and merges with it then with the development of fluid to far field region all vortices gradually dissipate in summary the interaction between rotor trailing edge vortex and tip vortex dominates further instability of tip vortex the roll up of rotor trailing edge vortex and roll down of rotor tip vortex are main forms of this multi interaction concentrated rotor trailing vortices are generated by the roll up process and it subsequently interacts with tip vortices causing its instability in addition in the rotor region those small vortices separated from the root of rotor trailing vortex shown as gray circles flow downstream along the hub surface and it sheds from the hub surface not the end point of hub forming some small vortices rotating around the hub vortex as shown in fig 23 a similar vortex structure can be found in more paper muscari et al 2013 those small vortices approach and interact with the hub vortex with the wake evolution the experiment of felli et al 2011 shows that the hub vortex of a single propeller is stable over a long distance until the far field based on the picture captured by the camera in the far wake the tip vortex filaments tend to collide with the hub vortex causing its sudden destabilization the hub vortex of the s r pjp is obviously different the hub vortex is only stable at a short distance downstream of the propeller z d 0 5 1 and then spiral precession occurs until the double helix break down it is reasonable to think that the small vortices rotating around the hub vortex is the reason of hub vortex instability for the s r pjp the interaction between hub vortex and rotor trailing vortex is the trigger mechanism of hub vortex instability similar to the analysis of the s r pjp the wake flow of r s pjp is discussed as shown in fig 25 the position of tip vortex is reflected as the low pressure region marked by the red circle in fig 25 a with a range of z d 0 1 5 and r d about 0 4 the axial and radial distributions of the tip vortices for those two pjps are similar while the wake of s r pjp keeps longer due to the postposition of rotor in addition the wake of the s r pjp presents uniform periodic acceleration while the wake of the r s pjp is obviously more chaotic and asymmetric about z axis see fig 25 b which is due to the fact that the number of blades of the s r pjp is odd finally the most obvious difference between the two pjps is that the hub vortex of the r s pjp has no stable region and it maintains chaotic and unstable after falling off from the hub surface until breakdown in the far field region fig 26 gives instantaneous q surfaces of the r s pjp the structure of tip vortices for the r s pjp is quite different from that of the s r pjp instead of the independent helical filament structure a series of spiral filaments are attached to each other since the hub vortex of the r s pjp is always unstable the region of the r s pjp is divided into four regions rotor region stator region transition region and far field region the axial evolution of vortices of the r s pjp can be seen from fig 27 similar to the s r pjp the duct shear layer vortex is fully mixed with rotor tip vortex at the region downstream the duct the envelope of tip vortices basically keeps as a flat cylindrical surface in the transition region similarly the axial evolution mechanism of vortices in the y z plane for the r s pjp is visualized in fig 27 c the upper part of the picture is the area in the middle of stator channel while the lower part is the region behind the trailing edge of stator blade as shown a similar roll up of the rotor blade trailing edge sheet vortex is found compared with s r pjp the roll process of the r s pjp vortex occurs faster in the range of z d 1 1 5 rotor trailing vortices are drawn to rotor tip vortices quickly in addition the evolution of the stator blade trailing edge sheet vortex is also similar to the s r pjp the stator root trailing vortex is formed at the root of each stator blade and sheds from the hub surface then it interacts with the hub vortex and falls out rapidly in order to further understand the difference of tip vortices between those two pjps instantaneous q surfaces in the stator and rotor regions of those two pjps are given in fig 28 as shown for the r s pjp after shedding from the leading edge of rotor tip the rotor tip vortex impacts the stator blade the structure of tip vortices has been complicated changed due to the different number of rotor and stator blades part of the tip vortices directly impact the stator pressure surface and the other part of tip vortices impact on the stator leading edge tip and separate into several vortices so the complex interaction between the rotor tip vortex and stator blades is the reason of the tip vortex instability in addition according to felli s analysis felli et al 2011 the more number of blades propeller has the closer the axial distance between two adjacent tip vortex spiral filaments is and the more possibility the mutual inductance instability occurs compared with the s r pjp 6 rotor blades the distance between two adjacent tip spiral filaments of the r s pjp 11 rotor blades is obviously smaller see figs 23 a and fig 26 a this is also the reason why adjacent tip spiral filaments link to each other which is called mutual inductance instability the overall shape of tip vortices of the r s pjp is more like a fishing net than isolated spiral filaments in conclusion the interaction between rotor tip vortex and stator blade dominates the instability of rotor tip vortex in addition the interaction between tip vortex and duct vortex the roll up effect of rotor trailing vortex and mutual inductance of adjacent tip vortices contribute to the mutual inductance instability of rotor tip vortex then let s discuss the influence of j on the evolution of vortices of pjps as shown in fig 29 for the s r pjp it can be seen that distance that tip vortex maintains stable at j 1 0 is longest compared with that of low load condition j 1 2 and high load condition j 0 4 this conclusion seems to be quite different from felli s experiment felli et al 2011 the length of tip vortex stability region increases with increasing j for a 4 blade e779a propeller in the range of j 0 45 to 0 85 however we note that this 4 blade e779a achieves the maximum efficiency at about j 0 9 therefore we believe that the stable length of tip vortex is not only related to j but also related to the point of maximum efficiency at the optimal operating point the length of tip vortex spiral filament maintaining stability is the longest this conclusion is worthy of further study according to the instability transition point of hub vortex the wake region of the s r pjp is divide into stable region and transition region it can be seen from the figure that with the decrease of j the length of the stable region first increases and then decreases which is related to the change of the stable length of tip vortex the pitch of rotor tip vortex p is marked in the figure see fig 29 a and the helical pitch of a single rotor tip spiral filament should be n r p for those two pjps the pitch p increases with the increase of j this is also consistent with the conclusion of okulov 2004 that the transition to the instability of tip vortices for a single propeller shows a clear dependence on the spiral to spiral distance on the basis of the conclusion our study shows that the occurrence of the s r pjp instability not only depent on the spiral to spiral distance but also related to the optimal efficiency point whether the conclusion is suitable for the single propeller or the duct propeller is worth further discussion for the r s pjp as discussed earlier since there is no stable region for tip vortex in the wake of pjp it is impossible to give the specific length of the stable region for rotor tip vortex however the larger j is the larger the pitch p will be and the weaker the mutual inductance instability caused by the interaction of adjacent spiral filaments will be of course the influence of j on the spatial evolution of vortices obviously contains a very complex mechanism here due to the length of the article we will not discuss them one by one the specific content will be discussed in our next paper in order to study the wake dynamic of the s r pjp 13 probes are selected which located in the region of tip vortices and hub vortex the specific location of probes can be seen from fig 30 a the power spectrum density psd of the turbulence kinetic energy at those probes are computed and discussed first of all spectrums of p1 p6 have obvious peaks at n f b p f which indicates that the main characteristic frequency of tip vortex is still blade passing frequency fig 31 in addition several peaks at n f n i e 2 4 8 10 are found it shows that shaft frequency harmonics also contribute the fluctuation of turbulence kinetic energy of tip vortices the amplitude of psd indicates the intensity of the pulsation a process of energy transfer from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics at tip vortices which is similar with the experimental results of the psd of the radial velocity in the wake of a four bladed propeller felli et al 2011 is found see fig 32 spectrums of p6 p8 has obvious peaks at blade harmonics n f b p f the peak value at 1 f b p f gradually decreases from p6 to p8 until it nearly disappear further downstream at p9 corresponding to this process the amplitude at 4 f n increases from p6 to p8 then at p9 the peak at 4 f n almost disappeared and is replaced by the peak at 2 f n hence the process of energy transfer of the s r pjp can be characterized by a two step cascade mechanism in the first step the 1st energy transfer involves the blade harmonics i e 120 and 240 hz to 4 f n then the 2nd energy transfer refers to 4 f n to 2 f n similarly 12 probes are set up to study the vortex dynamics of the r s pjp see fig 30 b the psd results of tke are shown in fig 33 similar with the s r pjp obvious peak at n f b p f appear in spectrums of p1 p6 for the r s pjp the blade harmonics dominates the characteristic frequency of tip vortex in addition the amplitude of psd increases gradually from p1 to p4 which is caused by the instability of tip vortex on the contrary the decrease of amplitude from p5 to p8 corresponds to the diffusion process and break down process of tip vortices a similar energy transfer process is observed from fig 33 b the peak at 1 f b p f is obvious in spectrums of p5 and p6 while it disappears in the far field region at p7 and p8 at p7 several indistinct peaks at shift harmonics n f n n 4 5 6 8 9 are shown as the fluid develops downstream at p8 the peaks mainly focus at 3 f n and 4 f n compared with the s r pjp the energy transfer between frequencies of the r s pjp is much more complicated but in general the energy transfer refers to blade harmonics to shaft harmonics for both pjps spectrums of probes located behind the hub p10 p13 for the s r pjp and p9 p12 for the r s pjp show broadband spectral characteristics the expected peaks at n f b p f are not so obvious which is different from felli s experiment felli et al 2011 that the period of hub vortex is t the period of hub rotation as discussed before the effect of the roll up process of rotor trailing vortices has significant effect on the hub vortex and tip vortices which disturbs the characteristic frequency of hub vortex to analysis the effect of duct on the wake vortices of pjp two probes are selected p1 and p4 for the s r pjp and p2 and p3 for the r s pjp the p1 and p2 are located right behind the blades of the s r pjp and r s pjp respectively p4 and p3 are located right behind the duct the effect of duct on psd of tke of pjp are shown in fig 34 for the s r pjp the amplitude of the psd of tke of p4 is significantly bigger than that of p1 especially at the peak value of n f b p f as shown in figs 23 and 24 the tip vortices are strongly disturbed by the duct the original uniform spiral filaments are twisted by the interaction between tip vortices and the duct in addition some relatively small spiral filaments called secondary tip vortex are generated therefore the duct of the s r pjp causes the distortion of tip vortices and the generation of the secondary tip vortex which eventually leads to a significant increase of psd of tke of p4 for the r s pjp the amplitude of the broadband component the psd of p3 is slightly smaller than that of p2 in addition the peak at 754 hz of p2 disappears we suspect that the peak at 754 hz is caused by the shedding frequency of stator trailing edge vortex instead for p3 a new peak at about 320 hz appears which may be caused by the vortex shedding frequency of the duct in general the amplitudes of the psd of tke of p3 and p4 are almost the same as discussed before after going through the stator channel the spiral filaments of tip vortices have been broken and connects with each other forming a tip vortex envelope like fishing net at the wake of the duct some small vortices fall off the outside of the duct see fig 26 a and then is mixed with tip vortices and finally breaks down quickly in a word for the r s pjp some small vortices shed from the duct which contributes to some tonal peak component of psd furthermore it should be noted that the overall amplitude of broadband component of psd for p3 is about 4 e 7 which is much larger than that of p4 3 e 8 of the s r pjp which is consistent with the above analysis in summary an important physical phenomenon the energy transfer process from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics is found in the tip vortex region for both pjps the specific transfer process is slightly different which is related to the number of rotor and stator blades 5 conclusions in this paper in order to investigate the difference of hydrodynamic performance between two types of pumpjet propulsor two pjp models the s r pjp and the r s pjp are presented numerical simulations are carried out based on the unsteady rans method with sst k ω turbulence model and iddes approach the method is validated by comparing with the experiment data of the s r pjp in addition the grid and time step independence test are well completed furthermore openwater coefficients unsteady forces wake vortex structure and evolution mechanism of those two pjps are discussed comprehensively numerical results reveal that 1 the r s pjp has a bigger maximum openwater efficiency than the s r pjp with the same rotational speed of 1200 rpm with a 6 higher maximum openwater efficiency in this paper in addition the r s pjp has a better balanced torque performance than the s r pjp 2 the stator of the s r pjp always provides resistance while the stator of r s pjp always provides thrust in the calculated j range 3 for both pjps the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces acting on each stator blade is n f b p f the rotor blade passing frequency and its harmonics while that of each rotor blade is n f s the stator blade passing frequency and its harmonics n f b p f dominates the characteristic frequency of total unsteady thrust and torque of propulsor for both pjps 4 when the numbers of rotor blades and stator blades have a common multiple it is more likely to cause resonance which should be avoided as far as possible in the design processing of pjp wake vortices of pjps are a complex vortex system which consist of tip vortex hub vortex two sheets of vortices shed from rotor and stator blade trailing edges and duct shear layer vortex a the hub vortex for the s r pjp the hub vortex shedding from the hub surface and maintain stable as a straight line in the near field region then undergoes progressive separation and deformation until double helix breakdown in the farfield however the hub vortex of the r s pjp has no stable region and it maintains unstable after falling off from the hub b the duct shear layer vortex the duct shear layer vortex is formed behind the duct for both pjps and the interaction between it and the rotor tip vortex enhances the instability of tip vortex the secondary tip vortex is induced c the rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet an important physical phenomenon the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet are found and discussed for both pjps concentrated rotor trailing vortices are generated by the roll up of rotor trailing edge wake and it subsequently interacts with rotor tip vortices causing its wake instability d tip vortices the axial evaluation of tip vortices of pjps is similar to that of a single propeller for the s r pjp the short wave instability of the helical filament is observed and tip vortices of the r s pjp mainly occur through mutual inductance instability mode due to the existence of the post stator the overall shape of tip vortices of the r s pjp is more like a fishing net than isolated spiral filaments the interaction between rotor tip vortex and stator blade contributes to the mutual inductance of adjacent tip vortices the energy transfer process from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics is found in the tip vortex region for both pjps in general the stable wake region of tip and hub vortices of the r s pjp is smaller than the s r pjp the instability of vortices the r s pjp is more likely to occur the research of this paper aims to give some insights to pjp designers and help researchers understand the hydrodynamic performance and wake vortex structure between those two kinds of pumpjet propulsor

20974,pumpjet propulsor pjp is widely used in various underwater vehicles recently two types of pjp the stator rotor pjp the rotor is behind the stator and the rotor stator pjp the rotor is in front of the stator are designed to investigate the difference of the hydrodynamic performance between those two pjps numerical simulations based on the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes model are carried out results show that the rotor stator pjp has a better balanced torque character than that of the stator rotor pjp in addition the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces acting on each rotor blade is the stator blade passage frequency and its harmonics while that of each stator blade is the rotor blade passage frequency and its harmonics the wake vortex structure and the evolution mechanism of both pjps are discussed and compared spiral precession and double helix breakdown of hub vortex are observed for the stator rotor pjp the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet for both pjps is discussed the short wave instability and the mutual inductance instability of tip vortices for pjps are discussed the instability of tip and hub vortices of the rotor stator pjp is more likely to occur keywords pumpjet propulsor hydrodynamic performance unsteady forces the vortex evolution 1 introduction in recent years various novel propellers such as the waterjet the ducted propeller and pumpjet have been employed on both ships and underwater vehicles among them considerable attention has been paid to the pumpjet propulsor pjp due to its superior hydrodynamic cavitation and noise performance henderson 1974 mc cormick et al defined that the pjp consists of a stationary blade row or called as stator a rotating blade row or called as rotor and a shroud enclosing them eisenhuth and mc cormick 2012 herderson suggested that pjp is similar with the ducted fan engine used for aeroplane and is a rotating propeller operated in a close fitting duct henderson et al 1964 in addition wang et al proposed a new type of pjp that consists of two contra rotating vane systems and a stator vane system which is installed behind the rotors wang et al ruxu in this paper pjp is defined as a hydrodynamic propulsor that consists of a stator a rotor and a duct nouri et al 2013 the supporting fin is not included in the definition since supporting fins may not be needed for some pjps the new type of pjp such as the contra rotating pjp are not included here the stator is a stationary vane system which is fixed within the duct the rotor is a rotating vane system operating within the duct the duct is an axisymmetric shroud that is coaxial with the rotor and stator according to the relative position of the rotor and stator pjp can be divided into two types the stator rotor pjp which means the rotor is behind the stator is abbreviated to the s r pjp and the rotor stator pjp is abbreviated to the r s pjp the r s pjp is also called as the post swirl pjp and the s r pjp is called as the pre swirl pjp the schematic diagram of those two types of pjps is shown as fig 1 the pjp has a great hydrodynamic performance compared with the single propeller the stator can produce counter torque to balance the rotating torque caused by the rotor in addition the single rotor reduces the mechanical complexities of conventional contra rotating propellers das et al 2006 therefore since the birth of the pumpjet propeller research of pjp black bruce et al 1974 has grown rapidly at the beginning the research of hydrodynamic performances of pjp was mainly focused on the experiment suryanarayana et al did a lot of works in this field which contains the experiment of pjp in the wind tunnel and the cavitation water tunnel suryanarayana et al rao suryanarayana et al ramji suryanarayana et al saiju in their experiment propulsor characteristics the self propulsor point of the pjp model and tunnel blockage effects were studied in addition some theories of pjp were developed theoretical derivations of the energy relationships illustrated that values of propulsive efficiency approaching 100 were attainable using modern state of the art pjps evanbar and thurston recently with the rapid growth of computing power more and more researchers use computational fluid dynamics cfd method to study the hydrodynamic performance of pjp a lot of work has been done on the study of flow simulation of the r s pjp cfd analysis of two high speed underwater bodies fitted with a r s pjp was carried out to examine the flow phenomenon of pjp das et al 2006 the flow of a r s pjp with several different accelerating and decelerating ducts were calculated and discussed using cfd huyer and dropkin 2011 the open water performance and the rotor tip flow about a r s pjp with 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades was discussed lu et al sahoo lu et al 2092 the effect of different rotor tip clearances on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp was numerically studied qin et al ke the hydrodynamic performance of a post swirl pjp with 13 rotor blades and 11 stator blades under the openwater and behind hull condition was studied the obtained results show that the stator can create additional thrust in the behind hull condition shirazi et al 2019 in addition the panel method combined with tip leakage vortex model is also used to predict the steady state hydrodynamic characteristics of pjp wang et al 2019 based on the study of hydrodynamic performance some people studied the hydrodynamic noise of the r s pjp qin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 as for the research of the s r pjp there are relatively fewer studies this type of propeller was originally called as the duct propeller with pre swirl stators and was considered as a kind of ducted propeller instead of a pjp huyer et al conducted a wind tunnel experiment of a pre swirl pjp to measure the steady wake flow using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in addition the pjp model was tested in a water tunnel to measure the force the effect of different stator geometries on the flow of pjp was discussed huyer et al 2012 rao et al studied frequency characteristics of unsteady forces arising from hydrodynamic interactions between the rotor and stators of a pjp with pre swirl stators qiang rao et al 2013 in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the study of the evolution of propeller wake vortex most of them are focused on the single propeller and the duct propeller felli et al felli et al 2011 experimentally studied the evolution of tip and the hub vortices in the wake of a e779a propeller model flow velocities were measured by laser doppler velocimeter ldv and visualizations of vortices were performed by means of two high speed cameras additional experiments about vortex of propellers were carried out using both hydrophones and 2d piv particle image velocimetry felli et al 2002 2006 2008 furthermore large eddy simulation les has been used for simulations of the wake vortex of propeller kumar et al kumar mahesh studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller using les the morphology and evolution of tip and hub vortices were well captured although decent predictions were obtained simulations were very time consuming the mesh size used for les simulation is 181 million in his research in addition posa et al posa et al balaras simulated wake vortices of a 7 blade notional submarine propeller using les in which a cylindrical grid composed of about 840 million nodes is used an overall computational cost of about 1 5 million core hours is needed for one case hence les simulation is so time consuming and expensive that it is difficult to widely used in engineering then the hybrid rans les models reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation large eddy simulation which include detached eddy simulation des shur et al 1999 the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes spalart et al 2006 the stress blended eddy simulation sbes menter 2016 have been developed to avoid the high resolution requirements of les the wake vortices of ducted and non ducted propellers are compared based on the des method gong et al 2018 additional research using des for marine propellers can be found in references muscari et al 2013 mascio et al 2014 dubbioso et al 2013 in the research of pjp qin et al 2019 studied a the wake vortices of a r s pjp 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades using des results showed that the sawtooth duct has a significant effect on the morphology of wake vortices of pjp li et al 2020 compared different hybrid rans les models in terms of wake vortices simulation of a s r pjp as discussed before numerous researchers have investigated the hydrodynamic performance of the r s pjp and the s r pjp however to the authors best knowledge there is little work that directly compares the hydrodynamic performance of those two types of pjp it is worthwhile to investigate the difference of the flow field between the r s pjp and the s r pjp in this paper a study is carried out to investigate differences of the hydrodynamic performance and wake vortices between those two types of pjp this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the background of pjp the numerical methodology is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the model the numerical set up in addition simulation results are compared with the experimental data for validation in section 4 differences of the hydrodynamic performance between the r s pjp and the s r pjp are discussed from three aspects hydrodynamic coefficients unsteady forces and the vortex structure and evolution finally conclusions are made in section 5 2 numerical methodology in this paper the pumpjet propulsor is working under water and only the hydrodynamic performance is discussed in the case of non cavitation therefore the flow is an incompressible and single phase fluid flow the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations can be written as the continuity equation and momentum conservations as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j s j where ρ is the fluid density x i and x j i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 are the cartesian coordinate components respectively u i and u j are the components of the absolute velocity in the inertial system p is the pressure and t is the time ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stresses s j is defined as the generalised source term μ is the dynamic viscosity firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps are predicted based on unsteady rans simulation combined with the shear stress transport sst k ω model the sst k ω turbulence model was designed to give a highly accurate prediction of the onset and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients by the inclusion of transport effects into the formulation of the eddy viscosity this results in a major improvement in terms of flow separation predictions based on the research of bardina et al bardina et al coakley the sst k ω model does the best overall job in predicting the complex flow involving separation compared with the k ε turbulence model and the one equation model of spalart and allmaras hence this model was selected to simulate the flow of pumpjet propulsor in a lot of studies lu et al sahoo lu et al 2092 qin et al ke qin et al 2019 motallebi nejad et al 2017 additional details about this model can be found in the reference menter 1994 then improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes model shur et al 2008 is used in this paper to precisely capture the structure and evaluation of vortices generated by pjp the iddes model is based on modifying the sink term in the k equation of the sst model 3 ρ k t ρ u k μ μ t σ k 3 k p k ρ β k ω f i d d e s 4 ρ ω t ρ u ω μ μ t σ k 3 ω 1 f 1 2 ρ k ω σ

different pjp models the s r pjp and the r s pjp are presented parameters of pjps are shown in table 1 in the table n r is the numbe of rotor blades and n s denotes the number of stator blades d r is the mean diameter of rotor blade and d d is the maximum diameter of the duct l d is the length of the duct the s r pjp with 6 rotor blades and 8 stator blades is designed for a big underwater vehicle a 1 20 scale up model is used here the scale of the numerical model is 1 20 of that of the experimental model which is the same as the water tunnel test model the r s pjp with 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades is designed for a high velocity autonomous underwater vehicle auv this model is the 1 1 model fitted on the auv the average diameter of rotor blade of the s r and the r s pjp is d r 1 0 1664 m and d r 2 0 2300 m respectively the maximum diameter of duct is d d 1 0 22 m for the s r pjp while d d 2 0 26 m for the r s pjp for both models lengths of duct are same with l d 0 17 m in addition tip clearances between the rotor and duct for both models are all 1 mm fig 2 shows 3 d models of those two types of pjps note that rotor blades are painted red and stator blades are marked blue 3 2 computational domain and mesh fig 3 a and b show the computational domain used in this paper for the s r pjp and the r s pjp respectively for both models the coordinate origin is located in the center of the rotor and the size of those two computational domains is based on the maximum diameter of the duct d d as shown in fig 3 both computational domains are a cylinder with 10 d d diameter extending from 6 d d to 14 d d in the streamwise direction where d d equals to d d 1 for the s r pjp and d d 2 for the r s pjp divisions of both computational domains are the same the total domain is divided into four parts the far field domain the near field domain the rotor domain and the stator domain the selection of near field domain is key to obtain accurate prediction of the flow field around pjps with a minimized mesh size here a cylinder with 1 5d diameter and 5d length is chosen according to prior research qin et al 2019 the z axes of the near field and the far field domain coincide with the rotating axis of pjp one thing should be mentioned here is that coordinate origins of those two pjps are different due to different locations of rotor high quality structured grids are generated for both pjps and details of grids are shown in fig 4 the grid of blades can be seen in fig 4 a fig 4 b shows the duct surface mesh the topological structure of the two grids is the same outer o block grids are generated around surfaces of blades to well simulate the boundary layer fig 4 c gives the mesh in the middle section y z plane and one of its zoom in view can be seen in fig 4 d the mesh in the wake of pjp is obviously refined to obtain well capture of wake vortices as discussed before there is a tip clearance equals 1 mm between the rotor blade and the inner surface of duct with the high rotating speed of rotor blades violent flow takes place in such a small gap in order to accurately capture the generation of tip vortex the 1 mm tip clearance is divided into about 31 layers here the reynolds number of pjp is defined as re ρ c 1 0 r π n d r 2 v 2 μ where c 1 0 r is the chord length of the rotor blade at 1 0r and n is the rotational speed r s and μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity the re of the s r pjp and the r s pjp ranges form 8 5 10 5 to 1 8 10 9 in order to carry out grid independence test 3 different grids coarse medium and fine grids of the s r pjp are generated whose parameters are shown in table 2 the height of the first layer for all the three grids is the same with the mean y value of pjp surfaces equals to 5 and a growth rate of 1 05 the determine of y value had already been studied in prior research qin et al 2019 the difference of those three grids is the mesh density details of blade surface mesh of those three kinds of grids are shown in fig 6 the node number around the airfoil of blades for the coarse grid is 80 while 120 and 180 for the medium and the fine grid respectively for the fine grid considering the simulation of tip vortices a special refinement at the tip are made as shown in fig 6 c in order to accurately capture the generation and development of vortices meshes in the region around the rotor and stator blades inside the duct and the wake of pjp are obviously refined which is clearly visualized in fig 5 the maximum length of cells is defined as δ m a x m a x δ x δ y δ z where δ x δ y δ z is the length of cells in the x y and z direction respectively considering the development of wake we use the grid size at 1 d r downstream of the duct as the judgment basis for the coarse grid the maximum size of cells at 1 d r downstream of the duct is δ max 2 d r while 1 5 d r and 1 d r for the medium and fine grid the total number of cells for the coarse grid of the s r pjp is 8 38 10 6 while that of the medium and the fine grid corresponds to 1 26 10 7 and 2 46 10 7 respectively fig 4 shows the fine grid of the s r pjp and the r s pjp as for the r s pjp the total cell number equals to 1 01 10 7 and 2 57 10 7 for the medium grid and the fine grid respectively as shown in fig 3 boundary conditions of the r s and the s r pjp are similar the rotor domain of both models is set as a rotational domain with a same rotation speed of 1200 revolutions per minute rpm the inlet is set as the velocity inlet with different speed according different j values the outlet is a pressure outlet surface with an average static pressure of 1 atm atmosphere the turbulence intensity in the simulation is 5 furthermore the piso algorithm is used the pressure is discretized by the second order scheme and the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate in addition the bounded second order implicit time discretization scheme is used in the unsteady simulation the time step size is determined by using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number which is defined as c f l δ t u δ m i n δ m i n is the minimum grid size and u is calculated using the far field inlet velocity the flow of pjp is solved by ansys fluent version 16 ansys inc furthermore the overall computation cost per case using the fine grid is about 20000 core hours 3 3 validation cases the model of the s r pjp is designed by ourself to validate the cfd simulation results the hydrodynamic experiment of this s r pjp model was carried out in the water tunnel of science and technology on water jet propulsion laboratory marine design and research institute of china the experimental data of hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp can be found in references li et al 2020 the size of the experimental model is the same as that of the simulation model of the s r pjp model used in this paper one thing should be mentioned here is that there are some inevitable differences between the experimental model and numerical simulation model in experimental model for the need of tool processing there is a rounded corner with 5 mm radius at the root of blades in addition clearances between the rotor shaft and the stator shaft are also ignored in the numerical simulation therefore it is understandable if numerical simulation results are slightly different from experimental data the water tunnel has a speed that ranges 0 15 m s and test conditions for this experiment are j 0 2 1 2 with a motor speed 1200 rpm table 3 lists the definition of the non dimensional physical quantities used in the following research in the table n is the rotation speed v denotes the far field inlet flow velocity d r is the diameter of rotor blades ρ is the fluid density t r t s and t d are the thrust generated by rotor stator and duct respectively and q r and q s are the torque of rotor and stator the total thrust of the pjp is defined as k t k t r k t s k t d while the total torque of the pjp is defined as k q k q r for the s r pjp and the r s pjp the v d r and k t r etc are changed according to different models in order to validate the numerical simulation numerical results of hydrodynamic coefficients of the s r pjp are compared with the experiment data in the numerical simulation three different methods the rans simulation combined with the sst k ω turbulence model the unsteady simulation combined with the sst k ω model and the iddes simulation are carried out to simulate the flow of pjp using the medium mesh the numerical results are shown in fig 7 in the unsteady rans and iddes simulation the time step is set as the time taken for rotor blade to rotate 1 δ t 1 4 e 4 s 30 rotation cycles are calculated for each case and the average value of the last 15 cycles is taken as the final hydrodynamic coefficient numerical results are compared to the experimental data and the relative error is defined as δ k t r k t r n u m k t r e x p k t r e x p and δ k q r k q r n u m k q r e x p k q r e x p as we all know that multiple reference frame mrf model and the transient sliding mesh model are usually used in the flow simulation of turbomachinery in the rans simulation the mrf model also called as the frozen rotor approach is used while the sliding mesh model is used in unsteady rans u rans simulation in order to quantitatively evaluate the difference between those two model in predicting hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp results of rans and u rans simulation are compared in fig 7 the results show the result of u rans the blue point in the figure is more consistent with the experimental value the difference can be seen more clearly from results in table 4 at j 1 0 the design work point of the s r pjp the relative errors of rans results for k t r and k q r are 5 70 and 6 18 while results of u rans are only 2 95 and 2 69 respectively the rans predictions show a significant discrepancy with a maximum error of 7 09 hence the mrf model fails to simulate the flow for those turbomachinery with a strong rotor stator interaction such as pjp with reasonable accuracy in addition in order to accurately capture vortex structures of pjps the iddes simulation is carried out and hydrodynamic coefficient predictions are shown in fig 7 and table 4 results show that predictions of iddes are almost the same with that of u rans and have a great agreement with the experimental data as shown in table 4 the relative error of iddes is smallest in those three models δ k t r and δ k q r at j 1 0 is only 1 93 and 2 24 respectively although relative errors in the low and high j cases are relatively higher the maximum relative error of iddes results in the calculated j range 0 2 1 2 is only 4 48 considering the manufacturing error of experimental model the error is acceptable in summary the hydrodynamic performance coefficient predicted by the unsteady rans simulation and iddes simulation are all reliable compared with the experiment data for the turbo machinery with a strong rotor stator interaction such as pjp the unsteady simulation combined with the sliding mesh model is recommended 3 4 grid and time step independence tests next grid and time step independence tests are carried out for simplicity only the results of iddes are given below here three different grids of the s r pjp coarse grid medium grid and fine grid are used to simulate the flow in different j cases table 5 shows results of grid convergence analysis in the simulation a time step δ t 1 4 e 4 s the time taken for rotor blade rotate 1 is used based on the theory of roache celik et al coleman the grid convergency index gci of hydrodynamic coefficient for the s r pjp is calculated in case of j 0 4 and 1 0 according to table 5 the numerical uncertainty in the medium grid solution g c i m e d i u m 32 for the k t r k t s and k q r has a maximum uncertainty of 2 74 at j 0 4 therefore hydrodynamic coefficients shows a good convergence as the grid is refined considering the time consuming of computation the medium grid is selected in the hydrodynamic performance study and the fine grid is used in iddes simulation to simulate vortices of pjps in addition in order to carry out time step independence verification three different time steps δ t 2 t 1 t and 0 5 t are selected where t is the time taken for the rotor blades to rotate 1 iddes simulations of the s r pjp in the case j 1 0 are carried out the average of the last 15 rotation periods is taken to predict hydrodynamic coefficients results with different time steps are compared in table 6 as shown k t r and k q r increase gradually and approach to the experimental value as time step decreases in addition the effect of time step on the drag coefficient of rotor is shown as fig 8 as shown k t r slightly decreases as the time step changes from 2t to 0 5t after it becomes steady all k t r values show periodic fluctuations the prediction show good convergence with different time steps considering the rapid increase of computational cost resulted from small time step δ t 1 t is used in the rest of this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 the comparison of the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps in order to compare the hydrodynamic performance of those two pjps the flow field of the s r and the r s pjp under different work conditions are simulated the rotational speed of rotor blades for both models remains unchanged 1200 revolutions per minute rpm while the inlet flow velocity is changed according to the advance coefficient j the calculated range of j in this paper is 0 2 3 2 as discussed before the unsteady simulation combined with the sst k ω turbulence model is used to predict hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp the definition of hydrodynamic coefficients has been given before fig 9 a shows the comparison of open water efficiency η of those two pjps in the range of j 0 2 3 2 for the s r pjp the efficiency will be negative when j 1 6 which is not shown in the figure as shown the trends of η for both models are similar which increase first and then decrease with increasing j the s r pjp has a maximum η of 58 49 at j 1 0 while the r s pjp reaches its maximum η of 64 56 at j 2 0 the maximum η of the r s pjp is about 6 higher than that of the s r pjp which shows that the r s pjp has a better maximum efficiency than the s r pjp moreover the s r pjp has better efficiency under small j conditions while the r s pjp is more suitable for high j working condition it is also why the r s pjp is mainly used as the propulsion system of small and high speed auvs while the low speed and heavy duty vehicles are usually equipped with the s r pjp the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjps are shown in fig 9 b and c for both models it can be seen that the thrust coefficients k t k t r and k t s all decrease with increasing j the thrust percentages provided by the rotor the stator and the duct of the s r pjp is compared with the r s pjp in fig 10 the proportion of thrust generated by rotor stator and duct in total thrust is expressed as k t r k t k t s k t and k t d k t as percentages respectively a negative value indicates that the resistance is generated rather than thrust considering the big difference of j range of those two pjps we only consider the cases at j 0 6 1 4 it can be clearly seen that the thrust distributions of those two pjps are quite different as shown for the r s pjp the thrust component percentage provided by stator varies from 21 to 26 in the case j 0 6 1 4 on the other hand for the s r pjp the stator thrust percentage varies from 19 to 37 with j changes from 0 6 to 1 4 in other words the stator of the s r pjp always provides resistance while the stator of the r s pjp always provides thrust in j 0 6 1 4 furthermore the rotor of the r s pjp provide about 60 78 of total thrust in j 0 6 1 4 while it of the s r pjp varies from 115 to 426 of total thrust hence the rotor of the s r pjp provides nearly all the thrust of the propulsor in the calculated j range this is also the most significant difference of hydrodynamic performance between the two types of pjp in addition the thrusts generated by the duct all decrease with increasing j for both pjps especially the thrust of the duct gradually changes from thrust to resistance with increasing j see fig 9 b and c for the s r pjp the duct will provide considerable resistance 289 at j 1 4 which offset most of the thrust generated by the rotor at high j cases of course this is also due to the shape of duct a careful duct design is very important in the design process of pjp the torque generated by the propeller is an important parameter for underwater vehicles which will significantly affect the maneuverability of the vehicles if the propeller provide an unbalanced torque it must be offset by adjusting the control surface to maintain a zero torque of body to maintain the attitude of the vehicle one of the significant advantages of pjp compared with single propeller is that it has good torque balance characteristic however even the pjp is well designed the torque of stator is hard to completely offset the torque generated by the rotor in this paper the moment unbalance ratio between the rotor and stator is defined as δ k q k q r k q s k q r the similar definition can be seen in another paper li et al 2020 there is an obvious difference about the moment unbalance between the r s pjp and the s r pjp see fig 11 in the figure the torque of the stator is represented as k q s owing negative value of k q s it is shown that the k q s of the s r pjp increases with increasing j which is opposite to the change trend of k q r the difference between them first decreases and then increases with increasing j with the largest value about 0 08 at j 1 6 see fig 11 a that s also why the k q changes from 9 j 0 6 to about 85 j 1 4 however k q s and k q r of the r s pjp decrease with increasing j the difference between them gradually decreases with increasing j with a maximum value of about 0 05 at j 0 6 as a result the k q decreases from about 9 j 0 6 to about 5 j 1 4 generally speaking the r s pjp has a better torque balance performance than the s r pjp the difference between the torques of the two pjps is due to the different flow field for the s r pjp the pre stator has a pre rotation effect on the incoming flow and provide a better angle of attack of rotor blades in the design process of pjp we first designed the rotor and then design the stator at the best working condition j of the rotor a proper installation angle of the pre stator blades is selected to obtain a opposite torque to the rotor to get a total torque about 0 of course our design is not perfect and the total torque equals to 0 at about j 0 8 see fig 11 a owing to the fixed installation angle of stator blades the angle of attack of stator blades will have a big change due to the rapid change of incoming flow velocity at low and high j cases further causes the big change of k q s that s the reason why the k q of the s r pjp has such a big change range for the r s pjp the post stator works in the rotating wake of the rotor hence the direction of inflow velocity for the stator blades is about a fixed value associated with the difference between the installation angle of rotor blades and that of stator blades this is also the reason why k q s remains nearly unchanged at j 0 8 2 0 in order to better understand the difference of hydrodynamic performance between those two pjps the rans flow field of pjps are compared the efficiencies η of pjps are basically the same at j 1 2 so the working condition j 1 2 is selected as the analysis object fig 12 shows contours of axial velocity components of those two pjps here three different z positions are selected for further analysis z1 is located at the inlet surface of the duct z2 is the plane in the middle of rotor and stator and z3 is right behind stator for each pjp the velocity is dimensionless divided by far field incoming velocity u the axial velocity component v a and tangential velocity component v t at different z positions viewed from back to front are shown in figs 12 and 13 for the s r pjp at z1 the axial velocity in the inlet surface of duct is obviously lower than the incoming velocity due to the existence of stator blades the stator blade has a well designed installation angle whose bending direction is opposite to rotor blades with fluid flowing through the front stator z1 z2 the tangential velocity has an obvious increase with an average value v t u increases from 0 to about 0 09 as shown in fig 13 a indicating that the front stator has a pre rotation effect on the incoming flow the direction of tangential velocity is opposite to the rotation direction of rotor blade which slightly changes the angle of attack of rotor blades and results in a better load work condition of rotor blades then when fluid flows through the second stage blade z2 z3 the average tangential velocity v t v 0 decreases from 0 09 to about 0 02 as shown in fig 13 a which indicates that the rotation of the rotor well offsets the pre rotation component brought by the front stator and keeps the wake basically axial for the r s pjp when passing through the first stage blades z1 z2 the fluid is accelerated by the rotational rotor with a a sharp increase of v t u from about 0 to 0 3 seen in fig 13 b then the v t v 0 decreases rapidly to about 0 after passing through stator blades from z2 z3 which indicates that the rear stator can recover the rotational energy of the fluid very well in addition the axial velocity in the wake of the r s pjp is larger than that of the s r pjp at the same load condition j 1 2 for the s r pjp the axial velocity first decreases due to the existence of stator blades then increases by the rotation of rotor hence the s r pjp works at a relatively low speed at the same j compared to the r s pjp which will obviously help to reduce the possibility of cavitation both pjps can recover the rotational energy in the wake very well which is also the biggest advantage of pjp compared with a conventional single propeller or a duct propeller as discussed before the total torque of the propeller is about 0 which leads to a good maneuverability for the body equipped with a pjp in summary for the r s pjp the stator is located downstream of the rotor which can neutralizes the rotational velocity component caused by rotor thus the axial outflow can be straightened and practically swirl free the hydrodynamic efficiency of propulsor is improved by recovering rotational energy in the wake for the s r pjp the stator is located upstream of the rotor which can pre whirl the flow against the rotation direction of rotor then the flow is straightened then by the rotating blades so that the flow exits axially the whirl losses is significantly reduced and thereby improving the hydrodynamic efficiency of propulsor evanbar and thurston 4 2 the comparison of unsteady forces of pjps there was a brief discussion about unsteady forces of rotor and stator for the s r pjp in one of our previous paper li et al 2020 here the unsteady force of those two pjps was compared to see if those two pjps have the same frequency characteristics of unsteady forces of blades the unsteady forces of blades based on the unsteady simulation with sst k ω turbulence model of pjps are compared in the above discussion of hydrodynamic coefficients the rotational speed is fixed here we change j by varying the rotational speed of the rotor for the s r pjp the incoming flow velocity u 3 328 m s while for the r s pjp u 9 2 m s the time history of the force of each blade of the s r pjp at the case j 0 4 is shown in fig 14 blades are named in clockwise order as blade1 2 3 in addition in order to further understand its frequency domain characteristics frequency analysis is carried out using fast fourier transform fft in frequency domain analysis frequency f is normalized by f f b p f where f b p f refers to the rotor blade passing frequency f b p f n 60 n r n r p m is the rotation speed of rotor blades in addition we define the shaft rotation frequency f n and the stator blade passing frequency f s f n n 60 and f s f n n s n r and n s is the number of rotor and stator respectively for the case j 0 4 with n 3000 rpm f n 50 h z f b p f 300 h z f s 400 h z as shown in fig 14 a unsteady forces of six rotor blades are basically divided into three groups blade 1 and 4 blade 2 and 5 blade 3 and 6 and there is a 1 3 cycle phase difference between every two groups of signals amplitudes of six forces are almost the same the frequency domain analysis shows that unlike our imagination the peak of blade thrust does not appear at n f b p f but at 400 800 and 1200 which is n f s how to understand it as shown in fig 13 a for the s r pjp the fluid is divided into 8 channels after passing through 8 front stator blades hence for the rotor blade the incoming velocity field is not a constant value u like that of the far field incoming flow but a uniformly distributed velocity field of eight channels we can imagine that each rotor blade passes through these eight channels in turn with the frequency f n so the characteristic frequency of each rotor blade unsteady force is exactly f n 8 f s in summary the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of the rotor blade is n f s which is the passing frequency of the stator blade for the unsteady force of stator blades as shown in fig 14 b the frequency domain analysis shows that the characteristic frequency of the stator blade thrust is n f b p f this is easy to understand results of the s r pjp in j 1 0 and j 1 6 are given in fig 15 and fig 16 similar conclusion can be drawn the time and frequency analysis results of unsteady forces generated by blades for the r s pjp in the case j 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 are shown in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 respectively similar frequency characteristics are found that the spectrum lines of each rotor blade unsteady force show obvious peaks at f s and its harmonics hence the interaction between rotor and stator dominates the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of rotor blades regardless of the relative position of the rotor and stator in summary for both pjps characteristic frequencies of unsteady forces acting on stator blades is n f b p f the rotor blade passing frequency and its harmonics while that of rotor blades is n f s the stator blade passing frequency and its harmonics in addition some differences are found unlike the s r pjp amplitudes of fft results of 9 stator blades for the r s pjp are almost the same furthermore for the r s pjp fft amplitudes of stator unsteady forces are bigger than that of rotor blades which is opposite to the s r pjp the stronger interaction between the rotor and stator contributes to violent fluctuations of unsteady forces of stator blades of the r s pjp the analysis of the vortex structure of pjps in the following part will help to understand these differences moreover the frequency spectrum of the rotor s unsteady force of r s pjp not only has peaks at n f s but also small peaks at n f n that is the hub frequency and its harmonics especially in the case of high j cases such as j 3 0 the peaks at n f n are hardly visible in low j cases especially for unsteady forces of the stator blades the same change trend can also be seen in the results of the s r pjp here we conjecture that the frequency at n f n is related to the development of hub vortex this conjecture will be discussed further in the next section next let s discuss the frequency characteristics of the total thrust and torque of pjps fig 20 shows fft results of the thrust and torque coefficients for the s r pjp in the case j 1 0 as shown in fig 20 b the characteristic frequency of unsteady force of rotor is different from that of each rotor blade unlike peaks at n f s for the unsteady force of each rotor blade as shown in fig 15 a the fft results of k t r shows obvious peaks at 2 f b p f 3 f b p f and 4 f b p f as for the reason although the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces of six rotor blades are the same n f s phases of different forces are different see fig 15 therefore the superposition of six signals with same frequency but different phase leads to the change of characteristic frequency for total force of rotor k t r according to the fft results approximate equations of forces of six rotor blades are given mainly focus on the first three dominant frequencies f f s 2 f s and 3 f s k t r i 0 0784 0 0033 c o s 2 π 160 t ϕ 1 i 0 0002 c o s 2 π 320 t ϕ 2 i 9 e 5 c o s 2 π 480 t ϕ 3 i i 1 2 6 ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 4 120 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 1 5 120 ϕ 1 3 ϕ 1 6 0 these three group of signals at f f s with a phase difference of 120 cancel each other out that s why the peak at f f s 160 h z disappear in the fft results of k t r similarly the amplitude at 320hz of k t r is relatively small too 1 2e 5 while ϕ 3 1 ϕ 3 4 80 ϕ 3 2 ϕ 3 5 80 ϕ 3 3 ϕ 3 6 70 phases of those three group forces at 3 f s are almost same hence the amplitude at 3 f s 480 h z is strengthened this is also why the first order main frequency of k t r is 480hz in addition the signal processing at 2 f b p f and 3 f b p f shows that the amplitude of k t r at both frequencies is slightly strengthened leading to obvious peaks at 2 f b p f and 3 f b p f here those specific equations will not be listed one by one an important thing should be noted that 480hz is the common multiple of f b p f 120 h z and f s 160 h z all the forces of rotor stator and duct have the highest peak at 4 f b p f the amplitude at 480 hz has been enhanced due to the resonance phenomenon of rotor and stator blades this resonance phenomenon has been discussed before in one of our previous paper li et al 2020 in practical application we should reasonably select the number of rotor and stator blades and pay attention to avoid this resonance phenomenon in addition the characteristic frequency of the unsteady force of duct k t d is the same as that of the k t s this is easy to understand that the duct and stator are actually interconnected as a whole obvious peaks at n f b p f can be seen in the frequency spectrum curve of stator unsteady torque k q s which is consistent with that of k t s similarly the characteristic frequency of k q r is the same as that of rotor force k t r finally the characteristic frequency of total thrust of pjp k t is almost the same as that of k t r because the force of the stator and the duct is smaller than the force provided by the rotor as shown in fig 10 in addition the fluctuation amplitude of k t s of each stator blade 8e 5 is much smaller than that of rotor blade 4e 3 as shown in fig 15 therefore the characteristic frequency of the rotor dominates the characteristic frequency of overall unsteady thrust of pjp for the r s pjp see fig 21 the frequency characteristic of k t s and k t d is similar with that of the s r pjp obvious peaks at n f b p f while some differences are found in spectrum lines of k t r and k t several peaks at n f b p f and 1 f s can be found in the line of k t r the peak at 1 f s is expected due to that the characteristic frequency of each rotor blade force is n f s as for the characteristic frequencies of n f b p f it is caused by the shedding frequency of the tip vortex this will be discussed in the following part finally the characteristic frequencies of total thrust k t of the r s pjp is n f b p f this is due to that the amplitude of peaks for k t s and k t d at a level of 1e 4 is obviously bigger than that of k t r at a level of 1e 5 hence for the r s pjp the rotor blades passing frequency and its harmonics n f b p f dominate the characteristic frequency of total unsteady thrust of propulsor 4 3 the comparison of vortex evolution of pjps des simulations of those two pjps with different work conditions are carried out to analyse the vortex structure and evolution of pjps fig 22 shows the instantaneous flow field in the y z plane of the s r pjp the tip vortex can be seen clearly as low pressure region see fig 22 a which spread from z d 0 to about 1 5 the radial position of tip vortices is about r d 0 4 the near field downstream the duct is dominated by coherent tip vortices and the blade trailing edge wake see fig 22 c as shown in the experiment felli et al 2011 the wake of an e779a propeller consists of tip vortex hub vortex and a sheet of vortices shed from blade trailing edge fig 23 gives instantaneous q surfaces of the s r pjp the wake vortex of the sr pjp is similar to e779a propeller which consists of tip vortex hub vortex in addition a sheet of vortex sheds from stator trailing edge called as stator trailing vortices can be found in stator region see fig 23 b moreover a sheet of vortex sheds from rotor blade trailing edge called as rotor trailing vortices can be found in instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude see fig 24 according the definition of vortex instability transition region of felli et al 2011 the flow field of pjp is divided into four regions stator region rotor region stable region transition region and far field region among them the division of stable and transition region is based on the identification of hub vortex instability transition the transition to instability point is defined as the position at which the hub vortex starts to deviate from the straight geometry first of all let s talk about the hub vortex the hub vortex originating from the end of hub surface appears as a straight line in the stable region the straight line means that the hub vortex maintain stable in the near field downstream the hub it is also why the region is called as stable region in the transition region the hub vortex gradually twists and deforms into a spiral geometry as the vortex moves downstream to far field region the hub vortex undergoes progressive separation and deformation until breakdown a distinctive double helix can be observed in fig 23 a clearly which is similar to the visualization of hub vortex of an single propeller felli et al 2011 the hub vortex breakdown appears as this double helix geometry split from the centerline filament whose rotation direction is the same as the rotor sarpkaya 1971 here the starting point of far field region is defined as the position that the double helix break down of hub vortex is almost completed secondly the tip vortex of the s r pjp is significantly different from that of a single propeller according to the theoretical model of widnall et al widnall 1972 the instability of tip vortex of a single propeller occurs through three modes long wave instability short wave instability and mutual inductance instability mode similarly the short wave instability is observed as a smooth sinuous wave type mode saffman 1970 as shown in fig 23 a which is also same as the captured picture in the water tunnel experiment of a single propeller felli et al 2011 a clearer image of this smooth sinuous wave type mode can be seen in fig 29 j 0 4 in felli s theory felli et al 2011 the tip vortex with short wave instability shown as the local deformation of helical filament is caused by the self induced motion but for the s r pjp the self induction of the filament may not be the only reason fig 24 a gives instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude of the s r pjp the structure of tip vortex is similar with that of a duct propeller gong et al 2018 the wake of a ducted propeller is defined as the vortex system composed of hub vortex blade vortices shear layer vortices of the duct and secondary vortical structures similarly we follow this definition the structure of the duct shear layer vortex can be seen in fig 24 a the flow passing the duct surface is similar with the flow passing an airfoil the standard near wall boundary layer is formed close to walls of the duct as shown in fig 24 c the boundary layer flow on the inner wall is disturbed in advance by the tip vortex in the rotor region tip helical filaments maintains the standard spiral shape while it is gradually twisted when approaching the trailing edge of duct due to the interaction with the duct shear layer vortex see fig 23 b at the trailing edge of duct the tip vortex is greatly disturbed by the vortices shedding from the trailing edge of duct as shown in fig 23 a next to each tip spiral filament a relatively small spiral filament called as secondary tip vortex appears which gradually collapses in a short distance in summary the interaction between the primary tip vortex and duct shear layer vortex leads to the turbulence kinetic energy disturbance of tip vortex which further leads to the distortion of tip vortex and the generation of the secondary tip vortex hence the interaction between the tip vortex and duct dominates the short wave instability in the stable region the filament of tip vortex shows a twisted spiral shape which indicates that the tip vortex has begun to transform into unstable form near the trailing edge of duct finally let s talk about the trailing edge vortex which is a complex system consisting of the stator trailing edge vortex and rotor trailing edge vortex the structure of stator blade trailing edge vortex can be seen clearly from fig 23 b a sheet of vortex sheds from each stator blade trailing edge with the development of fluid in the axial direction the sheet vortex breaks up rapidly and many small vortices are generated and gradually fade out however at the root and tip of the blade small vortices gradually merge into two large vortices which are called stator tip vortex and stator root vortex these two vortices spread to the whole stator region and then stator tip vortex gradually weakens as it enters the rotor region and finally merges into the rotor tip vortex compared with stator tip vortex the stator root vortex with relatively larger rotation strength diffuses into the rotor region significantly interactions have been observed between the stator root vortex and the rotor trailing edge vortex see fig 24 b the evolution of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet undergoes a complex process of roll up kumar mahesh the trailing edge vortex breaks into smaller fragments after complete roll up which eventually dissipate in the far field region then the far field wake which consists of only tip and hub vortices is formed however in the experiment of felli et al 2011 the roll up process of trailing edge vortex is not observed while the classic leapfrogging phenomenon is captured by a camera which is caused by the adjacent helical filaments roll up around each other this mode is called the mutual inductance instability mode which appears when two adjacent rotor tip filaments pass within a distance the evolution of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex shown in this paper is different from the experiment of felli et al while is similar to the research of kumar et al kumar mahesh in his research the wake of a marine propeller dtmb 4381 is discussed based on les simulation the propeller dtmb 4381 has weaker tip vortices compared with the e779a propeller in this paper the mutual inductance between adjacent rotor tip vortices of the s r pjp is not so strong so we infer that this is also the reason why the classic leapfrogging phenomenon is not observed in the wake evolution of rotor tip vortices for the s r pjp fig 24 b gives the close up view of the x component of vorticity in the y z plane based on the instantaneous surfaces of vorticity magnitude shown as fig 24 a we give a schematic diagram to show the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet of the s r pjp fig 24 c in the figure circles colored with red represent rotor tip vortices and blue circles show major vortices separated from the rotor blade trailing sheet vortex in addition red and blue arrows indicate their direction of rotation and the two way arrow show the mutual inductance between rotor trailing edge vortex and rotor tip vortex for the s r pjp the roll up process of rotor trailing vortex plays a significant role in the wake evolution of vortices in the near field downstream the propeller the same as the conclusion of kumar et al kumar mahesh for a single marine propeller let s discuss the evolution process of the rotor blade trailing edge vortex in the rotor region a sheet vortex is detached from every rotor blade trailing edge due to the induce of the stator root vortex the rotor trailing edge vortex breaks rapidly into small vortices see fig 24 a some small vortices are formed in the root of the stator blade with the downstream development of fluid those small vortices are mixed with the hub vortex the main part of rotor trailing vortex represented by blue circles develops gradually from the hub stable region to the transition region the rotation direction of rotor trailing is opposite to that of tip vortex shown as opposite ω x which further induces the roll up of rotor trailing root vortex upward movement of the blue circle in the radial direction following by the roll down of rotor tip vortex downward movement of the red circle in the radial direction in the stable region the roll up process of the rotor trailing vortex is not so obvious while with vortices moving into the transient region the previous rotor trailing vortex gets closer and closer to the latter rotor tip vortex the strong interaction between them makes the rotor trailing vortex split into two part see fig 24 c this also makes the rotor tip vortex becomes more unstable characterized by severe distortion and even collapse of spiral filaments a part of the rotor trailing vortex is attracted to the next tip vortex and merges with it then with the development of fluid to far field region all vortices gradually dissipate in summary the interaction between rotor trailing edge vortex and tip vortex dominates further instability of tip vortex the roll up of rotor trailing edge vortex and roll down of rotor tip vortex are main forms of this multi interaction concentrated rotor trailing vortices are generated by the roll up process and it subsequently interacts with tip vortices causing its instability in addition in the rotor region those small vortices separated from the root of rotor trailing vortex shown as gray circles flow downstream along the hub surface and it sheds from the hub surface not the end point of hub forming some small vortices rotating around the hub vortex as shown in fig 23 a similar vortex structure can be found in more paper muscari et al 2013 those small vortices approach and interact with the hub vortex with the wake evolution the experiment of felli et al 2011 shows that the hub vortex of a single propeller is stable over a long distance until the far field based on the picture captured by the camera in the far wake the tip vortex filaments tend to collide with the hub vortex causing its sudden destabilization the hub vortex of the s r pjp is obviously different the hub vortex is only stable at a short distance downstream of the propeller z d 0 5 1 and then spiral precession occurs until the double helix break down it is reasonable to think that the small vortices rotating around the hub vortex is the reason of hub vortex instability for the s r pjp the interaction between hub vortex and rotor trailing vortex is the trigger mechanism of hub vortex instability similar to the analysis of the s r pjp the wake flow of r s pjp is discussed as shown in fig 25 the position of tip vortex is reflected as the low pressure region marked by the red circle in fig 25 a with a range of z d 0 1 5 and r d about 0 4 the axial and radial distributions of the tip vortices for those two pjps are similar while the wake of s r pjp keeps longer due to the postposition of rotor in addition the wake of the s r pjp presents uniform periodic acceleration while the wake of the r s pjp is obviously more chaotic and asymmetric about z axis see fig 25 b which is due to the fact that the number of blades of the s r pjp is odd finally the most obvious difference between the two pjps is that the hub vortex of the r s pjp has no stable region and it maintains chaotic and unstable after falling off from the hub surface until breakdown in the far field region fig 26 gives instantaneous q surfaces of the r s pjp the structure of tip vortices for the r s pjp is quite different from that of the s r pjp instead of the independent helical filament structure a series of spiral filaments are attached to each other since the hub vortex of the r s pjp is always unstable the region of the r s pjp is divided into four regions rotor region stator region transition region and far field region the axial evolution of vortices of the r s pjp can be seen from fig 27 similar to the s r pjp the duct shear layer vortex is fully mixed with rotor tip vortex at the region downstream the duct the envelope of tip vortices basically keeps as a flat cylindrical surface in the transition region similarly the axial evolution mechanism of vortices in the y z plane for the r s pjp is visualized in fig 27 c the upper part of the picture is the area in the middle of stator channel while the lower part is the region behind the trailing edge of stator blade as shown a similar roll up of the rotor blade trailing edge sheet vortex is found compared with s r pjp the roll process of the r s pjp vortex occurs faster in the range of z d 1 1 5 rotor trailing vortices are drawn to rotor tip vortices quickly in addition the evolution of the stator blade trailing edge sheet vortex is also similar to the s r pjp the stator root trailing vortex is formed at the root of each stator blade and sheds from the hub surface then it interacts with the hub vortex and falls out rapidly in order to further understand the difference of tip vortices between those two pjps instantaneous q surfaces in the stator and rotor regions of those two pjps are given in fig 28 as shown for the r s pjp after shedding from the leading edge of rotor tip the rotor tip vortex impacts the stator blade the structure of tip vortices has been complicated changed due to the different number of rotor and stator blades part of the tip vortices directly impact the stator pressure surface and the other part of tip vortices impact on the stator leading edge tip and separate into several vortices so the complex interaction between the rotor tip vortex and stator blades is the reason of the tip vortex instability in addition according to felli s analysis felli et al 2011 the more number of blades propeller has the closer the axial distance between two adjacent tip vortex spiral filaments is and the more possibility the mutual inductance instability occurs compared with the s r pjp 6 rotor blades the distance between two adjacent tip spiral filaments of the r s pjp 11 rotor blades is obviously smaller see figs 23 a and fig 26 a this is also the reason why adjacent tip spiral filaments link to each other which is called mutual inductance instability the overall shape of tip vortices of the r s pjp is more like a fishing net than isolated spiral filaments in conclusion the interaction between rotor tip vortex and stator blade dominates the instability of rotor tip vortex in addition the interaction between tip vortex and duct vortex the roll up effect of rotor trailing vortex and mutual inductance of adjacent tip vortices contribute to the mutual inductance instability of rotor tip vortex then let s discuss the influence of j on the evolution of vortices of pjps as shown in fig 29 for the s r pjp it can be seen that distance that tip vortex maintains stable at j 1 0 is longest compared with that of low load condition j 1 2 and high load condition j 0 4 this conclusion seems to be quite different from felli s experiment felli et al 2011 the length of tip vortex stability region increases with increasing j for a 4 blade e779a propeller in the range of j 0 45 to 0 85 however we note that this 4 blade e779a achieves the maximum efficiency at about j 0 9 therefore we believe that the stable length of tip vortex is not only related to j but also related to the point of maximum efficiency at the optimal operating point the length of tip vortex spiral filament maintaining stability is the longest this conclusion is worthy of further study according to the instability transition point of hub vortex the wake region of the s r pjp is divide into stable region and transition region it can be seen from the figure that with the decrease of j the length of the stable region first increases and then decreases which is related to the change of the stable length of tip vortex the pitch of rotor tip vortex p is marked in the figure see fig 29 a and the helical pitch of a single rotor tip spiral filament should be n r p for those two pjps the pitch p increases with the increase of j this is also consistent with the conclusion of okulov 2004 that the transition to the instability of tip vortices for a single propeller shows a clear dependence on the spiral to spiral distance on the basis of the conclusion our study shows that the occurrence of the s r pjp instability not only depent on the spiral to spiral distance but also related to the optimal efficiency point whether the conclusion is suitable for the single propeller or the duct propeller is worth further discussion for the r s pjp as discussed earlier since there is no stable region for tip vortex in the wake of pjp it is impossible to give the specific length of the stable region for rotor tip vortex however the larger j is the larger the pitch p will be and the weaker the mutual inductance instability caused by the interaction of adjacent spiral filaments will be of course the influence of j on the spatial evolution of vortices obviously contains a very complex mechanism here due to the length of the article we will not discuss them one by one the specific content will be discussed in our next paper in order to study the wake dynamic of the s r pjp 13 probes are selected which located in the region of tip vortices and hub vortex the specific location of probes can be seen from fig 30 a the power spectrum density psd of the turbulence kinetic energy at those probes are computed and discussed first of all spectrums of p1 p6 have obvious peaks at n f b p f which indicates that the main characteristic frequency of tip vortex is still blade passing frequency fig 31 in addition several peaks at n f n i e 2 4 8 10 are found it shows that shaft frequency harmonics also contribute the fluctuation of turbulence kinetic energy of tip vortices the amplitude of psd indicates the intensity of the pulsation a process of energy transfer from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics at tip vortices which is similar with the experimental results of the psd of the radial velocity in the wake of a four bladed propeller felli et al 2011 is found see fig 32 spectrums of p6 p8 has obvious peaks at blade harmonics n f b p f the peak value at 1 f b p f gradually decreases from p6 to p8 until it nearly disappear further downstream at p9 corresponding to this process the amplitude at 4 f n increases from p6 to p8 then at p9 the peak at 4 f n almost disappeared and is replaced by the peak at 2 f n hence the process of energy transfer of the s r pjp can be characterized by a two step cascade mechanism in the first step the 1st energy transfer involves the blade harmonics i e 120 and 240 hz to 4 f n then the 2nd energy transfer refers to 4 f n to 2 f n similarly 12 probes are set up to study the vortex dynamics of the r s pjp see fig 30 b the psd results of tke are shown in fig 33 similar with the s r pjp obvious peak at n f b p f appear in spectrums of p1 p6 for the r s pjp the blade harmonics dominates the characteristic frequency of tip vortex in addition the amplitude of psd increases gradually from p1 to p4 which is caused by the instability of tip vortex on the contrary the decrease of amplitude from p5 to p8 corresponds to the diffusion process and break down process of tip vortices a similar energy transfer process is observed from fig 33 b the peak at 1 f b p f is obvious in spectrums of p5 and p6 while it disappears in the far field region at p7 and p8 at p7 several indistinct peaks at shift harmonics n f n n 4 5 6 8 9 are shown as the fluid develops downstream at p8 the peaks mainly focus at 3 f n and 4 f n compared with the s r pjp the energy transfer between frequencies of the r s pjp is much more complicated but in general the energy transfer refers to blade harmonics to shaft harmonics for both pjps spectrums of probes located behind the hub p10 p13 for the s r pjp and p9 p12 for the r s pjp show broadband spectral characteristics the expected peaks at n f b p f are not so obvious which is different from felli s experiment felli et al 2011 that the period of hub vortex is t the period of hub rotation as discussed before the effect of the roll up process of rotor trailing vortices has significant effect on the hub vortex and tip vortices which disturbs the characteristic frequency of hub vortex to analysis the effect of duct on the wake vortices of pjp two probes are selected p1 and p4 for the s r pjp and p2 and p3 for the r s pjp the p1 and p2 are located right behind the blades of the s r pjp and r s pjp respectively p4 and p3 are located right behind the duct the effect of duct on psd of tke of pjp are shown in fig 34 for the s r pjp the amplitude of the psd of tke of p4 is significantly bigger than that of p1 especially at the peak value of n f b p f as shown in figs 23 and 24 the tip vortices are strongly disturbed by the duct the original uniform spiral filaments are twisted by the interaction between tip vortices and the duct in addition some relatively small spiral filaments called secondary tip vortex are generated therefore the duct of the s r pjp causes the distortion of tip vortices and the generation of the secondary tip vortex which eventually leads to a significant increase of psd of tke of p4 for the r s pjp the amplitude of the broadband component the psd of p3 is slightly smaller than that of p2 in addition the peak at 754 hz of p2 disappears we suspect that the peak at 754 hz is caused by the shedding frequency of stator trailing edge vortex instead for p3 a new peak at about 320 hz appears which may be caused by the vortex shedding frequency of the duct in general the amplitudes of the psd of tke of p3 and p4 are almost the same as discussed before after going through the stator channel the spiral filaments of tip vortices have been broken and connects with each other forming a tip vortex envelope like fishing net at the wake of the duct some small vortices fall off the outside of the duct see fig 26 a and then is mixed with tip vortices and finally breaks down quickly in a word for the r s pjp some small vortices shed from the duct which contributes to some tonal peak component of psd furthermore it should be noted that the overall amplitude of broadband component of psd for p3 is about 4 e 7 which is much larger than that of p4 3 e 8 of the s r pjp which is consistent with the above analysis in summary an important physical phenomenon the energy transfer process from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics is found in the tip vortex region for both pjps the specific transfer process is slightly different which is related to the number of rotor and stator blades 5 conclusions in this paper in order to investigate the difference of hydrodynamic performance between two types of pumpjet propulsor two pjp models the s r pjp and the r s pjp are presented numerical simulations are carried out based on the unsteady rans method with sst k ω turbulence model and iddes approach the method is validated by comparing with the experiment data of the s r pjp in addition the grid and time step independence test are well completed furthermore openwater coefficients unsteady forces wake vortex structure and evolution mechanism of those two pjps are discussed comprehensively numerical results reveal that 1 the r s pjp has a bigger maximum openwater efficiency than the s r pjp with the same rotational speed of 1200 rpm with a 6 higher maximum openwater efficiency in this paper in addition the r s pjp has a better balanced torque performance than the s r pjp 2 the stator of the s r pjp always provides resistance while the stator of r s pjp always provides thrust in the calculated j range 3 for both pjps the characteristic frequency of unsteady forces acting on each stator blade is n f b p f the rotor blade passing frequency and its harmonics while that of each rotor blade is n f s the stator blade passing frequency and its harmonics n f b p f dominates the characteristic frequency of total unsteady thrust and torque of propulsor for both pjps 4 when the numbers of rotor blades and stator blades have a common multiple it is more likely to cause resonance which should be avoided as far as possible in the design processing of pjp wake vortices of pjps are a complex vortex system which consist of tip vortex hub vortex two sheets of vortices shed from rotor and stator blade trailing edges and duct shear layer vortex a the hub vortex for the s r pjp the hub vortex shedding from the hub surface and maintain stable as a straight line in the near field region then undergoes progressive separation and deformation until double helix breakdown in the farfield however the hub vortex of the r s pjp has no stable region and it maintains unstable after falling off from the hub b the duct shear layer vortex the duct shear layer vortex is formed behind the duct for both pjps and the interaction between it and the rotor tip vortex enhances the instability of tip vortex the secondary tip vortex is induced c the rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet an important physical phenomenon the roll up process of rotor blade trailing edge vortex sheet are found and discussed for both pjps concentrated rotor trailing vortices are generated by the roll up of rotor trailing edge wake and it subsequently interacts with rotor tip vortices causing its wake instability d tip vortices the axial evaluation of tip vortices of pjps is similar to that of a single propeller for the s r pjp the short wave instability of the helical filament is observed and tip vortices of the r s pjp mainly occur through mutual inductance instability mode due to the existence of the post stator the overall shape of tip vortices of the r s pjp is more like a fishing net than isolated spiral filaments the interaction between rotor tip vortex and stator blade contributes to the mutual inductance of adjacent tip vortices the energy transfer process from blade harmonics to shaft harmonics is found in the tip vortex region for both pjps in general the stable wake region of tip and hub vortices of the r s pjp is smaller than the s r pjp the instability of vortices the r s pjp is more likely to occur the research of this paper aims to give some insights to pjp designers and help researchers understand the hydrodynamic performance and wake vortex structure between those two kinds of pumpjet propulsor
