6230,it is challenging to predict groundwater level gwl accurately and reliably in reclaimed coastal areas the dynamic of which has been greatly altered by the land reclamation activities due to its diverse engineering boundaries in this study the data driven artificial neural network ann models nonlinear input output network nio nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and wavelet narx wa narx are used to predict the gwl in a newly reclaimed land on zhoushan island china the models use semi diurnal tide sdt and precipitation as input variables and the wavelet coherence wtc is applied to analyze the response of gwl to sdt the results show that the wa narx hybrid model provides better prediction performance especially for short term periods meanwhile we also explore the correlations between gwl and sdt in the filled and clay layers by using the wtc and the global coherence coefficient gcc the results show strong correlations at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales resonance periodicities which are then used as prediction periods for ann models the correlation is stronger for the filled layer than that for the clay layer indicates gwl in the filled layer is more sensitive to sdt especially at 0 5 day time scale the predicted results also confirm that sdt and precipitation have great influences on gwl with better prediction in the filled layer keywords land reclamation groundwater level semi diurnal tide wavelet coherence artificial neural network ann 1 introduction in recent years coastal reclamation has expanded land resources and living spaces for humans utilizing ocean in many countries such as netherlands japan and singapore bi et al 2012 dore 2013 goh and chou 1997 hoeksema et al 2010 jickells et al 2016 wang et al 2016 coastal areas are usually the final discharge zones of regional groundwater systems jiao et al 2006 with the extending of land to sea the large scale reclamation activities have an irreversible detrimental impact on the geomorphology of the coastal line and hydrodynamic system chen and jiao 2007 duan et al 2016 mulder et al 1994 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2011 for instance the natural interactions between sea and land have been seriously interrupted by the constructed seawalls and other man made structures leading to changes of groundwater flow path rate of drainage and load of nutrient which ultimately result in rising gwl biodiversity decline saltwater retention soil salinization beach dewatering and instability of coastal infrastructures bi et al 2012 hu and jiao 2010 kalnay and cai 2003 li et al 2019 mckinney 2008 wang et al 2019 x zhang et al 2018 the rising gwl may lead to the decreasing of bearing capacity of the foundation which may cause the settlement of buildings if heavy rainfall occurs the potential hazard is enormous in china the area of reclaimed land was 5779 ha in 2017 which had decreased 22 per year compared to that in 2013 soa 2018 the impact of reclamation has gradually gained attention worldwide therefore understanding the groundwater variation in seashore reclaimed area is helpful to evaluate the impact of groundwater on the construction of the reclamation area it is important for accurate and reliable land planning and reclamation management in the coastal urbanized areas asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 gribovszki et al 2015 in recent years the influence of land reclamation on the groundwater system has received more attention switzman et al 2015 presented an approach for generating transient groundwater model inputs to assess the long term impacts of land reclamation on groundwater resources guo and jiao 2007 derived the analytical solution for calculating the position of the saltwater freshwater interface and found that the saline wedge moved seaward after reclamation jiao et al 2006 discussed the impact of land reclamation on groundwater system in coastal areas in hong kong by using two dimensional multilayered numerical model and calibrated the parameters by comparing the simulated and observed gwl previous studies focused on steady groundwater flow or large scale numerical simulation after land reclamation but the short term variation of groundwater flow was not considered the gwl can be controlled effectively by grasping the dynamic change of gwl in a timely manner during the construction ensuring the safety of reclamation area construction and further formulating the scheme of groundwater utilization therefore real time prediction of gwl is fundamental to studying the impact of land reclamation on the groundwater system at a short term period and to implementing the overall planning and management of reclamation areas however it is difficult to utilize either the analytical or the numerical methods to predict gwl directly for the complex and diverse engineering constructions of reclamation in general the change of gwl is mainly dependent on the range of reclaimed land hydraulic conductivity of the filling materials and the tide variation and rainfall in the reclamation area jiao et al 2006 on one hand with the anthropogenic extension of land the discharge of groundwater to seawater is weakened leading to rising of gwl in the original coastal area guo and jiao 2007 on the other hand due to the infiltration reduction caused by a large area of the impermeable land surface the reclamation could induce heavier seawater intrusion shiguo and yi 2013 the flow pattern variation of groundwater depends on the specific hydrogeological conditions at different sites for the land reclamation area the soil is factitiously divided into the filled and the clay layers different hydraulic conductivity results in the different pattern of gwl variation thus it is impossible to study reclamation areas according to the general law of groundwater flow system in coastal areas it requires analyzing the differences between the two layers and the different responses to the tide in order to explore the impact of land reclamation on gwl more specifically to overcome the difficulty in building mathematical models in the reclaimed land due to the complex system or lacking of detailed information data driven based models could be used to make hydrological predictions anctil and tape 2004 nourani et al 2014 shoaib et al 2016 taormina and chau 2015 wang and jing 2003 artificial neural network ann is a useful method which involves the wide range of applications of hydrological analysis and prediction of nonlinear systems aqil et al 2007 castellano mendez et al 2004 moosavi et al 2013 anns are effective in constructing models for nonlinear function without explicitly describing the underlying complex processes in mathematical forms shoaib et al 2016 wang and jing 2003 the nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was applied for forecasting the monthly gwl in several wells in the mississippi river valley aquifer and southwest germany guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 and the results showed good performance however ann may not be able to cope with highly varied non stationary signals well unless the original data was preprocessed cannas et al 2005 j zhang et al 2018 wavelet transform decomposes the original time series and extracts nontrivial and potentially useful information from the large data sets of historical records moosavi et al 2013 therefore it helps to better predict non stationary signals by decomposing them into sub signals at different temporal levels adamowski and chan 2011 kisi and shiri 2011 mohanty et al 2015 moosavi et al 2013 nourani et al 2015 it has been reported that the data driven technique combined ann with wavelet analysis performs efficiently and has been applied over a wide range of hydrological processes e g precipitation stream flow rainfall runoff groundwater evapotranspiration and water quality adamowski and chan 2011 gorgij et al 2017 kavousi fard 2017 kisi and shiri 2011 rajaee and shahabi 2016 shoaib et al 2016 wang and jing 2003 j zhang et al 2018 based on the theoretical basis of wavelet transform and ann it can be inferred that the hybrid model could have the advantages of both methods anctil and tape 2004 j zhang et al 2018 thus the wavelet ann hybrid model wa ann is a good option to predict the groundwater variation to the best of our knowledge this method has not been applied in predicting gwl at coastal reclamation area before we need to compare different ann and wa ann models to find the most suitable prediction model for this study area tidal effects play an important role in coastal unconfined aquifers and beaches gribovszki et al 2015 for the reclaimed land with an impermeable dike in our case the tide can affect groundwater variation with draining pipes which were built in the dike therefore the mathematical model not only contains porous flow but also pipe flow although previous studies have widely investigated for the effect of tide on the groundwater fluctuation in the beach under natural conditions it is seldom studied for the response of gwl to tidal oscillations in reclamation land moreover since the sdt is a high frequent and non stationary signal the traditional method is difficult to capture the correlation between sdt and gwl the wavelet coherence wtc is a useful tool to analyze the correlation between two signals in the time frequency domain which is particularly applicable to non stationary systems grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 this approach was applied to many fields such as the correlation between gwl and climate teleconnection patterns gurdak et al 2007 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 between gwl and precipitation oh et al 2017 qi et al 2018 yu and lin 2015 and the effect of monsoon on spring discharge huo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 there is little previous research about the linkage between the tide and gwl using wavelet analysis in this study the correlation structure and resonance periodicities between sdt and gwl are analyzed in the time frequency domain the resonance periodicities as the prediction periods of ann models can improve the accuracy of prediction and make the analysis more reliable moreover the different correlation between sdt and gwl in reclamation and natural layers helps to analyze their differences in this study we use gwl sdt and precipitation dataset from a research site in zhoushan island which reflects the impact of the precipitation and sdt variations on gwl the objective of this study is to develop the best data based time series predicting models for gwl fluctuations which is conducive to the research of groundwater dynamic system in the coastal reclamation areas to this aim the ann and wa ann models using the precipitation and sdt as inputs are developed since the tidal variation is the main driving force for gwl fluctuation in the coastal area gribovszki et al 2015 we address the specific questions of 1 is there any difference in groundwater dynamics between the filled and the clay layers 2 how does the correlation between gwl and sdt differ for two layers 3 how do different models a hybrid model wa ann model and other ann models perform for the same dataset to the best of our knowledge few studies explore the correlation between gwl and sdt using wtc and apply ann and wa ann hybrid models to predict gwl with the sdt as input in land reclamation area 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 geography and climate zhoushan island is the principal inhabited island of the zhoushan archipelago on the mid eastern seaboard of china its landform mainly consists of the central hill range the surrounding plains and the tidal flat wetlands the tidal flats reclamation along the coast have been started in the 1970s for mariculture aquaculture and harbor industry xu and yu 2003 the climate is typical northern subtropical monsoon with mean annual precipitation and temperature of 1300 mm and 17 c respectively annual precipitation is about 921 6 1318 8 mm according to the public climate report of zhoushan in may 2016 from zhoushan meteorological administration the precipitation data is provided by the meteorological bureau of zhoushan the tide pattern belongs to an irregular sdt with long term tidal range about 1 91 to 3 31 m the maximum tidal range could reach 3 73 4 96 m x zhang et al 2018 the tide dataset is recorded at shenjiamen an observation site of the inland the study site located on the southeast corner of zhoushan island as shown in fig 1 2 1 2 hydrogeology preliminary borehole logging indicated that the reclaimed cross section had a two layered structure the reclamation thickness gradually decreases from 11 8 m near the west hilly area to 0 m next to the reclamation dike as shown in fig 2 as unconsolidated marine sediment the bottom part is consisting of mainly muddy silty clay with silt aggregate and visible shells a large amount of igneous and granite stone blocks from the nearby mountain were first infilled on the top of terrigenous sediments diameters of the stones are generally 20 50 cm which account for 50 80 of the volume but some of them are as large as 80 100 cm gravels were accounting for 25 of the volume with diameters about 5 20 cm above that clay sand gravel and dirt were filled between the large gaps until the desired height is reached 2 1 3 borehole design a well drilling program was carried out in 2014 in order to investigate possible changes in physical and chemical properties of groundwater a total of 10 monitoring boreholes were drilled in the reclaimed region and their locations are shown in fig 2 the odd number wells sw13 sw15 sw17 sw19 and sw25 were in the top filled layer and the even number wells sw14 sw16 sw18 sw20 and sw26 located in the clay layer four groups were set up from the peripheral dike towards the land across the reclamation zone the eight wells were designed as four coupled groups one group was designed as control points on the two sides of the study region fig 2 each group is composed of two wells representing conditions for both filled fields and the underlain sediment separately sw14 was supposed to be drilled into the underlain clay layer however as shown in fig 2a no clay layer exists in this location since it is located at the foot of the hill in the west and the geology is ignimbrite below correspondingly sw14 was in the filled layer groundwater monitoring and sampling were performed from may 2015 to february 2016 after examination of the drilled wells gwls in 10 wells were recorded in the study period with a half hourly interval to understand the temporal variation of groundwater dynamics 2 2 wavelet analysis in this study wavelet analysis has been applied to identify the significant oscillation periods and extract useful information from the original data it decomposes the signal into a series of wavelet functions generated by the mother wavelet function the morlet wavelet is applied for the mother wavelet 1 ψ t π 1 4 e i w 0 t e t 2 2 where w 0 is the dimensionless frequency and t is the time in general the morlet wavelet with w 0 6 is chosen to extract features suitable for the balance between time and frequency resolution grinsted et al 2004 ze ev and dan 2001 the continuous wavelet transforms cwt is used to identify the dominant oscillations of the signal in the time frequency domain for the energy finite signal or time series f t l 2 r a convolution with a shifted and scaled factor successive wavelet transform of f t is shown as below 2 w a b a 1 2 f t ψ t b a d t where a is a scale or frequency parameter and b is the time or shift parameter ψ t is the complex conjugate function of ψ t eq 2 shows that the wavelet transform tends to be irregular and asymmetrical in different resolution levels or scales and it decomposes f t into a series of lower resolution components the w 2 is the wavelet power spectrum which represents the energy distribution in the time frequency domain labat 2010 there are some edge artifacts which are caused by the incomplete localization of wavelet in time therefore the cone of influence coi is used to resolve the area affected by the edge effect and the area outside coi can be neglected torrence and compo 1998 in practical application the cwt is often substituted by the discrete wavelet transform dwt let a a 0 j b k b 0 a 0 j a 0 1 b 0 r k j are integer numbers then dwt of f t can be written as 3 w j k a 0 j 2 f t ψ a 0 j t k b 0 d t in eq 3 the simplest and the most common choice for the parameters a 0 and b 0 uses a power of logarithmic scaling mallat 1989 i e a 0 2 and b 0 1 the characteristics of the original time series in frequency a or j and time b or k domains are reflected by w a b for the cwt or w j k for the dwt for a discrete time series f t the different time steps t of dwt can be defined as 4 w j k 2 j 2 t 0 n 1 f t ψ 2 j t k where w j k is the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale a 2 j b 2 j k the f t is assumed as the finite time series in this study t 0 1 2 n 1 and n is an integer power of 2 n 2 m several methods are available when we transform from the classical cwt to its discrete representation such as the mallat algorithm and á trous algorithm the á trous algorithm dutilleux 1990 shensa 1992 has been adopted in this work if f t denotes the original time series data then it is identical to the zero level approximation c 0 t the á trous decomposition algorithm is defined as follows 5 c i t n h n c i 1 t 2 i n i 1 2 6 w i t c i 1 t c i t i 1 2 where h n is the discrete low pass filter which is a b 3 spline defined by the knot sequence 1 16 1 4 3 8 1 4 1 16 c i t and w i t i 1 2 are scale coefficient background information and wavelet coefficient detail information at the resolution level i respectively w 1 t w 2 t w p t and c p t comprise the dwt with the resolution level p the dwt uses low pass and high pass filters to decompose the original time series into low frequency approximations c 1 c 2 c 3 and high frequency details w 1 w 2 w 3 at different resolution levels respectively thus the original time series can be decomposed into components that include its trend or the low frequency approximation and the high frequencies or the fast events the details the high frequency detailed signal captures the small scale features in the data this application will be used in the hybrid model which is described in section 2 4 the cwt cross wavelet transform xwt and wtc are used to analyze the correlation between gwl and sdt matlab toolbox of wtc is provided by grinsted et al 2004 available at http www glaciology net wavelet coherence xwt is used to find high correlation between gwl and sdt the xwt between two time series x t and y t is defined as 7 w xy a b w x a b w y a b from the cross wavelet spectrum the wtc is used for analyzing the degree of local correlation of the two signals the wtc coefficient is defined by torrence and compo 1998 as 8 r 2 a b s a 1 w xy a b 2 s a 1 w x a b 2 s a 1 w y a b 2 where r 2 a b falls between 0 and 1 s is a smoothing operator the monte carlo method is used for estimating the significance level of the wtc the significance testing of the wavelet power spectrum can make against red noise which is dependent on each other in a short sampling interval with a first order autoregressive ar 1 process if a peak in the wavelet power spectrum is significantly above the background spectrum red noise it can be regarded as a true feature with certain percent confidence the 5 significance level is taken into account in this study torrence and compo 1998 the global coherence coefficient gcc at a certain scale a is defined as the time averaged wtc coefficients 9 r 2 a 1 n τ 1 n r 2 a b the gcc estimates the correlation with the time averaged wtc coefficients that can help to examine the characteristic periodicities labat 2010 torrence and compo 1998 2 3 nonlinear neural network 2 3 1 nonlinear input output nio the nio model krukowicz 2010 uses the time delay network that can be expressed as 10 y t f u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where y t represents the prediction the nonlinear function f can be approximated by using the time delay neural network u t 1 u t n u denote the inputs which have a strong correlation with y t the time delay network has a finite dynamic response to input data mainly because its input weight has a tap delay line associated 2 3 2 nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx the narx model is based on the linear nonlinear autoregressive network nar model and is an important and useful class of discrete time nonlinear systems that is defined by chatterjee et al 2012 11 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where y t represents the prediction y t 1 to y t n y denote the past observation of y u t 1 to u t n u represent the exogenous input data and f represents the network architecture of the narx while n u 1 n y 1 and n u n y at discrete time step t n u and n y are the input and output memory orders respectively the state of the narx network corresponds to a set of two tap delay lines one is made up of n u taps on the input and the other consists of n y taps on the output values the nonlinear function f can be approximated by using a feed forward neural network for example a standard multi layer perceptron network the resulting connection architecture is called the narx network menezes and barreto 2008 it can be trained with static backpropagation the detailed diagram of resulting neural network is shown in fig s1b in the supporting information 2 4 wavelet and narx wa narx hybrid model the wa narx hybrid model is the narx model that uses the sub time series obtained by multi resolution wavelet decomposition as inputs this decomposition applies the wavelet transform to successively decompose the original signal into different resolution levels as explained earlier producing low frequency of the approximation component c and high frequency of the detail components ws using the á trous algorithm adamowski and sun 2010 here although there is no existing theory to explain the selection of wavelet levels it is generally believed that l int log 10 n levels are needed tiwari and chatterjee 2010 where l denotes the number of wavelet levels and n is the number of data points in the time series in this study 4 resolution levels are needed given the number of data points in the datasets the half hourly time series of gwl sdt and precipitation are decomposed into a certain number of sub time components using the á trous algorithm then the wavelet components are used as inputs of the narx model we choose the most important components as inputs which have a high correlation with the original data the metrics of the root mean square errors rmse determination coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliffe criterion nash are used as performance indicators for analysis as shown below 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 13 nash 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 14 r 2 i 1 n o i o i s i s i i 1 n o i o i 2 i 1 n s i s i 2 2 where o i is the observation and s i denotes the simulation o i and s i represent their mean values respectively in this technique the data is divided into two subsets training and testing periods the training dataset 75 is used for optimizing the network configuration and the testing dataset 25 is employed to test the performance of the network in addition the numbers of hidden neurons of nio narx and wa narx models are determined by trial and error method we used 10 hidden neurons in this study 3 results 3 1 gwl time series gwls in all 10 monitoring wells are illustrated in two separate plots based on their casing depths figs s2 and s3 wells 13 14 15 17 19 and 25 were used to monitor the gwls in the upper filled material layer and wells 16 18 20 and 26 are designed to measure gwls in the underline clay layer in the reclamation region from may 2015 to february 2016 similar variation trends of gwls are observed in all wells in the filled layer fig s2 the gwls fluctuate with time through the year and are within the same range of values at the beginning and the end of the observation period the gwl of sw14 is about 0 2 m lower than that in sw13 on average which could be evidence of vertical recharge since sw13 is on the west side of sw14 it indicates there is a potential for water from the west which infiltrates into the soil and flows laterally into the reclaimed region most of the wells in the clay layer maintain the stable water level in a week for a rainfall event fig s3 the time series of the precipitation and sdt for the same time period as gwl are shown in fig s4 it is shown clearly that the dramatical change of gwl is the response to each of the precipitation events in addition sw18 in the clay layer has the same variation trend as that of sw17 in the filled layer which reflects an impact from the upper layer and may indicate a priority flow path between the filled and clay layers figs 2 and s3 3 2 coherence between gwl and sdt to better understand the effects of sdt on gwl we calculate the wtc and gccs between half hourly gwl and sdt the wtc and gccs of the filled and clay layers are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the wtc between sdt and gwl shows continuous significant regions at 0 5 day time scale and intermittent significant regions at 0 25 1 and 15 day timescales for all wells in the filled layer fig 3 the peaks of gccs are more than 0 9 at 0 5 day time scale except for sw25 table 1 but the maximum gcc of sw25 also occurs at 0 5 day time scale which is 0 58 fig 4 illustrates the wtc and the gccs between gwl and sdt for all wells in the clay layer the main intermittent significant regions can be found at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales respectively the gccs of the clay layer are smaller than those of the filled layer table 1 three timescales i e 0 5 1 and 15 day are applied to the prediction periods of the gwl for the ann models 3 3 the ann models the gwl dataset was recorded half hourly from may 2015 to february 2016 the dataset was divided into two subsets for training and testing the first 75 of gwl data 5112 h were used for training and the remaining 25 were used for testing so did precipitation and sdt datasets the r2 nash and rmse values for the training and testing periods of all ann models are listed in table 2 figs 5 s5 and s6 show the results of nio model the sdt and precipitation are used as inputs to predict the gwl in nio model most of the nash and r2 values of the simulation using the nio model are less than 0 8 and the rmse values are greater than 0 1 table 2 the results of the narx model are shown in figs 6 s7 and s8 narx models use the past gwl sdt and precipitation as inputs to predict the current gwl the nash and r2 values of narx model are more than 0 9 meanwhile the rmse values of narx model are less than 0 09 table 2 3 4 the wa ann hybrid model on the basis of narx model we introduce the wavelet decomposition to minimize prediction errors and avoid over fitting the past gwl sdt and precipitation are processed by wavelet decomposition the effective sub time series components are used as inputs to predict the gwl the scatterplot and time series for comparing the observed and simulated gwls are showed in figs 7 s9 and s10 and the nash r2 and rmse values of wa narx model are exhibited in table 2 the values of nash and r2 are all close to 1 and the values of rmse are less than 0 02 by comparing the results of the three models nio narx and wa narx models we use the better ones narx and wa narx models to predict the gwl the feedback loop performs multi step ahead prediction when the training of the model is completed and the loop of narx and wa narx network are closed according to wtc and gccs between sdt and gwl the prediction periods are selected at 0 5 1 and 15 day i e 24 48 and 720 half hourly time steps respectively time scales the results of the narx and wa narx models for the multi step ahead prediction are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the results of wa narx model are superior to those of narx model moreover the prediction results at 0 5 day time scale are all beyond the acceptable level for both models overall the predictions in the filled layer are better than those in the clay layer 4 discussion there are no artificial water resources or agricultural exploitation in the reclamation area so that the gwl is mainly affected by natural factors the groundwater recharge includes direct infiltration from atmospheric precipitation infiltration from runoff and the seawater intrusion with the tidal effect thus the groundwater flow field is affected by tide and rainfall in this area gribovszki et al 2015 the variation of gwl monitored in the filled layer is directly related to rainfall or other potential hydrological sources due to the shallow burial and high permeability of the filling material permeable sands and gravels dramatical change of gwl in the filled layer is the sensitive response to precipitation events while gwls in most wells in the clay layer remain steady figs s1 s2 and s3a and have a delayed and weak response to the precipitation the sudden upward and downward changes of the monitored gwl are caused by the low permeability of the clay layer which prevents gwl to recover to its original state quickly after pumping the pumping process causes the deviation between the observation and the actual data the gwl and sdt datasets in the 10 month study period show strong variability and periodicity by means of wtc and the gccs especially for the filled layer heretofore it is difficult to capture the correlation of high frequent and non stationary signals by the traditional method especially in the time frequency domain the wtc reflects the resonance periodicities of gwl with sdt in the time frequency domain the wtc between gwl and sdt is characterized by multiple high or low frequent periodicities across the study period for the filled layer with the strongest correlation at 0 5 day it can be inferred that gwl in the filled layer is more responsive to sdt since the coherence of high frequent periodicities for the filled layer is higher than that for the clay layer previously sdt was considered to have no effect on gwl using the traditional method in the reclamation area cao et al 1996 also the gccs are larger for the filled layer than those for the clay layer as well these results corroborate that the influence of sdt on gwl fluctuation is different by depth in land reclamation area robinson 1939 in other words the effect of sdt on gwl in the filled layer is greater than that in the clay layer meanwhile the significant influence of sdt on gwl is mainly at 0 5 day corresponding to the periodicity of sdt according to the results of wtc and gcc wtc not only shows the correlation hard to capture between sdt and gwl but also reflects the subtle difference of the response of gwl to sdt in two layers the study area consists of two layers establishing a foundation for ascertaining the evolution process and regular pattern of groundwater system in zhoushan reclamation area under different hydrogeological characteristics combining the correlation for the filled and the clay layers the gwls are dominated by the sdt at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales a good performance of ann models can be expected if we did the prediction for gwl at these timescales in the reclamation area the consequent danger of rising gwl to underground engineering was unexpected during the design and construction period due to the limited drainage path of the groundwater system in this area the potential enormous hazard comes with the heavy rainfall therefore the gwl in the construction period can be effectively controlled to ensure the safety of construction by predicting the future changes of groundwater in the reclamation area the scheme and suggestion of groundwater utilization in this area can also be further formulated results of this study were based on the performance of ann models and the accuracy of the models was mainly evaluated by the rmse r2 and nash during the training and testing periods the lower rmse value indicates that the model has smaller discrepancies between observation and prediction and the higher r2 and nash values indicate that the model is more accurate comparing the nash r2 and rmse of three models nio narx and wa narx during the training and testing periods the narx and wa narx models perform better than the nio model the lower rmse and higher nash and r2 values of the narx and wa narx models show their closer estimates to the corresponding observed gwl meanwhile the nash and r2 values of multi step ahead prediction of wa narx model are larger than that of the narx model tables 3 and 4 and the rmse values of multi step ahead prediction of wa narx model are lower than those of narx model tables 3 and 4 the results indicate that the wa narx hybrid model is significantly superior to other models the discrete wavelet transform can remove most of the noise and it is easy to extract the periodic signals in the original time series the decomposed data can improve the performance of the narx model by providing useful information on various decomposition levels moosavi et al 2013 it can be seen that the wa narx model is more accurate because the decomposition of wt extracts useful information from the original time series hence the wa narx model is potentially useful for predicting the gwl in land reclamation area compared with traditional gwl prediction methods the data based model wa narx can predict gwl more accurately and timelier only in this way it would be able to predict the gwl in a timely manner and to help control the gwl effectively during the construction period however few people used the ann model to predict gwl in this research topic and region before therefore we compared different ann models and the hybrid model wa narx to find the most suitable prediction model simple but highly accurate for this study area the prediction results of the two models narx and wa narx at 0 5 day time scale are equally good which can be attributed to the strong effect of the sdt on gwl in addition the results for the filled layer are better than those for the clay layer table 2 it can indicate that the gwl of the filled layer is more affected by the sdt and precipitation while the clay layer is buffered by the filled layer and is less susceptible to precipitation events and sdt there are more and more ongoing practices of coastal reclamation which have changed the groundwater system including gwl and the original conditions of recharge runoff and discharge reclamation activities prolonged the path of groundwater discharge into seawater and and in the meantime reduced the amount of discharge as well then the gwl at the coastal area is raised which would have an impact on the seawater freshwater interface the risk of building subsidence and flood disasters in rainy season will also occur with the decreasing of the foundation bearing capacity in the study area meanwhile reclamation materials will affect the quality of the freshwater and the fluctuation of gwl in the reclamation area jiao et al 2006 thus the safety of construction and the selection of reclamation materials should be considered comprehensively in the coastal reclamation projects our results show that wa narx model could be a useful tool for accurate and reliable prediction of gwls and for the planning of land and water resources management strategies in the coastal reclamation area in addition the national groundwater monitoring project plans to establish a relatively complete network for national groundwater monitoring unfortunately this project lacks consideration of the reclamation area therefore the prediction method of gwl proposed in this study can fill some gaps and improve the project for groundwater monitoring in the reclamation area 5 conclusions the variation pattern of gwl and its response to precipitation are different between the filled and the clay layers gwl in the filled layer exhibits the quick response and dramatical variation to each of the precipitation events while gwl in the clay layer has a delayed response to the precipitation and remains relatively stable the wtc and gccs are used to understand the correlation between gwl and sdt in the time frequency domain gwl is affected by sdt at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales in both filled and clay layers these time scales suggest the most efficient prediction periods for the ann prediction models the strongest power spectrum of the sdt affecting gwl occurs at high frequent 0 5 day time scale for the filled layer but there is no obvious strong power spectrum for the clay layer gccs between gwl and sdt are greater for the filled layer than those for the clay layer because filler materials have higher permeability and the shallow burial gwl in the filled layer is more responsive to sdt and precipitation events based on their correlation we investigate the potential of predicting the fluctuations of gwl in the filled and the clay layers using ann and wa narx models with precipitation and sdt as inputs the wa narx hybrid model combines the dwt and narx our results revealed that the technique as wavelet analysis could improve the prediction accuracy of ann models and wa narx model provided the best performance to predict the gwl with simpler but more accurate means data pre processing i e wavelet decomposition can improve model performance by capturing useful information on various resolution levels in this study we noted the relative lower prediction accuracy for gwl in the clay layer caused by its low permeability and the consequently delayed responses of gwl to the precipitation events and tide moreover observations from a few wells designed for the clay layer are not used data not shown since they were not drilled into the certain depth as planned due to the uncertain thickness of filling layer that may be related to the spatial heterogeneity of the medium in the study area in future research more boreholes and data collections for the clay layer are needed to better understand the dynamics of gwl variation in this layer in the reclamation area the past gwl is used as one of the input variables to predict future gwl in the wa narx model however the general complexity of the reclamation land system leads to either difficulty of gwl monitoring or inevitable errors in the monitoring process thus in the future work we will try to apply wa nar model to predict gwl which does not use the past gwl as an input variable making the prediction model simpler and easier to operate acknowledgments this study was supported by zhoushan bureau of land and resources gzh201200506 and

6230,it is challenging to predict groundwater level gwl accurately and reliably in reclaimed coastal areas the dynamic of which has been greatly altered by the land reclamation activities due to its diverse engineering boundaries in this study the data driven artificial neural network ann models nonlinear input output network nio nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and wavelet narx wa narx are used to predict the gwl in a newly reclaimed land on zhoushan island china the models use semi diurnal tide sdt and precipitation as input variables and the wavelet coherence wtc is applied to analyze the response of gwl to sdt the results show that the wa narx hybrid model provides better prediction performance especially for short term periods meanwhile we also explore the correlations between gwl and sdt in the filled and clay layers by using the wtc and the global coherence coefficient gcc the results show strong correlations at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales resonance periodicities which are then used as prediction periods for ann models the correlation is stronger for the filled layer than that for the clay layer indicates gwl in the filled layer is more sensitive to sdt especially at 0 5 day time scale the predicted results also confirm that sdt and precipitation have great influences on gwl with better prediction in the filled layer keywords land

humans utilizing ocean in many countries such as netherlands japan and singapore bi et al 2012 dore 2013 goh and chou 1997 hoeksema et al 2010 jickells et al 2016 wang et al 2016 coastal areas are usually the final discharge zones of regional groundwater systems jiao et al 2006 with the extending of land to sea the large scale reclamation activities have an irreversible detrimental impact on the geomorphology of the coastal line and hydrodynamic system chen and jiao 2007 duan et al 2016 mulder et al 1994 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2011 for instance the natural interactions between sea and land have been seriously interrupted by the constructed seawalls and other man made structures leading to changes of groundwater flow path rate of drainage and load of nutrient which ultimately result in rising gwl biodiversity decline saltwater retention soil salinization beach dewatering and instability of coastal infrastructures bi et al 2012 hu and jiao 2010 kalnay and cai 2003 li et al 2019 mckinney 2008 wang et al 2019 x zhang et al 2018 the rising gwl may lead to the decreasing of bearing capacity of the foundation which may cause the settlement of buildings if heavy rainfall occurs the potential hazard is enormous in china the area of reclaimed land was 5779 ha in 2017 which had decreased 22 per year compared to that in 2013 soa 2018 the impact of reclamation has gradually gained attention worldwide therefore understanding the groundwater variation in seashore reclaimed area is helpful to evaluate the impact of groundwater on the construction of the reclamation area it is important for accurate and reliable land planning and reclamation management in the coastal urbanized areas asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 gribovszki et al 2015 in recent years the influence of land reclamation on the groundwater system has received more attention switzman et al 2015 presented an approach for generating transient groundwater model inputs to assess the long term impacts of land reclamation on groundwater resources guo and jiao 2007 derived the analytical solution for calculating the position of the saltwater freshwater interface and found that the saline wedge moved seaward after reclamation jiao et al 2006 discussed the impact of land reclamation on groundwater system in coastal areas in hong kong by using two dimensional multilayered numerical model and calibrated the parameters by comparing the simulated and observed gwl previous studies focused on steady groundwater flow or large scale numerical simulation after land reclamation but the short term variation of groundwater flow was not considered the gwl can be controlled effectively by grasping the dynamic change of gwl in a timely manner during the construction ensuring the safety of reclamation area construction and further formulating the scheme of groundwater utilization therefore real time prediction of gwl is fundamental to studying the impact of land reclamation on the groundwater system at a short term period and to implementing the overall planning and management of reclamation areas however it is difficult to utilize either the analytical or the numerical methods to predict gwl directly for the complex and diverse engineering constructions of reclamation in general the change of gwl is mainly dependent on the range of reclaimed land hydraulic conductivity of the filling materials and the tide variation and rainfall in the reclamation area jiao et al 2006 on one hand with the anthropogenic extension of land the discharge of groundwater to seawater is weakened leading to rising of gwl in the original coastal area guo and jiao 2007 on the other hand due to the infiltration reduction caused by a large area of the impermeable land surface the reclamation could induce heavier seawater intrusion shiguo and yi 2013 the flow pattern variation of groundwater depends on the specific hydrogeological conditions at different sites for the land reclamation area the soil is factitiously divided into the filled and the clay layers different hydraulic conductivity results in the different pattern of gwl variation thus it is impossible to study reclamation areas according to the general law of groundwater flow system in coastal areas it requires analyzing the differences between the two layers and the different responses to the tide in order to explore the impact of land reclamation on gwl more specifically to overcome the difficulty in building mathematical models in the reclaimed land due to the complex system or lacking of detailed information data driven based models could be used to make hydrological predictions anctil and tape 2004 nourani et al 2014 shoaib et al 2016 taormina and chau 2015 wang and jing 2003 artificial neural network ann is a useful method which involves the wide range of applications of hydrological analysis and prediction of nonlinear systems aqil et al 2007 castellano mendez et al 2004 moosavi et al 2013 anns are effective in constructing models for nonlinear function without explicitly describing the underlying complex processes in mathematical forms shoaib et al 2016 wang and jing 2003 the nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was applied for forecasting the monthly gwl in several wells in the mississippi river valley aquifer and southwest germany guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 and the results showed good performance however ann may not be able to cope with highly varied non stationary signals well unless the original data was preprocessed cannas et al 2005 j zhang et al 2018 wavelet transform decomposes the original time series and extracts nontrivial and potentially useful information from the large data sets of historical records moosavi et al 2013 therefore it helps to better predict non stationary signals by decomposing them into sub signals at different temporal levels adamowski and chan 2011 kisi and shiri 2011 mohanty et al 2015 moosavi et al 2013 nourani et al 2015 it has been reported that the data driven technique combined ann with wavelet analysis performs efficiently and has been applied over a wide range of hydrological processes e g precipitation stream flow rainfall runoff groundwater evapotranspiration and water quality adamowski and chan 2011 gorgij et al 2017 kavousi fard 2017 kisi and shiri 2011 rajaee and shahabi 2016 shoaib et al 2016 wang and jing 2003 j zhang et al 2018 based on the theoretical basis of wavelet transform and ann it can be inferred that the hybrid model could have the advantages of both methods anctil and tape 2004 j zhang et al 2018 thus the wavelet ann hybrid model wa ann is a good option to predict the groundwater variation to the best of our knowledge this method has not been applied in predicting gwl at coastal reclamation area before we need to compare different ann and wa ann models to find the most suitable prediction model for this study area tidal effects play an important role in coastal unconfined aquifers and beaches gribovszki et al 2015 for the reclaimed land with an impermeable dike in our case the tide can affect groundwater variation with draining pipes which were built in the dike therefore the mathematical model not only contains porous flow but also pipe flow although previous studies have widely investigated for the effect of tide on the groundwater fluctuation in the beach under natural conditions it is seldom studied for the response of gwl to tidal oscillations in reclamation land moreover since the sdt is a high frequent and non stationary signal the traditional method is difficult to capture the correlation between sdt and gwl the wavelet coherence wtc is a useful tool to analyze the correlation between two signals in the time frequency domain which is particularly applicable to non stationary systems grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 this approach was applied to many fields such as the correlation between gwl and climate teleconnection patterns gurdak et al 2007 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 between gwl and precipitation oh et al 2017 qi et al 2018 yu and lin 2015 and the effect of monsoon on spring discharge huo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 there is little previous research about the linkage between the tide and gwl using wavelet analysis in this study the correlation structure and resonance periodicities between sdt and gwl are analyzed in the time frequency domain the resonance periodicities as the prediction periods of ann models can improve the accuracy of prediction and make the analysis more reliable moreover the different correlation between sdt and gwl in reclamation and natural layers helps to analyze their differences in this study we use gwl sdt and precipitation dataset from a research site in zhoushan island which reflects the impact of the precipitation and sdt variations on gwl the objective of this study is to develop the best data based time series predicting models for gwl fluctuations which is conducive to the research of groundwater dynamic system in the coastal reclamation areas to this aim the ann and wa ann models using the precipitation and sdt as inputs are developed since the tidal variation is the main driving force for gwl fluctuation in the coastal area gribovszki et al 2015 we address the specific questions of 1 is there any difference in groundwater dynamics between the filled and the clay layers 2 how does the correlation between gwl and sdt differ for two layers 3 how do different models a hybrid model wa ann model and other ann models perform for the same dataset to the best of our knowledge few studies explore the correlation between gwl and sdt using wtc and apply ann and wa ann hybrid models to predict gwl with the sdt as input in land reclamation area 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 geography and climate zhoushan island is the principal inhabited island of the zhoushan archipelago on the mid eastern seaboard of china its landform mainly consists of the central hill range the surrounding plains and the tidal flat wetlands the tidal flats reclamation along the coast have been started in the 1970s for mariculture aquaculture and harbor industry xu and yu 2003 the climate is typical northern subtropical monsoon with mean annual precipitation and temperature of 1300 mm and 17 c respectively annual precipitation is about 921 6 1318 8 mm according to the public climate report of zhoushan in may 2016 from zhoushan meteorological administration the precipitation data is provided by the meteorological bureau of zhoushan the tide pattern belongs to an irregular sdt with long term tidal range about 1 91 to 3 31 m the maximum tidal range could reach 3 73 4 96 m x zhang et al 2018 the tide dataset is recorded at shenjiamen an observation site of the inland the study site located on the southeast corner of zhoushan island as shown in fig 1 2 1 2 hydrogeology preliminary borehole logging indicated that the reclaimed cross section had a two layered structure the reclamation thickness gradually decreases from 11 8 m near the west hilly area to 0 m next to the reclamation dike as shown in fig 2 as unconsolidated marine sediment the bottom part is consisting of mainly muddy silty clay with silt aggregate and visible shells a large amount of igneous and granite stone blocks from the nearby mountain were first infilled on the top of terrigenous sediments diameters of the stones are generally 20 50 cm which account for 50 80 of the volume but some of them are as large as 80 100 cm gravels were accounting for 25 of the volume with diameters about 5 20 cm above that clay sand gravel and dirt were filled between the large gaps until the desired height is reached 2 1 3 borehole design a well drilling program was carried out in 2014 in order to investigate possible changes in physical and chemical properties of groundwater a total of 10 monitoring boreholes were drilled in the reclaimed region and their locations are shown in fig 2 the odd number wells sw13 sw15 sw17 sw19 and sw25 were in the top filled layer and the even number wells sw14 sw16 sw18 sw20 and sw26 located in the clay layer four groups were set up from the peripheral dike towards the land across the reclamation zone the eight wells were designed as four coupled groups one group was designed as control points on the two sides of the study region fig 2 each group is composed of two wells representing conditions for both filled fields and the underlain sediment separately sw14 was supposed to be drilled into the underlain clay layer however as shown in fig 2a no clay layer exists in this location since it is located at the foot of the hill in the west and the geology is ignimbrite below correspondingly sw14 was in the filled layer groundwater monitoring and sampling were performed from may 2015 to february 2016 after examination of the drilled wells gwls in 10 wells were recorded in the study period with a half hourly interval to understand the temporal variation of groundwater dynamics 2 2 wavelet analysis in this study wavelet analysis has been applied to identify the significant oscillation periods and extract useful information from the original data it decomposes the signal into a series of wavelet functions generated by the mother wavelet function the morlet wavelet is applied for the mother wavelet 1 ψ t π 1 4 e i w 0 t e t 2 2 where w 0 is the dimensionless frequency and t is the time in general the morlet wavelet with w 0 6 is chosen to extract features suitable for the balance between time and frequency resolution grinsted et al 2004 ze ev and dan 2001 the continuous wavelet transforms cwt is used to identify the dominant oscillations of the signal in the time frequency domain for the energy finite signal or time series f t l 2 r a convolution with a shifted and scaled factor successive wavelet transform of f t is shown as below 2 w a b a 1 2 f t ψ t b a d t where a is a scale or frequency parameter and b is the time or shift parameter ψ t is the complex conjugate function of ψ t eq 2 shows that the wavelet transform tends to be irregular and asymmetrical in different resolution levels or scales and it decomposes f t into a series of lower resolution components the w 2 is the wavelet power spectrum which represents the energy distribution in the time frequency domain labat 2010 there are some edge artifacts which are caused by the incomplete localization of wavelet in time therefore the cone of influence coi is used to resolve the area affected by the edge effect and the area outside coi can be neglected torrence and compo 1998 in practical application the cwt is often substituted by the discrete wavelet transform dwt let a a 0 j b k b 0 a 0 j a 0 1 b 0 r k j are integer numbers then dwt of f t can be written as 3 w j k a 0 j 2 f t ψ a 0 j t k b 0 d t in eq 3 the simplest and the most common choice for the parameters a 0 and b 0 uses a power of logarithmic scaling mallat 1989 i e a 0 2 and b 0 1 the characteristics of the original time series in frequency a or j and time b or k domains are reflected by w a b for the cwt or w j k for the dwt for a discrete time series f t the different time steps t of dwt can be defined as 4 w j k 2 j 2 t 0 n 1 f t ψ 2 j t k where w j k is the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale a 2 j b 2 j k the f t is assumed as the finite time series in this study t 0 1 2 n 1 and n is an integer power of 2 n 2 m several methods are available when we transform from the classical cwt to its discrete representation such as the mallat algorithm and á trous algorithm the á trous algorithm dutilleux 1990 shensa 1992 has been adopted in this work if f t denotes the original time series data then it is identical to the zero level approximation c 0 t the á trous decomposition algorithm is defined as follows 5 c i t n h n c i 1 t 2 i n i 1 2 6 w i t c i 1 t c i t i 1 2 where h n is the discrete low pass filter which is a b 3 spline defined by the knot sequence 1 16 1 4 3 8 1 4 1 16 c i t and w i t i 1 2 are scale coefficient background information and wavelet coefficient detail information at the resolution level i respectively w 1 t w 2 t w p t and c p t comprise the dwt with the resolution level p the dwt uses low pass and high pass filters to decompose the original time series into low frequency approximations c 1 c 2 c 3 and high frequency details w 1 w 2 w 3 at different resolution levels respectively thus the original time series can be decomposed into components that include its trend or the low frequency approximation and the high frequencies or the fast events the details the high frequency detailed signal captures the small scale features in the data this application will be used in the hybrid model which is described in section 2 4 the cwt cross wavelet transform xwt and wtc are used to analyze the correlation between gwl and sdt matlab toolbox of wtc is provided by grinsted et al 2004 available at http www glaciology net wavelet coherence xwt is used to find high correlation between gwl and sdt the xwt between two time series x t and y t is defined as 7 w xy a b w x a b w y a b from the cross wavelet spectrum the wtc is used for analyzing the degree of local correlation of the two signals the wtc coefficient is defined by torrence and compo 1998 as 8 r 2 a b s a 1 w xy a b 2 s a 1 w x a b 2 s a 1 w y a b 2 where r 2 a b falls between 0 and 1 s is a smoothing operator the monte carlo method is used for estimating the significance level of the wtc the significance testing of the wavelet power spectrum can make against red noise which is dependent on each other in a short sampling interval with a first order autoregressive ar 1 process if a peak in the wavelet power spectrum is significantly above the background spectrum red noise it can be regarded as a true feature with certain percent confidence the 5 significance level is taken into account in this study torrence and compo 1998 the global coherence coefficient gcc at a certain scale a is defined as the time averaged wtc coefficients 9 r 2 a 1 n τ 1 n r 2 a b the gcc estimates the correlation with the time averaged wtc coefficients that can help to examine the characteristic periodicities labat 2010 torrence and compo 1998 2 3 nonlinear neural network 2 3 1 nonlinear input output nio the nio model krukowicz 2010 uses the time delay network that can be expressed as 10 y t f u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where y t represents the prediction the nonlinear function f can be approximated by using the time delay neural network u t 1 u t n u denote the inputs which have a strong correlation with y t the time delay network has a finite dynamic response to input data mainly because its input weight has a tap delay line associated 2 3 2 nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx the narx model is based on the linear nonlinear autoregressive network nar model and is an important and useful class of discrete time nonlinear systems that is defined by chatterjee et al 2012 11 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where y t represents the prediction y t 1 to y t n y denote the past observation of y u t 1 to u t n u represent the exogenous input data and f represents the network architecture of the narx while n u 1 n y 1 and n u n y at discrete time step t n u and n y are the input and output memory orders respectively the state of the narx network corresponds to a set of two tap delay lines one is made up of n u taps on the input and the other consists of n y taps on the output values the nonlinear function f can be approximated by using a feed forward neural network for example a standard multi layer perceptron network the resulting connection architecture is called the narx network menezes and barreto 2008 it can be trained with static backpropagation the detailed diagram of resulting neural network is shown in fig s1b in the supporting information 2 4 wavelet and narx wa narx hybrid model the wa narx hybrid model is the narx model that uses the sub time series obtained by multi resolution wavelet decomposition as inputs this decomposition applies the wavelet transform to successively decompose the original signal into different resolution levels as explained earlier producing low frequency of the approximation component c and high frequency of the detail components ws using the á trous algorithm adamowski and sun 2010 here although there is no existing theory to explain the selection of wavelet levels it is generally believed that l int log 10 n levels are needed tiwari and chatterjee 2010 where l denotes the number of wavelet levels and n is the number of data points in the time series in this study 4 resolution levels are needed given the number of data points in the datasets the half hourly time series of gwl sdt and precipitation are decomposed into a certain number of sub time components using the á trous algorithm then the wavelet components are used as inputs of the narx model we choose the most important components as inputs which have a high correlation with the original data the metrics of the root mean square errors rmse determination coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliffe criterion nash are used as performance indicators for analysis as shown below 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 13 nash 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 14 r 2 i 1 n o i o i s i s i i 1 n o i o i 2 i 1 n s i s i 2 2 where o i is the observation and s i denotes the simulation o i and s i represent their mean values respectively in this technique the data is divided into two subsets training and testing periods the training dataset 75 is used for optimizing the network configuration and the testing dataset 25 is employed to test the performance of the network in addition the numbers of hidden neurons of nio narx and wa narx models are determined by trial and error method we used 10 hidden neurons in this study 3 results 3 1 gwl time series gwls in all 10 monitoring wells are illustrated in two separate plots based on their casing depths figs s2 and s3 wells 13 14 15 17 19 and 25 were used to monitor the gwls in the upper filled material layer and wells 16 18 20 and 26 are designed to measure gwls in the underline clay layer in the reclamation region from may 2015 to february 2016 similar variation trends of gwls are observed in all wells in the filled layer fig s2 the gwls fluctuate with time through the year and are within the same range of values at the beginning and the end of the observation period the gwl of sw14 is about 0 2 m lower than that in sw13 on average which could be evidence of vertical recharge since sw13 is on the west side of sw14 it indicates there is a potential for water from the west which infiltrates into the soil and flows laterally into the reclaimed region most of the wells in the clay layer maintain the stable water level in a week for a rainfall event fig s3 the time series of the precipitation and sdt for the same time period as gwl are shown in fig s4 it is shown clearly that the dramatical change of gwl is the response to each of the precipitation events in addition sw18 in the clay layer has the same variation trend as that of sw17 in the filled layer which reflects an impact from the upper layer and may indicate a priority flow path between the filled and clay layers figs 2 and s3 3 2 coherence between gwl and sdt to better understand the effects of sdt on gwl we calculate the wtc and gccs between half hourly gwl and sdt the wtc and gccs of the filled and clay layers are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the wtc between sdt and gwl shows continuous significant regions at 0 5 day time scale and intermittent significant regions at 0 25 1 and 15 day timescales for all wells in the filled layer fig 3 the peaks of gccs are more than 0 9 at 0 5 day time scale except for sw25 table 1 but the maximum gcc of sw25 also occurs at 0 5 day time scale which is 0 58 fig 4 illustrates the wtc and the gccs between gwl and sdt for all wells in the clay layer the main intermittent significant regions can be found at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales respectively the gccs of the clay layer are smaller than those of the filled layer table 1 three timescales i e 0 5 1 and 15 day are applied to the prediction periods of the gwl for the ann models 3 3 the ann models the gwl dataset was recorded half hourly from may 2015 to february 2016 the dataset was divided into two subsets for training and testing the first 75 of gwl data 5112 h were used for training and the remaining 25 were used for testing so did precipitation and sdt datasets the r2 nash and rmse values for the training and testing periods of all ann models are listed in table 2 figs 5 s5 and s6 show the results of nio model the sdt and precipitation are used as inputs to predict the gwl in nio model most of the nash and r2 values of the simulation using the nio model are less than 0 8 and the rmse values are greater than 0 1 table 2 the results of the narx model are shown in figs 6 s7 and s8 narx models use the past gwl sdt and precipitation as inputs to predict the current gwl the nash and r2 values of narx model are more than 0 9 meanwhile the rmse values of narx model are less than 0 09 table 2 3 4 the wa ann hybrid model on the basis of narx model we introduce the wavelet decomposition to minimize prediction errors and avoid over fitting the past gwl sdt and precipitation are processed by wavelet decomposition the effective sub time series components are used as inputs to predict the gwl the scatterplot and time series for comparing the observed and simulated gwls are showed in figs 7 s9 and s10 and the nash r2 and rmse values of wa narx model are exhibited in table 2 the values of nash and r2 are all close to 1 and the values of rmse are less than 0 02 by comparing the results of the three models nio narx and wa narx models we use the better ones narx and wa narx models to predict the gwl the feedback loop performs multi step ahead prediction when the training of the model is completed and the loop of narx and wa narx network are closed according to wtc and gccs between sdt and gwl the prediction periods are selected at 0 5 1 and 15 day i e 24 48 and 720 half hourly time steps respectively time scales the results of the narx and wa narx models for the multi step ahead prediction are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the results of wa narx model are superior to those of narx model moreover the prediction results at 0 5 day time scale are all beyond the acceptable level for both models overall the predictions in the filled layer are better than those in the clay layer 4 discussion there are no artificial water resources or agricultural exploitation in the reclamation area so that the gwl is mainly affected by natural factors the groundwater recharge includes direct infiltration from atmospheric precipitation infiltration from runoff and the seawater intrusion with the tidal effect thus the groundwater flow field is affected by tide and rainfall in this area gribovszki et al 2015 the variation of gwl monitored in the filled layer is directly related to rainfall or other potential hydrological sources due to the shallow burial and high permeability of the filling material permeable sands and gravels dramatical change of gwl in the filled layer is the sensitive response to precipitation events while gwls in most wells in the clay layer remain steady figs s1 s2 and s3a and have a delayed and weak response to the precipitation the sudden upward and downward changes of the monitored gwl are caused by the low permeability of the clay layer which prevents gwl to recover to its original state quickly after pumping the pumping process causes the deviation between the observation and the actual data the gwl and sdt datasets in the 10 month study period show strong variability and periodicity by means of wtc and the gccs especially for the filled layer heretofore it is difficult to capture the correlation of high frequent and non stationary signals by the traditional method especially in the time frequency domain the wtc reflects the resonance periodicities of gwl with sdt in the time frequency domain the wtc between gwl and sdt is characterized by multiple high or low frequent periodicities across the study period for the filled layer with the strongest correlation at 0 5 day it can be inferred that gwl in the filled layer is more responsive to sdt since the coherence of high frequent periodicities for the filled layer is higher than that for the clay layer previously sdt was considered to have no effect on gwl using the traditional method in the reclamation area cao et al 1996 also the gccs are larger for the filled layer than those for the clay layer as well these results corroborate that the influence of sdt on gwl fluctuation is different by depth in land reclamation area robinson 1939 in other words the effect of sdt on gwl in the filled layer is greater than that in the clay layer meanwhile the significant influence of sdt on gwl is mainly at 0 5 day corresponding to the periodicity of sdt according to the results of wtc and gcc wtc not only shows the correlation hard to capture between sdt and gwl but also reflects the subtle difference of the response of gwl to sdt in two layers the study area consists of two layers establishing a foundation for ascertaining the evolution process and regular pattern of groundwater system in zhoushan reclamation area under different hydrogeological characteristics combining the correlation for the filled and the clay layers the gwls are dominated by the sdt at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales a good performance of ann models can be expected if we did the prediction for gwl at these timescales in the reclamation area the consequent danger of rising gwl to underground engineering was unexpected during the design and construction period due to the limited drainage path of the groundwater system in this area the potential enormous hazard comes with the heavy rainfall therefore the gwl in the construction period can be effectively controlled to ensure the safety of construction by predicting the future changes of groundwater in the reclamation area the scheme and suggestion of groundwater utilization in this area can also be further formulated results of this study were based on the performance of ann models and the accuracy of the models was mainly evaluated by the rmse r2 and nash during the training and testing periods the lower rmse value indicates that the model has smaller discrepancies between observation and prediction and the higher r2 and nash values indicate that the model is more accurate comparing the nash r2 and rmse of three models nio narx and wa narx during the training and testing periods the narx and wa narx models perform better than the nio model the lower rmse and higher nash and r2 values of the narx and wa narx models show their closer estimates to the corresponding observed gwl meanwhile the nash and r2 values of multi step ahead prediction of wa narx model are larger than that of the narx model tables 3 and 4 and the rmse values of multi step ahead prediction of wa narx model are lower than those of narx model tables 3 and 4 the results indicate that the wa narx hybrid model is significantly superior to other models the discrete wavelet transform can remove most of the noise and it is easy to extract the periodic signals in the original time series the decomposed data can improve the performance of the narx model by providing useful information on various decomposition levels moosavi et al 2013 it can be seen that the wa narx model is more accurate because the decomposition of wt extracts useful information from the original time series hence the wa narx model is potentially useful for predicting the gwl in land reclamation area compared with traditional gwl prediction methods the data based model wa narx can predict gwl more accurately and timelier only in this way it would be able to predict the gwl in a timely manner and to help control the gwl effectively during the construction period however few people used the ann model to predict gwl in this research topic and region before therefore we compared different ann models and the hybrid model wa narx to find the most suitable prediction model simple but highly accurate for this study area the prediction results of the two models narx and wa narx at 0 5 day time scale are equally good which can be attributed to the strong effect of the sdt on gwl in addition the results for the filled layer are better than those for the clay layer table 2 it can indicate that the gwl of the filled layer is more affected by the sdt and precipitation while the clay layer is buffered by the filled layer and is less susceptible to precipitation events and sdt there are more and more ongoing practices of coastal reclamation which have changed the groundwater system including gwl and the original conditions of recharge runoff and discharge reclamation activities prolonged the path of groundwater discharge into seawater and and in the meantime reduced the amount of discharge as well then the gwl at the coastal area is raised which would have an impact on the seawater freshwater interface the risk of building subsidence and flood disasters in rainy season will also occur with the decreasing of the foundation bearing capacity in the study area meanwhile reclamation materials will affect the quality of the freshwater and the fluctuation of gwl in the reclamation area jiao et al 2006 thus the safety of construction and the selection of reclamation materials should be considered comprehensively in the coastal reclamation projects our results show that wa narx model could be a useful tool for accurate and reliable prediction of gwls and for the planning of land and water resources management strategies in the coastal reclamation area in addition the national groundwater monitoring project plans to establish a relatively complete network for national groundwater monitoring unfortunately this project lacks consideration of the reclamation area therefore the prediction method of gwl proposed in this study can fill some gaps and improve the project for groundwater monitoring in the reclamation area 5 conclusions the variation pattern of gwl and its response to precipitation are different between the filled and the clay layers gwl in the filled layer exhibits the quick response and dramatical variation to each of the precipitation events while gwl in the clay layer has a delayed response to the precipitation and remains relatively stable the wtc and gccs are used to understand the correlation between gwl and sdt in the time frequency domain gwl is affected by sdt at 0 5 1 and 15 day time scales in both filled and clay layers these time scales suggest the most efficient prediction periods for the ann prediction models the strongest power spectrum of the sdt affecting gwl occurs at high frequent 0 5 day time scale for the filled layer but there is no obvious strong power spectrum for the clay layer gccs between gwl and sdt are greater for the filled layer than those for the clay layer because filler materials have higher permeability and the shallow burial gwl in the filled layer is more responsive to sdt and precipitation events based on their correlation we investigate the potential of predicting the fluctuations of gwl in the filled and the clay layers using ann and wa narx models with precipitation and sdt as inputs the wa narx hybrid model combines the dwt and narx our results revealed that the technique as wavelet analysis could improve the prediction accuracy of ann models and wa narx model provided the best performance to predict the gwl with simpler but more accurate means data pre processing i e wavelet decomposition can improve model performance by capturing useful information on various resolution levels in this study we noted the relative lower prediction accuracy for gwl in the clay layer caused by its low permeability and the consequently delayed responses of gwl to the precipitation events and tide moreover observations from a few wells designed for the clay layer are not used data not shown since they were not drilled into the certain depth as planned due to the uncertain thickness of filling layer that may be related to the spatial heterogeneity of the medium in the study area in future research more boreholes and data collections for the clay layer are needed to better understand the dynamics of gwl variation in this layer in the reclamation area the past gwl is used as one of the input variables to predict future gwl in the wa narx model however the general complexity of the reclamation land system leads to either difficulty of gwl monitoring or inevitable errors in the monitoring process thus in the future work we will try to apply wa nar model to predict gwl which does not use the past gwl as an input variable making the prediction model simpler and easier to operate acknowledgments this study was supported by zhoushan bureau of land and resources gzh201200506 and

efficient and reliable keywords aquifer heterogeneity particle tracking minimum resistance transport computational efficiency 1 introduction as one of the key factors controlling groundwater flow and solute transport aquifer heterogeneity over multiple scales has been widely recognized and continuingly attracting interests of hydrogeologists e g dagan 1986 delhomme 1979 fiori et al 2007 gelhar 1986 gelhar and axness 1983 kitanidis 2015 nan and wu 2017 neuman and di federico 2003 rajaram and gelhar 1993 among many others there often exist very complex flow patterns in highly heterogeneous media which leads to extremely uneven flow distributions connections of highly conductive parts of media allows existence of fast flow conduits i e preferential flow paths pfp as observed in modeling and field studies such pfp may convey dominating water and solute migrations in a small portion of space bianchi et al 2011 fiori 2014 zheng et al 2011 zheng and gorelick 2003 and increase difficulty in solute transport prediction occurrence of pfp often dramatically change the behavior of aquifers like scale effects anomalous diffusion early time arrivals and so on fiori 2014 le borgne et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2006 thus it drives hydrogeologists to describe quantitatively the degree of connection or channeling for high conductivity clusters renard and allard 2013 tyukhova and willmann 2016 and to reconsider the relationship between groundwater data and models to avoid black swans low chance but consequential outcomes in model prediction ferre 2017 peeters 2017 there have been analytical semi analytical and numerical approaches to deal with solute transport problems in heterogeneous aquifers analytical approaches are generally limited to aquifers of weak or mild heterogeneity de barros et al 2015 rizzo and de barros 2017 numerical approaches e g random walk particle tracking etc are usually applicable to aquifers of generic heterogeneity but suffer from high computational cost in practice boso et al 2013 moslehi et al 2015 park et al 2008 salamon et al 2006 semi analytical approaches are often of less popularity compared to numerical approaches due to their complexities in implementation and certain assumptions e g stationarity geometric regularity etc which are often hard to satisfy in practice cvetkovic et al 2014 fiori et al 2015 jankovic and barnes 1999b there are also attempts to numerically search potential fast conduits in heterogeneous aquifers more efficiently rizzo and de barros 2017 defined minimum hydraulic resistance mr and applied an algorithm from graph theory to fast search the mr path between two points search for mr path is indeed computationally efficient but it is somehow problematic to use mr path as an indicator of pfp in many cases the main limitation of mr is that the definition of mr relies only on spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity regardless of dynamics and flow conditions hence the evaluation of mr path often leads to geometrically fast but dynamically unreasonable paths such as excessive meandering and unlikely upstream moves in this study stream function is used to overcome the limitation of mr in determination of pfp stream functions have been found very useful in simulation of groundwater flow bear 1972 solute transport obi and blunt 2004 two phase fluid dynamics siavashi et al 2016 analysis of travel time distributions fuks et al 2019 and so on analytical solutions of stream functions can only be obtained under very constrained conditions and in aquifers of general heterogeneity numerical approaches have to be employed there are studies which provided ways of calculating stream functions in two or three dimensional models batycky et al 1997 blunt et al 1996 mallison et al 2006 matanga 1993 1996 steward 1998 thiele et al 1996 many numerical approaches of solving streamtubes e g modpath pollock 1994 are based on velocity fields and particle tracking pt which usually introduces errors both in velocity interpolation and displacement extrapolation and is generally computationally expensive we propose an approach to find the early time arrivals by efficiently evaluating streamtubes in heterogeneous aquifers through widely used numerical softwares e g modflow the objective of this study is to establish an efficient and effective framework to quantitatively analyze aquifer heterogeneity and identify pfp based on not only spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity but also flow conditions this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the procedure to determine stream tubes and travel time in heterogeneity section 3 explores the validity of our proposed method by comparing it with mr and pt methods analyze the impact of heterogeneity level on pfp identification and compare efficiency of three methods section 4 provides the main conclusions in this study 2 methodology 2 1 identification of pfp via streamtubes pfp means a conduit of fast flow and ease at water transport thus can be indicated by concentrated streamlines a streamline is a curve that are instantaneously tangent to the velocity field a streamtube is bounded by streamlines and carries a fixed volumetric flux blunt et al 1996 in two dimensional flow an imaginary function ψ x y ψ x y t for transient flow which is constant along streamlines is called the stream function of two dimensional flow l2 t bear 1972 in three dimensional flow the streamlines are related to two stream functions λ x y z and χ x y z leading to higher complexity in calculation but still solvable steward 1998 thiele et al 1996 though we recognize that preferential flow may be greatly impacted by spatial dimension fiori and jankovic 2012 we currently focus on demonstrating the proposed framework and constrain our analysis to two dimensional flow in heterogeneous yet isotropic media and ignore compressibility of water in this study consequently one has pseudo potential flow q k h and k h 0 where k k x y is hydraulic conductivity and h h x y is the hydraulic head and a pseudo potential q is specific discharge vector in such problems the corresponding equation for ψ is bear 1972 equation 6 5 26 1 1 k ψ 0 for a given k field we can define resistance field r x y 1 k x y and then have a classic partial differential equation in groundwater modeling 2 r ψ 0 existing groundwater flow solvers such as finite element or finite difference methods analytical element method jankovic and barnes 1999a b strack 2017 etc can numerically or semi analytically solve a partial differential equation of the form like eq 2 with good efficiency and accuracy thus one is able to immediately obtain spatial distribution of ψ in the domain the streamlines can be found by linking points of the same ψ values with curves probably after interpolation or simply using off the shelf contouring functions e g bourke 1987 mathworks 2007 this step is also computationally efficient the travel time along a streamline of ψ i can be expressed as 3 t d s v where v k h is the magnitude of darcian velocity flux d s is the length measure along the streamline now consider a small streamtube enclosed by streamlines of ψ i δ ψ 2 and ψ i δ ψ 2 recall that the total discharge between the two streamlines of ψ i δ ψ 2 and ψ i δ ψ 2 is equal to the difference of stream function i e δ ψ q i on the other hand one has q i v s w s where v s is the cross sectional average of velocity in the streamtube and w is the width of the streamtube thus one has v s δ ψ w s if v in eq 3 is approximated by v then 4 t ds v w s δ ψ d s a δ ψ where a w s d s is the total area of the streamtube according to eq 4 travel time in a streamtube is proportional to the streamtube area a if the stream function difference δ ψ between neighboring streamlines is fixed we can find the streamline along which travel time is the shortest i e pfp by simply comparing areas of streamtubes the approximation error in eq 4 goes down as δ ψ decreases i e thinner streamtubes used for brevity the proposed method is termed stream function based method or sf method below 2 2 evaluation of stream function and search for shortest travel time as mentioned in section 2 1 eq 2 can be efficiently solved by existing groundwater flow solvers such as analytical element method finite element or finite difference methods here we use finite difference based tool modflow harbaugh et al 2000 as an example for its ease in implementation and popularity of course other solvers can be used for certain wanted strengths e g local refinement accuracy flexibility to irregular interfaces etc though it is not trivial to find proper boundary conditions for eq 2 in complex problems matanga 1993 in context of pfp analysis one can impose simple boundary conditions of dirichlet and neumann types see fig 1 more specifically the upstream and downstream sides of regional flow direction where constant head boundary conditions are often imposed can be specified as neumann boundary for ψ no flux boundary of ψ at the lateral impermeable sides constant ψ boundary conditions can be specified since the impermeable sides themselves are streamlines more complex boundary conditions can be applied in complicated situations if needed ψ distribution can be obtained by numerically solving eq 2 plus appropriate boundary conditions once the spatial distribution of ψ is solved a series of streamlines can be conveniently found by contouring ψ values through existing tools what we use in this study is contour function in matlab mathworks 2007 which approximates streamlines by polygonal lines and provides coordinates of line points for specified ψ values to evaluate the area of streamtubes we employ a matlab function polyarea which is able to fast calculate the area of a polygon characterized by a sequence of vertexes by comparing the area of streamtubes a one is able to identify the fastest streamline a representative of pfp the workflow of the proposed sf method is shown in fig 2 a and the conventional pt method is also included in fig 2 b for comparison purpose the advantage of sf method is the efficiency and accuracy as well as ease of implementation as explained above the calculation of ψ s4 in fig 2 a can be efficiently done with widely used groundwater flow solvers e g modflow contouring the resultant ψ with an existing contour algorithm s5 in fig 2 a immediately leads to sufficiently accurate streamlines traditional pt method relies on tracking a large number of particles carried by velocity fields to find streamlines pollock 1994 it extrapolates displacements of particles according to current velocity vector and time step p5 in fig 2 b which is prone to overshoot and usually produces inaccurate paths in order to alleviate errors produced by extrapolating displacements pt has to use small enough time steps making it computationally demanding since the paths in our method are predetermined by eq 2 and free of time discretization sf method does not suffer from such a problem and is accurate and efficient pt method with small time steps though computationally inefficient is used as reference to compare mr and sf methods these methods will be further compared in numerical experiments below it is noteworthy that here the framework of sf method does not prohibit usage of other solving methods of stream functions in some cases modflow may not be the best choice and other tools can be used for certain strengths for example finite element method e g femwater lin et al 1997 can be used for multiscale meshing and local refinement analytical element method barnes and jankovic 1999 jankovic and barnes 1999b strack 2017 can provide very accurate results in media containing simple inclusions boundary element method is able to produce semi analytical solutions in nested aquifers wang et al 2018 and complex polynomial method used by craig 2015 can render accurate analytical solutions in two dimensional porous media whose hydraulic conductivity can be represented by polynomial in space in our point of view these candidates can influence the accuracy and efficiency of sf method to certain extent in various scenario which is worth systematic investigation in future 2 3 evaluation criterion of paths to assess the deviations of mr path from the fastest pt paths rizzo and de barros 2017 used the separation distance between right ends of mr paths and earliest particle arrivals however we believe that such separation distance is an indicator of exit position rather than a criterion for path evaluation because their separation of ends does not take into account the intermediate shape of paths at all and thus is unable to reflect real difference among paths instead we suggest use average path distance d defined as 5 d 1 n i n r i 6 r i min j 1 n x t e s i x r e f j where x t e s i i 1 n is the evenly discrete sequence of the path to be tested i e mr path or sf path n is the number of discrete points in the tested path x r e f j j 1 n is the sequence of reference path i e the fastest path found by pt n is the number of discrete points in the reference path r i represents the minimum distance from a point in the tested path to the reference path x r e f see fig 3 3 results and discussions in this section we investigate the performance of mr and sf methods compared to pt to explore the effectiveness of the proposed sf method in pfp search in various situations we use three methods to search the fastest path in k fields of different characteristics sf and mr methods are those we are really interested in for their computational efficiency time demanding but reliable pt method based on a large number of particles and small time steps is used to provide reference paths and particle fronts for other two methods the implementation of pt method have been described in literature see e g park et al 2008 salamon et al 2006 the regional flow direction is assumed to be from left to right and hence 10 000 evenly distributed particles are instantaneously released at left boundary 3 1 homogeneous aquifers with low permeability barriers let us consider a synthetic confined aquifer which is homogeneous except two low permeability barriers as shown in fig 4 k 1 l t and porosity is a constant equal to 0 3 the size of the aquifer is l x 400 l l y 200 l both barriers are 90 l long and 3 l wide leaving a gap of 20 l in between thus the flow field will be symmetric with respect to the horizon of y 100 l which is coincidently a streamline such an aquifer allows one directly reckoning that the fastest flow occurs along the axis of symmetry the horizon of y 100 l assume the head difference between left and right boundaries is δ h 4 l the dispersion coefficient d is constant and equal to 0 0001 l 2 t peclet number pe v m l c d where l c is the characteristic length of the aquifer in this case the length of barriers i e 90 l v m is the mean longitudinal velocity v m k h δ h l x 1 3 10 4 where k h is harmonic mean of k fields leading to pe 120 and a convection dominant flow regime fig 5 illustrates on the left 40 streamlines of equal ψ interval and on the right the streamtube area a versus y coordinate of streamtube outlet obtained by the algorithm above the streamline corresponding to a m i n is the fastest path found by sf method i e sf path marked by red dash line fig 6 compares the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr methods besides the particle front and the earliest particle arrival are also included as reference it is revealed that sf path is almost coincident to pt path showing the validity of sf in this example note that pt path is not an exact streamline due to existent dispersion but it will be close to some streamline when convection is dominating mr path is close to but distinct from pt path because all horizontal lines going through the gap has the same hydraulic resistance and are equally qualified paths to mr in our opinion mr path is not a good enough result of pfp for two reasons firstly the right end of mr path does not necessarily match the earliest arrival position secondly and more importantly mr path is not a feasible path of water solute migration due to hydrodynamics see curvature of streamlines in fig 5 except the horizon of y 100 l on the other hand sf path is a more reasonable result since it takes hydrodynamic conditions into account though the difference between sf and mr paths is limited here the reason behind the difference is critical and may produce more remarkable consequences in a different situation as shown below an additional example of an aquifer containing multiple low permeability barriers fig 7 is shown to further demonstrate the difference of mr and sf paths fig 8 presents the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr as well as the particle front again sf path and pt path match each other very well and mr path is distinct from them despite its right end being close to the earliest arrival in fig 9 streamlines are pictured with path results so that we can check the compatibility of these paths with hydrodynamic conditions it is clear that pt and sf paths are close to certain streamlines contrarily mr path keeps cutting a number of streamlines and conflicts against the flow field again it is not surprising since mr does not take dynamic conditions e g boundaries into account thus mr path is less favorable than sf path 3 2 performance for a log multi gaussian k field in this subsection we investigate the effectiveness of sf method in log multi gaussian k fields compared to mr and pt methods that is l n k is assumed to be multi gaussian and generated via sequential gaussian simulation deutsch and journel 1998 gaussian variogram model with mean m y 0 integral scale i y 100 l and variance σ y 2 2 25 is used an arbitrarily picked l n k field sample is shown in fig 10 boundary conditions presented in fig 1 are applied in calculation of velocity field head difference between the left and right boundaries is 40 l leading to mean velocity 0 1 l t from left to right the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr are reported in fig 11 together with the particle front it can be seen that sf path is almost identical to pt path and ends up at the earliest particle arrival as well figs 12 and 11 together demonstrate that mr path is remarkably worse than these two paths a the streamtube area is also demonstrated in right panel versus y coordinate of streamtube outlet in fig 12 one can see that the streamtube of a m i n i e sf path coincides with pt path and is compatible with dynamic conditions the difference between sf and mr paths is more remarkable in this case 3 3 performance assessment for different settings of l n k field features of flow fields can be distinct for different k fields and may impact the performance of pfp identification methods in order to avoid building our observations on an unconsolidated basis parallel experiments are carried out for a large number of l n k fields to investigate the accuracy and robustness of sf method and mr 3 3 1 overall performance of sf and mr for l n k fields of 9 scenarios we compare three methods in parallel experiments using 100 l n k fields generated by sequential gaussian simulation as above but using different settings see table 1 that is the performance of sf and mr methods are assessed by average path distance d in 900 different l n k fields the resultant d values of sf and mr paths for 100 fields in all 9 scenarios are reported in fig 13 in form of boxplot it is found that d box i e first second and third quartiles of sf is systematically lower than d box of mr in all 9 scenarios despite some outliers it means that sf paths are significantly closer to pt paths than mr paths thus sf method generally produces a more accurate result of pfp than mr though the superiority of sf can be weakened by the increase of σ y 2 to inspect this point more clearly fig 14 reports statistics of d in 100 fields of 9 scenarios for sf and mr including minimum min first quartile q1 median i e second quartile third quartile q3 and maximum max of d it is shown that 1 when σ y 2 1 all statistics except max of d for sf are remarkably smaller than those for mr 2 when σ y 2 4 statistics except max of d for sf generally increase but those for mr decrease more or less making mr results less inferior 3 when σ y 2 9 the differences in statistics of d for two methods become smaller but sf still slightly overperforms mr 4 when σ y 2 remains unchanged differences in d generated by different correlation structure i y and θ are not as remarkable as those by σ y 2 suggesting that σ y 2 is a more influential factor 3 3 2 inspection of mismatch to pt paths in fig 13 above l n k field outliers in which a large d is found for sf or mr paths can be observed in all scenarios for both sf and mr methods to understand the reason of d being large we inspect 4 fields in which d is one of the largest 4 values for sf or mr path respectively 8 fields in total for every scenario fig 15 reports the comparison results for scenario a1 where the left column a c e g are 4 largest d cases for sf and the right column b d f h are 4 largest d ones for mr in the left column it is found that sf paths red dash lines are more or less parallel to pt paths black solid lines besides sf paths though not close to pt paths usually coincide to one of other particle front fingers a c e g in fig 15 it suggests that existence of multiple pfp may lead to divergence of sf and pt paths similar phenomenon is also observed in the right column for mr fig 15d and h however in fig 15b f and e mr paths seem crossing over particle fronts multiple times and not matching any front finger implying a conflict between mr path and flow field such conflict is very similar to what happens in figs 11 and 12 fig 16 shows the comparison results for a3 σ y 2 9 it is observed in fig 16 that 1 path results in sf and mr may be distinct from pt paths but match one of front fingers induced by existence of multiple pfp 2 lack of hydrodynamic constraints is an additional and significant cause of path mismatch in mr which is solved in sf method 3 paths found by all three methods are much more crooked and rough than those in a1 σ y 2 1 indicating the impact of large σ y 2 similar observations can be obtained in comparisons of paths for scenarios b3 and c3 figs 17 and 18 the observations in scenarios of σ y 2 4 a2 b2 and c2 are generally in between thus omitted for brevity overall the primary reason of large differences between a sf or mr path and a pt path is the existence of multiple fast paths especially for sf besides mr paths can remarkably differ from pt paths for another and a very unfavorable reason i e conflicts against flow fields led by lack of dynamic constraints in mr algorithm 3 3 3 time cost time cost of a pfp search algorithm is one of critical factors which impact the algorithm applicability despite of its reliability the conventional pt method has a high computational demand which impairs its application to high dimensional real problems the strongest advantage of mr method over pt method is computational efficiency one may wonder whether sf method proposed in this study is also computationally efficient to answer this question single field time cost t c in all fields of 9 scenarios above are presented in fig 19 in boxplot form for sf mr and pt methods two clear facts can be noticed 1 t c of pt is much higher than sf and mr in all scenarios 2 t c of mr is very stable regardless of σ y 2 and correlation structure as to sf the behavior of t c appears to be dependent on σ y 2 as σ y 2 1 t c of sf is consistently lower than t c of pt and even mr as σ y 2 4 t c of sf varies in a larger range but hardly exceeds t c of mr as σ y 2 9 the variability of t c is stronger and overall t c of sf can be smaller or mildly larger than or comparable to that of mr see fig 19f c and i respectively we find that variation of t c is mainly attributed to variation of modflow runtime during solving stream function ψ additional iterations may be needed to secure accuracy in k fields of high heterogeneity in summary when σ y 2 4 sf is more efficient than pt and mr when σ y 2 9 time cost of sf is close to that of mr slightly dependent on correlation structure 3 4 limitation of space dimensionality a major limitation of our analysis is spatial dimensionality of the flow problems i e only two dimensional flow considered in our analyses above though there exist problems which can be loosely treated to be two dimensional three dimensional flow and transport problems are usually encountered in real geologic formations as is pointed out in literature characteristics of connectivity can be distinct in two and three dimensional structures and preferential flow paths are more remarkable in three dimensional flows fiori and jankovic 2012 hence our analyses above lead to observations representative only in two dimensional porous media for enhanced results the applicability and performance of sf method in three dimensional media have to and will be investigated in the future study 4 conclusions pfp which strongly impact water and solute migration in geologic formations is very important in understanding and predicting the behavior of aquifers though there are pt and mr methods which can be used to identify pfp in heterogeneous aquifers these two methods are not satisfying for either high computational demand or low reliability in this paper we propose a new framework of sf method based on stream function we first establish the proportionality relation between travel time and streamtube area which allows finding the fastest flow path by seeking the minimum streamtube area by using existing convenient tools e g modflow and matlab functions it is easy to solve stream functions in heterogeneous aquifers draw streamlines and evaluate streamtube areas though being ware of the distinct behavior of preferential flow paths in two and three dimensional structures here we stay focusing on demonstration of the framework of sf method in two dimensional heterogeneous media to explore the effectiveness of sf method and compare it with pt and mr methods we use three methods to analyze the pfp in three examples including two aquifers containing low permeability barriers and one log multi gaussian k field furthermore parallel experiments are conducted in 900 lnk fields of 9 different settings to inspect the robustness of sf method time cost of three methods are compared in the parallel experiments as well some significant observations are obtained from the results in this study 1 sf usually leads to a path coinciding with pt path or other reasonable fast paths indicated by particle front fingers suggesting that sf is effective and generally leads to satisfying results very close to results of pt 2 mr does not take hydrodynamic conditions into account therefore mr paths sometimes conflict against the flow fields and may lead to paths that water or solute is unlikely to follow in terms of hydrodynamics 3 statistics of average path distance d in a large number of log multi gaussian k fields indicate that sf method usually performs much better than mr in k fields of weak and mild heterogeneity when variance of lnk fields is as large as 9 the performance of sf degrades but is still statistically better than that of mr 4 both sf and mr methods are far more efficient than conventional pt method while time cost of mr does not rely on the degree of heterogeneity time cost of sf does for weak or mild heterogeneity time cost of sf is generally lower than that of mr in lnk fields of variance equal to 9 time cost of sf is comparable to that of mr and still very efficient in all sf method is found to be effective and efficient in pfp identification compared to pt and mr methods according to our analysis in two dimensional porous media it avoids high computational demand in pt method and lack of hydrodynamic conditions in mr method though further studies in three dimensional porous media will be required to enhance our confidence to sf method sf method seems a promising tool for its ease in implementation computational efficiency and consistency with hydrodynamics it can be applied in environmental risk assessment connectivity and mixing analysis based on heterogeneity features in future declaration of competing

media which leads to extremely uneven flow distributions connections of highly conductive parts of media allows existence of fast flow conduits i e preferential flow paths pfp as observed in modeling and field studies such pfp may convey dominating water and solute migrations in a small portion of space bianchi et al 2011 fiori 2014 zheng et al 2011 zheng and gorelick 2003 and increase difficulty in solute transport prediction occurrence of pfp often dramatically change the behavior of aquifers like scale effects anomalous diffusion early time arrivals and so on fiori 2014 le borgne et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2006 thus it drives hydrogeologists to describe quantitatively the degree of connection or channeling for high conductivity clusters renard and allard 2013 tyukhova and willmann 2016 and to reconsider the relationship between groundwater data and models to avoid black swans low chance but consequential outcomes in model prediction ferre 2017 peeters 2017 there have been analytical semi analytical and numerical approaches to deal with solute transport problems in heterogeneous aquifers analytical approaches are generally limited to aquifers of weak or mild heterogeneity de barros et al 2015 rizzo and de barros 2017 numerical approaches e g random walk particle tracking etc are usually applicable to aquifers of generic heterogeneity but suffer from high computational cost in practice boso et al 2013 moslehi et al 2015 park et al 2008 salamon et al 2006 semi analytical approaches are often of less popularity compared to numerical approaches due to their complexities in implementation and certain assumptions e g stationarity geometric regularity etc which are often hard to satisfy in practice cvetkovic et al 2014 fiori et al 2015 jankovic and barnes 1999b there are also attempts to numerically search potential fast conduits in heterogeneous aquifers more efficiently rizzo and de barros 2017 defined minimum hydraulic resistance mr and applied an algorithm from graph theory to fast search the mr path between two points search for mr path is indeed computationally efficient but it is somehow problematic to use mr path as an indicator of pfp in many cases the main limitation of mr is that the definition of mr relies only on spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity regardless of dynamics and flow conditions hence the evaluation of mr path often leads to geometrically fast but dynamically unreasonable paths such as excessive meandering and unlikely upstream moves in this study stream function is used to overcome the limitation of mr in determination of pfp stream functions have been found very useful in simulation of groundwater flow bear 1972 solute transport obi and blunt 2004 two phase fluid dynamics siavashi et al 2016 analysis of travel time distributions fuks et al 2019 and so on analytical solutions of stream functions can only be obtained under very constrained conditions and in aquifers of general heterogeneity numerical approaches have to be employed there are studies which provided ways of calculating stream functions in two or three dimensional models batycky et al 1997 blunt et al 1996 mallison et al 2006 matanga 1993 1996 steward 1998 thiele et al 1996 many numerical approaches of solving streamtubes e g modpath pollock 1994 are based on velocity fields and particle tracking pt which usually introduces errors both in velocity interpolation and displacement extrapolation and is generally computationally expensive we propose an approach to find the early time arrivals by efficiently evaluating streamtubes in heterogeneous aquifers through widely used numerical softwares e g modflow the objective of this study is to establish an efficient and effective framework to quantitatively analyze aquifer heterogeneity and identify pfp based on not only spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity but also flow conditions this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the procedure to determine stream tubes and travel time in heterogeneity section 3 explores the validity of our proposed method by comparing it with mr and pt methods analyze the impact of heterogeneity level on pfp identification and compare efficiency of three methods section 4 provides the main conclusions in this study 2 methodology 2 1 identification of pfp via streamtubes pfp means a conduit of fast flow and ease at water transport thus can be indicated by concentrated streamlines a streamline is a curve that are instantaneously tangent to the velocity field a streamtube is bounded by streamlines and carries a fixed volumetric flux blunt et al 1996 in two dimensional flow an imaginary function ψ x y ψ x y t for transient flow which is constant along streamlines is called the stream function of two dimensional flow l2 t bear 1972 in three dimensional flow the streamlines are related to two stream functions λ x y z and χ x y z leading to higher complexity in calculation but still solvable steward 1998 thiele et al 1996 though we recognize that preferential flow may be greatly impacted by spatial dimension fiori and jankovic 2012 we currently focus on demonstrating the proposed framework and constrain our analysis to two dimensional flow in heterogeneous yet isotropic media and ignore compressibility of water in this study consequently one has pseudo potential flow q k h and k h 0 where k k x y is hydraulic conductivity and h h x y is the hydraulic head and a pseudo potential q is specific discharge vector in such problems the corresponding equation for ψ is bear 1972 equation 6 5 26 1 1 k ψ 0 for a given k field we can define resistance field r x y 1 k x y and then have a classic partial differential equation in groundwater modeling 2 r ψ 0 existing groundwater flow solvers such as finite element or finite difference methods analytical element method jankovic and barnes 1999a b strack 2017 etc can numerically or semi analytically solve a partial differential equation of the form like eq 2 with good efficiency and accuracy thus one is able to immediately obtain spatial distribution of ψ in the domain the streamlines can be found by linking points of the same ψ values with curves probably after interpolation or simply using off the shelf contouring functions e g bourke 1987 mathworks 2007 this step is also computationally efficient the travel time along a streamline of ψ i can be expressed as 3 t d s v where v k h is the magnitude of darcian velocity flux d s is the length measure along the streamline now consider a small streamtube enclosed by streamlines of ψ i δ ψ 2 and ψ i δ ψ 2 recall that the total discharge between the two streamlines of ψ i δ ψ 2 and ψ i δ ψ 2 is equal to the difference of stream function i e δ ψ q i on the other hand one has q i v s w s where v s is the cross sectional average of velocity in the streamtube and w is the width of the streamtube thus one has v s δ ψ w s if v in eq 3 is approximated by v then 4 t ds v w s δ ψ d s a δ ψ where a w s d s is the total area of the streamtube according to eq 4 travel time in a streamtube is proportional to the streamtube area a if the stream function difference δ ψ between neighboring streamlines is fixed we can find the streamline along which travel time is the shortest i e pfp by simply comparing areas of streamtubes the approximation error in eq 4 goes down as δ ψ decreases i e thinner streamtubes used for brevity the proposed method is termed stream function based method or sf method below 2 2 evaluation of stream function and search for shortest travel time as mentioned in section 2 1 eq 2 can be efficiently solved by existing groundwater flow solvers such as analytical element method finite element or finite difference methods here we use finite difference based tool modflow harbaugh et al 2000 as an example for its ease in implementation and popularity of course other solvers can be used for certain wanted strengths e g local refinement accuracy flexibility to irregular interfaces etc though it is not trivial to find proper boundary conditions for eq 2 in complex problems matanga 1993 in context of pfp analysis one can impose simple boundary conditions of dirichlet and neumann types see fig 1 more specifically the upstream and downstream sides of regional flow direction where constant head boundary conditions are often imposed can be specified as neumann boundary for ψ no flux boundary of ψ at the lateral impermeable sides constant ψ boundary conditions can be specified since the impermeable sides themselves are streamlines more complex boundary conditions can be applied in complicated situations if needed ψ distribution can be obtained by numerically solving eq 2 plus appropriate boundary conditions once the spatial distribution of ψ is solved a series of streamlines can be conveniently found by contouring ψ values through existing tools what we use in this study is contour function in matlab mathworks 2007 which approximates streamlines by polygonal lines and provides coordinates of line points for specified ψ values to evaluate the area of streamtubes we employ a matlab function polyarea which is able to fast calculate the area of a polygon characterized by a sequence of vertexes by comparing the area of streamtubes a one is able to identify the fastest streamline a representative of pfp the workflow of the proposed sf method is shown in fig 2 a and the conventional pt method is also included in fig 2 b for comparison purpose the advantage of sf method is the efficiency and accuracy as well as ease of implementation as explained above the calculation of ψ s4 in fig 2 a can be efficiently done with widely used groundwater flow solvers e g modflow contouring the resultant ψ with an existing contour algorithm s5 in fig 2 a immediately leads to sufficiently accurate streamlines traditional pt method relies on tracking a large number of particles carried by velocity fields to find streamlines pollock 1994 it extrapolates displacements of particles according to current velocity vector and time step p5 in fig 2 b which is prone to overshoot and usually produces inaccurate paths in order to alleviate errors produced by extrapolating displacements pt has to use small enough time steps making it computationally demanding since the paths in our method are predetermined by eq 2 and free of time discretization sf method does not suffer from such a problem and is accurate and efficient pt method with small time steps though computationally inefficient is used as reference to compare mr and sf methods these methods will be further compared in numerical experiments below it is noteworthy that here the framework of sf method does not prohibit usage of other solving methods of stream functions in some cases modflow may not be the best choice and other tools can be used for certain strengths for example finite element method e g femwater lin et al 1997 can be used for multiscale meshing and local refinement analytical element method barnes and jankovic 1999 jankovic and barnes 1999b strack 2017 can provide very accurate results in media containing simple inclusions boundary element method is able to produce semi analytical solutions in nested aquifers wang et al 2018 and complex polynomial method used by craig 2015 can render accurate analytical solutions in two dimensional porous media whose hydraulic conductivity can be represented by polynomial in space in our point of view these candidates can influence the accuracy and efficiency of sf method to certain extent in various scenario which is worth systematic investigation in future 2 3 evaluation criterion of paths to assess the deviations of mr path from the fastest pt paths rizzo and de barros 2017 used the separation distance between right ends of mr paths and earliest particle arrivals however we believe that such separation distance is an indicator of exit position rather than a criterion for path evaluation because their separation of ends does not take into account the intermediate shape of paths at all and thus is unable to reflect real difference among paths instead we suggest use average path distance d defined as 5 d 1 n i n r i 6 r i min j 1 n x t e s i x r e f j where x t e s i i 1 n is the evenly discrete sequence of the path to be tested i e mr path or sf path n is the number of discrete points in the tested path x r e f j j 1 n is the sequence of reference path i e the fastest path found by pt n is the number of discrete points in the reference path r i represents the minimum distance from a point in the tested path to the reference path x r e f see fig 3 3 results and discussions in this section we investigate the performance of mr and sf methods compared to pt to explore the effectiveness of the proposed sf method in pfp search in various situations we use three methods to search the fastest path in k fields of different characteristics sf and mr methods are those we are really interested in for their computational efficiency time demanding but reliable pt method based on a large number of particles and small time steps is used to provide reference paths and particle fronts for other two methods the implementation of pt method have been described in literature see e g park et al 2008 salamon et al 2006 the regional flow direction is assumed to be from left to right and hence 10 000 evenly distributed particles are instantaneously released at left boundary 3 1 homogeneous aquifers with low permeability barriers let us consider a synthetic confined aquifer which is homogeneous except two low permeability barriers as shown in fig 4 k 1 l t and porosity is a constant equal to 0 3 the size of the aquifer is l x 400 l l y 200 l both barriers are 90 l long and 3 l wide leaving a gap of 20 l in between thus the flow field will be symmetric with respect to the horizon of y 100 l which is coincidently a streamline such an aquifer allows one directly reckoning that the fastest flow occurs along the axis of symmetry the horizon of y 100 l assume the head difference between left and right boundaries is δ h 4 l the dispersion coefficient d is constant and equal to 0 0001 l 2 t peclet number pe v m l c d where l c is the characteristic length of the aquifer in this case the length of barriers i e 90 l v m is the mean longitudinal velocity v m k h δ h l x 1 3 10 4 where k h is harmonic mean of k fields leading to pe 120 and a convection dominant flow regime fig 5 illustrates on the left 40 streamlines of equal ψ interval and on the right the streamtube area a versus y coordinate of streamtube outlet obtained by the algorithm above the streamline corresponding to a m i n is the fastest path found by sf method i e sf path marked by red dash line fig 6 compares the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr methods besides the particle front and the earliest particle arrival are also included as reference it is revealed that sf path is almost coincident to pt path showing the validity of sf in this example note that pt path is not an exact streamline due to existent dispersion but it will be close to some streamline when convection is dominating mr path is close to but distinct from pt path because all horizontal lines going through the gap has the same hydraulic resistance and are equally qualified paths to mr in our opinion mr path is not a good enough result of pfp for two reasons firstly the right end of mr path does not necessarily match the earliest arrival position secondly and more importantly mr path is not a feasible path of water solute migration due to hydrodynamics see curvature of streamlines in fig 5 except the horizon of y 100 l on the other hand sf path is a more reasonable result since it takes hydrodynamic conditions into account though the difference between sf and mr paths is limited here the reason behind the difference is critical and may produce more remarkable consequences in a different situation as shown below an additional example of an aquifer containing multiple low permeability barriers fig 7 is shown to further demonstrate the difference of mr and sf paths fig 8 presents the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr as well as the particle front again sf path and pt path match each other very well and mr path is distinct from them despite its right end being close to the earliest arrival in fig 9 streamlines are pictured with path results so that we can check the compatibility of these paths with hydrodynamic conditions it is clear that pt and sf paths are close to certain streamlines contrarily mr path keeps cutting a number of streamlines and conflicts against the flow field again it is not surprising since mr does not take dynamic conditions e g boundaries into account thus mr path is less favorable than sf path 3 2 performance for a log multi gaussian k field in this subsection we investigate the effectiveness of sf method in log multi gaussian k fields compared to mr and pt methods that is l n k is assumed to be multi gaussian and generated via sequential gaussian simulation deutsch and journel 1998 gaussian variogram model with mean m y 0 integral scale i y 100 l and variance σ y 2 2 25 is used an arbitrarily picked l n k field sample is shown in fig 10 boundary conditions presented in fig 1 are applied in calculation of velocity field head difference between the left and right boundaries is 40 l leading to mean velocity 0 1 l t from left to right the fastest paths found by pt sf and mr are reported in fig 11 together with the particle front it can be seen that sf path is almost identical to pt path and ends up at the earliest particle arrival as well figs 12 and 11 together demonstrate that mr path is remarkably worse than these two paths a the streamtube area is also demonstrated in right panel versus y coordinate of streamtube outlet in fig 12 one can see that the streamtube of a m i n i e sf path coincides with pt path and is compatible with dynamic conditions the difference between sf and mr paths is more remarkable in this case 3 3 performance assessment for different settings of l n k field features of flow fields can be distinct for different k fields and may impact the performance of pfp identification methods in order to avoid building our observations on an unconsolidated basis parallel experiments are carried out for a large number of l n k fields to investigate the accuracy and robustness of sf method and mr 3 3 1 overall performance of sf and mr for l n k fields of 9 scenarios we compare three methods in parallel experiments using 100 l n k fields generated by sequential gaussian simulation as above but using different settings see table 1 that is the performance of sf and mr methods are assessed by average path distance d in 900 different l n k fields the resultant d values of sf and mr paths for 100 fields in all 9 scenarios are reported in fig 13 in form of boxplot it is found that d box i e first second and third quartiles of sf is systematically lower than d box of mr in all 9 scenarios despite some outliers it means that sf paths are significantly closer to pt paths than mr paths thus sf method generally produces a more accurate result of pfp than mr though the superiority of sf can be weakened by the increase of σ y 2 to inspect this point more clearly fig 14 reports statistics of d in 100 fields of 9 scenarios for sf and mr including minimum min first quartile q1 median i e second quartile third quartile q3 and maximum max of d it is shown that 1 when σ y 2 1 all statistics except max of d for sf are remarkably smaller than those for mr 2 when σ y 2 4 statistics except max of d for sf generally increase but those for mr decrease more or less making mr results less inferior 3 when σ y 2 9 the differences in statistics of d for two methods become smaller but sf still slightly overperforms mr 4 when σ y 2 remains unchanged differences in d generated by different correlation structure i y and θ are not as remarkable as those by σ y 2 suggesting that σ y 2 is a more influential factor 3 3 2 inspection of mismatch to pt paths in fig 13 above l n k field outliers in which a large d is found for sf or mr paths can be observed in all scenarios for both sf and mr methods to understand the reason of d being large we inspect 4 fields in which d is one of the largest 4 values for sf or mr path respectively 8 fields in total for every scenario fig 15 reports the comparison results for scenario a1 where the left column a c e g are 4 largest d cases for sf and the right column b d f h are 4 largest d ones for mr in the left column it is found that sf paths red dash lines are more or less parallel to pt paths black solid lines besides sf paths though not close to pt paths usually coincide to one of other particle front fingers a c e g in fig 15 it suggests that existence of multiple pfp may lead to divergence of sf and pt paths similar phenomenon is also observed in the right column for mr fig 15d and h however in fig 15b f and e mr paths seem crossing over particle fronts multiple times and not matching any front finger implying a conflict between mr path and flow field such conflict is very similar to what happens in figs 11 and 12 fig 16 shows the comparison results for a3 σ y 2 9 it is observed in fig 16 that 1 path results in sf and mr may be distinct from pt paths but match one of front fingers induced by existence of multiple pfp 2 lack of hydrodynamic constraints is an additional and significant cause of path mismatch in mr which is solved in sf method 3 paths found by all three methods are much more crooked and rough than those in a1 σ y 2 1 indicating the impact of large σ y 2 similar observations can be obtained in comparisons of paths for scenarios b3 and c3 figs 17 and 18 the observations in scenarios of σ y 2 4 a2 b2 and c2 are generally in between thus omitted for brevity overall the primary reason of large differences between a sf or mr path and a pt path is the existence of multiple fast paths especially for sf besides mr paths can remarkably differ from pt paths for another and a very unfavorable reason i e conflicts against flow fields led by lack of dynamic constraints in mr algorithm 3 3 3 time cost time cost of a pfp search algorithm is one of critical factors which impact the algorithm applicability despite of its reliability the conventional pt method has a high computational demand which impairs its application to high dimensional real problems the strongest advantage of mr method over pt method is computational efficiency one may wonder whether sf method proposed in this study is also computationally efficient to answer this question single field time cost t c in all fields of 9 scenarios above are presented in fig 19 in boxplot form for sf mr and pt methods two clear facts can be noticed 1 t c of pt is much higher than sf and mr in all scenarios 2 t c of mr is very stable regardless of σ y 2 and correlation structure as to sf the behavior of t c appears to be dependent on σ y 2 as σ y 2 1 t c of sf is consistently lower than t c of pt and even mr as σ y 2 4 t c of sf varies in a larger range but hardly exceeds t c of mr as σ y 2 9 the variability of t c is stronger and overall t c of sf can be smaller or mildly larger than or comparable to that of mr see fig 19f c and i respectively we find that variation of t c is mainly attributed to variation of modflow runtime during solving stream function ψ additional iterations may be needed to secure accuracy in k fields of high heterogeneity in summary when σ y 2 4 sf is more efficient than pt and mr when σ y 2 9 time cost of sf is close to that of mr slightly dependent on correlation structure 3 4 limitation of space dimensionality a major limitation of our analysis is spatial dimensionality of the flow problems i e only two dimensional flow considered in our analyses above though there exist problems which can be loosely treated to be two dimensional three dimensional flow and transport problems are usually encountered in real geologic formations as is pointed out in literature characteristics of connectivity can be distinct in two and three dimensional structures and preferential flow paths are more remarkable in three dimensional flows fiori and jankovic 2012 hence our analyses above lead to observations representative only in two dimensional porous media for enhanced results the applicability and performance of sf method in three dimensional media have to and will be investigated in the future study 4 conclusions pfp which strongly impact water and solute migration in geologic formations is very important in understanding and predicting the behavior of aquifers though there are pt and mr methods which can be used to identify pfp in heterogeneous aquifers these two methods are not satisfying for either high computational demand or low reliability in this paper we propose a new framework of sf method based on stream function we first establish the proportionality relation between travel time and streamtube area which allows finding the fastest flow path by seeking the minimum streamtube area by using existing convenient tools e g modflow and matlab functions it is easy to solve stream functions in heterogeneous aquifers draw streamlines and evaluate streamtube areas though being ware of the distinct behavior of preferential flow paths in two and three dimensional structures here we stay focusing on demonstration of the framework of sf method in two dimensional heterogeneous media to explore the effectiveness of sf method and compare it with pt and mr methods we use three methods to analyze the pfp in three examples including two aquifers containing low permeability barriers and one log multi gaussian k field furthermore parallel experiments are conducted in 900 lnk fields of 9 different settings to inspect the robustness of sf method time cost of three methods are compared in the parallel experiments as well some significant observations are obtained from the results in this study 1 sf usually leads to a path coinciding with pt path or other reasonable fast paths indicated by particle front fingers suggesting that sf is effective and generally leads to satisfying results very close to results of pt 2 mr does not take hydrodynamic conditions into account therefore mr paths sometimes conflict against the flow fields and may lead to paths that water or solute is unlikely to follow in terms of hydrodynamics 3 statistics of average path distance d in a large number of log multi gaussian k fields indicate that sf method usually performs much better than mr in k fields of weak and mild heterogeneity when variance of lnk fields is as large as 9 the performance of sf degrades but is still statistically better than that of mr 4 both sf and mr methods are far more efficient than conventional pt method while time cost of mr does not rely on the degree of heterogeneity time cost of sf does for weak or mild heterogeneity time cost of sf is generally lower than that of mr in lnk fields of variance equal to 9 time cost of sf is comparable to that of mr and still very efficient in all sf method is found to be effective and efficient in pfp identification compared to pt and mr methods according to our analysis in two dimensional porous media it avoids high computational demand in pt method and lack of hydrodynamic conditions in mr method though further studies in three dimensional porous media will be required to enhance our confidence to sf method sf method seems a promising tool for its ease in implementation computational efficiency and consistency with hydrodynamics it can be applied in environmental risk assessment connectivity and mixing analysis based on heterogeneity features in future declaration of competing

6232,little is known about the contribution of bedload flux to the total sediment load exported from tropical sand bed rivers yet predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management more appropriate river engineering works design accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management therefore bedload suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower gilgel abay river in the blue nile catchment of ethiopia catchment area is 3887 km2 average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 164 m3 s 1 and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0 0007 m m 1 a standard helley smith u s bl 84 cable suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season the bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted medium sized sand 250 500 µm with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution the mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0 7 to 427 5 mg d 1 with an average rate of 175 1 mg d 1 field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier the average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220 028 mg d 1 and dominates the total sediment yield 94 6 the bedload accounts for only 0 1 to 5 4 of the total sediment load the area specific bedload and suspended load are also 0 6 and 22 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively the elongated planform growth of the gilgel abay river delta in lake tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine suspended load in the sediment transport of this river in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of tana lake among the tested bedload prediction criteria the stream power based equations of martin and modified bagnold performed better yet the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data adj r2 0 82 0 87 finally this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand bed rivers in africa and other tropical regions keywords sand bed river sediment transport us bl 84 sampler bedload to total load ratio lake tana basin 1 introduction sediment yield is the mass of total sediment load tl that leaves a catchment per unit area and time and comprises bedload and suspended load whereas bedload is the coarsest part of the fluvial sediment that moves in sliding rolling or jumping modes along the river bed suspended load is carried in suspension in the water column emmett 1981 gomez 1991 depending on grain size of the sediment and energy of the flowing water solid material may interchange between bedload and suspended load components on its journey through a river system church 2006 usually the bedload component is ignored due to measurement constraints e g delmas et al 2012 vanmaercke et al 2014 or estimated as a fixed fraction of the tl e g powell et al 1996 turowski et al 2010 ziegler et al 2014 as a result the bedload data from rivers worldwide are extremely scarce erskine and saynor 2015 the average global measured bedload fluxes typically account for 15 of tl alexandrov et al 2009 babiński 2005 claude et al 2012 delmas et al 2012 emmett 1981 girma 2005 karambiri and ribolzi 2003 turowski et al 2010 and may reach up to 50 in small catchments with debris rich slopes and in river channels of mountainous areas located in the temperate zone babiński 2005 mccarthy et al 1991 powell et al 1996 turowski et al 2010 bedload also constitutes ca 7 of the tl for sand bed rivers in tropical environments babiński 2005 erskine and saynor 2015 although measurements of sediment transport in africa started in the nineteenth century relatively little is known about the total sediment load tl and many uncertainties still exist vanmaercke et al 2014 walling 1984 despite its size and topographic variability sediment yield sy data in africa are few observed mainly from large rivers and poorly represent small catchments vanmaercke et al 2014 particularly studies indicated that bedload in african rivers constitutes 6 of tl in ephemeral streams and rivers dominated by suspended load e g billi 2011 karambiri and ribolzi 2003 spronck 1941 13 30 of tl in small gravel bed rivers with mountainous catchments e g kulfo ethiopia and in large rivers e g nile at bani sweif egypt having relatively steep channel gradients abdel fattah et al 2004 girma 2005 and may reach 40 55 of tl in debris rich channels of semi arid areas e g okavango in botswana that have high level of anthropogenic disturbance and aeolian inputs mccarthy et al 1991 and mountainous catchments in the sahel olivry and hoorelbecke 1975 moreover sediment yield measurements from gauging stations generally do not include bedload and therefore underestimate the true sy vanmaercke et al 2014 except two case studies that showed a bedload to tl ratio of 1 14 in semi arid and hilly catchments billi 2011 girma 2005 the magnitude of bedload is currently unknown for most ethiopian river similarly to most rivers worldwide nyssen et al 2004 vanmaercke et al 2014 sediment transport data are crucial in any river engineering work design and its quantification is gaining prominent importance with increasing utilization of water resources erskine and saynor 2015 field measurements of bedload flux require reliable equipment and measuring techniques whereas bedload prediction by means of transport capacity equation is not yet sufficiently accurate especially in supply limited systems where sediment supply variations can largely dictate bedload rates blanckaert et al 2017 comiti and mao 2012 gomez 1991 commonly bedload transport rates are measured in the field by portable samplers or sediment traps e g billi 2011 billi et al 2017 blanckaert et al 2017 emmett 1981 or are estimated by applying an appropriate sediment transport equation e g billi and ali 2010 heimann et al 2015 kuhnle et al 2014 recently in order to understand this complex process there has been a trend towards the direct measurement of bedload in small to large sand bed rivers by means of portable pressure differential samplers throughout the world erskine and saynor 2015 kociuba 2017 rachlewicz et al 2017 whereas the portable traps developed by bunte et al 2004 have performed more accurately in small mountain coarse grained gravel bed rivers with very low flow depths ca 0 39 m flow velocities 1 0 1 5 m s 1 and discharge 4 0 5 7 m3 s 1 bunte at al traps therefore are not suitable for permanent rivers in which flow depth does not allow their direct installation on the streambed the portable pressure differential samplers are preferred by operators for several reasons i e ease of use portable fit easily into the channel bed and are less disruptive for river flow the most used bedload sampler the helley smith has its best efficiency in sandy and mixed fine gravel sand bed rivers this sampler therefore is the best option for bedload measurement in small to medium size lowland sand bed rivers with relatively small flow depth and stream power very high flow velocities and depth in fact tend to drag the sampler on the streambed thus leading to overestimate of the actual bedload emmett 1979 on the other hand estimating bedload transport rates from simple hydrological measurements would greatly benefit various sediment related river management practices gao 2011 this study focuses on the little studied sand bed rivers in africa which could also be advantageous to identify the roles of measured suspended sediment yield and bedload in sediment budgeting in the region we aim i to quantify bedload fluxes in the lower reach of gilgel abay river ii to assess the relative significance of bedload and suspended load iii to establish statistically significant and meaningful empirical relationships between daily bedload flux and hydraulic variables and iv to evaluate the performance of some of the most widely applied bedload formulas against field data 2 gilgel abay catchment gilgel abay meaning the little nile river is located in lake tana basin and enters ethiopia s largest lake 60 80 km diameter from the south fig 1 the catchment drains 3887 km2 and its elevation ranges from 1786 to 3531 m a s l the river is equipped with two flow gauges i e bikolo station at the hilly part and chimba station located nearly at the start of kunzla floodplains i e ca 16 km from the mouth dessie et al 2014 lemma et al 2018 the average slope gradient of the catchment is 8 3 range 0 72 and the channel bed gradient at chimba bridge is 1 7 along the 250 m long natural reach upstream of the chimba gauging site geologically the catchment is dominated by quaternary basalts williams 2016 the climate is characterized as highland tropical monsoon and shows distinct wet and dry seasons where the wet season usually runs from june to september and accounts for 70 90 of annual rainfall fetene et al 2018 the average annual rainfall varies between 1200 mm and 2400 mm 1999 2016 in addition to natural erosion processes sediment is supplied to the stream channels mainly due to deforestation land use intensification and subsequent accelerated land degradation hurni et al 2005 intense rainfall erodible soils steep slopes along most of the channel length severe gullying bank erosion and channel incision abate et al 2015 provide persistent and high sediment supply to the channel addis and klik 2015 tilahun et al 2016 and subsequently increased sedimentation further downstream and rapid delta growth poppe et al 2013 as a result gilgel abay river delta shows considerable change particularly during the last three decades fig 2 in response to high anthropogenic induced soil erosion rates in the catchment poppe et al 2013 3 methods 3 1 river discharge measurements the flow discharge measurements were made at chimba gauging station located 155 m downstream of the chimba bridge figs 1 3 the water stage data was recorded automatically by a pressure transducer type diver at 10 min interval and manually by staff gauge on a daily basis a stage discharge relation determined by dessie et al 2014 was used to convert the stage data to flow discharge data the river profile and cross section at the bridge were also monitored using a total station fig 4 at the monitoring site mean annual discharge is 115 m3 s 1 streambed width is ca 71 m at bankfull discharge and bed material is predominantly sandy d50 0 61 mm there is stone riprap ca 32 cm in size near left bridge span 3 2 bedload measurements bedload measurements were conducted at chimba bridge for a total of 23 days within the period of 13 july to 30 november 2017 for river discharges ranging from low flows 44 m3 s 1 to the peak discharges of a 2 year flood 511 m3 s 1 bedload was measured by a standard helley smith u s bl 84 cable suspended sampler the 29 5 kg sampler has a 7 62 cm square intake and an area expansion ratio of 1 4 edwards and glysson 1999 the sampling bag has a length of 46 cm surface area of 1903 cm2 and consists of 0 25 mm mesh polyester it is attached to the rear of the mouth with a rubber o ring edwards and glysson 1999 emmett 1981 the bedload sampler was lowered from the bridge deck into the river using a small locally made crane fig 3b all the bedload measurements were made standing on the downstream side of chimba bridge fig 3a and b the bridge consists of two rectangular spans 37 5 m wide each however the maximum effective channel width through which bedload flux occurs is 71 m initially we tried to divide the width at full bank into five equally spaced subsections but the third sampling vertical would then be in front of the central bridge pier hence we delimited five verticals that are approximately equally spaced of which 3 verticals on the left span deeper section and 2 verticals on the right span we also tried to avoid side sloped areas so as to position the sampler on flat area the energy slope of the water surface along the 370 m long reach was determined by marking the water surface elevation on both sides of the river bank and then taking the readings by total station at the upstream side the river reach is separated by an islet located 75 m upstream of the bridge fig 3c i e there is a 190 m straight reach with an energy gradient of 0 12 on the left a 215 m long reach with gradient of 0 06 on the right and a 155 m long reach with gradient of 0 04 downstream of the bridge overall the bedload sampling site has a mean gradient of 0 07 bedload transport samples were collected at five verticals across the river channel fig 4 three in the left bridge span where the river is deeper and two in the right bridge span i e at 9 21 5 34 5 46 5 and 58 5 m from the left pier this procedure enables the determination of mean bedload transport rate and provides an insight into spatial and temporal variations emmett 1981 moreover using a universal current meter model 6500 with accuracy of 0 1 mounted on the bedload sampler near bed velocity measurements were made during each bedload sampling after preliminarily tests to get a bedload sample of 100 g up to a half filled sampler bag vericat and batalla 2005 during the 2016 rainy season the target sampling time was set at 300 500 s depending on the location of verticals with a maximum time at the middle vertical for consistency the same sampling vertical locations were used for all measurements to investigate the relationship between bedload flux qb and size of sediment transported grain size distributions were determined each sample was cleaned from organic debris manually and air dried to a constant mass the dried bedload samples from each vertical were dry sieved through a stack of stainless steel sieves that were arranged on 1 phi ϕ scale from 4 to 4 phi equivalent to 16 to 0 063 in mm and the bedload mass from each sieve was weighed the ϕ size for sediments is 1 ϕ log 2 d where d is the particle diameter in mm the ϕ unit was used to calculate the grain size statistics of each sample using the method of moments or folk and ward graphical approach in gradistat program blott and pye 2001 the grain size statistics included in the gradistat are geometric mean mode sorting standard deviation skewness kurtosis d10 the diameter for which 10 of a sample s mass is finer d50 d90 d90 d10 and d90 d10 the gradistat also provides descriptions of the textural group such as moderately sorted very coarse sand and the sediment classification such as fine gravelly coarse sand etc the percentage of grains falling into each size fraction graphs of the grain size distribution and cumulative distribution of the data analysis of variance anova statistics in r package was used to determine whether there were significant differences in the grain size statistics of bedload at each vertical section 3 3 bedload transport from direct measurements a total of 297 bedload samples were taken the individual transport rate and the mean daily bedload flux were used to calculate bedload transport indicators the instant bedload transport rate qbj i in kg s 1 m 1 measured at a given sampling vertical j across the river in a given day i was computed as the ratio of the dry mass of caught bedload mi j in kg divided by the measuring period tj in seconds during which the sampler was resting on the river bottom at vertical j and the width of the intake of the sampler i e 0 0762 m kociuba 2017 rachlewicz et al 2017 2 qb j i m ij 0 0762 t j where the index i and j represent the sampling day and the sampling verticals across the river or subsection a to e in fig 4 then the average bedload transport rates in each vertical were integrated over the full river cross section rachlewicz et al 2017 i e weighted by wetted channel width of the five subsections and added up to determine the total sediment transport in a given day qb 3 qb i i j 1 n q b i j w j 86 4 where qbi is the total bedload flux in a given day mg d 1 wj the width of each vertical subsection across the river m and 86 4 is a unit conversion factor for time and mass to provide a better description of the changes that occurred in the channel sediment samples from the individual traps were analyzed independently anova was performed to determine whether investigated subsections and months have statistically significant differences in terms of bedload transport and hydrological conditions the shapiro wilk s test and levene s test were used to check for normality and the homogeneity of variance to meet the assumptions of the anova kutner et al 2005 3 4 suspended sediment measurements a total set 94 measurements of discrete suspended sediment concentration ssc using a depth integrated sampler bartram and ballance 1996 and the corresponding river discharge q were also made from june to november 2017 the ssc samples were taken with a plastic bottle mounted within a heavy iron frame at least once in each vertical when the corresponding bedload sample was collected then the samples usually 750 1000 ml were filtered using a whatman cellulose filter 42 with 2 5 µm pore diameter oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and weighed ultimately the suspended sediment rating curve based on discharge asselman 2000 was established 4 ssc i a q i b where ssc in g l 1 q in m3 s 1 whereas the empirical values a and b are determined by minimizing the sum of errors using the least square method kutner et al 2005 then the suspended sediment yield qs in mg was estimated as ssc multiplied with q and duration 5 qs i 1 n s s c i q i 86 4 where 86 4 is a unit conversion factor for time and mass and the index i as a reference for day of the year 3 5 bedload transport equations with varying degree of success more than three dozen formulae have been developed to predict bedload transport in rivers which ranges from simple regressions to complex multi parameter formulations barry et al 2007 khorram and ergil 2010 zanke 2001 among the most renowned in the literature twelve equations developed to predict bedload transport in rivers were tested against the observed data table 1 they were meyer peter and müller 1948 modified meyer peter müller wong and parker 2006 martin 2003 bagnold 1980 modified bagnold martin and church 2000 engelund and fredsoe 1976 modified engelund meng et al 2016 fernandez luque and van beek 1976 parker 1978 nielsen 1992 wilcock and crowe 2003 and yalin 1977 their parameters are median grain size d50 energy slope s flow shear stress τ critical flow shear stress τ cr flow shear velocity u water depth h discharge q and river width w the ability of the equations to predict the bedload transport rate in the study site was made on the basis of the discrepancy ratio r between the predicted qbp and measured qbm values khorram and ergil 2010 lópez et al 2014 6 r q bp q bm then the arithmetic mean 0 and range of the discrepancy ratio r were calculated lópez et al 2014 the rates of bed load transport can also be represented by a simple power function eq 7 of several hydraulic variables barry et al 2007 habersack et al 2008 yang 1984 the hydraulic variables such as flow discharge q barry et al 2007 bed shear stress τ meyer peter and müller 1948 yang 1984 and unit stream power ω bagnold 1980 habersack et al 2008 yang 1984 are commonly used to predict bedload transport rates and their capability to predict bedload discharge were tested 7 q b α p β where qb is bedload transport rate kg s 1 m 1 p is a

furthermore cross validation was conducted to examine the predictive performance of the simple power regression formulae eq 7 obtained from the field data reliable bedload regression equations are considered those statistically significant ρ 0 05 and explaining at least 60 of the variance in bedload transport erskine and saynor 2015 4 results 4 1 hydrological conditions during the measuring period both bedload qb and suspended load qs were sampled during 23 sampling days in 2017 qb was collected during the 23 days however only in 21 events qb qs and discharge were sampled completely table 2 river discharge was characterized by base flows ranging from 17 to 44 m3 s 1 with the high flows occurring later during the field campaign i e in august and september table 2 fig 5 flow width during the bedload measurements ranged from 12 5 to 68 m moreover a bankfull discharge of 480 m3 s 1 was attained when the river stage reached 5 67 m and flooding occurred from 5 to 9 september 2017 that inundated the areas around and downstream of the bridge the largest flood was measured on 7 september 2017 with a discharge of 511 m3 s 1 0 142 m3 s 1 km 2 and the lowest flow 17 m3 s 1 was recorded on 8 june 2017 the bedload transport associated with the smallest flow discharge 44 m3 s 1 is very small though still appreciable qb 9 7 g s 1 a discharge of 44 m3 s 1 can therefore be considered as the critical flow condition for bedload entrainment in the study reach such a flow corresponds to a shear stress threshold τ cr of 4 5 n m 2 and a unit stream power threshold ω cr of 16 w m 2 which is one order of magnitude higher than the critical shear stress of 0 27 n m 2 calculated by the classical shields criterion for bed material d50 0 37 mm similar results were obtained for sand bed rivers located in lowland areas e g billi et al 2017 the actual critical condition for bedload entrainment is associated with a shear velocity value u g h s 0 5 0 07 m s 1 in which h is flow depth g is gravity and s is energy gradient since u depends on shear stress the critical value for gilgel abay river is higher than the theoretical one it is common to observe that the critical flow shear velocity exceeds the critical shields stress because of the higher flow resistance in gilgel abay river reach due to the presence of roughness elements such as bridge piers the stone apron and mainly bedforms lamb et al 2008 under these conditions stream power equations based on discharge are assumed to provide more reliable results than those based on flow shear stress habersack et al 2008 4 2 measured bedload transport 4 2 1 grain size characteristics of bedload in total 297 bedload transport samples were collected and 18 yielded zero bedload transport during the 23 sampling days the number of bedload samples per sampling day varied from 4 to 21 table 2 grain size analysis of the samples using the gradistat shows that on average the bedload fractions were fine sand 13 4 medium sand 69 7 coarse sand 16 1 and gravel 0 8 the gravel particles maximum 8 mm in diameter were sampled during the high flows of august and september the main bedload grain size characteristics are dmean 0 375 mm d10 0 217 mm d50 0 368 mm d90 0 744 mm and standard deviation sorting of 0 0016 mm table 3 in line with blott and pye 2001 the bedload is composed of predominantly well sorted and medium sized sand 250 500 μm with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution fig 6 table 3 the five grain size curves corresponding to the 5 sampled verticals fig 6 also show typical unimodal distributions of medium sized sand through the full river cross section as the variable and its transformed form do not meet the anova assumptions a nonparametric inference procedure e g kruskal wallis test was used to compare the observed data among the verticals considered kutner et al 2005 the kruskal wallis test revealed that grain size is significantly finer at verticals a than at vertical e α 5 which may be associated with higher flow energy and discharge through subsection e table 3 4 2 2 spatial and temporal variability of bedload transport the rate of bedload transport qb was highly variable with a peak rate of 282 g s 1 m 1 measured at vertical e on 8 september 2017 to almost negligible 0 17 g s 1 m 1 during the measurement campaign the mean observed qb in each vertical strongly varied from 2 6 g m 1 s 1 in vertical c to above 57 g m 1 s 1 in verticals a and e fig 7 table 4 which averaged in the full cross section as 31 3 g m 1 s 1 the mean subsection s bedload flux qb representing the specific sampling location ranged from 2 8 mg d 1 in subsection c to 100 7 mg d 1 in subsection e this corresponds with a mean daily bedload flux of 225 6 mg that discharged through the full river cross section due to the hydraulic disturbance of the bridge central pier the local flow velocity is increased and very likely an important proportion of bed material may have been entrained as suspended load hence bedload transport in the thalweg was significantly low fig 7 table 4 a maximum rate of ca 426 mg d 1 in the full river cross section was recorded during the high river flows of 11th august and 8th september 2017 fig 5 table 2 the observed bedload transport rates are also significantly varied during the measuring period with a maximum qb in august and september after which qb decreases with decreasing discharge and limited amounts of sediment available for transport figs 4 and 7 during the measurement campaign of 2017 the mean daily bedload flux through the entire cross section amounted to 175 1 mg however bedload flux during the high flows and floods was ca 2 4 times higher than the mean at the study site the total bedload flux exported through the river cross section from july to november 2017 amounted to 22 185 mg however it was not possible to measure the presence of migrating bedforms and their geometry in 2017 despite the fact that the bed material is composed of sand so it was not possible to compare the bedload rates measured with the helley smith sampler with those obtained by the dune migration method kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 villard and church 2003 4 3 suspended sediment load and total load considerable variation in suspended sediment concentration ssc in individual samples from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 was observed table 2 reflecting the typical ssc ranges reported for lake tana basin lemma et al 2018 suspended sediment load qs varied between 220 028 mg d 1 for a large river discharge 488 m3 s 1 on 10 august 2017 and 247 mg d 1 for the lowest water discharge 44 m3 s 1 on 30 november 2017 the average ssc obtained for the largest observed qs was 5 25 g l 1 then the ssc values decreased varying from 4 6 to 0 07 g l 1 however the ssc was recorded higher again 3 5 4 g l 1 during the flooding events on 5 9 september 2018 the large ssc observed in the first sampling period were related to freshly ploughed croplands exposed to erosive rainfalls poor soil cover and entrainment of particles that had been loosened throughout the previous long interval of dry months cantalice et al 2013 vanmaercke et al 2010 this behaviour is consistent with previous observations lemma et al 2018 indicating that most of the suspended sediment load from the catchments was delivered at the beginning of the rainy season however high ssc during september s floods may also be associated with river bank failures upstream abate et al 2015 analysis of the grain sizes of suspended sediment in this study also revealed that verticals a and e had higher stream power to suspend a larger sand fraction fig 8 it is also worth noticing that the sand fraction in the suspended load is rather high 40 60 whereas in previous study on the blue nile in khartoum it was found to be around 30 billi and ali 2010 and in a study on a mediterranean sand bed river billi and paris 2004 found this fraction to be 10 suspended sediment rating curves were fitted to the daily averaged ssc and to all ssc samples observed in 2017 and these fits showed a coefficient of determination of 0 86 and 0 79 respectively fig 9 moreover comparison of the effect of discharge and ssc on suspended load in standardized units showed that the suspended load was influenced more by changes in ssc than discharge with a 1 standard deviation increase in ssc causing a 0 62 standard deviation increase in the suspended load whereas discharge only produced a 0 36 increase bedload qb and suspended load qs were calculated for each of the 21 sampling days for which bedload ssc and discharge data were all available table 2 suspended load dominated the overall sediment transported during all events and bedload proportion ranges from 0 1 to 5 4 average 0 7 of the total load tl 4 4 bedload prediction from equations the predictive performance of the selected equations was tested by comparing predicted qbp against measured qbm values of bedload transport rates fig 10 most equations over predict bedload transport by one to two orders of magnitude however the overall best performance was achieved by martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 equations with an average discrepancy ratio eq 6 2 4 fig 10 table 5 the worst performing equations were engelund and fredsoe parker nielsen modified engelund and yalin the reasons for that are manifold and will be analysed in the discussion section most commonly used bedload equations examined here table 5 have disconcerted performance even the best performing equations strongly overestimate the lower bedload transport rates alternatively simple power regression functions were developed to describe the relation between bedload transport and local measurements of hydraulic parameters table 6 the strength of the regression equations was relatively weak when the relationship was developed based on all measured data from the subsections however the mean daily bedload transport rate qb of chimba gauging station generally fitted well against the corresponding mean flow discharge q mean excess bed shear stress and mean excess unit stream power using least squares regression on log transformed values figs 11 and 12 table 6 all regressions were significant α 5 and each tested hydraulic parameter adequately explained the variance in bedload transport rates qb adj r2 0 81 in fig 11 table 6 the 10 fold cross validation also gave acceptable validation which was conformed by rmse less 10 of the data range and r2 0 9 roy et al 2016 particularly the power regression function between q and qb fig 12 explained 87 the variation in measured bedload flux by the mean daily river discharge table 6 in general the obtained plots and statistical indices revealed that the established relationships are satisfactory to predict bedload transport moreover the degree of linear dependence between mean daily measured and calculated bedload transport rate is very high 5 discussion 5 1 measured bedload variability the measurement of bedload transport in this study is one of the very few attempts in africa to quantify bedload flux with ca 297 observations at chimba gauging station which is located along the lower most gilgel abay river ethiopia previous studies applied direct measurements of bedload on small 1 km2 to large 3 4 106 km2 catchments and with sand and gravel beds table 7 bedload flux usually varies greatly over space and time and this is also the case in our study the analysis showed that the average bedload transport rate qb in gilgel abay river was 31 3 43 2 g s 1 m 1 ranging from negligible 0 2 g s 1 m 1 during low river flow of november 44 m3 s 1 to 282 g s 1 m 1 during high flow 480 m3 s 1 in august and september the mean observed qb in each vertical also varied from 2 6 g m 1 s 1 in vertical c to above 57 g m 1 s 1 in verticals a and e fig 7 table 4 from the field observations it has become clear that the presence of central bridge pier could change the water flow pattern and thus sediment dynamics due to friction and counteraction of flow imposed by nose and walls of the pier as a result bedload flux was limited in the middle river subsection and increase towards the river banks in the absence of flow obstacles such as bridge pier and bar in a river measured bedload flux in natural rivers is maximum at the thalweg or in the central part of the channel and decreases towards the river banks e g billi et al 2017 habersack et al 2008 kociuba 2017 in contrast the spatial variability observed at the measuring sections was greatly influenced by the presence of the central bridge pier the flow contraction due to the presence of the pier causes an increase in flow velocity local shear stress and the formation of a horseshow vortex during high flows the vortex produces a typical scour hole upstream and on both sides of the pier here excess shear stress of downward helicoidal flows erodes streambed sediments and push these up bringing them in suspension thus overpassing the helley smith sampler moreover the central bridge pier caused the flow to be deflected away from its original direction and accelerated the flow away from the pier ghobadian et al 2018 shrestha 2015 the downstream water level and associated energy also drops due to the rapid transition between lower to upper flow regime whereas the flow expansion of the river as it passes the bridge may also lead to a lateral deflection of the sediment in transit yarnell 1934 all these onsite situations may account for subsections a and e having the highest bedload fluxes maximum bedload transport rates of 249 and 282 g s 1 m 1 were measured at vertical e during the highest river discharges of 11 august 2017 and 8 september 2017 respectively the higher bedload transport rates during higher flow discharges indicates the need for the sediment sampling at peak flow stage horowitz 2003 the mean rate of bedload transport in this study 31 3 g s 1 m 1 is within the range of values reported for rivers congo okavango and mfolozi table 7 which might be due to having a similar slope gradient and grain size grenfell and ellery 2009 mccarthy et al 1991 spronck 1941 and for a few italian rivers of comparable catchment area the bedload transport rate of which ranges between 0 9 and 170 g m 1 s 1 billi and paris 2004 billi et al 2017 preciso et al 2012 while it is significantly less than the bedload transport rate of rivers in mountainous catchments e g kulfo and kwilu girma 2005 savat 1973 however the bedload transport rate in nile river at the immediate downstream of the high aswan dam at aswan and quena is smaller than the value obtained in this study due to the trapping effect of the reservoir abdel fattah et al 2004 during the floods of august and september the entire river bed of lower gilgel abay contributes a mean daily bedload flux exceeding 425 mg d 1 whereas bedload transport is concentrated around the central verticals during the small discharges of october and november fig 7 similarly the grain size showed significant variation throughout the measuring period which was reflected by the observed d50 variation from 375 μm during high flow to 102 μm in low flow months 5 2 bedload suspended load and total load the extent of bedload qb and suspended load qs transported by a river significantly varies depending on the transporting power the quality and quantity of sediment supply i e the catchment characteristics from which the sediment originates and is greatly modified by anthropogenic activity babiński 2005 with ssc ranging from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 suspended load dominates the total sediment load tl of gilgel abay river at the study gauging station by contrast the ratio of bedload to tl was in the range between 0 1 and 5 4 with an average value of 0 7 these values are within the ranges of bedload percentage in tl reported for rivers in the equatorial regions of africa e g billi 2011 girma 2005 karambiri and ribolzi 2003 spronck 1941 rivers such as the nile downstream of aswan dam okavango and mayo tsanaga delivered a higher proportion of bedload 20 55 of tl whereas the blue nile at khartoum gereb oda katchari congo and gilgel abay carried the smallest bedload fraction i e 6 of tl table 7 the bedload percentage exceeding 20 of the tl table 7 is commonly found in steep and coarse rivers with a high sediment supply from the headwaters where weathering and erosion processes are more intense or in rivers and headwaters that are affected by a high degree of anthropogenic disturbances abdel fattah et al 2004 mccarthy et al 1991 olivry and hoorelbecke 1975 bedload fraction could also be as high as 54 of the tl in proglacial streams which are generally characterized by high flow velocities and transport capacity high sediment concentrations and intense bedload rates bogen et al 2015 mao et al 2019 rainato et al 2017 usually the tl in lower gradient reaches and ephemeral streams worldwide is also dominated by suspended load and the bedload accounts for only a small 1 fraction of the tl babiński 2005 billi 2011 groten et al 2016 yasi and hamzepouri 2008 for instance the magnitude of bedload in the lower most reaches near the river mouth and alluvial rivers represents 0 1 0 3 in the yellow river 1 6 in amu darya 0 7 2 4 in yangtze 1 2 4 in mississippi 1 in amazon and 1 2 in nile during the pre aswan high dam babiński 2005 filizola et al 2011 joshi and xu 2017 knox and latrubesse 2016 woodward et al 2008 because stream power decreases with distance downstream lecce 1997 furthermore the relatively high rates of both bed and suspended load are reflected by the fast growth pattern of gilgel abay delta a study by poppe et al 2013 and landsat image analysis of the 1985s and 2015s showed that the gilgel abay river delta was growing rapidly in the last 15 40 years fig 3 in general the suspended load inputs have low settling velocities caldwell and edmonds 2014 leading to long advection lengths and fine grains that are transported far into the water body while the combination of low wave activity and increased critical flow shear stress for very fine grained sediments stabilizes channels burpee et al 2015 caldwell and edmonds 2014 similar to the mississippi delta development caldwell and edmonds 2014 the suspended load dominated sediment dynamics in lower gilgel abay river also creates a delta with elongated planform and few stable channel mouths dominated by levee growth analysis of the grain sizes of suspended sediment in this study and sediment coring of the upper most 10 m deposited sediment near to lakeshores and in the middle of lake tana by lamb et al 2007 showed uniformly composed sediments with a median size of 13 63 μm 5 3 bedload prediction using equations and uncertainties when bedload data availability is sparse and its measurement remains an obstacle to understand sediment transport it is common to estimate bedload by applying reliable sediment transport equations erskine and saynor 2015 heimann et al 2015 out of the twelve equations tested in this study the empirical equations of martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 performed well with an overall discrepancy ratio r of 0 3 to 2 4 similar to findings of billi et al 2017 the largest discrepancies between qbm and qbp are associated with the lowest bedload transport rates the performance improved for higher bedload rates due to the fact that high flows are better captured by transport capacity equations comiti and mao 2012 this result also confirms that even the best performing equations failed to capture the relatively gradual decline in measured bedload transport rates moreover the percentage of the overall data having a discrepancy ratio r between 0 05 and 20 is 100 for both equations fig 10 also the percentage of the overall data having a discrepancy ratio between 0 5 and 2 is ca 71 for the martin 2003 and 61 for the modified bagnold martin and church 2000 equations respectively however the remaining equations are found to overpredict bedload transport rate by at least one order of magnitude for the study reach it is however worth noticing that the engelund equation was obtained to predict both bedload and bed material suspended load i e that proportion of sediments that contributes with wash load to suspended load so some overprediction is intrinsic in this equation meyer peter and muller and parker equations were derived for gravel bed rivers and those of fernandez luque and van beek wilcock and crowe and yalin were derived for mixtures of fine gravel and sand gomez and church 1989 all these equations consider the transport of gravel or fine gravel which implies larger flow shear stress values additionally most of them were derived from flume experiments in which important factors such as the variability of sediment supply in natural rivers and the occurrence of macroroughness whereby effective shear stress is lower than the total one are not considered hence their inability to predict the bedload of a sand bed driver is not surprising emmett 1979 nielsen equation was designed to predict the sand transport of longshore currents i e in a different hydraulic environment although the basic principles of drag and entrainment are the same as in rivers the ratio between sediment supply and flow energy may be very different the empirical equation of martin was obtained by plotting unit stream power versus bedload transport data of a world wide data set reported in the paper of gomez and church 1989 though martins s equation is empirical its calibration with real data and the use of unit stream power seem to be the main reasons for its good performance in their study on the assessment of several bedload transport formulae gomez and church 1989 were the first to demonstrate the reliability of stream power based equations and to point out the good performance of the bagnold formula best prediction performances could also be achieved by simple empirical bedload transport relations that are accounting for other hydraulic variables such as flow discharge slope and grain size nitsche et al 2011 recking 2010 rickenmann 2001 this study confirms that best predictions were given by equations that relate the bedload transport rate with unit stream power and adjusted for flow depth and grain size accordingly simple power regression functions were also established to describe the relations between bedload transport versus river discharge excess unit stream power and excess shear stress figs 11 and 12 application of these variables to predict bedload transport by means of power functions provided satisfactory agreement r2 0 82 α 0 05 with the measured data sets table 6 and the best predictions compared to the other equations considered in this study similar studies also revealed that hydraulic parameters used in regression models play important roles to formulate suitable bedload transport equations e g barry et al 2007 billi 2011 girma 2005 habersack et al 2008 kociuba 2017 6 conclusions this study analysed bedload and suspended load transport in five verticals along the channel cross section of the lower course of the gilgel abay river the analysis of these two components during the measuring campaign revealed considerable variations in bedload transport among the measuring verticals and months the measured values 0 11 to 282 g s 1 m 1 average 31 3 g s 1 m 1 is within the ranges reported for most african rivers mean daily bedload transport rate and flux were used for comparison of the temporal variation and for the evaluation of the performance of different bedload equations mean daily measured bedload varied from 0 7 to 427 5 mg d 1 which corresponds to a mean bedload flux of 225 6 mg d 1 as bedload flux generally increased with flow discharge the highest measured mean daily bedload transport rates occurred at the highest mean river discharges 483 m3 s 1 during the months of august and september similarly the suspended sediment concentration ssc also ranges from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 and the peak ssc was observed at the beginning of the sampling period early august due to availability of sediments originating from freshly ploughed croplands with limited soil cover and high runoff discharges for transporting these sediments despite the higher ssc occurring during higher river discharges r2 0 86 the suspended load was influenced more by changes in ssc than by discharge confirming the important role of sediment supply variability in determining the ssc of a river the observed area specific bedload and suspended load are also 0 6 and 22 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively like many rivers in the tropics total sediment load tl in lower gilgel abay river is dominated by the suspended load with a bedload to tl ratio of 0 1 to 5 4 besides the small values of the bedload to tl ratio the elongated planform of gilgel abay delta with few channels could be an indicator that suspended sediment is dominating the sediment dynamics in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the small tana lake waves among the bedload prediction equations tested martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 provided bedload predictions closest to the observations with an acceptable range of error on the other hand equations that relate bedload transport with hydraulic variables for lower gilgel abay river have been established as an alternative application of these variables particularly river discharge and unit stream power to predict bedload transport rates using power functions provide satisfactory agreement with the measured data sets finally this study provides plausible estimates of bedload flux that are within predicted ranges reported for alluvial rivers in african and other tropical regions i e 1 to 10 of total load moreover the bedload regression equation based on flow discharge and the best performer equations of martin and modified bagnold tested herein could be representative for natural rivers found in low lying geographic area and similar hydraulic and sediment conditions

6232,little is known about the contribution of bedload flux to the total sediment load exported from tropical sand bed rivers yet predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management more appropriate river engineering works design accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management therefore bedload suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower gilgel abay river in the blue nile catchment of ethiopia catchment area is 3887 km2 average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 164 m3 s 1 and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0 0007 m m 1 a standard helley smith u s bl 84 cable suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season the bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted medium sized sand 250 500 µm with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution the mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0 7 to 427 5 mg d 1 with an average rate of 175 1 mg d 1 field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier the average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220 028 mg d 1 and dominates the total sediment yield 94 6 the bedload accounts for only 0 1 to 5 4 of the total sediment load the area specific bedload and suspended load are also 0 6 and 22 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively the elongated planform growth of the gilgel abay river delta in lake tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine suspended load in the sediment transport of this river in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of tana lake among the tested bedload prediction criteria the stream power based equations of martin and modified bagnold performed better yet the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data adj r2 0 82 0 87 finally this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand bed rivers in africa and other tropical regions keywords sand bed river sediment transport us bl 84 sampler bedload to total load ratio lake tana basin 1 introduction sediment yield is the mass of total sediment load tl that leaves a catchment per unit area and time and comprises bedload and suspended load whereas bedload is the coarsest part of the fluvial sediment that moves in sliding rolling or jumping modes along the river bed suspended load is carried in suspension in the water column emmett 1981 gomez 1991 depending on grain size of the sediment and energy of the flowing water solid material may interchange between bedload and suspended load components on its journey through a river system church 2006 usually the bedload component is ignored due to measurement constraints e g delmas et al 2012 vanmaercke et al 2014 or estimated as a fixed fraction of the tl e g powell et al 1996 turowski et al 2010 ziegler et al 2014 as a result the bedload data from rivers worldwide are extremely scarce erskine and saynor 2015 the average global measured bedload fluxes typically account for 15 of tl alexandrov et al 2009 babiński 2005 claude et al 2012 delmas et al 2012 emmett 1981 girma 2005 karambiri and ribolzi 2003 turowski et al 2010 and may reach up to 50 in small catchments with debris rich slopes and in river channels of mountainous areas located in the temperate zone babiński 2005 mccarthy et al 1991 powell et al 1996 turowski et al 2010 bedload also constitutes ca 7 of the tl for sand bed rivers in tropical environments babiński 2005 erskine and saynor 2015 although measurements of sediment transport in africa started in the nineteenth century relatively little is known about the total sediment load tl and many uncertainties still exist vanmaercke et al 2014 walling 1984 despite its size and topographic variability sediment yield sy data in africa are few observed mainly from large rivers and poorly represent small catchments vanmaercke et al 2014 particularly studies indicated that bedload in african rivers constitutes 6 of tl in ephemeral streams and rivers dominated by suspended load e g billi

disturbance and aeolian inputs mccarthy et al 1991 and mountainous catchments in the sahel olivry and hoorelbecke 1975 moreover sediment yield measurements from gauging stations generally do not include bedload and therefore underestimate the true sy vanmaercke et al 2014 except two case studies that showed a bedload to tl ratio of 1 14 in semi arid and hilly catchments billi 2011 girma 2005 the magnitude of bedload is currently unknown for most ethiopian river similarly to most rivers worldwide nyssen et al 2004 vanmaercke et al 2014 sediment transport data are crucial in any river engineering work design and its quantification is gaining prominent importance with increasing utilization of water resources erskine and saynor 2015 field measurements of bedload flux require reliable equipment and measuring techniques whereas bedload prediction by means of transport capacity equation is not yet sufficiently accurate especially in supply limited systems where sediment supply variations can largely dictate bedload rates blanckaert et al 2017 comiti and mao 2012 gomez 1991 commonly bedload transport rates are measured in the field by portable samplers or sediment traps e g billi 2011 billi et al 2017 blanckaert et al 2017 emmett 1981 or are estimated by applying an appropriate sediment transport equation e g billi and ali 2010 heimann et al 2015 kuhnle et al 2014 recently in order to understand this complex process there has been a trend towards the direct measurement of bedload in small to large sand bed rivers by means of portable pressure differential samplers throughout the world erskine and saynor 2015 kociuba 2017 rachlewicz et al 2017 whereas the portable traps developed by bunte et al 2004 have performed more accurately in small mountain coarse grained gravel bed rivers with very low flow depths ca 0 39 m flow velocities 1 0 1 5 m s 1 and discharge 4 0 5 7 m3 s 1 bunte at al traps therefore are not suitable for permanent rivers in which flow depth does not allow their direct installation on the streambed the portable pressure differential samplers are preferred by operators for several reasons i e ease of use portable fit easily into the channel bed and are less disruptive for river flow the most used bedload sampler the helley smith has its best efficiency in sandy and mixed fine gravel sand bed rivers this sampler therefore is the best option for bedload measurement in small to medium size lowland sand bed rivers with relatively small flow depth and stream power very high flow velocities and depth in fact tend to drag the sampler on the streambed thus leading to overestimate of the actual bedload emmett 1979 on the other hand estimating bedload transport rates from simple hydrological measurements would greatly benefit various sediment related river management practices gao 2011 this study focuses on the little studied sand bed rivers in africa which could also be advantageous to identify the roles of measured suspended sediment yield and bedload in sediment budgeting in the region we aim i to quantify bedload fluxes in the lower reach of gilgel abay river ii to assess the relative significance of bedload and suspended load iii to establish statistically significant and meaningful empirical relationships between daily bedload flux and hydraulic variables and iv to evaluate the performance of some of the most widely applied bedload formulas against field data 2 gilgel abay catchment gilgel abay meaning the little nile river is located in lake tana basin and enters ethiopia s largest lake 60 80 km diameter from the south fig 1 the catchment drains 3887 km2 and its elevation ranges from 1786 to 3531 m a s l the river is equipped with two flow gauges i e bikolo station at the hilly part and chimba station located nearly at the start of kunzla floodplains i e ca 16 km from the mouth dessie et al 2014 lemma et al 2018 the average slope gradient of the catchment is 8 3 range 0 72 and the channel bed gradient at chimba bridge is 1 7 along the 250 m long natural reach upstream of the chimba gauging site geologically the catchment is dominated by quaternary basalts williams 2016 the climate is characterized as highland tropical monsoon and shows distinct wet and dry seasons where the wet season usually runs from june to september and accounts for 70 90 of annual rainfall fetene et al 2018 the average annual rainfall varies between 1200 mm and 2400 mm 1999 2016 in addition to natural erosion processes sediment is supplied to the stream channels mainly due to deforestation land use intensification and subsequent accelerated land degradation hurni et al 2005 intense rainfall erodible soils steep slopes along most of the channel length severe gullying bank erosion and channel incision abate et al 2015 provide persistent and high sediment supply to the channel addis and klik 2015 tilahun et al 2016 and subsequently increased sedimentation further downstream and rapid delta growth poppe et al 2013 as a result gilgel abay river delta shows considerable change particularly during the last three decades fig 2 in response to high anthropogenic induced soil erosion rates in the catchment poppe et al 2013 3 methods 3 1 river discharge measurements the flow discharge measurements were made at chimba gauging station located 155 m downstream of the chimba bridge figs 1 3 the water stage data was recorded automatically by a pressure transducer type diver at 10 min interval and manually by staff gauge on a daily basis a stage discharge relation determined by dessie et al 2014 was used to convert the stage data to flow discharge data the river profile and cross section at the bridge were also monitored using a total station fig 4 at the monitoring site mean annual discharge is 115 m3 s 1 streambed width is ca 71 m at bankfull discharge and bed material is predominantly sandy d50 0 61 mm there is stone riprap ca 32 cm in size near left bridge span 3 2 bedload measurements bedload measurements were conducted at chimba bridge for a total of 23 days within the period of 13 july to 30 november 2017 for river discharges ranging from low flows 44 m3 s 1 to the peak discharges of a 2 year flood 511 m3 s 1 bedload was measured by a standard helley smith u s bl 84 cable suspended sampler the 29 5 kg sampler has a 7 62 cm square intake and an area expansion ratio of 1 4 edwards and glysson 1999 the sampling bag has a length of 46 cm surface area of 1903 cm2 and consists of 0 25 mm mesh polyester it is attached to the rear of the mouth with a rubber o ring edwards and glysson 1999 emmett 1981 the bedload sampler was lowered from the bridge deck into the river using a small locally made crane fig 3b all the bedload measurements were made standing on the downstream side of chimba bridge fig 3a and b the bridge consists of two rectangular spans 37 5 m wide each however the maximum effective channel width through which bedload flux occurs is 71 m initially we tried to divide the width at full bank into five equally spaced subsections but the third sampling vertical would then be in front of the central bridge pier hence we delimited five verticals that are approximately equally spaced of which 3 verticals on the left span deeper section and 2 verticals on the right span we also tried to avoid side sloped areas so as to position the sampler on flat area the energy slope of the water surface along the 370 m long reach was determined by marking the water surface elevation on both sides of the river bank and then taking the readings by total station at the upstream side the river reach is separated by an islet located 75 m upstream of the bridge fig 3c i e there is a 190 m straight reach with an energy gradient of 0 12 on the left a 215 m long reach with gradient of 0 06 on the right and a 155 m long reach with gradient of 0 04 downstream of the bridge overall the bedload sampling site has a mean gradient of 0 07 bedload transport samples were collected at five verticals across the river channel fig 4 three in the left bridge span where the river is deeper and two in the right bridge span i e at 9 21 5 34 5 46 5 and 58 5 m from the left pier this procedure enables the determination of mean bedload transport rate and provides an insight into spatial and temporal variations emmett 1981 moreover using a universal current meter model 6500 with accuracy of 0 1 mounted on the bedload sampler near bed velocity measurements were made during each bedload sampling after preliminarily tests to get a bedload sample of 100 g up to a half filled sampler bag vericat and batalla 2005 during the 2016 rainy season the target sampling time was set at 300 500 s depending on the location of verticals with a maximum time at the middle vertical for consistency the same sampling vertical locations were used for all measurements to investigate the relationship between bedload flux qb and size of sediment transported grain size distributions were determined each sample was cleaned from organic debris manually and air dried to a constant mass the dried bedload samples from each vertical were dry sieved through a stack of stainless steel sieves that were arranged on 1 phi ϕ scale from 4 to 4 phi equivalent to 16 to 0 063 in mm and the bedload mass from each sieve was weighed the ϕ size for sediments is 1 ϕ log 2 d where d is the particle diameter in mm the ϕ unit was used to calculate the grain size statistics of each sample using the method of moments or folk and ward graphical approach in gradistat program blott and pye 2001 the grain size statistics included in the gradistat are geometric mean mode sorting standard deviation skewness kurtosis d10 the diameter for which 10 of a sample s mass is finer d50 d90 d90 d10 and d90 d10 the gradistat also provides descriptions of the textural group such as moderately sorted very coarse sand and the sediment classification such as fine gravelly coarse sand etc the percentage of grains falling into each size fraction graphs of the grain size distribution and cumulative distribution of the data analysis of variance anova statistics in r package was used to determine whether there were significant differences in the grain size statistics of bedload at each vertical section 3 3 bedload transport from direct measurements a total of 297 bedload samples were taken the individual transport rate and the mean daily bedload flux were used to calculate bedload transport indicators the instant bedload transport rate qbj i in kg s 1 m 1 measured at a given sampling vertical j across the river in a given day i was computed as the ratio of the dry mass of caught bedload mi j in kg divided by the measuring period tj in seconds during which the sampler was resting on the river bottom at vertical j and the width of the intake of the sampler i e 0 0762 m kociuba 2017 rachlewicz et al 2017 2 qb j i m ij 0 0762 t j where the index i and j represent the sampling day and the sampling verticals across the river or subsection a to e in fig 4 then the average bedload transport rates in each vertical were integrated over the full river cross section rachlewicz et al 2017 i e weighted by wetted channel width of the five subsections and added up to determine the total sediment transport in a given day qb 3 qb i i j 1 n q b i j w j 86 4 where qbi is the total bedload flux in a given day mg d 1 wj the width of each vertical subsection across the river m and 86 4 is a unit conversion factor for time and mass to provide a better description of the changes that occurred in the channel sediment samples from the individual traps were analyzed independently anova was performed to determine whether investigated subsections and months have statistically significant differences in terms of bedload transport and hydrological conditions the shapiro wilk s test and levene s test were used to check for normality and the homogeneity of variance to meet the assumptions of the anova kutner et al 2005 3 4 suspended sediment measurements a total set 94 measurements of discrete suspended sediment concentration ssc using a depth integrated sampler bartram and ballance 1996 and the corresponding river discharge q were also made from june to november 2017 the ssc samples were taken with a plastic bottle mounted within a heavy iron frame at least once in each vertical when the corresponding bedload sample was collected then the samples usually 750 1000 ml were filtered using a whatman cellulose filter 42 with 2 5 µm pore diameter oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and weighed ultimately the suspended sediment rating curve based on discharge asselman 2000 was established 4 ssc i a q i b where ssc in g l 1 q in m3 s 1 whereas the empirical values a and b are determined by minimizing the sum of errors using the least square method kutner et al 2005 then the suspended sediment yield qs in mg was estimated as ssc multiplied with q and duration 5 qs i 1 n s s c i q i 86 4 where 86 4 is a unit conversion factor for time and mass and the index i as a reference for day of the year 3 5 bedload transport equations with varying degree of success more than three dozen formulae have been developed to predict bedload transport in rivers which ranges from simple regressions to complex multi parameter formulations barry et al 2007 khorram and ergil 2010 zanke 2001 among the most renowned in the literature twelve equations developed to predict bedload transport in rivers were tested against the observed data table 1 they were meyer peter and müller 1948 modified meyer peter müller wong and parker 2006 martin 2003 bagnold 1980 modified bagnold martin and church 2000 engelund and fredsoe 1976 modified engelund meng et al 2016 fernandez luque and van beek 1976 parker 1978 nielsen 1992 wilcock and crowe 2003 and yalin 1977 their parameters are median grain size d50 energy slope s flow shear stress τ critical flow shear stress τ cr flow shear velocity u water depth h discharge q and river width w the ability of the equations to predict the bedload transport rate in the study site was made on the basis of the discrepancy ratio r between the predicted qbp and measured qbm values khorram and ergil 2010 lópez et al 2014 6 r q bp q bm then the arithmetic mean 0 and range of the discrepancy ratio r were calculated lópez et al 2014 the rates of bed load transport can also be represented by a simple power function eq 7 of several hydraulic variables barry et al 2007 habersack et al 2008 yang 1984 the hydraulic variables such as flow discharge q barry et al 2007 bed shear stress τ meyer peter and müller 1948 yang 1984 and unit stream power ω bagnold 1980 habersack et al 2008 yang 1984 are commonly used to predict bedload transport rates and their capability to predict bedload discharge were tested 7 q b α p β where qb is bedload transport rate kg s 1 m 1 p is a

furthermore cross validation was conducted to examine the predictive performance of the simple power regression formulae eq 7 obtained from the field data reliable bedload regression equations are considered those statistically significant ρ 0 05 and explaining at least 60 of the variance in bedload transport erskine and saynor 2015 4 results 4 1 hydrological conditions during the measuring period both bedload qb and suspended load qs were sampled during 23 sampling days in 2017 qb was collected during the 23 days however only in 21 events qb qs and discharge were sampled completely table 2 river discharge was characterized by base flows ranging from 17 to 44 m3 s 1 with the high flows occurring later during the field campaign i e in august and september table 2 fig 5 flow width during the bedload measurements ranged from 12 5 to 68 m moreover a bankfull discharge of 480 m3 s 1 was attained when the river stage reached 5 67 m and flooding occurred from 5 to 9 september 2017 that inundated the areas around and downstream of the bridge the largest flood was measured on 7 september 2017 with a discharge of 511 m3 s 1 0 142 m3 s 1 km 2 and the lowest flow 17 m3 s 1 was recorded on 8 june 2017 the bedload transport associated with the smallest flow discharge 44 m3 s 1 is very small though still appreciable qb 9 7 g s 1 a discharge of 44 m3 s 1 can therefore be considered as the critical flow condition for bedload entrainment in the study reach such a flow corresponds to a shear stress threshold τ cr of 4 5 n m 2 and a unit stream power threshold ω cr of 16 w m 2 which is one order of magnitude higher than the critical shear stress of 0 27 n m 2 calculated by the classical shields criterion for bed material d50 0 37 mm similar results were obtained for sand bed rivers located in lowland areas e g billi et al 2017 the actual critical condition for bedload entrainment is associated with a shear velocity value u g h s 0 5 0 07 m s 1 in which h is flow depth g is gravity and s is energy gradient since u depends on shear stress the critical value for gilgel abay river is higher than the theoretical one it is common to observe that the critical flow shear velocity exceeds the critical shields stress because of the higher flow resistance in gilgel abay river reach due to the presence of roughness elements such as bridge piers the stone apron and mainly bedforms lamb et al 2008 under these conditions stream power equations based on discharge are assumed to provide more reliable results than those based on flow shear stress habersack et al 2008 4 2 measured bedload transport 4 2 1 grain size characteristics of bedload in total 297 bedload transport samples were collected and 18 yielded zero bedload transport during the 23 sampling days the number of bedload samples per sampling day varied from 4 to 21 table 2 grain size analysis of the samples using the gradistat shows that on average the bedload fractions were fine sand 13 4 medium sand 69 7 coarse sand 16 1 and gravel 0 8 the gravel particles maximum 8 mm in diameter were sampled during the high flows of august and september the main bedload grain size characteristics are dmean 0 375 mm d10 0 217 mm d50 0 368 mm d90 0 744 mm and standard deviation sorting of 0 0016 mm table 3 in line with blott and pye 2001 the bedload is composed of predominantly well sorted and medium sized sand 250 500 μm with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution fig 6 table 3 the five grain size curves corresponding to the 5 sampled verticals fig 6 also show typical unimodal distributions of medium sized sand through the full river cross section as the variable and its transformed form do not meet the anova assumptions a nonparametric inference procedure e g kruskal wallis test was used to compare the observed data among the verticals considered kutner et al 2005 the kruskal wallis test revealed that grain size is significantly finer at verticals a than at vertical e α 5 which may be associated with higher flow energy and discharge through subsection e table 3 4 2 2 spatial and temporal variability of bedload transport the rate of bedload transport qb was highly variable with a peak rate of 282 g s 1 m 1 measured at vertical e on 8 september 2017 to almost negligible 0 17 g s 1 m 1 during the measurement campaign the mean observed qb in each vertical strongly varied from 2 6 g m 1 s 1 in vertical c to above 57 g m 1 s 1 in verticals a and e fig 7 table 4 which averaged in the full cross section as 31 3 g m 1 s 1 the mean subsection s bedload flux qb representing the specific sampling location ranged from 2 8 mg d 1 in subsection c to 100 7 mg d 1 in subsection e this corresponds with a mean daily bedload flux of 225 6 mg that discharged through the full river cross section due to the hydraulic disturbance of the bridge central pier the local flow velocity is increased and very likely an important proportion of bed material may have been entrained as suspended load hence bedload transport in the thalweg was significantly low fig 7 table 4 a maximum rate of ca 426 mg d 1 in the full river cross section was recorded during the high river flows of 11th august and 8th september 2017 fig 5 table 2 the observed bedload transport rates are also significantly varied during the measuring period with a maximum qb in august and september after which qb decreases with decreasing discharge and limited amounts of sediment available for transport figs 4 and 7 during the measurement campaign of 2017 the mean daily bedload flux through the entire cross section amounted to 175 1 mg however bedload flux during the high flows and floods was ca 2 4 times higher than the mean at the study site the total bedload flux exported through the river cross section from july to november 2017 amounted to 22 185 mg however it was not possible to measure the presence of migrating bedforms and their geometry in 2017 despite the fact that the bed material is composed of sand so it was not possible to compare the bedload rates measured with the helley smith sampler with those obtained by the dune migration method kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 villard and church 2003 4 3 suspended sediment load and total load considerable variation in suspended sediment concentration ssc in individual samples from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 was observed table 2 reflecting the typical ssc ranges reported for lake tana basin lemma et al 2018 suspended sediment load qs varied between 220 028 mg d 1 for a large river discharge 488 m3 s 1 on 10 august 2017 and 247 mg d 1 for the lowest water discharge 44 m3 s 1 on 30 november 2017 the average ssc obtained for the largest observed qs was 5 25 g l 1 then the ssc values decreased varying from 4 6 to 0 07 g l 1 however the ssc was recorded higher again 3 5 4 g l 1 during the flooding events on 5 9 september 2018 the large ssc observed in the first sampling period were related to freshly ploughed croplands exposed to erosive rainfalls poor soil cover and entrainment of particles that had been loosened throughout the previous long interval of dry months cantalice et al 2013 vanmaercke et al 2010 this behaviour is consistent with previous observations lemma et al 2018 indicating that most of the suspended sediment load from the catchments was delivered at the beginning of the rainy season however high ssc during september s floods may also be associated with river bank failures upstream abate et al 2015 analysis of the grain sizes of suspended sediment in this study also revealed that verticals a and e had higher stream power to suspend a larger sand fraction fig 8 it is also worth noticing that the sand fraction in the suspended load is rather high 40 60 whereas in previous study on the blue nile in khartoum it was found to be around 30 billi and ali 2010 and in a study on a mediterranean sand bed river billi and paris 2004 found this fraction to be 10 suspended sediment rating curves were fitted to the daily averaged ssc and to all ssc samples observed in 2017 and these fits showed a coefficient of determination of 0 86 and 0 79 respectively fig 9 moreover comparison of the effect of discharge and ssc on suspended load in standardized units showed that the suspended load was influenced more by changes in ssc than discharge with a 1 standard deviation increase in ssc causing a 0 62 standard deviation increase in the suspended load whereas discharge only produced a 0 36 increase bedload qb and suspended load qs were calculated for each of the 21 sampling days for which bedload ssc and discharge data were all available table 2 suspended load dominated the overall sediment transported during all events and bedload proportion ranges from 0 1 to 5 4 average 0 7 of the total load tl 4 4 bedload prediction from equations the predictive performance of the selected equations was tested by comparing predicted qbp against measured qbm values of bedload transport rates fig 10 most equations over predict bedload transport by one to two orders of magnitude however the overall best performance was achieved by martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 equations with an average discrepancy ratio eq 6 2 4 fig 10 table 5 the worst performing equations were engelund and fredsoe parker nielsen modified engelund and yalin the reasons for that are manifold and will be analysed in the discussion section most commonly used bedload equations examined here table 5 have disconcerted performance even the best performing equations strongly overestimate the lower bedload transport rates alternatively simple power regression functions were developed to describe the relation between bedload transport and local measurements of hydraulic parameters table 6 the strength of the regression equations was relatively weak when the relationship was developed based on all measured data from the subsections however the mean daily bedload transport rate qb of chimba gauging station generally fitted well against the corresponding mean flow discharge q mean excess bed shear stress and mean excess unit stream power using least squares regression on log transformed values figs 11 and 12 table 6 all regressions were significant α 5 and each tested hydraulic parameter adequately explained the variance in bedload transport rates qb adj r2 0 81 in fig 11 table 6 the 10 fold cross validation also gave acceptable validation which was conformed by rmse less 10 of the data range and r2 0 9 roy et al 2016 particularly the power regression function between q and qb fig 12 explained 87 the variation in measured bedload flux by the mean daily river discharge table 6 in general the obtained plots and statistical indices revealed that the established relationships are satisfactory to predict bedload transport moreover the degree of linear dependence between mean daily measured and calculated bedload transport rate is very high 5 discussion 5 1 measured bedload variability the measurement of bedload transport in this study is one of the very few attempts in africa to quantify bedload flux with ca 297 observations at chimba gauging station which is located along the lower most gilgel abay river ethiopia previous studies applied direct measurements of bedload on small 1 km2 to large 3 4 106 km2 catchments and with sand and gravel beds table 7 bedload flux usually varies greatly over space and time and this is also the case in our study the analysis showed that the average bedload transport rate qb in gilgel abay river was 31 3 43 2 g s 1 m 1 ranging from negligible 0 2 g s 1 m 1 during low river flow of november 44 m3 s 1 to 282 g s 1 m 1 during high flow 480 m3 s 1 in august and september the mean observed qb in each vertical also varied from 2 6 g m 1 s 1 in vertical c to above 57 g m 1 s 1 in verticals a and e fig 7 table 4 from the field observations it has become clear that the presence of central bridge pier could change the water flow pattern and thus sediment dynamics due to friction and counteraction of flow imposed by nose and walls of the pier as a result bedload flux was limited in the middle river subsection and increase towards the river banks in the absence of flow obstacles such as bridge pier and bar in a river measured bedload flux in natural rivers is maximum at the thalweg or in the central part of the channel and decreases towards the river banks e g billi et al 2017 habersack et al 2008 kociuba 2017 in contrast the spatial variability observed at the measuring sections was greatly influenced by the presence of the central bridge pier the flow contraction due to the presence of the pier causes an increase in flow velocity local shear stress and the formation of a horseshow vortex during high flows the vortex produces a typical scour hole upstream and on both sides of the pier here excess shear stress of downward helicoidal flows erodes streambed sediments and push these up bringing them in suspension thus overpassing the helley smith sampler moreover the central bridge pier caused the flow to be deflected away from its original direction and accelerated the flow away from the pier ghobadian et al 2018 shrestha 2015 the downstream water level and associated energy also drops due to the rapid transition between lower to upper flow regime whereas the flow expansion of the river as it passes the bridge may also lead to a lateral deflection of the sediment in transit yarnell 1934 all these onsite situations may account for subsections a and e having the highest bedload fluxes maximum bedload transport rates of 249 and 282 g s 1 m 1 were measured at vertical e during the highest river discharges of 11 august 2017 and 8 september 2017 respectively the higher bedload transport rates during higher flow discharges indicates the need for the sediment sampling at peak flow stage horowitz 2003 the mean rate of bedload transport in this study 31 3 g s 1 m 1 is within the range of values reported for rivers congo okavango and mfolozi table 7 which might be due to having a similar slope gradient and grain size grenfell and ellery 2009 mccarthy et al 1991 spronck 1941 and for a few italian rivers of comparable catchment area the bedload transport rate of which ranges between 0 9 and 170 g m 1 s 1 billi and paris 2004 billi et al 2017 preciso et al 2012 while it is significantly less than the bedload transport rate of rivers in mountainous catchments e g kulfo and kwilu girma 2005 savat 1973 however the bedload transport rate in nile river at the immediate downstream of the high aswan dam at aswan and quena is smaller than the value obtained in this study due to the trapping effect of the reservoir abdel fattah et al 2004 during the floods of august and september the entire river bed of lower gilgel abay contributes a mean daily bedload flux exceeding 425 mg d 1 whereas bedload transport is concentrated around the central verticals during the small discharges of october and november fig 7 similarly the grain size showed significant variation throughout the measuring period which was reflected by the observed d50 variation from 375 μm during high flow to 102 μm in low flow months 5 2 bedload suspended load and total load the extent of bedload qb and suspended load qs transported by a river significantly varies depending on the transporting power the quality and quantity of sediment supply i e the catchment characteristics from which the sediment originates and is greatly modified by anthropogenic activity babiński 2005 with ssc ranging from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 suspended load dominates the total sediment load tl of gilgel abay river at the study gauging station by contrast the ratio of bedload to tl was in the range between 0 1 and 5 4 with an average value of 0 7 these values are within the ranges of bedload percentage in tl reported for rivers in the equatorial regions of africa e g billi 2011 girma 2005 karambiri and ribolzi 2003 spronck 1941 rivers such as the nile downstream of aswan dam okavango and mayo tsanaga delivered a higher proportion of bedload 20 55 of tl whereas the blue nile at khartoum gereb oda katchari congo and gilgel abay carried the smallest bedload fraction i e 6 of tl table 7 the bedload percentage exceeding 20 of the tl table 7 is commonly found in steep and coarse rivers with a high sediment supply from the headwaters where weathering and erosion processes are more intense or in rivers and headwaters that are affected by a high degree of anthropogenic disturbances abdel fattah et al 2004 mccarthy et al 1991 olivry and hoorelbecke 1975 bedload fraction could also be as high as 54 of the tl in proglacial streams which are generally characterized by high flow velocities and transport capacity high sediment concentrations and intense bedload rates bogen et al 2015 mao et al 2019 rainato et al 2017 usually the tl in lower gradient reaches and ephemeral streams worldwide is also dominated by suspended load and the bedload accounts for only a small 1 fraction of the tl babiński 2005 billi 2011 groten et al 2016 yasi and hamzepouri 2008 for instance the magnitude of bedload in the lower most reaches near the river mouth and alluvial rivers represents 0 1 0 3 in the yellow river 1 6 in amu darya 0 7 2 4 in yangtze 1 2 4 in mississippi 1 in amazon and 1 2 in nile during the pre aswan high dam babiński 2005 filizola et al 2011 joshi and xu 2017 knox and latrubesse 2016 woodward et al 2008 because stream power decreases with distance downstream lecce 1997 furthermore the relatively high rates of both bed and suspended load are reflected by the fast growth pattern of gilgel abay delta a study by poppe et al 2013 and landsat image analysis of the 1985s and 2015s showed that the gilgel abay river delta was growing rapidly in the last 15 40 years fig 3 in general the suspended load inputs have low settling velocities caldwell and edmonds 2014 leading to long advection lengths and fine grains that are transported far into the water body while the combination of low wave activity and increased critical flow shear stress for very fine grained sediments stabilizes channels burpee et al 2015 caldwell and edmonds 2014 similar to the mississippi delta development caldwell and edmonds 2014 the suspended load dominated sediment dynamics in lower gilgel abay river also creates a delta with elongated planform and few stable channel mouths dominated by levee growth analysis of the grain sizes of suspended sediment in this study and sediment coring of the upper most 10 m deposited sediment near to lakeshores and in the middle of lake tana by lamb et al 2007 showed uniformly composed sediments with a median size of 13 63 μm 5 3 bedload prediction using equations and uncertainties when bedload data availability is sparse and its measurement remains an obstacle to understand sediment transport it is common to estimate bedload by applying reliable sediment transport equations erskine and saynor 2015 heimann et al 2015 out of the twelve equations tested in this study the empirical equations of martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 performed well with an overall discrepancy ratio r of 0 3 to 2 4 similar to findings of billi et al 2017 the largest discrepancies between qbm and qbp are associated with the lowest bedload transport rates the performance improved for higher bedload rates due to the fact that high flows are better captured by transport capacity equations comiti and mao 2012 this result also confirms that even the best performing equations failed to capture the relatively gradual decline in measured bedload transport rates moreover the percentage of the overall data having a discrepancy ratio r between 0 05 and 20 is 100 for both equations fig 10 also the percentage of the overall data having a discrepancy ratio between 0 5 and 2 is ca 71 for the martin 2003 and 61 for the modified bagnold martin and church 2000 equations respectively however the remaining equations are found to overpredict bedload transport rate by at least one order of magnitude for the study reach it is however worth noticing that the engelund equation was obtained to predict both bedload and bed material suspended load i e that proportion of sediments that contributes with wash load to suspended load so some overprediction is intrinsic in this equation meyer peter and muller and parker equations were derived for gravel bed rivers and those of fernandez luque and van beek wilcock and crowe and yalin were derived for mixtures of fine gravel and sand gomez and church 1989 all these equations consider the transport of gravel or fine gravel which implies larger flow shear stress values additionally most of them were derived from flume experiments in which important factors such as the variability of sediment supply in natural rivers and the occurrence of macroroughness whereby effective shear stress is lower than the total one are not considered hence their inability to predict the bedload of a sand bed driver is not surprising emmett 1979 nielsen equation was designed to predict the sand transport of longshore currents i e in a different hydraulic environment although the basic principles of drag and entrainment are the same as in rivers the ratio between sediment supply and flow energy may be very different the empirical equation of martin was obtained by plotting unit stream power versus bedload transport data of a world wide data set reported in the paper of gomez and church 1989 though martins s equation is empirical its calibration with real data and the use of unit stream power seem to be the main reasons for its good performance in their study on the assessment of several bedload transport formulae gomez and church 1989 were the first to demonstrate the reliability of stream power based equations and to point out the good performance of the bagnold formula best prediction performances could also be achieved by simple empirical bedload transport relations that are accounting for other hydraulic variables such as flow discharge slope and grain size nitsche et al 2011 recking 2010 rickenmann 2001 this study confirms that best predictions were given by equations that relate the bedload transport rate with unit stream power and adjusted for flow depth and grain size accordingly simple power regression functions were also established to describe the relations between bedload transport versus river discharge excess unit stream power and excess shear stress figs 11 and 12 application of these variables to predict bedload transport by means of power functions provided satisfactory agreement r2 0 82 α 0 05 with the measured data sets table 6 and the best predictions compared to the other equations considered in this study similar studies also revealed that hydraulic parameters used in regression models play important roles to formulate suitable bedload transport equations e g barry et al 2007 billi 2011 girma 2005 habersack et al 2008 kociuba 2017 6 conclusions this study analysed bedload and suspended load transport in five verticals along the channel cross section of the lower course of the gilgel abay river the analysis of these two components during the measuring campaign revealed considerable variations in bedload transport among the measuring verticals and months the measured values 0 11 to 282 g s 1 m 1 average 31 3 g s 1 m 1 is within the ranges reported for most african rivers mean daily bedload transport rate and flux were used for comparison of the temporal variation and for the evaluation of the performance of different bedload equations mean daily measured bedload varied from 0 7 to 427 5 mg d 1 which corresponds to a mean bedload flux of 225 6 mg d 1 as bedload flux generally increased with flow discharge the highest measured mean daily bedload transport rates occurred at the highest mean river discharges 483 m3 s 1 during the months of august and september similarly the suspended sediment concentration ssc also ranges from 0 05 to 6 87 g l 1 and the peak ssc was observed at the beginning of the sampling period early august due to availability of sediments originating from freshly ploughed croplands with limited soil cover and high runoff discharges for transporting these sediments despite the higher ssc occurring during higher river discharges r2 0 86 the suspended load was influenced more by changes in ssc than by discharge confirming the important role of sediment supply variability in determining the ssc of a river the observed area specific bedload and suspended load are also 0 6 and 22 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively like many rivers in the tropics total sediment load tl in lower gilgel abay river is dominated by the suspended load with a bedload to tl ratio of 0 1 to 5 4 besides the small values of the bedload to tl ratio the elongated planform of gilgel abay delta with few channels could be an indicator that suspended sediment is dominating the sediment dynamics in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the small tana lake waves among the bedload prediction equations tested martin 2003 and modified bagnold martin and church 2000 provided bedload predictions closest to the observations with an acceptable range of error on the other hand equations that relate bedload transport with hydraulic variables for lower gilgel abay river have been established as an alternative application of these variables particularly river discharge and unit stream power to predict bedload transport rates using power functions provide satisfactory agreement with the measured data sets finally this study provides plausible estimates of bedload flux that are within predicted ranges reported for alluvial rivers in african and other tropical regions i e 1 to 10 of total load moreover the bedload regression equation based on flow discharge and the best performer equations of martin and modified bagnold tested herein could be representative for natural rivers found in low lying geographic area and similar hydraulic and sediment conditions

6233,interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems therefore the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate this is particularly true for semi arid arid regions where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification poverty and climate change however quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported in the present study rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one year period january december 2016 for a deciduous broad leafed r pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle leaf p tabuliformis plantation common afforestation tree species situated in the semi arid loess plateau of china the stand age density canopy cover and leaf area index of r pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years 2000 tree ha 1 0 48 and 1 41 m2 m 2 respectively the corresponding values for pinus tabuliformis were 17 years 1200 tree ha 1 0 62 and 2 53 m2 m 2 the measured throughfall stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for r pseudoacacia were 81 1 1 3 and 17 6 respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 75 4 0 7 and 23 9 given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the observed higher interception loss for p tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species the revised gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used the revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity keywords rainfall interception revised gash analytical model semiarid climate stemflow throughfall 1 introduction arid and semi arid ecosystems constitute more than 30 of the earth s terrestrial surface and are among the world s most fragile ecosystems due to periodic droughts and increasing overexploitation of the limited water resources malagnoux et al 2007 moreover these ecosystems are facing extraordinary challenges including desertification biodiversity loss poverty and climate change fao 2015 to tackle such challenges large scale afforestation and reforestation efforts have been implemented in these regions to convert farm grass and shrub land into forest plantations cao et al 2011 malagnoux et al 2007 fao 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 because trees and forests are vital for averting desertification and increasing the resilience of ecosystems in the face of global change such restoration measures however have raised concerns about the effects of the new forest plantations on water resources farley et al 2005 wang et al 2011 because canopies of plantations may reduce water yield from watersheds through transpiration interception and evaporation farley et al 2005 creating potentially conflicting demands for water between ecosystems and humans feng et al 2016 in these water scarce arid and semiarid regions where limited precipitation is the main source of water gross rainfall plays an important role in regulating plant growth and survival net primary productivity and ecosystem c nutrient and water fluxes e g niu et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2016 hence a good understanding of the amount of rainfall nr net rainfall reaching the ground is essential for water resource managers to develop effective water resources management and water plan strategies when rain falls on forest canopies a portion reaches the forest floor as throughfall tf and stemflow sf and the remainder is retained on the canopy and subsequently evaporated back to the atmosphere interception loss i the actual amount of rainfall that reaches the forest floor tf sf is net rainfall nr calculated as the difference between the gross rainfall and interception loss interception loss is the sink term in the water balance of a watershed and is recognized as a considerably important hydrological process in water resource management muzylo et al 2009 the importance of interception loss has been repeatedly demonstrated in different tree species under various ecological systems crockford and richardson 2000 dunkerley 2000 llorens and domingo 2007 a literature review has shown that a significant portion of gross rainfall is lost to interception loss limousin et al 2008 carlyle moses and gash 2011 for example interception losses have been reported to range from 9 of the gross rainfall in an amazonian rainforest llorens 1998 to as high as 60 in a coniferous forest in the mediterranean mountain area forgeard et al 1980 the large variability in interception loss is strongly dependent on the canopy structure e g density leaf area index canopy cover and canopy storage capacity and climate variables e g evaporation rate wind and rainfall characteristics crockford and richardson 2000 gash 1979 staelens et al 2008 among all these factors canopy structure is always identified as the most important influential factor in most rainfall interception models deguchi et al 2006 canopy structure may be altered by changes in tree species composition gap fraction leaf spatial distribution and temporal changes in foliage amounts franklin et al 2002 he et al 2014 within forests more attention has been paid to the influence of tree species composition on interception loss which tended to be higher in coniferous forests than in broad leaved forests carlyle moses and gash 2011 moreover most of these studies have only included measurements from the leafed growing season price and carlyle moses 2003 and relatively little work has sought to investigate the effects of seasonal changes on the foliage amount i e both leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons on interception loss deguchi et al 2006 additionally interception loss within deciduous trees is more affected by seasonal changes in canopy structure than that within evergreen trees augusto et al 2002 interception loss models allow measurement results to be extrapolated in space and time and they also provide insight into the mechanisms of interception process rutter et al 1975 gash et al 1995 hence interception models are particularly needed by forest managers as a component of hydrological predication tools to accurately predict interception loss by different types of vegetation many interception loss models have been developed muzylo et al 2009 these models are largely based on either the rutter rutter et al 1971 1975 or gash gash 1979 gash et al 1995 models the original gash 1979 model is a simplified version of the rutter model features an empirical approach and requires fewer data however it overestimates interception loss for sparse forests since it predicts overall whole plot area evaporation rather than evaporation per canopy area gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 therefore gash et al 1995 revised the original model by introducing a canopy cover fraction the revised gash analytical model was more robust and provided more accurate estimates of interception loss for sparse forests carlyle moses and price 2007 deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2009 valente et al 1997 as it took into account forest sparseness and improved forest boundary conditions the revised gash model has been successfully applied to forests across different climatic conditions including temperate forests deguchi et al 2006 gash et al 1995 mediterranean forests limousin et al 2008 and tropical rainforests ghimire et al 2017 however to the knowledge of the authors only a few studies have tested the revised gash model in arid and semi arid forests dunkerley 2000 and this model has rarely been validated in arid and semi arid plantations e g motahari et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 the revised gash model has been applied less frequently in deciduous forests than in evergreen forests moreover modelling studies of deciduous forests have mostly been focused on measurements from the leafed growing season e g carlyle moses and price 1999 price and carlyle moses 2003 with only a few studies focusing on both the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons e g deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 the limited number of interception loss modelling studies in deciduous forests is possibly a consequence of difficulties in model application in this kind of forests to correctly apply the revised model separate parameterization and validation datasets are required for both the leafed and leafless seasons muzylo et al 2012 which will prolong the observation period extend from the leafed season to the leafless season and is also a time consuming and labour intensive process although interception loss takes a much lower fraction of gross rainfall in the leafless period than in the leafed period for deciduous forests it is still a critical component of the water balance e g deguchi et al 2006 šraj et al 2008 therefore to better understand the effects of deciduous canopies on water resources interception loss measurement or and modelling should be applied in both leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons two of the most commonly selected tree species for afforestation in the arid and semi arid regions of asia e g afghanistan iran pakistan iraq lebanon and china are roinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabuliformis e g guo et al 2008 jia et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2016 these two species were chosen due to their great tolerance to drought infertility and low high temperature as well as their superior growth compared with some native tree species ma et al 2014 vitkova et al 2017 however the phenological and morphological traits of these two species are distinct from each other r pseudoacacia is a broad leaved deciduous tree species with a narrow crown and smooth bark while p tabuliformis is a needle leaved evergreen tree species with a flat topped crown and rough bark furthermore these two species are also significantly different in canopy thickness branching architecture and leaf shedding patterns all of which will be differentially affected by rainfall and other climate variables e g wind and solar radiation and lead to distinct rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and canopy interception patterns e g carlyle moses and gash 2011 park and cameron 2008 hence quantification comparison and modelling studies of rainfall partitioning between these two species in arid and semi arid regions may benefit watershed and forest managers by providing valuable information about canopy hydrological processes however such a comparison and modelling study has rarely been reported jian et al 2015 therefore the objectives of this research are to i measure and compare interception loss throughfall and stemflow between afforested stands of r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis during different measurement periods e g annual leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons in the semi arid region of china ii calibrate and validate the revised gash analytical model for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis forest stands during the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons and iii explore the underlying causes of differences in interception loss between the two forest stands an advantage of this study is that the two studied forests experienced similar climatic conditions during the experimental period potentially minimizing the effects of meteorological differences on interception loss and allowing comparison primarily due to structural differences 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted within the yeheshan watershed yhs 34 31 76 n 107 54 67 e in the provincial natural reserve of fufeng county in shaanxi province china fig 1 the yhs is in a hilly and gully region with an elevation ranging from 449 m to 1662 m above sea level and an area of 10 996 ha forest covers approximately 90 of the watershed and is made up of a mosaic of pure stands of different tree varieties including both coniferous and broad leaved species r pseudoacacia is the dominant tree species in this region and accounts for approximately 75 of the canopy trees p tabuliformis is the second most abundant species constituting approximately 15 of the canopy trees the other tree species platycladus orientalis populus davidiana quercus wutaishansea and quercus variabili are usually found as individual trees or in small groups the yhs experiences a semi arid continental climate characterized by a hot humid summer june august and cold dry winter december february based on climate data 1958 2016 from the fufeng bureau of meteorology the nearest meteorology station to yhs 10 km the average annual precipitation is 580 mm sd 139 mm and the average annual temperature is 12 7 c sd 0 6 c with an absolute maximum of 42 2 c in june and an absolute minimum of 21 2 c in january precipitation mainly occurs during the leafed growing season may october and has a large inter annual variation with a variation coefficient of 0 3 the average annual reference evapotranspiration was 1217 mm which was calculated as the product of pan evaporation and the pan coefficient depending on the average annual wind speed 1 5 m s 1 and relative humidity 72 over the study region the pan coefficient was set to 0 80 fao 1998 the dominant wind direction varies seasonally with southeast winds in the growing season and northwest winds in the dormant season november april two representative experimental plots 50 50 m2 were established in the adjacent r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis woodlands approximately 200 m apart from each other the two plots are located on a relatively flat slope 5 10 underlain by deep silt loam soil over 50 m deep the deciduous r pseudoacacia stand was established in 2002 with a dense understory of stipa bungeana artemisia sacrorum and artemisia scoparia the evergreen p tabuliformis stand was established in 2000 with a sparse understory of grass species the r pseudoacacia stand had a stem density of 2000 tree ha 1 a mean diameter at breast height dbh 1 3 m of 11 cm and a mean tree height of 9 6 m in 2016 while the corresponding values for the p tabuliformis stand were 1200 tree ha 1 15 cm and 7 2 m respectively the leaf area index lai was estimated using digital hemispherical photography and can eye software version 6 3 baret and weiss 2004 hemispherical photographs were taken with a nikon d100 equipped with a 4 5 mm sigma circular fisheye lens for the best representation of canopy gap fraction 12 photos were taken within each stand 6 taken between tree rows and another 6 within trees rows and the camera was oriented carefully such that the edge of the image was perpendicular to the tree row in each stand hemispherical photographs were then processed according to the can eye tutorial document baret and weiss 2004 the average lai value of r pseudoacacia was 2 40 m2 m 2 during the growing season including leaf burst and senescence may october and 0 41 m2 m 2 during the dormant season wood area index november april the average lai value of p tabuliformis was 2 55 m2 m 2 and 2 50 m2 m 2 for the growing and dormant seasons respectively indicating small seasonal variations details of other forest structural features of the study plots are summarized in table 1 2 2 measurements of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements at the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis plots were conducted from 1 january 2016 until 31 december 2016 gross rainfall pg mm was measured for each study plot with a weighing bucket rain gauge t 200b geonor eiksmarka norway connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa and one manual rain gauge 30 cm diameter in a nearby clearing 30 m away the manual gauges were used to check the weighing gauge and were read immediately after each rainfall event a rain event was defined as a period with more than 0 2 mm of the total pg separated by at least 6 h without rain field observations with the leaf wetness sensor 237l campbell scientific logan ut usa at each forest stand confirmed that the time interval was sufficient for residual rainwater to evaporate from the tree crown in this climate throughfall tf mm was measured under the canopy with 30 rain gauges identical to the manual pg rain gauge in each study plot to overcome the spatial variability of tf rain gauges were installed randomly along three 30 m long transects 10 m apart underneath the canopy with an average distance of 2 5 m between neighbouring gauges the average tf can be accurately estimated using a combination of stationary and manual roving gauges to provide representative samples crockford and richardson 2000 holwerda et al 2012 ritter and regalado 2014 therefore two thirds of the rain gauges were relocated to new random positions after every three rainfall events to avoid ground splash effects the orifices of all rain gauges were placed approximately 1 m above the ground stemflow sf mm was measured on thirteen representative trees at each study plot the sf was sampled using spiral type sf collars constructed from plastic hoses each sf collar was attached to the stems and sealed in an upward spiral pattern with silicon sealant to divert rain water into a sf collector the measured data were then scaled to the unit ground area by the average basal area per unit ground area for each study plot therefore interception loss i mm was calculated as the difference between pg and the sum of tf and sf 2 3 meteorological measurements meteorological variables were measured by an automatic weather station mounted on a 13 metre high tower 2 m above the black locust canopy located at the centre of the r pseudoacacia woodland relative humidity and air temperature were measured with an hmp155a vaisala finland type thermohydrometer net radiation was measured using a 4 component radiometer cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands wind speed was measured with a 3 d sonic anemometers thermometer cast3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa close to the station two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux thermal sensors the netherlands were installed 5 cm below the ground surface meteorological data were automatically sampled at 10 s intervals and recorded at 10 min intervals by using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa as the two study plots were close to each other 200 m apart the recorded meteorological variables were considered to be the same for the two study plots 2 4 revised gash analytical model the revised gash analytical model gash et al 1995 was used to model interception loss at the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis plots the model operates under the assumption that pg is intercepted as a series of individual rainfall events with enough time to completely dry the canopy and trunk between two successive events each rainfall event can be distinguished by three sequential phases i a wetting up phase during which pg is less than the threshold value required to saturate the canopy pg mm ii a saturation phase during which the canopy achieves and maintains a saturation state when rainfall intensity r mm h 1 exceeds the mean wet canopy evaporation rate e mm h 1 of the saturated canopy and iii a drying phase after rainfall has ceased interception losses through evaporation take place during each phase and the total interception loss for a particular event is obtained as the sum of different components to calculate interception loss the revised analytical model requires two types of data canopy parameters and atmospheric variables the required canopy parameters are the free throughfall coefficient ρ here assumed to be one minus canopy cover fraction c the canopy storage capacity s the trunk storage capacity st and the rainfall fraction diverted into sf pt the required atmospheric variables are pg e and r during each rainfall event the amounts of rainwater required to entirely saturate the canopy pg and trunk pt are calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 2 p t s t p t where e c is the mean evaporation rate from the saturated canopy during a rainfall event and is defined as e c e c sc is the canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover and is calculated as sc s c the revised analytical model divides interception loss into five components and the equation used to calculate each component is presented in table 2 2 5 estimation of model parameters following wallace and mcjannet 2008 s for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands were obtained as the negative intercept of the regression of pg against the sum of tf and sf the free throughfall coefficient ρreg was estimated in accordance with jackson 1975 as the slope of the linear regression between pg and tf for small rainfall that was too small to saturate the canopy an alternative method to estimate this parameter ρlai was also applied during the growing and dormant seasons using hemispherical photographs taken by a nikon d100 digital camera with a fish eye lens baret and weiss 2004 muzylo et al 2012 and processed using can eye software version 6 3 to achieve this goal 12 photos were taken within each stand and the camera was oriented carefully such that the edge of the image was perpendicular to the tree row in each stand macfarlane et al 2007 all photos were taken each month on cloudy days or at dusk under uniform sky conditions the rainfall fraction diverted to the trunks pt and the trunk storage capacity st were estimated by the method of gash and morton 1978 as the slope and the negative intercept of the linear regression between pg and sf e was estimated using three approaches first the evaporation rate was estimated using the penman monteith equation hereafter referred to as e pm assuming a canopy conductance of zero gash et al 1995 shi et al 2010 3 e pm δ r n g ρ a c p d g a λ δ γ where is the slope of the curve relating the saturation vapor pressure to temperature kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air j kg 1 k 1 d is the vapor pressure deficit kpa λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water kpa k 1 γ is the psychometric constant j kg 1 and g a is the aerodynamic conductance m s 1 which is calculated using the method provided by gash et al 1995 4 g a k 2 u ln z d z 0 2 where k is von karman s constant 0 41 u m s 1 is the wind speed z is the height at which wind speed was measured m d is the zero plane displacement height m here assumed to be 0 7 h and z0 is the roughness length for momentum m here assumed to be 0 1 h second the mean evaporation rate e tf was derived from the value of e r as estimated from the linear regression relationship between pg and interception loss gash 1979 third the mean evaporation rate e opt was estimated through optimization of e r by minimizing the root mean square error between the simulated and observed interception loss for all rainfall events marquardt 1963 to investigate the effects of seasonal changes in structural parameters on interception loss all parameters were estimated separately for two vegetation periods 1 the leafed growing season may october and 2 the leafless dormant season november april the periods were determined according to the phenological measurements and lai data of the r pseudoacacia stand 2 6 sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the parameters in the revised analytical model sensitivity analyses were performed separately for the leafed growing season and leafless dormant season in this analysis parameters s c e r pt and st were considered their values were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values and the simulated results were compared to their field data 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the mean relative error between four rainfall measurements among the two forest sites was 3 1 which indicates that pg over the study area did not vary considerably and the mean value was thus used as pg in this study during the study period the total measured rainfall was 510 mm generated by 78 discrete rainfall events with 464 8 mm 91 1 and 45 2 mm 8 9 occurring during the leafed growing season and leafless dormant season respectively however the frequency distribution of the event size duration and intensity were similar between the growing and dormant seasons fig 2 generally smaller events 5 mm were more frequent but contributed a lower percentage of total gross rainfall than larger events especially during the dormant season and vice versa fig 2a rainfall duration distribution was less positively skewed fig 2b with events in shorter 2h or longer 20 h duration ranges corresponding to a lower event frequency 11 5 and 5 1 respectively in contrast to rainfall duration the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was highly positively skewed fig 2c suggesting that low intensity rainfall 0 5 mm h 1 had a higher frequency of occurrence than high intensity rainfall 5 mm h 1 however rainfall events with low intensity contributed a lower percentage of gross rainfall than high intensity rainfall statistical analysis indicated that the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity between growing and dormant seasons was not significant p 0 064 except for low intensity events 0 5 mm h 1 a significant difference p 0 01 was detected 3 2 rainfall partitioning the cumulative annual tf was 413 6 mm for the r pseudoacacia stand and 384 6 mm for the p tabuliformis stand which accounted for 81 1 and 75 4 of pg respectively table 3 the mean standard errors se of the mean tf for average individual rainfall events were 10 3 and 7 6 for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively the total tf for r pseudoacacia in the growing and dormant seasons was 373 4 mm 80 3 of corresponding rainfall p and 40 2 mm 89 of p respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 350 2 mm 75 3 of p and 34 4 mm 76 1 of p the cumulative annual sf was larger in the r pseudoacacia stand 1 3 of pg than in the p tabuliformis stand 0 7 of pg the calculated mean se values of sf were much higher 18 5 for r pseudoacacia and 26 3 for p tabuliformis in the r pseudoacacia stand the cumulative sf was 6 0 mm 1 35 of p and 0 8 mm 1 8 of p for the growing and dormant seasons respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 3 3 mm 0 7 of p and 0 3 mm 0 7 of p interception loss was derived by subtracting the measured tf and sf from pg during the study period the estimated interception loss was larger in the p tabuliformis stand 23 9 of pg than in the r pseudoacacia stand 17 6 of pg the mean se values of interception loss which was estimated as the root sum of the variances of tf and sf were 9 9 for r pseudoacacia and 15 6 for p tabuliformis in the r pseudoacacia stand the estimated interception loss during the growing season 85 4 mm was much larger than that in the dormant season 4 2 mm representing 18 4 and 9 2 respectively of the corresponding rainfall p in the p tabuliformis stand the growing season interception loss was 111 3 mm vs 10 5 mm for the dormant season representing 23 9 and 23 2 of p respectively 3 3 model parameterization the total number of rainfall events measured at the two forest sites during the growing season may october and dormant season november april of 2016 were each divided into two subsets i e dataset 1 n 35 in the growing season and dataset 1 n 11 in the dormant season for model calibration and dataset 2 n 25 and dataset 2 n 7 in the growing and dormant seasons respectively for model validation to account for seasonal variation in rainfall intensity the data from june august and october in dataset 1 and from november december february and march in dataset 1 were used for model calibration the data from may july and september in dataset 2 and january and from april in dataset 2 were used for model validation total gross rainfall for dataset 1 and dataset 1 was 267 9 mm and 28 1 mm respectively the corresponding values for dataset 2 and dataset 2 were 196 9 mm and 17 1 mm the values for canopy parameters to be used in the revised gash analytical model were obtained from the calibration datasets dataset 1 and dataset 1 which ensured an independent validation the mean canopy parameters during the growing and dormant seasons for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands are presented in table 4 the free throughfall coefficients ρ estimated from the fisheye photographs ρlai and from regression fitting ρreg were similar to each other with no significant differences p greater than 0 05 for both forest sites fig 3 and table 4 in the r pseudoacacia stand the ρ values were significantly p 0 001 higher in the dormant season than in the growing season while in the p tabuliformis stand there were no significant differences p 0 302 in ρ between the two study seasons for modelling purpose the mean value of ρlai and ρreg was used to estimate the canopy cover c table 4 in the r pseudoacacia stand the canopy storage capacity s was 1 34 mm in the growing season nearly seven times higher than that in the dormant season 0 20 mm while in the p tabuliformis stand s was slightly higher in the growing season 1 43 mm than in the dormant season 1 38 mm fig 3c and 3d the trunk storage capacity st was higher in the growing season 0 074 mm than in the dormant season 0 052 mm for r pseudoacacia while the values 0 041 mm were similar in the two seasons for p tabuliformis fig 3e and 3f similar results were found for the threshold rainfall to entirely saturate the canopy pg and the trunk pg in the growing season pg 1 97 mm for r pseudoacacia and 2 52 mm for p tabuliformis pg 5 69 mm for r pseudoacacia and 5 86 mm for p tabuliformis and the dormant season pg 1 05 mm for r pseudoacacia and 2 49 mm for p tabuliformis pg 3 06 mm for r pseudoacacia and 5 86 mm for p tabuliformis table 4 for the fraction of rainfall contributing to stemflow pt the estimated values 0 007 were similar between the two seasons for p tabuliformis while this value was higher in the dormant season 0 017 than in the growing season 0 013 for r pseudoacacia fig 3 3 4 model results measured and simulated total interception loss using different evaporate rates for the calibration dataset dataset 1 from r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands during the growing season are summarized in table 5 and presented in fig 4 generally simulated interception loss was underestimated to different extents for the two forest sites and the underestimation was larger in the r pseudoacacia stand than in the p tabuliformis stand the predicted interception loss using e pm values was underestimated by 18 9 in the growing season for r pseudoacacia the corresponding value for p tabuliformis was 16 3 the simulated interception loss using e tf was closer to the measured values with an underestimation of 5 4 and 4 5 respectively for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands table 5 the predicted interception loss using e opt agreed well with the measured values for both forest sites resulting in an underestimation ranging from 2 6 for the r pseudoacacia stand to 2 3 for the p tabuliformis stand table 5 and fig 4 in total the performance of the revised analytical gash model greatly improved through the usage of e opt with the relative error decreasing from 18 9 to 2 3 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient increasing from 0 64 to 0 93 table 5 the performance of the model was validated using evaporation rates e tf and e opt and the estimated canopy parameters from the calibration datasets dataset 1 the simulated interception losses using e tf and e opt for the validation datasets dataset 2 from the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands were also in good agreement with the field measurements with relative errors of 7 6 and nash sutcliffe coefficients above 0 74 for both forest stands table 5 and fig 4 the observed and simulated interception loss using different evaporation rates during the dormant season for calibration dataset dataset 1 are presented in table 6 and fig 5 the model run with e pm was largely underestimated for the two forest sites with an underestimation of 21 7 and 18 3 for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively a much better fit between simulated and measured interception losses was obtained using e tf with a model efficiency greater than 0 78 for all forest sites however the model underestimated the interception loss by 8 7 for r pseudoacacia which was larger than the underestimation of 5 0 for p tabuliformis the performance of the revised gash model using e opt was slightly better than that of the model using e tf for both forest sites resulting in an underestimation of only 4 3 and 3 3 for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis respectively use of the optimized canopy evaporation rate improved the model efficiency for both plantations during the dormant season with improvements of the nash sutcliffe coefficient from 0 56 to 0 84 for r pseudoacacia and from 0 60 to 0 87 for p tabuliformis using e opt the simulated interception loss was also in very good agreement with the measured values for both plantations for the validation dataset dataset 2 with underestimations of only 5 and 4 6 respectively table 6 and fig 5 similar to the results obtained by using e opt the predicted total interception loss for the validation datasets also agreed well with those derived from the throughfall and stemflow measurements with a relative error 6 8 and modelling efficiency greater than 0 72 table 6 and fig 5 table 7 summarizes different interception components predicted by the revised analytical gash model using e opt the results revealed that most of the interception loss occurred in the stage of after rainfall had ceased in the growing season for both forest sites 41 2 for r pseudoacacia and 42 5 for p tabuliformis table 7 the second largest term occurred in the stage of during saturated rainfall conditions with the p tabuliformis stand exhibiting a slightly greater loss of this kind 40 1 than r pseudoacacia 37 5 the contribution of small rainfall to the total evaporation loss was also larger 9 2 for r pseudoacacia and 8 4 for p tabuliformis whereas evaporation losses during canopy wetting for r pseudoacacia and from the trunks for p tabuliformis were minor 6 in the dormant season the simulation suggested that 39 3 and 30 of total interception occurred in the stages of during saturated rainfall conditions and after rainfall had ceased respectively for the r pseudoacacia stand the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 18 and 60 evaporation losses from small rainfall events also played a larger role in total evaporation loss for both forest sites 12 for r pseudoacacia and 12 7 for p tabuliformis while evaporation loss from trunks was minor 10 3 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the canopy and climatic variables to interception loss is presented in fig 6 generally the results indicated that the revised analytical gash model was highly sensitive to variations in the canopy parameter s and the climatic variable e r for both forest sites a decrease of 50 in s resulted in a decrease of 24 3 and 9 0 in simulated interception loss for the r pseudoacacia stand during the growing and dormant seasons respectively fig 6a b for the p tabuliformis stand a 50 decrease of s reduced the predicted interception loss by 23 6 for the growing season and 29 2 for the dormant season fig 6c d a decrease in e r of 50 reduced the simulated interception loss by 16 6 and 31 6 for r pseudoacacia during the growing and dormant seasons respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis stand were 21 3 and 16 8 the revised analytical model was less sensitive to the canopy parameter c and trunk parameter pt fig 6 a decrease in c of 50 resulted in a 4 5 and 6 5 decrease in interception loss for the growing and dormant seasons respectively in the r pseudoacacia stand for the p tabuliformis stand the corresponding values were 7 0 and 6 2 likewise a 50 decrease in pt reduced interception loss by 2 7 in the growing season and 9 2 in the dormant season for r pseudoacacia the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 2 3 and 2 1 the revised analytical model was fairly insensitive to the trunk parameter st for both forest sites fig 6 a decrease of 50 in st resulted in a decrease of 1 6 and 3 8 in interception loss for the growing and dormant seasons respectively in the r pseudoacacia stand whereas a similar decrease in st in the p tabuliformis stand only reduced the interception loss by 0 2 4 discussion 4 1 interception throughfall and stemflow the interception loss in this study for the r pseudoacacia stand 17 6 of pg was similar to the value 20 of pg reported by sadeghi et al 2016 but much higher than the value 8 6 of pg observed by wang et al 2013 the reason for this large difference between our study and that of wang et al 2013 is likely caused by the lower rainfall intensity r 1 83 mm h 1 and higher evaporation rates e 0 18 mm h 1 during rainfall in the study area compared to that in the central loess plateau where most rainfall events are short and intense r 2 82 mm h 1 and evaporation rates are lower e 0 11 mm h 1 wang et al 2013 the measured interception loss for the p tabuliformis stand 23 9 of pg was slightly higher than the values already reported for other pine forests with a low stem density such as 22 9 in a pinus elliottii and pinus caribaea plantation reported by fan et al 2014 22 3 in a mature pine forest reported by bryant et al 2005 19 2 in a pinus pseudostrobus forest reported by silva et al 2001 16 5 in a planted pinus roxburghii forest reported by ghimire et al 2012 and 14 2 in a pure and natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 it is possible that the higher interception loss was due to the higher tree density lai and canopy cover in our study which may have resulted in a higher e during rainfall gash et al 1995 šraj et al 2008 overall the observed interception loss was higher in p tabuliformis than in r pseudoacacia which is expected as interception loss tends to be higher in evergreen coniferous forests than in broad leafed deciduous forests fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2016 and these findings are in good agreement with previous work synthesizing interception loss studies carlyle moses and gash 2011 since the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the higher interception loss observed for the p tabuliformis stand thus can be largely explained by its higher s and e during rainfall table 4 the interception loss percentage was significantly higher during the leafed period 18 4 than the leafless period 9 2 for deciduous r pseudoacacia which agrees well with findings for other deciduous forests deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 park et al 2000 the decreased interception loss increased net precipitation received at the soil surface in the leafless season may depend on the reduction in leaf amounts and canopy cover table 4 as shown in the positive relationship between the leaf area index and interception loss that has already been reported elsewhere e g between seasons deguchi et al 2006 park et al 2000 by thinning molina and del campo 2012 shinohara et al 2015 by beetle infestation bearup et al 2014 increased net precipitation during the leafless dormant season will increase the soil water content in the unsaturated soil zone which could increase tree growth during the next leafed growing season for example worbes 1999 reported that the precipitation amount during the dormant season has a close relationship with tree diameter growth during the growing season for deciduous forests hence in water limited regions e g arid and semi arid regions where water resource availability may have a substantial impact on forest growing forest managers are highly recommended to implement hydrology oriented silviculture e g reduce leaf amount and cover to reduce stand interception loss and transpiration and at the tree level to improve growth and water use efficiency the observed throughfall tf percentage of the r pseudoacacia stand 81 1 of pg was much lower than that previously reported for other r pseudoacacia forests with a low basal area in the central loess plateau e g 89 1 of pg reported by wang et al 2013 likewise the tf for the p tabuliformis stand 75 4 of pg was also much lower than the amounts reported in other pine forests with a low basal area e g 85 in a natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 and 83 8 in a thinned pinus halepensis forest reported by molina and del campo 2012 but it was comparable to the values 78 3 of pg reported by fan et al 2014 in a pine plantation with a similar basal area this result indicates that the lower tf fraction may possibly be explained by the relatively high basal area in the two forest stands since the basal area was similar between the two forests the lower tf fraction in p tabuliformis relative to r pseudoacacia may well have been caused by their thicker crown depth and denser leaves the thicker crown depth and denser leaves likely increased the length of interaction between raindrops and the crown surface resulting in more rainwater retention and a reduced tf fraction park and cameron 2008 sadeghi et al 2016 in this study the observed stemflow percentage of r pseudoacacia 1 3 of the gross rainfall was obviously higher than that of p tabuliformis 0 7 of the gross rainfall p greater than 0 05 the steeply angled branches and smooth bark of r pseudoacacia would favourably channel rainwater to sf compared with the low angled branches and rough bark of p tabuliformis thus potentially generating a higher sf for r pseudoacacia fan et al 2014 the measured sf for p tabuliformis 0 7 of pg was comparable to those observed for other pine forest with a similar basal area e g 0 9 of pg in a natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 and 1 of pg in a pinus elliottii and pinus caribaea plantation reported by fan et al 2014 but it was slightly lower than the observations 1 5 of pg in a natural pinus halepensis forest with a high basal area reported by molina and del campo 2012 this finding may indicate that the lower sf can be explained by the lower basal area in our forest stand concerning deciduous r pseudoacacia the measured sf was slightly higher in the leafless dormant season 1 8 of pg than in the leafed growing season 1 3 of pg which is in good agreement with reported findings for other deciduous forests herbst et al 2008 muzylo et al 2012 staelens et al 2008 the increased sf in the leafless dormant season relative to the leafed growing season was likely caused by the reduction in leaf amounts and the low evaporation rates during rainfall table 3 and 4 as previously reported by herbst et al 2008 and andre et al 2008 4 2 wet canopy evaporation the average annual wet canopy evaporation rates e pm calculated using the penman monteith equation were 0 05 mm h 1 0 05 mm h 1 in growing season 0 04 mm h 1 in dormant season and 0 04 mm h 1 0 06 mm h 1 in growing season 0 03 mm h 1 in dormant season for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively falling within the range of estimates for other temperate forests 0 02 1 11 mm h 1 herbst et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 shinohara et al 2015 estimates e tf based on the regression method were scaled to the canopy cover fraction to allow a direct comparison with e pm and provided average annual values of 0 25 mm h 1 and 0 26 mm h 1 for the r pseudoacacia stand 0 25 mm h 1 for both the growing and dormant seasons and the p tabuliformis stand 0 38 mm h 1 in the growing season 0 15 mm h 1 in the dormant season which were approximately six r pseudoacacia and four p tabuliformis times higher than the corresponding values of e pm the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates e opt were very close to the e tf values table 4 but they were much lower than the optimized values in sub tropical forests ghimire et al 2017 fan et al 2014 wallace and mcjannet 2008 significant differences between e pm and e tf as in this study have also been reported in other interception modelling studies ghimire et al 2012 2017 muzylo et al 2012 wallace and mcjannet 2008 and the possible reasons for this larger discrepancy are discussed below first the penman moentich equation considers vegetation as a single big leaf which may no longer be valid for the tall and sparse forests because their complicated vertical structure tends to enhance eddy turbulence and evaporation holwerda et al 2012 second the zero plane displacement heights and roughness heights used to calculate the aerodynamic conductance g a in the penman monteith equation can be questionable and may tend to underestimate g a and thus e pm when applied in areas with a rugged topography like this study area ghimire et al 2012 holwerda et al 2012 finally the larger discrepancy between e pm and e tf can also be caused by the evaporation of small splashed rainfall droplets murakami 2007 the possible existence of a larger scale biotic pump of atmospheric moisture makarieve and gorshkov 2007 and the difficulty associated with accurately measuring the very high relative humidity levels during rainfall wallance and mcjannet 2008 4 3 canopy parameters the average canopy storage capacity s was significantly higher in the growing season 1 34 mm than the dormant season 0 2 mm for r pseudoacacia which agrees well with the findings for other temperate forests fathizadeh et al 2018 herbst et al 2008 muzylo et al 2012 the s values for p tabuliformis were similar between the growing season 1 43 mm and the dormant season 1 38 mm falling within the range reported in other pine forests 0 5 3 0 mm llorens and gallart 2000 since the local climate and basal area were similar between the two forest stands the differences in s could thus be attributed to the differences in canopy structure however it is difficult to draw a generalization for s because it is controlled by many factors such as rainfall characteristics e g raindrop size distribution and intensity climate conditions e g wind speed canopy traits e g basal area height and wood area index and measurement errors carlyle moses and gash 2011 the free throughfall coefficient a structure parameter assumed to be one minus the canopy cover c is a sensitive parameter for modelling interception loss and it is also an important parameter that is usually considered in forest water resource management in this study the measured average annual free throughfall coefficient was 0 52 for the r pseudoacacia stand and 0 38 for the p tabuliformis stand indicating that the canopy interception fraction in p tabuliformis was higher than that in r pseudoacacia hydrologically the free throughfall coefficient has an important effect on soil water content and nutrient cycling as it reflects the fraction of rainfall passes through the canopy without contacting the canopy surface and removing dry deposition in the canopy asadian 2007 thus the lower and higher s values in the p tabuliformis stand could result in less throughfall reaching the forest floor and hence show a potential to enhance soil water scarcity in this arid semi arid region undergoing re afforestation in contrast the lower and higher s values can protect the forest floor from raindrop splash erosion and delay the peaks in storm runoff asadian 2007 therefore the free throughfall coefficient and canopy storage capacity should be considered when selecting trees for re afforestation where soil erosion is serious the measured sf was relatively low in comparison to other rainfall fractions for the two forest stands table 3 introducing a risk in making comparisons of the sf related parameters st and pt with other studies the observed average annual value of pt for r pseudoacacia 0 015 was much lower than the only reported value of 0 032 by wang et al 2013 but the value for p tabuliformis 0 007 was comparable to that reported for other pine forests with a similar basal area 0 009 0 014 fan et al 2014 shi et al 2010 in this study the observed mean value of st was slightly higher in the r pseudoacacia stand 0 063 than in the p tabuliformis stand 0 041 which is in good agreement with the much higher trunk and longer branches of r pseudoacacia than of p tabuliformis potentially counteracting the effect of the rougher bark of p tabuliformis 4 4 performance of the revised analytical model the revised gash analytical model of rainfall interception satisfactorily estimated the total interception loss in both r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands tables 5 and 6 and it also captured well the seasonal growing and dormant seasons variation in terms of modelling error the revised model performed better for p tabuliformis than for r pseudoacacia and the modelling errors between observed and simulated interception loss were acceptable compared to the reports in other temperate forest interception modelling studies e g deguchi et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2018 herbst et al 2006 2008 muzylo et al 2012 in the present study the model slightly overestimated interception loss for some smaller rainfall events while the interception loss for larger rainfall events tended to be underestimated the modelling errors resulting from an underestimation of most large rainfall events were considered to be responsible for the underestimation of the total interception loss as reported previously fathizadeh et al 2018 shi et al 2010 therefore careful attention should be paid when applying this revised model to changing rainfall conditions towards larger rainfall sizes sadeghi et al 2015 the derived nash sutcliffe model efficiency for the revised model was higher in the p tabuliformis stand 0 6 0 93 than in the r pseudoacacia stand 0 56 0 90 and it was comparable to previous findings in other temperate rainfall interception studies generally ranging from 0 44 to 0 94 bryant et al 2005 fan et al 2014 in this study the use of e opt greatly improved the overall model performance compared with the use of e pm but e opt provided little improvement effect on the overall model performance compared with e tf table 5 and table 6 the application of different parameterization sets to shorter time periods e g seasonal or monthly for modelling interception loss is necessary because many model parameters e g canopy storage capacity canopy cover and evaporation rate change with varying canopy structures and shifting climatic conditions deguchi et al 2006 herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 moreover using constant parameter values for annual interception modelling could lead to significant under or over estimations therefore to avoid these problems monthly or seasonal parameter values have been recommended for use in interception loss modelling murakami et al 2007 muzylo et al 2012 in this study the revised analytical model was therefore run separately for the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons compared with the growing season the underestimation of interception loss in the dormant season was much higher by the revised gash analytical model table 5 and table 6 the higher underestimation of interception loss in the dormant season was probably introduced by the underestimation of rainfall intensity table 4 when small rainfall events occur more frequently fig 2 and more actual evaporation is supposed to occur previous studies have demonstrated that the revised analytical model better estimates rainfall events when interception loss is dependent on s which means that for rainfall events sufficiently large to saturate s e r has more control over interception loss which could lead to greater bias between modelled and measured values fathizadeh et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 in the present study the measurements indicated that the s value was lower in the dormant season than in the growing season table 4 and there were more rainfall events that were sufficiently large to saturate the canopy during the dormant season fig 2 therefore accordingly interception loss was influenced more by e r and less controlled by s in the dormant season and thus a much greater underestimation of interception loss can be expected meteorological records based on high density gauge observations have indicated that precipitation has shifted towards fewer and higher rainfall events over most area of the study region sun et al 2015 therefore if the future climate in the semi arid area shifts towards a frequency of few and intense rainfall events then use of the revised analytical model for interception loss modelling can be more appropriate for the p tabuliformis forest than for the r pseudoacacia forest in terms of model efficiency tables 5 and 6 for other arid and semi arid afforestation sites with different climatic condition and tree species application of the revised gash model may have different canopy and rainfall characteristics to be considered 5 conclusion rainfall interception losses were quantified and modelled for a deciduous broad leafed r pseudoacacia stand and an evergreen needle leaf p tabuliformis stand situated in the semi arid loess plateau of china over the one year january december 2016 study period the measured throughfall stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for r pseudoacacia were 81 1 1 3 and 17 6 respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 75 4 0 7 and 23 9 given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the observed higher interception loss for p tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rates of this species the revised analytical model was well calibrated and validated against the field measurements and it was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately and effectively capture the seasonal variations leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons provided that the gross rainfall throughfall regression method based wet canopy evaporation rate and the optimized wet canopy evaporation rate were used analysis of the magnitude of the different interception components distinguished by the model revealed that most of the total interception loss occurred from canopies in the stages of during saturated rainfall conditions and after rainfall had ceased small rainfall events played a larger role in total interception loss while interception loss from trunks was minor the revised model was highly sensitive to canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover but it was found to be fairly insensitive to trunk storage capacity as interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from soil moisture transpiration surface and groundwater recharge quantification and modelling tools of interception loss are of significant importance to semi arid regions undergoing re afforestation because the measurements and modelling measures allow water resources and forest managers to efficiently predict the effects of re afforestation on water inputs under a future shifting climate declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china no

6233,interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems therefore the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate this is particularly true for semi arid arid regions where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification poverty and climate change however quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported in the present study rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one year period january december 2016 for a deciduous broad leafed r pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle leaf p tabuliformis plantation common afforestation tree species situated in the semi arid loess plateau of china the stand age density canopy cover and leaf area index of r pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years 2000 tree ha 1 0 48 and 1 41 m2 m 2 respectively the corresponding values for pinus tabuliformis were 17 years 1200 tree ha 1 0 62 and 2 53 m2 m 2 the measured throughfall stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for r pseudoacacia were 81 1 1 3 and 17 6 respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 75 4 0 7 and 23 9 given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the observed higher interception loss for p tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species the revised gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used the revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity keywords rainfall interception revised gash analytical model semiarid climate stemflow throughfall 1 introduction arid and semi arid ecosystems constitute more than 30 of the earth s terrestrial surface and are among the world s most fragile ecosystems due to periodic droughts and increasing overexploitation of the limited water resources malagnoux et al 2007 moreover these ecosystems are facing extraordinary challenges including desertification biodiversity loss poverty and climate change fao 2015 to tackle such challenges large scale afforestation and reforestation efforts have been implemented in these regions to convert farm grass and shrub land into forest plantations cao et al 2011 malagnoux et al 2007 fao 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 because trees and forests are vital for averting desertification and increasing the resilience of ecosystems in the face of global change such restoration measures however have raised concerns about the effects of the new forest plantations on water resources farley et al 2005 wang et al 2011 because canopies of plantations may reduce water yield from watersheds through transpiration interception and evaporation farley et al 2005 creating potentially conflicting demands for water between ecosystems and humans feng et al 2016 in these water scarce arid and semiarid regions where limited precipitation is the main source of water gross rainfall plays an important role in regulating plant growth and survival net primary productivity and ecosystem c nutrient and water fluxes e g niu et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2016 hence a good understanding of the amount of rainfall nr net rainfall reaching the ground is essential for water resource managers to develop effective water resources management and water plan strategies when rain falls on forest canopies a portion reaches the forest floor as throughfall tf and stemflow sf and the remainder is retained on the canopy and subsequently evaporated back to the atmosphere interception loss i the actual amount of rainfall that reaches the forest floor tf sf is net rainfall nr calculated as the difference between the gross rainfall and interception loss interception loss is the sink term in the water balance of a watershed and is recognized as a considerably important hydrological process in water resource management muzylo et al 2009 the importance of interception loss has been repeatedly demonstrated in different tree species under various ecological systems crockford and richardson 2000 dunkerley 2000 llorens and domingo 2007 a literature review has shown that a significant portion of gross rainfall is lost to interception loss limousin et al 2008 carlyle moses and gash 2011 for example interception losses have been reported to range from 9 of the gross rainfall in an amazonian rainforest llorens 1998 to as high as 60 in a coniferous forest in the mediterranean mountain area forgeard et al 1980 the large variability in interception loss is strongly dependent on the canopy structure e g density leaf area index canopy cover and canopy storage capacity and climate variables e g evaporation rate wind and rainfall characteristics crockford and richardson 2000 gash 1979 staelens et al 2008 among all these factors canopy structure is always identified as the most important influential factor in most rainfall interception models deguchi et al 2006 canopy structure may be altered by changes in tree species composition gap fraction leaf spatial distribution and temporal changes in foliage amounts franklin et al 2002 he et al 2014 within forests more attention has been paid to the influence of tree species composition on interception loss which tended to be higher in coniferous forests than in broad leaved forests carlyle moses and gash 2011 moreover most of these studies have only included measurements from the leafed growing season price and carlyle moses 2003 and relatively little work has sought to investigate the effects of seasonal changes on the foliage amount i e both leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons on interception loss deguchi et al 2006 additionally interception loss within deciduous trees is more affected by seasonal changes in canopy structure than that within evergreen trees augusto et al 2002 interception loss models allow measurement results to be extrapolated in space and time and they also provide insight into the mechanisms of interception process rutter et al 1975 gash et al 1995 hence interception models are particularly needed by forest managers as a component of hydrological predication tools to accurately predict interception loss by different types of vegetation many interception loss models have been developed muzylo et al 2009 these models are largely based on either the rutter rutter et al 1971 1975 or gash gash 1979 gash et al 1995 models the original gash 1979 model is a simplified version of the rutter model features an empirical approach and requires fewer data however it overestimates interception loss for sparse forests since it predicts overall whole plot area evaporation rather than evaporation per canopy area gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 therefore gash et al 1995 revised the original model by introducing a canopy cover fraction the revised gash analytical model was more robust and provided more accurate estimates of interception loss for sparse forests carlyle moses and price 2007 deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2009 valente et al 1997 as it took into account forest sparseness and improved forest boundary conditions the revised gash model has been successfully applied to forests across different climatic conditions including temperate forests deguchi et al 2006 gash et al 1995 mediterranean forests limousin et al 2008 and tropical rainforests ghimire et al 2017 however to the knowledge of the authors only a few studies have tested the revised gash model in arid and semi arid forests dunkerley 2000 and this model has rarely been validated in arid and semi arid plantations e g motahari et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 the revised gash model has been applied less frequently in deciduous forests than in evergreen forests moreover modelling studies of deciduous forests have mostly been focused on measurements from the leafed growing season e g carlyle moses and price 1999 price and carlyle moses 2003 with only a few studies focusing on both the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons e g deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 the limited number of interception loss modelling studies in deciduous forests is possibly a consequence of difficulties in model application in this kind of forests to correctly apply the revised model separate parameterization and validation datasets are required for both the leafed and leafless seasons muzylo et al 2012 which will prolong the observation period extend from the leafed season to the leafless season and is also a time consuming and labour intensive process although interception loss takes a much lower fraction of gross rainfall in the leafless period than in the leafed period for deciduous forests it is still a critical component of the water balance e g deguchi et al 2006 šraj et al 2008 therefore to better understand the effects of deciduous canopies on water resources interception loss measurement or and modelling should be applied in both leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons two of the most commonly selected tree species for afforestation in the arid and semi arid regions of asia e g afghanistan iran pakistan iraq lebanon and china are roinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabuliformis e g guo et al 2008 jia et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2016 these two species were chosen due to their great tolerance to drought infertility and low high temperature as well as their superior growth compared with some native tree species ma et al 2014 vitkova et al 2017 however the phenological and morphological traits of these two species are distinct from each other r pseudoacacia is a broad leaved deciduous tree species with a narrow crown and smooth bark while p tabuliformis is a needle leaved evergreen tree species with a flat topped crown and rough bark furthermore these two species are also significantly different in canopy thickness branching architecture and leaf shedding patterns all of which will be differentially affected by rainfall and other climate variables e g wind and solar radiation and lead to distinct rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and canopy interception patterns e g carlyle moses and gash 2011 park and cameron 2008 hence quantification comparison and modelling studies of rainfall partitioning between these two species in arid and semi arid regions may benefit watershed and forest managers by providing valuable information about canopy hydrological processes however such a comparison and modelling study has rarely been reported jian et al 2015 therefore the objectives of this research are to i measure and compare interception loss throughfall and stemflow between afforested stands of r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis during different measurement periods e g annual leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons in the semi arid region of china ii calibrate and validate the revised gash analytical model for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis forest stands during the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons and iii explore the underlying causes of differences in interception loss between the two forest stands an advantage of this study is that the two studied forests experienced similar climatic conditions during the experimental period potentially minimizing the effects of meteorological differences on interception loss and allowing comparison primarily due to structural differences 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted within the yeheshan watershed yhs 34 31 76 n 107 54 67 e in the provincial natural reserve of fufeng county in shaanxi province china fig 1 the yhs is in a hilly and gully region with an elevation ranging from 449 m to 1662 m above sea level and an area of 10 996 ha forest covers approximately 90 of the watershed and is made up of a mosaic of pure stands of different tree varieties including both coniferous and broad leaved species r pseudoacacia is the dominant tree species in this region and accounts for approximately 75 of the canopy trees p tabuliformis is the second most abundant species constituting approximately 15 of the canopy trees the other tree species platycladus orientalis populus davidiana quercus wutaishansea and quercus variabili are usually found as individual trees or in small groups the yhs experiences a semi arid continental climate characterized by a hot humid summer june august and cold dry winter december february based on climate data 1958 2016 from the fufeng bureau of meteorology the nearest meteorology station to yhs 10 km the average annual precipitation is 580 mm sd 139 mm and the average annual temperature is 12 7 c sd 0 6 c with an absolute maximum of 42 2 c in june and an absolute minimum of 21 2 c in january precipitation mainly occurs during the leafed growing season may october and has a large inter annual variation with a variation coefficient of 0 3 the average annual reference evapotranspiration was 1217 mm which was calculated as the product of pan evaporation and the pan coefficient depending on the average annual wind speed 1 5 m s 1 and relative humidity 72 over the study region the pan coefficient was set to 0 80 fao 1998 the dominant wind direction varies seasonally with southeast winds in the growing season and northwest winds in the dormant season november april two representative experimental plots 50 50 m2 were established in the adjacent r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis woodlands approximately 200 m apart from each other the two plots are located on a relatively flat slope 5 10 underlain by deep silt loam soil over 50 m deep the deciduous r pseudoacacia stand was established in 2002 with a dense understory of stipa bungeana artemisia sacrorum and artemisia scoparia the evergreen p tabuliformis stand was established in 2000 with a sparse understory of grass species the r pseudoacacia stand had a stem density of 2000 tree ha 1 a mean diameter at breast height dbh 1 3 m of 11 cm and a mean tree height of 9 6 m in 2016 while the corresponding values for the p tabuliformis stand were 1200 tree ha 1 15 cm and 7 2 m respectively the leaf area index lai was estimated using digital hemispherical photography and can eye software version 6 3 baret and weiss 2004 hemispherical photographs were taken with a nikon d100 equipped with a 4 5 mm sigma circular fisheye lens for the best representation of canopy gap fraction 12 photos were taken within each stand 6 taken between tree rows and another 6 within trees rows and the camera was oriented carefully such that the edge of the image was perpendicular to the tree row in each stand hemispherical photographs were then processed according to the can eye tutorial document baret and weiss 2004 the average lai value of r pseudoacacia was 2 40 m2 m 2 during the growing season including leaf burst and senescence may october and 0 41 m2 m 2 during the dormant season wood area index november april the average lai value of p tabuliformis was 2 55 m2 m 2 and 2 50 m2 m 2 for the growing and dormant seasons respectively indicating small seasonal variations details of other forest structural features of the study plots are summarized in table 1 2 2 measurements of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements at the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis plots were conducted from 1 january 2016 until 31 december 2016 gross rainfall pg mm was measured for each study plot with a weighing bucket rain gauge t 200b geonor eiksmarka norway connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa and one manual rain gauge 30 cm diameter in a nearby clearing 30 m away the manual gauges were used to check the weighing gauge and were read immediately after each rainfall event a rain event was defined as a period with more than 0 2 mm of the total pg separated by at least 6 h without rain field observations with the leaf wetness sensor 237l campbell scientific logan ut usa at each forest stand confirmed that the time interval was sufficient for residual rainwater to evaporate from the tree crown in this climate throughfall tf mm was measured under the canopy with 30 rain gauges identical to the manual pg rain gauge in each study plot to overcome the spatial variability of tf rain gauges were installed randomly along three 30 m long transects 10 m apart underneath the canopy with an average distance of 2 5 m between neighbouring gauges the average tf can be accurately estimated using a combination of stationary and manual roving gauges to provide representative samples crockford and richardson 2000 holwerda et al 2012 ritter and regalado 2014 therefore two thirds of the rain gauges were relocated to new random positions after every three rainfall events to avoid ground splash effects the orifices of all rain gauges were placed approximately 1 m above the ground stemflow sf mm was measured on thirteen representative trees at each study plot the sf was sampled using spiral type sf collars constructed from plastic hoses each sf collar was attached to the stems and sealed in an upward spiral pattern with silicon sealant to divert rain water into a sf collector the measured data were then scaled to the unit ground area by the average basal area per unit ground area for each study plot therefore interception loss i mm was calculated as the difference between pg and the sum of tf and sf 2 3 meteorological measurements meteorological variables were measured by an automatic weather station mounted on a 13 metre high tower 2 m above the black locust canopy located at the centre of the r pseudoacacia woodland relative humidity and air temperature were measured with an hmp155a vaisala finland type thermohydrometer net radiation was measured using a 4 component radiometer cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands wind speed was measured with a 3 d sonic anemometers thermometer cast3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa close to the station two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux thermal sensors the netherlands were installed 5 cm below the ground surface meteorological data were automatically sampled at 10 s intervals and recorded at 10 min intervals by using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa as the two study plots were close to each other 200 m apart the recorded meteorological variables were considered to be the same for the two study plots 2 4 revised gash analytical model the revised gash analytical model gash et al 1995 was used to model interception loss at the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis plots the model operates under the assumption that pg is intercepted as a series of individual rainfall events with enough time to completely dry the canopy and trunk between two successive events each rainfall event can be distinguished by three sequential phases i a wetting up phase during which pg is less than the threshold value required to saturate the canopy pg mm ii a saturation phase during which the canopy achieves and maintains a saturation state when rainfall intensity r mm h 1 exceeds the mean wet canopy evaporation rate e mm h 1 of the saturated canopy and iii a drying phase after rainfall has ceased interception losses through evaporation take place during each phase and the total interception loss for a particular event is obtained as the sum of different components to calculate interception loss the revised analytical model requires two types of data canopy parameters and atmospheric variables the required canopy parameters are the free throughfall coefficient ρ here assumed to be one minus canopy cover fraction c the canopy storage capacity s the trunk storage capacity st and the rainfall fraction diverted into sf pt the required atmospheric variables are pg e and r during each rainfall event the amounts of rainwater required to entirely saturate the canopy pg and trunk pt are calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 2 p t s t p t where e c is the mean evaporation rate from the saturated canopy during a rainfall event and is defined as e c e c sc is the canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover and is calculated as sc s c the revised analytical model divides interception loss into five components and the equation used to calculate each component is presented in table 2 2 5 estimation of model parameters following wallace and mcjannet 2008 s for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands were obtained as the negative intercept of the regression of pg against the sum of tf and sf the free throughfall coefficient ρreg was estimated in accordance with jackson 1975 as the slope of the linear regression between pg and tf for small rainfall that was too small to saturate the canopy an alternative method to estimate this parameter ρlai was also applied during the growing and dormant seasons using hemispherical photographs taken by a nikon d100 digital camera with a fish eye lens baret and weiss 2004 muzylo et al 2012 and processed using can eye software version 6 3 to achieve this goal 12 photos were taken within each stand and the camera was oriented carefully such that the edge of the image was perpendicular to the tree row in each stand macfarlane et al 2007 all photos were taken each month on cloudy days or at dusk under uniform sky conditions the rainfall fraction diverted to the trunks pt and the trunk storage capacity st were estimated by the method of gash and morton 1978 as the slope and the negative intercept of the linear regression between pg and sf e was estimated using three approaches first the evaporation rate was estimated using the penman monteith equation hereafter referred to as e pm assuming a canopy conductance of zero gash et al 1995 shi et al 2010 3 e pm δ r n g ρ a c p d g a λ δ γ where is the slope of the curve relating the saturation vapor pressure to temperature kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air j kg 1 k 1 d is the vapor pressure deficit kpa λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water kpa k 1 γ is the psychometric constant j kg 1 and g a is the aerodynamic conductance m s 1 which is calculated using the method provided by gash et al 1995 4 g a k 2 u ln z d z 0 2 where k is von karman s constant 0 41 u m s 1 is the wind speed z is the height at which wind speed was measured m d is the zero plane displacement height m here assumed to be 0 7 h and z0 is the roughness length for momentum m here assumed to be 0 1 h second the mean evaporation rate e tf was derived from the value of e r as estimated from the linear regression relationship between pg and interception loss gash 1979 third the mean evaporation rate e opt was estimated through optimization of e r by minimizing the root mean square error between the simulated and observed interception loss for all rainfall events marquardt 1963 to investigate the effects of seasonal changes in structural parameters on interception loss all parameters were estimated separately for two vegetation periods 1 the leafed growing season may october and 2 the leafless dormant season november april the periods were determined according to the phenological measurements and lai data of the r pseudoacacia stand 2 6 sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the parameters in the revised analytical model sensitivity analyses were performed separately for the leafed growing season and leafless dormant season in this analysis parameters s c e r pt and st were considered their values were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values and the simulated results were compared to their field data 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the mean relative error between four rainfall measurements among the two forest sites was 3 1 which indicates that pg over the study area did not vary considerably and the mean value was thus used as pg in this study during the study period the total measured rainfall was 510 mm generated by 78 discrete rainfall events with 464 8 mm 91 1 and 45 2 mm 8 9 occurring during the leafed growing season and leafless dormant season respectively however the frequency distribution of the event size duration and intensity were similar between the growing and dormant seasons fig 2 generally smaller events 5 mm were more frequent but contributed a lower percentage of total gross rainfall than larger events especially during the dormant season and vice versa fig 2a rainfall duration distribution was less positively skewed fig 2b with events in shorter 2h or longer 20 h duration ranges corresponding to a lower event frequency 11 5 and 5 1 respectively in contrast to rainfall duration the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was highly positively skewed fig 2c suggesting that low intensity rainfall 0 5 mm h 1 had a higher frequency of occurrence than high intensity rainfall 5 mm h 1 however rainfall events with low intensity contributed a lower percentage of gross rainfall than high intensity rainfall statistical analysis indicated that the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity between growing and dormant seasons was not significant p 0 064 except for low intensity events 0 5 mm h 1 a significant difference p 0 01 was detected 3 2 rainfall partitioning the cumulative annual tf was 413 6 mm for the r pseudoacacia stand and 384 6 mm for the p tabuliformis stand which accounted for 81 1 and 75 4 of pg respectively table 3 the mean standard errors se of the mean tf for average individual rainfall events were 10 3 and 7 6 for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively the total tf for r pseudoacacia in the growing and dormant seasons was 373 4 mm 80 3 of corresponding rainfall p and 40 2 mm 89 of p respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 350 2 mm 75 3 of p and 34 4 mm 76 1 of p the cumulative annual sf was larger in the r pseudoacacia stand 1 3 of pg than in the p tabuliformis stand 0 7 of pg the calculated mean se values of sf were much higher 18 5 for r pseudoacacia and 26 3 for p tabuliformis in the r pseudoacacia stand the cumulative sf was 6 0 mm 1 35 of p and 0 8 mm 1 8 of p for the growing and dormant seasons respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 3 3 mm 0 7 of p and 0 3 mm 0 7 of p interception loss was derived by subtracting the measured tf and sf from pg during the study period the estimated interception loss was larger in the p tabuliformis stand 23 9 of pg than in the r pseudoacacia stand 17 6 of pg the mean se values of interception loss which was estimated as the root sum of the variances of tf and sf were 9 9 for r pseudoacacia and 15 6 for p tabuliformis in the r pseudoacacia stand the estimated interception loss during the growing season 85 4 mm was much larger than that in the dormant season 4 2 mm representing 18 4 and 9 2 respectively of the corresponding rainfall p in the p tabuliformis stand the growing season interception loss was 111 3 mm vs 10 5 mm for the dormant season representing 23 9 and 23 2 of p respectively 3 3 model parameterization the total number of rainfall events measured at the two forest sites during the growing season may october and dormant season november april of 2016 were each divided into two subsets i e dataset 1 n 35 in the growing season and dataset 1 n 11 in the dormant season for model calibration and dataset 2 n 25 and dataset 2 n 7 in the growing and dormant seasons respectively for model validation to account for seasonal variation in rainfall intensity the data from june august and october in dataset 1 and from november december february and march in dataset 1 were used for model calibration the data from may july and september in dataset 2 and january and from april in dataset 2 were used for model validation total gross rainfall for dataset 1 and dataset 1 was 267 9 mm and 28 1 mm respectively the corresponding values for dataset 2 and dataset 2 were 196 9 mm and 17 1 mm the values for canopy parameters to be used in the revised gash analytical model were obtained from the calibration datasets dataset 1 and dataset 1 which ensured an independent validation the mean canopy parameters during the growing and dormant seasons for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands are presented in table 4 the free throughfall coefficients ρ estimated from the fisheye photographs ρlai and from regression fitting ρreg were similar to each other with no significant differences p greater than 0 05 for both forest sites fig 3 and table 4 in the r pseudoacacia stand the ρ values were significantly p 0 001 higher in the dormant season than in the growing season while in the p tabuliformis stand there were no significant differences p 0 302 in ρ between the two study seasons for modelling purpose the mean value of ρlai and ρreg was used to estimate the canopy cover c table 4 in the r pseudoacacia stand the canopy storage capacity s was 1 34 mm in the growing season nearly seven times higher than that in the dormant season 0 20 mm while in the p tabuliformis stand s was slightly higher in the growing season 1 43 mm than in the dormant season 1 38 mm fig 3c and 3d the trunk storage capacity st was higher in the growing season 0 074 mm than in the dormant season 0 052 mm for r pseudoacacia while the values 0 041 mm were similar in the two seasons for p tabuliformis fig 3e and 3f similar results were found for the threshold rainfall to entirely saturate the canopy pg and the trunk pg in the growing season pg 1 97 mm for r pseudoacacia and 2 52 mm for p tabuliformis pg 5 69 mm for r pseudoacacia and 5 86 mm for p tabuliformis and the dormant season pg 1 05 mm for r pseudoacacia and 2 49 mm for p tabuliformis pg 3 06 mm for r pseudoacacia and 5 86 mm for p tabuliformis table 4 for the fraction of rainfall contributing to stemflow pt the estimated values 0 007 were similar between the two seasons for p tabuliformis while this value was higher in the dormant season 0 017 than in the growing season 0 013 for r pseudoacacia fig 3 3 4 model results measured and simulated total interception loss using different evaporate rates for the calibration dataset dataset 1 from r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands during the growing season are summarized in table 5 and presented in fig 4 generally simulated interception loss was underestimated to different extents for the two forest sites and the underestimation was larger in the r pseudoacacia stand than in the p tabuliformis stand the predicted interception loss using e pm values was underestimated by 18 9 in the growing season for r pseudoacacia the corresponding value for p tabuliformis was 16 3 the simulated interception loss using e tf was closer to the measured values with an underestimation of 5 4 and 4 5 respectively for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands table 5 the predicted interception loss using e opt agreed well with the measured values for both forest sites resulting in an underestimation ranging from 2 6 for the r pseudoacacia stand to 2 3 for the p tabuliformis stand table 5 and fig 4 in total the performance of the revised analytical gash model greatly improved through the usage of e opt with the relative error decreasing from 18 9 to 2 3 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient increasing from 0 64 to 0 93 table 5 the performance of the model was validated using evaporation rates e tf and e opt and the estimated canopy parameters from the calibration datasets dataset 1 the simulated interception losses using e tf and e opt for the validation datasets dataset 2 from the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands were also in good agreement with the field measurements with relative errors of 7 6 and nash sutcliffe coefficients above 0 74 for both forest stands table 5 and fig 4 the observed and simulated interception loss using different evaporation rates during the dormant season for calibration dataset dataset 1 are presented in table 6 and fig 5 the model run with e pm was largely underestimated for the two forest sites with an underestimation of 21 7 and 18 3 for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively a much better fit between simulated and measured interception losses was obtained using e tf with a model efficiency greater than 0 78 for all forest sites however the model underestimated the interception loss by 8 7 for r pseudoacacia which was larger than the underestimation of 5 0 for p tabuliformis the performance of the revised gash model using e opt was slightly better than that of the model using e tf for both forest sites resulting in an underestimation of only 4 3 and 3 3 for r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis respectively use of the optimized canopy evaporation rate improved the model efficiency for both plantations during the dormant season with improvements of the nash sutcliffe coefficient from 0 56 to 0 84 for r pseudoacacia and from 0 60 to 0 87 for p tabuliformis using e opt the simulated interception loss was also in very good agreement with the measured values for both plantations for the validation dataset dataset 2 with underestimations of only 5 and 4 6 respectively table 6 and fig 5 similar to the results obtained by using e opt the predicted total interception loss for the validation datasets also agreed well with those derived from the throughfall and stemflow measurements with a relative error 6 8 and modelling efficiency greater than 0 72 table 6 and fig 5 table 7 summarizes different interception components predicted by the revised analytical gash model using e opt the results revealed that most of the interception loss occurred in the stage of after rainfall had ceased in the growing season for both forest sites 41 2 for r pseudoacacia and 42 5 for p tabuliformis table 7 the second largest term occurred in the stage of during saturated rainfall conditions with the p tabuliformis stand exhibiting a slightly greater loss of this kind 40 1 than r pseudoacacia 37 5 the contribution of small rainfall to the total evaporation loss was also larger 9 2 for r pseudoacacia and 8 4 for p tabuliformis whereas evaporation losses during canopy wetting for r pseudoacacia and from the trunks for p tabuliformis were minor 6 in the dormant season the simulation suggested that 39 3 and 30 of total interception occurred in the stages of during saturated rainfall conditions and after rainfall had ceased respectively for the r pseudoacacia stand the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 18 and 60 evaporation losses from small rainfall events also played a larger role in total evaporation loss for both forest sites 12 for r pseudoacacia and 12 7 for p tabuliformis while evaporation loss from trunks was minor 10 3 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the canopy and climatic variables to interception loss is presented in fig 6 generally the results indicated that the revised analytical gash model was highly sensitive to variations in the canopy parameter s and the climatic variable e r for both forest sites a decrease of 50 in s resulted in a decrease of 24 3 and 9 0 in simulated interception loss for the r pseudoacacia stand during the growing and dormant seasons respectively fig 6a b for the p tabuliformis stand a 50 decrease of s reduced the predicted interception loss by 23 6 for the growing season and 29 2 for the dormant season fig 6c d a decrease in e r of 50 reduced the simulated interception loss by 16 6 and 31 6 for r pseudoacacia during the growing and dormant seasons respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis stand were 21 3 and 16 8 the revised analytical model was less sensitive to the canopy parameter c and trunk parameter pt fig 6 a decrease in c of 50 resulted in a 4 5 and 6 5 decrease in interception loss for the growing and dormant seasons respectively in the r pseudoacacia stand for the p tabuliformis stand the corresponding values were 7 0 and 6 2 likewise a 50 decrease in pt reduced interception loss by 2 7 in the growing season and 9 2 in the dormant season for r pseudoacacia the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 2 3 and 2 1 the revised analytical model was fairly insensitive to the trunk parameter st for both forest sites fig 6 a decrease of 50 in st resulted in a decrease of 1 6 and 3 8 in interception loss for the growing and dormant seasons respectively in the r pseudoacacia stand whereas a similar decrease in st in the p tabuliformis stand only reduced the interception loss by 0 2 4 discussion 4 1 interception throughfall and stemflow the interception loss in this study for the r pseudoacacia stand 17 6 of pg was similar to the value 20 of pg reported by sadeghi et al 2016 but much higher than the value 8 6 of pg observed by wang et al 2013 the reason for this large difference between our study and that of wang et al 2013 is likely caused by the lower rainfall intensity r 1 83 mm h 1 and higher evaporation rates e 0 18 mm h 1 during rainfall in the study area compared to that in the central loess plateau where most rainfall events are short and intense r 2 82 mm h 1 and evaporation rates are lower e 0 11 mm h 1 wang et al 2013 the measured interception loss for the p tabuliformis stand 23 9 of pg was slightly higher than the values already reported for other pine forests with a low stem density such as 22 9 in a pinus elliottii and pinus caribaea plantation reported by fan et al 2014 22 3 in a mature pine forest reported by bryant et al 2005 19 2 in a pinus pseudostrobus forest reported by silva et al 2001 16 5 in a planted pinus roxburghii forest reported by ghimire et al 2012 and 14 2 in a pure and natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 it is possible that the higher interception loss was due to the higher tree density lai and canopy cover in our study which may have resulted in a higher e during rainfall gash et al 1995 šraj et al 2008 overall the observed interception loss was higher in p tabuliformis than in r pseudoacacia which is expected as interception loss tends to be higher in evergreen coniferous forests than in broad leafed deciduous forests fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2016 and these findings are in good agreement with previous work synthesizing interception loss studies carlyle moses and gash 2011 since the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the higher interception loss observed for the p tabuliformis stand thus can be largely explained by its higher s and e during rainfall table 4 the interception loss percentage was significantly higher during the leafed period 18 4 than the leafless period 9 2 for deciduous r pseudoacacia which agrees well with findings for other deciduous forests deguchi et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 park et al 2000 the decreased interception loss increased net precipitation received at the soil surface in the leafless season may depend on the reduction in leaf amounts and canopy cover table 4 as shown in the positive relationship between the leaf area index and interception loss that has already been reported elsewhere e g between seasons deguchi et al 2006 park et al 2000 by thinning molina and del campo 2012 shinohara et al 2015 by beetle infestation bearup et al 2014 increased net precipitation during the leafless dormant season will increase the soil water content in the unsaturated soil zone which could increase tree growth during the next leafed growing season for example worbes 1999 reported that the precipitation amount during the dormant season has a close relationship with tree diameter growth during the growing season for deciduous forests hence in water limited regions e g arid and semi arid regions where water resource availability may have a substantial impact on forest growing forest managers are highly recommended to implement hydrology oriented silviculture e g reduce leaf amount and cover to reduce stand interception loss and transpiration and at the tree level to improve growth and water use efficiency the observed throughfall tf percentage of the r pseudoacacia stand 81 1 of pg was much lower than that previously reported for other r pseudoacacia forests with a low basal area in the central loess plateau e g 89 1 of pg reported by wang et al 2013 likewise the tf for the p tabuliformis stand 75 4 of pg was also much lower than the amounts reported in other pine forests with a low basal area e g 85 in a natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 and 83 8 in a thinned pinus halepensis forest reported by molina and del campo 2012 but it was comparable to the values 78 3 of pg reported by fan et al 2014 in a pine plantation with a similar basal area this result indicates that the lower tf fraction may possibly be explained by the relatively high basal area in the two forest stands since the basal area was similar between the two forests the lower tf fraction in p tabuliformis relative to r pseudoacacia may well have been caused by their thicker crown depth and denser leaves the thicker crown depth and denser leaves likely increased the length of interaction between raindrops and the crown surface resulting in more rainwater retention and a reduced tf fraction park and cameron 2008 sadeghi et al 2016 in this study the observed stemflow percentage of r pseudoacacia 1 3 of the gross rainfall was obviously higher than that of p tabuliformis 0 7 of the gross rainfall p greater than 0 05 the steeply angled branches and smooth bark of r pseudoacacia would favourably channel rainwater to sf compared with the low angled branches and rough bark of p tabuliformis thus potentially generating a higher sf for r pseudoacacia fan et al 2014 the measured sf for p tabuliformis 0 7 of pg was comparable to those observed for other pine forest with a similar basal area e g 0 9 of pg in a natural pinus armandii forest reported by shi et al 2010 and 1 of pg in a pinus elliottii and pinus caribaea plantation reported by fan et al 2014 but it was slightly lower than the observations 1 5 of pg in a natural pinus halepensis forest with a high basal area reported by molina and del campo 2012 this finding may indicate that the lower sf can be explained by the lower basal area in our forest stand concerning deciduous r pseudoacacia the measured sf was slightly higher in the leafless dormant season 1 8 of pg than in the leafed growing season 1 3 of pg which is in good agreement with reported findings for other deciduous forests herbst et al 2008 muzylo et al 2012 staelens et al 2008 the increased sf in the leafless dormant season relative to the leafed growing season was likely caused by the reduction in leaf amounts and the low evaporation rates during rainfall table 3 and 4 as previously reported by herbst et al 2008 and andre et al 2008 4 2 wet canopy evaporation the average annual wet canopy evaporation rates e pm calculated using the penman monteith equation were 0 05 mm h 1 0 05 mm h 1 in growing season 0 04 mm h 1 in dormant season and 0 04 mm h 1 0 06 mm h 1 in growing season 0 03 mm h 1 in dormant season for the r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands respectively falling within the range of estimates for other temperate forests 0 02 1 11 mm h 1 herbst et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 shinohara et al 2015 estimates e tf based on the regression method were scaled to the canopy cover fraction to allow a direct comparison with e pm and provided average annual values of 0 25 mm h 1 and 0 26 mm h 1 for the r pseudoacacia stand 0 25 mm h 1 for both the growing and dormant seasons and the p tabuliformis stand 0 38 mm h 1 in the growing season 0 15 mm h 1 in the dormant season which were approximately six r pseudoacacia and four p tabuliformis times higher than the corresponding values of e pm the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates e opt were very close to the e tf values table 4 but they were much lower than the optimized values in sub tropical forests ghimire et al 2017 fan et al 2014 wallace and mcjannet 2008 significant differences between e pm and e tf as in this study have also been reported in other interception modelling studies ghimire et al 2012 2017 muzylo et al 2012 wallace and mcjannet 2008 and the possible reasons for this larger discrepancy are discussed below first the penman moentich equation considers vegetation as a single big leaf which may no longer be valid for the tall and sparse forests because their complicated vertical structure tends to enhance eddy turbulence and evaporation holwerda et al 2012 second the zero plane displacement heights and roughness heights used to calculate the aerodynamic conductance g a in the penman monteith equation can be questionable and may tend to underestimate g a and thus e pm when applied in areas with a rugged topography like this study area ghimire et al 2012 holwerda et al 2012 finally the larger discrepancy between e pm and e tf can also be caused by the evaporation of small splashed rainfall droplets murakami 2007 the possible existence of a larger scale biotic pump of atmospheric moisture makarieve and gorshkov 2007 and the difficulty associated with accurately measuring the very high relative humidity levels during rainfall wallance and mcjannet 2008 4 3 canopy parameters the average canopy storage capacity s was significantly higher in the growing season 1 34 mm than the dormant season 0 2 mm for r pseudoacacia which agrees well with the findings for other temperate forests fathizadeh et al 2018 herbst et al 2008 muzylo et al 2012 the s values for p tabuliformis were similar between the growing season 1 43 mm and the dormant season 1 38 mm falling within the range reported in other pine forests 0 5 3 0 mm llorens and gallart 2000 since the local climate and basal area were similar between the two forest stands the differences in s could thus be attributed to the differences in canopy structure however it is difficult to draw a generalization for s because it is controlled by many factors such as rainfall characteristics e g raindrop size distribution and intensity climate conditions e g wind speed canopy traits e g basal area height and wood area index and measurement errors carlyle moses and gash 2011 the free throughfall coefficient a structure parameter assumed to be one minus the canopy cover c is a sensitive parameter for modelling interception loss and it is also an important parameter that is usually considered in forest water resource management in this study the measured average annual free throughfall coefficient was 0 52 for the r pseudoacacia stand and 0 38 for the p tabuliformis stand indicating that the canopy interception fraction in p tabuliformis was higher than that in r pseudoacacia hydrologically the free throughfall coefficient has an important effect on soil water content and nutrient cycling as it reflects the fraction of rainfall passes through the canopy without contacting the canopy surface and removing dry deposition in the canopy asadian 2007 thus the lower and higher s values in the p tabuliformis stand could result in less throughfall reaching the forest floor and hence show a potential to enhance soil water scarcity in this arid semi arid region undergoing re afforestation in contrast the lower and higher s values can protect the forest floor from raindrop splash erosion and delay the peaks in storm runoff asadian 2007 therefore the free throughfall coefficient and canopy storage capacity should be considered when selecting trees for re afforestation where soil erosion is serious the measured sf was relatively low in comparison to other rainfall fractions for the two forest stands table 3 introducing a risk in making comparisons of the sf related parameters st and pt with other studies the observed average annual value of pt for r pseudoacacia 0 015 was much lower than the only reported value of 0 032 by wang et al 2013 but the value for p tabuliformis 0 007 was comparable to that reported for other pine forests with a similar basal area 0 009 0 014 fan et al 2014 shi et al 2010 in this study the observed mean value of st was slightly higher in the r pseudoacacia stand 0 063 than in the p tabuliformis stand 0 041 which is in good agreement with the much higher trunk and longer branches of r pseudoacacia than of p tabuliformis potentially counteracting the effect of the rougher bark of p tabuliformis 4 4 performance of the revised analytical model the revised gash analytical model of rainfall interception satisfactorily estimated the total interception loss in both r pseudoacacia and p tabuliformis stands tables 5 and 6 and it also captured well the seasonal growing and dormant seasons variation in terms of modelling error the revised model performed better for p tabuliformis than for r pseudoacacia and the modelling errors between observed and simulated interception loss were acceptable compared to the reports in other temperate forest interception modelling studies e g deguchi et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2018 herbst et al 2006 2008 muzylo et al 2012 in the present study the model slightly overestimated interception loss for some smaller rainfall events while the interception loss for larger rainfall events tended to be underestimated the modelling errors resulting from an underestimation of most large rainfall events were considered to be responsible for the underestimation of the total interception loss as reported previously fathizadeh et al 2018 shi et al 2010 therefore careful attention should be paid when applying this revised model to changing rainfall conditions towards larger rainfall sizes sadeghi et al 2015 the derived nash sutcliffe model efficiency for the revised model was higher in the p tabuliformis stand 0 6 0 93 than in the r pseudoacacia stand 0 56 0 90 and it was comparable to previous findings in other temperate rainfall interception studies generally ranging from 0 44 to 0 94 bryant et al 2005 fan et al 2014 in this study the use of e opt greatly improved the overall model performance compared with the use of e pm but e opt provided little improvement effect on the overall model performance compared with e tf table 5 and table 6 the application of different parameterization sets to shorter time periods e g seasonal or monthly for modelling interception loss is necessary because many model parameters e g canopy storage capacity canopy cover and evaporation rate change with varying canopy structures and shifting climatic conditions deguchi et al 2006 herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 moreover using constant parameter values for annual interception modelling could lead to significant under or over estimations therefore to avoid these problems monthly or seasonal parameter values have been recommended for use in interception loss modelling murakami et al 2007 muzylo et al 2012 in this study the revised analytical model was therefore run separately for the leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons compared with the growing season the underestimation of interception loss in the dormant season was much higher by the revised gash analytical model table 5 and table 6 the higher underestimation of interception loss in the dormant season was probably introduced by the underestimation of rainfall intensity table 4 when small rainfall events occur more frequently fig 2 and more actual evaporation is supposed to occur previous studies have demonstrated that the revised analytical model better estimates rainfall events when interception loss is dependent on s which means that for rainfall events sufficiently large to saturate s e r has more control over interception loss which could lead to greater bias between modelled and measured values fathizadeh et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 in the present study the measurements indicated that the s value was lower in the dormant season than in the growing season table 4 and there were more rainfall events that were sufficiently large to saturate the canopy during the dormant season fig 2 therefore accordingly interception loss was influenced more by e r and less controlled by s in the dormant season and thus a much greater underestimation of interception loss can be expected meteorological records based on high density gauge observations have indicated that precipitation has shifted towards fewer and higher rainfall events over most area of the study region sun et al 2015 therefore if the future climate in the semi arid area shifts towards a frequency of few and intense rainfall events then use of the revised analytical model for interception loss modelling can be more appropriate for the p tabuliformis forest than for the r pseudoacacia forest in terms of model efficiency tables 5 and 6 for other arid and semi arid afforestation sites with different climatic condition and tree species application of the revised gash model may have different canopy and rainfall characteristics to be considered 5 conclusion rainfall interception losses were quantified and modelled for a deciduous broad leafed r pseudoacacia stand and an evergreen needle leaf p tabuliformis stand situated in the semi arid loess plateau of china over the one year january december 2016 study period the measured throughfall stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for r pseudoacacia were 81 1 1 3 and 17 6 respectively the corresponding values for p tabuliformis were 75 4 0 7 and 23 9 given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar the observed higher interception loss for p tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rates of this species the revised analytical model was well calibrated and validated against the field measurements and it was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately and effectively capture the seasonal variations leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons provided that the gross rainfall throughfall regression method based wet canopy evaporation rate and the optimized wet canopy evaporation rate were used analysis of the magnitude of the different interception components distinguished by the model revealed that most of the total interception loss occurred from canopies in the stages of during saturated rainfall conditions and after rainfall had ceased small rainfall events played a larger role in total interception loss while interception loss from trunks was minor the revised model was highly sensitive to canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover but it was found to be fairly insensitive to trunk storage capacity as interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from soil moisture transpiration surface and groundwater recharge quantification and modelling tools of interception loss are of significant importance to semi arid regions undergoing re afforestation because the measurements and modelling measures allow water resources and forest managers to efficiently predict the effects of re afforestation on water inputs under a future shifting climate declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china no

6234,in this present study a novel approach is introduced for accurate prediction of the incipient motion of uniform grain particles in sand and gravel bedded open channels under unidirectional flow by improving sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool is based on sugeno fis consequent part of the anfis tool is limited to either as a constant or a linear function this means that not only a non linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions at the same time anfis tool optimizes antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters constant or linear functions by utilizing neural and least square methods respectively in this study a novel hybrid model named as geno fuzzy inference system genofis is introduced by integrating improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas that refer to where the antecedent fuzzy sets and consequent constant linear and non linear functions parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms gas tool a quantitative comparison is implemented between the anfis and genofis models using root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce as evaluation criteria by using three different types of incipient motion of sediment measurements that exist in the literature as reference

introduction 1 1 incipient motion and sediment transport overview following an important increase in the volume of flow pressing against stationary sediment particles at a given level which particles cannot possibly sustain undergoing pressure acting upon them caused by the hydrodynamic forces drag force and lift force suddenly dislocation will happen and movement will initiate buffington and montgomery 1997 andrews 1994 the instantaneous changes from a no motion state to initiation of sediment motion is defined as the threshold of initial motion or threshold of incipient motion which refers to the earliest stage of sediment transport the study of the incipient motion of sediment transport is very crucial in various areas such as channel design river morphology and restoration pollutant transport sediment mobility and their transport etc paphitis 2001 ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 the sediment transport is extremely related to the bed surface morphology grain particle size protrusion to the flow and packing orders fenton and abbott 1977 giménez curto and corniero 2009 most notably the recurring behavioural aspect of turbulence in near bed flow sutherland 1967 dey et al 2012 fig 1 a illustrates a description of a bed grain particle that is targeted at the incipience of sediment entrainment by hydraulically rough wall shear flow conditions the catalyst forces for the grain particle transport are the lift force fl and drag force fd elseways the force brings the stabilizing condition to the particle is the submerged weight fg of the actual particle the targeted bed particle can be possibly under these following entrainment modes rolling sliding and lifting fig 1b fig 1c and fig 1d illustrate all those transport modes the first mode of entrainment is rolling and is depicted in fig 1b it happens when the destabilizing moment md around the pivoting point exceeds the stabilizing moment ms around the same point ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 elseways fig 1c illustrates the sliding mode where the drag force fd surpasses the frictional resistance fr at the contact points moreover in lifting mode fig 1d the lift force fl surpasses the submerged weight fg of the grain particle hence all entrainment modes of a grain particle entrainment are as follows dey and ali 2018 1a r o l l i n g m o d e m d m s f d l v f l l h f g l h 1b s l i

kfr tanø if ø is the internal friction angle the equal sign presented in eq 1 for a specific grain particle entrainment mode represents the incipience of entrainment mode conditions whilst the greater than sign means a transport or entrainment mode elhakeem et al 2017 in order to measure the incipient motion of sediment transport accurately some dimensionless variables and functions of the two phase phenomenon are used the two phase phenomenon is herein defined by the fluid cohesionless granular medium and flow characteristics such as density ρ viscosity µ density of the granular material ρs diameter of the granular material d average depth of flow h slope j and force of gravity g yalin 1977 according to yalin 1977 when defining the two phase motion it should always be preferred to use the shear velocity u and specific density ρs rather than using the slope j and force of gravity g in addition basic quantities can be defined as characteristic parameters that have independent dimensions the procedure to transform the characteristic parameters into dimensionless variables was defined by yalin 1977 as follows 2 x 1 a 1 α 1 a 2 β 1 a 3 γ 1 a 4 m 1 x 2 a 1 α 2 a 2 β 2 a 3 γ 2 a 5 m 2 xn a 1 α n a 2 β n a 3 γ n a n mn with n n 3 where a1 a2 a3 and an are n basic quantities of the set a i i 1 2 n these n basic quantities are combined with each one of the remaining n 3 power products x1 x2 xn formed by n characteristic parameters a i as shown by eq 1 as the dimensionless variables of the two phase phenomenon mj αj βj and γj must be selected so that each of the power products above eq 2 becomes dimensionless yalin 1977 in this present study the set ρ µ ρs υ d h u γs is considered for the two phase phenomenon in sediment transport furthermore selection of the parameters d ρ u which have independent dimensions as basic quantities is performed moreover the application of the procedure implied by eq 2 permits to determine the following 8 3 5 power products as the dimensionless variables of the two phase phenomenon in this study the incipient motion of sediment transport or shields entrainment function is defined by two dimensionless characteristic parameters this is because of data used in this study from previous researches that were defined by only two dimensionless characteristic parameters as follows 3 x 1 x c r d 1 ρ 1 u c r 1 μ 1 u c r d υ 4 x 2 y c r d 1 ρ 1 u c r 2 γ s 1 ρ u c r 2 γ s d where x1 and x2 in eqs 3 and 4 stand for shear reynolds number re and shield entrainment function ycr respectively d defines particle diameter ρ defines the fluid density u defines the bed shear velocity µ defines the fluid dynamic viscosity υ defines the fluid kinematic viscosity and γs defines particle specific weight for the calculation of re the roughness length is taken as d by considering uniform granular material otherwise nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness should be used 1 2 incipient motion modeling overview using purely theoretical reasoning it has been established that the initiation of sediment transport on a plane mobile bed is given by a certain condition that must be fulfilled by the dimensionless variables shear reynolds number xcr and shields entrainment function ycr yalin 1977 shields introduced to plot the experimental values ycr versus xcr with the intention of producing a curve determining the initiation of sediment transport for the first time shields 1936 thereafter in recent years some implicit and explicit mathematical approaches have been used to study the threshold of incipient motion of sediments shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 paphitis 2001 yalin and da silva 2001 cao et al 2006 kitsikoudis et al 2016 sipiliotis et al 2018 dey and ali 2018 due to the complexity and high variability in defining hydrodynamics of sediments defining the threshold of incipient motion of sediments under a natural environment also becomes very challenging shields 1936 komar and clemens 1986 paphitis 2001 vollmer and kleinhans 2007 elhakeem et al 2017 in order to overcome this challenge numerous empirical threshold curves representing the threshold critical condition for the incipient initial motion of sediments or shields entrainment function as discussed herein have been represented hjulstrom 1935 shields 1936 inman 1949 sundborg 1956 komar and clemens 1986 paphitis 2001 the most commonly used approach to defining the threshold of initiation of sediment transport up today is still regarded as the shields approach shields 1936 even though details from shields results remain extremely vague kennedy 1995 buffington 1999 this same fact was supported by shvidchenko and pender 2000 by showing how the vagueness persists in defining what actually constitutes the incipient of motion furthermore vanoni 2006 concluded that the different definitions given to the initiation of motion by different researchers highly generate a bias to the published data as it can be noted in previously several approaches to defining the initiation of motion for sediment transport have been undertaken shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 in the actual literature the incipience of sediment transport is commonly defined using three different approaches namely reference visual and competence based approaches buffington and montgomery 1997 buffington and montgomery 1998 buffington 1999 cao et al 2006 the critical shear stress defined using reference based approach is determined with either a zero or low reference entrainment rate extrapolated to from joined shear stress and bed sediment entrainment analysis ashworth and ferguson 1989 ashworth et al 1992 visual observation approach is direct but can carry high subjectivity depending on researcher s definition of how much sediment entrainment defines the incipience of sediment motion kramer 1935 neill and yalin 1969 yalin and karahan 1979 wilcock 1988 turowski et al 2011 schiereck 2017 the competence functions are highly linked to the size and efficiency of the sediment catch sample size presence of coarse sediment sizes and definitely fitting approach wilcock 1988 wathen et al 1995 even though all methods used to define the incipience of sediment transport carry methodological bias that can be the cause of subjectivities and inappropriateness while deciding which research method is the best while defining the shields entrainment function value ycr none of these research methods used to define the incipience of sediment motion is considered superior buffington and montgomery 1997 dey and ali 2018 each and every research method has relatively its weakness and strength yet every method is more competitive in a particular case than others carson and griffiths 1985 for instance since competence and reference based values of ycr are computed from bedload entrainment estimations they can be accepted as the best research approaches that can be used to compute bedload transport following the bed load and the investigative technique applied competence and reference based approaches can integrate differential bed mobility that comes from bed surface textural blotches and reach scale separation of shear stress and sediment entrainment therefore competence and reference based approaches can be considered the best alternatives while representing reach average bed sediment motion unlikeness visual based approaches specifically focus on to record local incipience of sediment entrainment and are the best fit for application to entrainment studies of distinct bed surface textural blotches carson and griffiths 1985 wilcock 1988 buffington and montgomery 1997 dey and ali 2018 moreover the approaches used to analyze the incipience of sediment entrainment carry additionally considerable drawbacks such as many iterations time consuming nature and requiring expensive experiments and unfortunately the results found still carry considerable errors undoubtedly the accurate measurement of the incipient initiation of motion could contribute great valuable information to water resources engineering planners and designers recently in order to bring a new approach to the accurate measurement of the initiation of sediment transport fuzzy approach has been used in rough flow conditions spiliotis et al 2018 kitsikoudis et al 2016 spiliotis et al 2018 applied the fuzzy set knowledge to the zanke s equation dey and ali 2018 in rough flow conditions spiliotis et al 2018 opted not to consider the application in smooth and transitional flow conditions because of higher influence of viscous forces present previously the same group of researchers kitsikoudis et al 2016 has applied the fuzzy regression analysis combined with goal programming to model the incipient motion under rough flow conditions obviously a need to extend this approach for all hydrodynamic flow conditions to contribute to the current knowledge is present knowing that neuro fuzzy approach which is a powerful combination of artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis has been successfully used in hydrology hydraulics and other water resources fields such as rainfall runoff modeling şen and altunkaynak 2006 nasr and bruen 2008 remesan et al 2009 flood hazard risk mapping sonmez and bizimana 2018 modeling of lake water level fluctuations altunkaynak and şen 2007 bizimana et al 2016 stream flow prediction özger 2009 model for equilibrium scour in sediment transport uyumaz et al 2006 moreover tütmez et al 2007 who compared the spatial interpolation of mechanical properties of rocks by using mamdani and sugeno fuzzy models concluded that sugeno fuzzy model was better than mamdani fuzzy model in investigating the randomness presented in mechanical properties of rocks under nonlinear distribution furthermore ying 1999 in their research concluded that sugeno fuzzy approach is very economical while defining the number of inputs fuzzy sets compared to mamdani fuzzy approach when nontrapezoidal nontriangular inputs fuzzy sets are applied consequently the advantages found in literature of sugeno fuzzy approach over mamdani fuzzy approach and successful application of sugeno anfis approach in previous sediment transport based studies such as in evaluation of sediment entrainment in sand bed rivers azamathulla et al 2009 kitsikoudis et al 2015 computation of bed load in gravel bedded river channels kitsikoudis et al 2014 zounemat kermani et al 2018 andcomputation of sediment entrainment in sewer pipe systems azamathulla et al 2012 increased the motivation to apply machine learning or soft computation techniques specifically sugeno anfis to determine the incipient motion of sediment in all hydrodynamic flow conditions namely hydrodynamically smooth transitional and hydrodynamically rough the neuro fuzzy method clearly makes use of a combination of artificial neural network ann architecture and fuzzy logic fl reasoning ability these two approaches fall into soft computation techniques which are very important when encountered with systems that are hard to be described analytically by conventional physical and mathematical approaches ann can be described as a black box modeling tool which is able to obtain accurate results matching with observed data according to jovanovic et al 2004 the mechanism of ann learning is free of human expertise fuzzy inference system fis has recently become a popular computing approach with its concept of fuzzy set theory fuzzy sets fuzzy operators and expert base are building components of fis the expert base of a fis together with its rule base made of a number of fuzzy if then rules and corresponding membership functions of the fuzzy sets considered in the fuzzy rules can utilize expert knowledge although fis is very easy to use when expressing the knowledge with a set of if then rules still there is no methodical approach to make this transformation jang 1992 consequently the combination of ann and fis generates a mutually beneficial relationship that tackles previously mentioned drawbacks of each individual method this has meshed through integrated neuro fuzzy nf building blocks that share data structures and knowledge representation jang 1992 jang 1993 anfis is a different type of nf building architectures which belongs to the category of full fused nf systems jovanovic et al 2004 compared to other most used nf architectures such as evolving fuzzy neural network kasabov 1999 fuzzy inference software tano et al 1996 and many more anfis architecture provides the lowest root mean square error rmse when used for prediction of any chaotic data set abraham and nath 2000 abraham 2001 1 3 research objectives the objectives of this present study are i improve the widely used adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool which is based on the sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis approach the consequent part of anfis is allowed to be represented either as a constant or a linear function this means that not only a non linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions at the same time ii develop a novel method to overcome the shortcomings of anfis model with the combination of improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas that has skills to represent the consequent part of the model simultaneously by a constant linear and non linear function or a combination of them in addition the newly developed model optimizes the antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters constant linear and non linear functions via utilizing the gas tool iii develop a model for sediment entrainment for smooth transitional and rough flow conditions iv investigate and compare the performances of anfis and newly developed model which is named as geno fuzzy inference system genofis in predicting theincipientmotion of sediments under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in the following section 2 represents the theory establishment in this study section 3 represents the materials and methods applied in this study and section 4 represents the results and discussion of this study whilst section 5 qualitatively summarizes the main conclusions of this study 2 theory establishment 2 1 adaptive neural fuzzy inference system adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis is based on takagi sugeno fis sugeno and kang 1988 the neuro fuzzy model is introduced by r jang 1992 and with the name of anfis by jang 1992 jang 1993 that used two inputs and generated one output by using two fuzzy if then rules rule 1 if is a1 and y is b1 then fi p1x q1y r1 rule 2 if is a2 and y is b2 then f2 p2x q2y r2 as depicted in fig 2 five structure layers of the anfis tool are defined as follows layer 1 every node available in this layer has a node function o ä 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 or 5 o i 1 μ b i 2 y f o r i 3 4 where x or y is the input to node i and a i or b i 2 represents the linguistic label big small high close etc in association with the node function the function defines the level to which x or y meets the quantifier a or b i 2 and also called as the membership function of ai or b i 2 the fis provides tremendous freedom in defining the type of membership functions in relation to our needs in terms of speed simplicity convenience and efficiency the only condition that should be satisfied is that a membership function must definitely vary between 0 and 1 tagaki and sugeno 1985 fig 2 depicts the anfis architecture suggested by jang 1992 however the membership function is a function of its parameters therefore changing its parameters alters the membership function shape parameters found in the first layer refer to antecedent premise parameters layer 2 every node in this layer multiplies the incoming signals and also sends the product which is defined as the firing strength of a rule 6 o i 2 w i μ ai x x μ bi y i 1 2 layer 3 the name given to the outputs in this layer are called normalized firings strengths because each i th node in this particular layer calculates the ratio of the i th strength to the total summation of all rules of the firing strengths 7 o i 3 w i w i i w i i 1 2 layer 4 every node i in this particular layer is represented by a square node with a node function 8 o i 4 w i w i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where w i is the output characteristic of layer 3 and p1 q1 r1 is a set of parameters referred to consequent parameters it should be noticed that in case of pi 0 and qi 0 i 1 2 a sugeno fis which is named as zero order is implemented otherwise it is the first order sugeno fis that is incorporated sugeno 1985 tagaki and sugeno 1985 layer 5 the computation of the overall output as the summation of all signals received is made available by the single node in this layer 9 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i in order to reach its best performance anfis makes use of the least mean square optimization method in order to determine the consequent parameters and backpropagation to obtain the antecedent premise parameters every step in the learning process is composed of two steps in the first step training data set is used as the input the antecedent or boundary parameters are considered as fixed values and the optimal consequent parameters are obtained by an iterative epoch least mean square method in the second step patterns are once again propagated but herein this step the consequent parameters are supposed to be fastened and backpropagation is utilized to alter the antecedent parameters but unfortunately anfis does represent the optimal consequent output as a constant or linear function whereas many problems behave strongly non linear therefore this present study introduces a novel approach named as genofis model which is an integration of the improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas moreover genofis allows the representation of the consequent part as constant linear and non linear functions at the same time as well as optimize antecedent and consequent parameters utilizing gas 2 2 geno fuzzy inference system practical assumptions in determination of the suitable sugeno fis architecture for any practical social or engineering problem are a compromise between the accuracy and the computational entanglement for the conventional anfis architecture for n inputs f membership functions and k parameters that are given to each input and membership function respectively need the total number of fitting parameters equal to f n f k nf k fn n 1 it should be noticed that the time needed for computation during the training process in an anfis directly rely on this number therefore caution needs to be taken when increasing it it should also be kept in mind that the relationship between computational entanglement and anfis dimensionality is one of the drawbacks of the ordinary fuzzy approach this is frequently referred to as the curse of dimensionality maguire et al 1998 furthermore as mentioned before anfis generally can only define the consequent part either as a constant or linear function at the same time consequently the present study combines the approach defined by jovanovic et al 2004 proposed that in order to enhance the accuracy of anfis and at the same time reduce the computational entanglement the number of if then rules in fis should be represented by the number of input fuzzy sets under this presumption the total number of fitting parameters is given by g n f k n f k n f n 1 n f n k 1 this approach considerably increases the accuracy as well as reduces the computation entanglement in linear problems unfortunately it cannot solve non linear problems consequently as mentioned before in section 2 this present study introduces the genofis a novel approach that permits the representation of the consequent part with a non linear function where antecedent and consequent parameters are optimized by the gas tool hence the present novel method allows presenting the consequent part of the introduced novel method as non linear functions for the particular shields entrainment function y cr prediction of uniform sediment grain materials which highly behaves in a non linear manner shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 paphitis 2001 kitsikoudis et al 2016 the general rule bases for the novel genofis model used three approaches reference visual and competence used in the literature to define the incipient motion of sediments under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions as follows rule 1 if x cr is laminar then ycr a 1 re n b 1 re n 1 c 1 re n 2 d 1 re n n e 1 rule 2 if x cr is transitional then ycr a 2 re n b 2 re n 1 c 2 re n 2 d 2 re n n e 2 rule 3 if x cr is turbulent then ycr a 3 re n b 3 re n 1 c 3 re n 2 d 3 re n n e 3 where ycr defines the shields entrainment function and re is the shear reynolds number a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 a2 b2 c2 d3 e3 a3 b3 c3 d3 and e3 are consequent parameters which are optimized using genetic algorithms gas tool which is a method that searches the optimum solution by generating random number in a defined interval the gas goal is to determine a1 which combines parameters b1 c1 d1 and e1 in rule 1 a2 which combines parameters b2 c2 d2 and e2 and a3 which combines parameters b3 c3 d3 and e3 by using its inherent properties in order to successfully achieve this objective in the beginning chromosome population belonging to firmness variables is picked out randomly in most cases gas is coded in binary 0 1 basis in order to simplify the calculation these digital series are called chromosomes foregoing and present state variables connecting the weights rules of chromosomes formation which is in binary basis digital system is depicted in fig 3 in the chromosome structure depicted in fig 3 a member of state transition rules for rule 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 rule 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 and rule 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 were presented by 10 bits for each member respectively after being coded in this way the activeness of each chromosome in the community was calculated separately the roulette wheel approach was used to determine the activeness of each chromosome the activeness criterion of the chromosomes was determined according to the difference between the observed data and predicted values the global optimum solution point was reached at the point for which the root mean square error rmse value becomes the smallest the activeness of each chromosome defines whether a chromosome has to stay in or leave the population cross over transaction at gas possesses an important function in shaping the members with more activeness at the community the high activeness of any member defines its survival or otherwise its dismissal the existing generation is varied by using the operators of gas cross over and mutation according to the literature it is likely regarded that after the new member joins the population it becomes closer to the solution in order to attain the objective altunkaynak 2008 in this present study each chromosome in the population was coded with a randomly performed genetic digital series and a cross over between the genes it is called random cross over the randomness was also used to define the cross over s length unlike many other approaches such as the least square method lsm ga generates a vast number of solution points rather than only one solution point therefore gas can reach the global optimum solution among all solution points altunkaynak 2009 altunkaynak 2013 hadi and tombul 2018 in table 1 a comparison between fuzzy logic fl and genetic algorithms gas for their differences is exhibited 2 3 geno fuzzy inference system versus adaptive neural fuzzy inference system adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis is a technique that holds the capacity to self organize its network system and to train the parameters of the system the anfis tool uses the advantage of artificial neural network ann learning algorithms and fuzzy inference systems fis in other words anfis merges the verbal capacity of fis and the numerical capacity of the ann an anfis is defined as a hybrid learning algorithm that utilizes gradient descent and least squares ls methods to improve antecedent premise and consequent parameters respectively though the ls method utilizes derivatives to arrive at an optimal solution this indicates that used functions should always be continuous otherwise optimization procedure fails therefore anfis works definitely under restrictive presumptions such as linearity normality and constant variance özger 2009 akrami et al 2013 kitsikoudis et al 2016 spiliotis et al 2018 hence it can be clearly seen that anfis is inaccurate to deal with highly non linear problems moreover the anfis model parameter estimations are reached by considering the gradient descent and ls methods jang 1993 therefore the basic anfis approach demands differentiable and continuous linear target function at each and every point in the system structure in case of a nonlinear target function it definitely becomes difficult to take derivative and find an optimal solution on the other hand in order to bring a novel solution to the aforementioned problems resulting from anfis approach the novel genofis model was developed by improving consequent part of the sugeno consequent part so that it can be defined at the same time if needed as constant linear and non linear function options to optimize the novel genofis model parameters genetic algorithms gas are used the gas advantages and previous applications are discussed in details by altunkaynak 2010 2013 and also by ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 and najafzadeh et al 2017 and ouyang 2017 the novel genofis application allows that drawbacks presented by the regular sugeno approach are eliminated by a modified fis on the consequent part and at the same time solves the entanglement problems resulting from anfis approach process the entanglement problems are in terms of lack of simplicity and time effectiveness the novel genofis solves the aforementioned entanglement problems by considering equal the number of antecedents premises and consequents therefore the novel genofis reduces the number of if then rules and time used to process the final output finally in this study the shields entrainment function ycr of uniform bed grain particles under unidirectional flow conditions was predicted by using the observed shear reynolds number re additionally a comparative study between novel genofis and anfis is accomplished eventually the novel genofis model is proposed as a novel and practical alternative to the anfis model for modeling the shields entrainment function ycr of uniform bed grain particles in unidirectional flow under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in this study in order to accurately split the data space into accurate fuzzy sets a fuzzy logic clustering method is used in the literature the most cited fuzzy logic clustering approaches are the gustafson kessel gk approach gustafson and kessel 1979 and subtractive clustering sc approach chiu 1996 the gk approach is based on iterative minimization of the objective functions whereas sc is based on non iterative minimization of the objective functions in the present study the sc approach is used to compute the membership functions mfs of the fuzzy inference systems fis by using matlab commercial software together with genetic algorithm optimization operation for both anfis and genofis the selection of the best mfs was made after developing numerous models with different mf structures such as gaussian bell shape trapezoidal triangular and finding that as also supported by moosavi et al 2013 and gholami et al 2017 the gaussian shape is the best to be used fig 4 depicts the flowchart of calculation for both anfis and novel genofis 2 4 performance evaluation criteria solomatine and shrestha 2009 and others have demonstrated that among many other available model evaluation criteria in the literature root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce are most widely utilized and accepted nash and sutcliffe 1970 bowden et al 2013 also mentioned that rmse is a very good indicator of the degree of accuracy of a model hence rmse and ce are utilized to evaluate the performances of anfis and novel genofis models in this present study the following equation is used to calculate the root mean square error rmse 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n ycr pi ycr mi 2 where n is the total number of measurements ycr pi and ycr mi are the predicted and modeled shields entrainment values respectively for a perfect model rmse equals to 0 and as the perfection of a model reduces the inconsistency between the actual data and predicted model values increases rmse value also increases as regards the calculation of efficiency ce following equation is used 11 c e 1 i 1 n ycr pi ycr mi 2 i 1 n ycr mi ycr m 2 where ycr m is the mean predicted shield entrainment value ce of a model is considered acceptable when its values are greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 moreover donigian and love 2003 wang and altunkaynak 2011 and altunkaynak and wang 2012 categorized the performance of a predictive model as follows if ce values are in the range 0 65 0 75 the performance of the model is fair if ce values are in the range 0 75 0 85 the performance is good and if ce results are greater than 0 85 the performance is very good 3 materials and methods 3 1 observed data and data analysis both anfis and novel genofis models were implemented to model the shields entrainment function as indicated in the theory establishment section anfis and genofis models were developed to predict the shields entrainment function for three different shields entrainment function modeling approaches extrapolation base technique shields 1936 which involves determination of critical shear stress values that result from a low or completely a zero reference transport frequency from jointed shear stress and bed load entrainment measurements the visual base technique yalin and karahan 1979 is a direct visual observation of sediment entrainment from a given bed shear stress and development of competence functions wilcock 1988 yalin and da silva 2001 ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 the development of competence functions technique relates the bed shear stress to the entrainment of the biggest sediment particle the results of these predicting models were then evaluated in terms of their performance in predicting the shields entrainment function or dimensionless shear stress the data used herein was collected from three different previous most cited researches in terms of sediment incipient motion exploited data are from yalin and karahan 1979 buffington and montgomery 1997 and yalin and da silva 2001 those data were collected and digitized using the software webplotdigitizer 3 8 fig 5 depicts plots from which the data was collected fig 5b depicts the plot for visual based data yalin and karahan 1979 dey and ali 2018 fig 5a depicts the plot for reference based data buffington and montgomery 1997 and fig 5c depicts the plot for competence based data yalin and da silva 2001 hutter and wang 2016 according to altunkaynak and şen 2007 and özger 2009 each data set should be divided into two groups before the development of the model in order to divide the original dataset into train and test data sets the subset selection of maximum dissimilarity method ssmd is applied the original datasets are divided into 60 for train dataset and 40 for the test dataset kennard and stone 1969 have described the ssmd the ssmd offers the possibility to extract data subsets in a way that the extracted subsets form the original data set contains minimum similarities with maximum dissimilarities assessed between included members moreover the use of ssmd offers the unique possibility to increase the generality in a dataset by extracting data in a way that do not centralize to the special space instead it incorporates the data from the center to the defined dataset boundary lajiness and watson 2008 also stressed that by using the ssmd to divide the original dataset provides highest dissimilarities between subsets that cover the original dataset therefore 60 and 40 remaining of observed data were used for calibration training and to validate the performance of the model respectively in this present study the available data is very diverse as they were collected from different experimental results that used different techniques to define the threshold of the incipient motion of sediment a reference based technique utilizes statistical values rather than full obtained values and thus data collected from this technique demonstrates smaller shear reynolds numbers related to the shields entrainment function values or the dimensionless shear stress than in e g visual technique that was used by yalin and karahan 1979 it can be seen that shear reynolds numbers in table 3 that are higher than those presented in table 2 furthermore table 4 contains data obtained from a development of competence function based technique used by yalin and da silva 2001 as can be seen in table 4 shear reynolds values are even higher than of those in table 2 and table 3 with respect to shields entrainment function which is because the technique used to define the incipient motion relies on selective transport wilcock 1988 the selective transport relates the bed shear stress to the largest mobile grain size jiang and haff 1993 the data collected from the research of yalin and da silva 2001 are exposed in table 4 furthermore statistically an anticipated observation from the collected data shows that the anfis and genofis model results obtained using data from table 2 will likely give higher prediction error due to relatively bigger standard deviation considering the available maximum and minimum shield entrainment function ycr values and shear reynolds number re all data sets were collected from uniform grain material and non viscous fluid base models additionally these data were obtained from laboratory experiments performed for sand bedded open channels under unidirectional flows some of the statistical parameters of the data used herein are presented in table 2 table 3 and table 4 for reference visual and development of competence functions based technique respectively 3 2 application of anfis versus genofis it is well known that the anfis tool allows representing consequent part either as a constant or a linear function this implies that not only a non linear function is not allowed but also the consequent part of the model cannot be represented with both the constant and linear function simultaneously in this present study to overcome the shortcomings of anfis a new model is developed with the combination of modified sugeno fis and gas and named as genofis which is capable of representing the consequent part of the model with constant linear or non linear functions or even with a combination of them at the same time furthermore antecedent and consequent parameters are optimized by the gas tool the anfis and genofis model results are evaluated quantitatively based on rmse and ce values these models are used to define the shields entrainment function as the consequent part of the model by using the shear reynolds number which is selected as the sole antecedent parts of both anfis and genofis models only the shear reynolds number is considered as the sole antecedent value in both models because the models are trained by using data of buffington and montgomery 1997 yalin and karahan 1979 and yalin and da silva 2001 in which only shear reynolds number was used to predict the shields entrainment function table 5 and table 6 present the decision matrix fuzzy rules at the end of the calibration phase for both anfis and genofis models respectively as it can be seen in table 5 anfis tool has a drawback of representing the consequent part of the model either as a constant or a linear function which means that it does not allow representing the consequent part of the model as a constant linear and non linear or integration of them simultaneously because of this disadvantage the anfis model can yield inaccurate results when it comes to non linear problems such as the definition of the shields entrainment function however by reconsidering the same mfs as used for the anfis but this time redefining the parameters of the mfs using gas optimization technique the developed novel genofis provides the ability to represent the consequent part of the sugeno fis as any function such as polynomial logarithmic gaussian etc or combination of them simultaneously after the determination of fis using gas optimization technique the centroid approach for defuzzification process is performed to define the final ycr optimized values in this present study the consequent part of the newly genofis model is defined as polynomial functions for sediment incipient motion or threshold of sediment entrainment under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions see table 6 fuzzy sets applied herein to develop both anfis and genofis models for reference visual and competence techniques are depicted in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively model parameters of gaussian type membership functions for the genofis approach are presented in table 7 and 8 the gas tool was used to optimize the antecedent and consequent parameters for both anfis and genofis models the same number of membership functions was used nine fuzzy sets are depicted as laminar 1 l1 laminar 2 l2 laminar 3 l3 transitional 1 t1 transitional 2 t2 transitional 3 t3 rough 1 r1 rough 2 r2 and rough 3 r3 in turbulent flow fuzzy sets were separated as follows rough 1 r1 rough 2 r2 and rough 3 r3 for reference based approach laminar 1 l1 laminar 2 l2 laminar 3 l3 transitional 1 t1 and rough 1 r1 for visual based approach additionally nine fuzzy sets were used for competence based approach and in the latter fuzzy sets were divided as similarly as in the reference based approach for anfis nine consequent linear outputs with nine fuzzy rules were used whereas for the genofis model all laminar flow sub parts were assigned to one consequent output and the same procedure was performed for the transitional flow and turbulent flow parts by assigning each of them to one consequent output as polynomial functions see table 6 4 results and discussion due to the extremely complex interrelation between the hydrodynamic forces caused by the fluid and the bed sediment particles with different packing conditions and high turbulence that occurs near the bed the developed analytical approaches cannot accurately capture the interrelationship between bed sediment particle and fluid in motion easily dey and ali 2018 the accuracy of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis and novel geno fuzzy inference system genofis models in predicting shields entrainment function ycr is investigated by utilizing shear reynolds number re as input for three different techniques namely reference visual and competence based techniques 123 73 and 50 data points were used for reference competence and visual based techniques respectively for the development of the model 72 43 and 30 data points were used for training calibration phase and remaining 51 30 and 20 data points were used for testing phase prediction for reference competence and visual based techniques respectively anfis and newly developed genofis models were simulated and fuzzy sets of the models are obtained after the training phase for anfis and developed genofis models which are depicted in figs 6 7 and 8 also the decision matrix rule bases is demonstrated in tables 5 and 6 in the anfis model the antecedent fuzzy sets and consequent parameters are trained by an artificial neural network ann and least square method respectively whereas genofis model trains antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters only by the gas tool the consequent parameters of anfis and genofis models for reference competence and visual based techniques are presented in table 5 and table 6 respectively in table 6 the equations chosen to assume the processes in the consequent part of the genofis model are presented for three different techniques these functions were chosen after the optimization of the generalized consequent part of the genofis presented in theory establishment section geno fuzzy inference system subsection artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural network ann fuzzy logic fl and genetic programming gp are black box modeling tools likewise the proposed novel genofis and anfis models are also black box methods which transform the input data to output data mathematically not using physical concepts in this study the consequent functions are generated by published data which was divided into two parts for training calibration and validation prediction phases moreover antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters consequent functions are optimized with training calibration data by utilizing the gas tool subsequently genofis model is validated with remaining testing data furthermore knowing that the sediment entrainment behave in a different way following the type of flow conditions ebtehaj et al 2017 spiliotis et al 2018 wan mohtar et al 2018 the novel genofis model trained with the ga and compared to the published experimental data yalin and karahan 1979 buffington and montgomery 1997 yalin and da silva 2001 generated the best optimal functions for the consequent part of the improved sugeno fuzzy inference system as presented in table 6 consequently the novel genofis model offers a practical solution to mathematically represent the behavior of sediment entrainment in all types of individual boundaries and flow conditions by offering different types of functions at the same time unlike anfis that offers only linear or constant functions and not both in the same model the constant parameters of functions consequent outputs of genofis model for laminar transitional and turbulent flows with reference competence and visual based techniques after ga training and optimization processes are presented in tables 7 and 8 respectively in this study we applied the pawn approach to investigate the sensitivity for shear reynolds number re as a sole input for all performed models in all hydrodynamic flow conditions pawn approach was explained in details by pianosi and wagener 2015 pawn is an abbreviation derived from pianosi and wagener pawn approach allows investigating the propagation of shear reynolds number re uncertainty and sensitivity when used a sole input to predict the shields entrainment function under hydrodynamically smooth transitional and rough flow conditions we therefore consider the model output which is the shields entrainment function when the predicted ycr values are highly correlated to the observed ycr values under feasible ranges or confidence ranges of variation of re as given in table 9 the confidence ranges are computed and defined in a way that model training with the defined range would exhibit a sensible output performance the pawn approach to defining the sensibility of model parameters uses a coefficient of determination r2 that is evaluated between computed and observed outcome according to pianosi and wagener 2015 any model input parameter is defined as sensitive to the model output when an r2 is higher than 60 r2 60 r2 is defined as follows 12 r 2 1 var e var q where var e defines the variance of training stochastic terms or errors and var q defines the variance of observed shields entrainment values the confidence ranges were defined moreover for the confidence level definition in this study an approach discussed by brase and brase 2009 was applied the confidence band for the dataset means μ is defined as 13 x t c s n x t c s n where tc defines the critical values for the data distribution for confidence level c x defines the mean value s is the sample standard deviation n define the number of sampled data the validation of the confidence interval is qualified as a dynamic approach in the categorization process because it requires executing the model as also stressed by banks 1998 and petty 2012 the validation process involves a comparative approach petty 2012 during this process an observed shields entrainment function value ycr is compared to the shield entrainment value ycr obtained when the model is executed for the specific confidence range or band and the value performance is recorded moreover r2is calculated for the computed and observed outcome with an estimate of a confidence limit separately for individual boundaries generated from the confidence bands and flow conditions presented in this study the results are presented in table 9 accordingly pandis 2015 discussed in detail how to calculate confidence limits the parametric outcomes described in table 9 for the sensitivity analysis by using the pawn approach indicate an increase of the sensitivity for the shear reynolds number re as an input towards the output which is the shields entrainment function ycr when genofis was performed this means that the genofis model has successfully better trained even data samples that remain very distant from the mean of the sampled data than the anfis model performance of these two models was evaluated using rmse and ce as indicator criteria good prediction accuracy was yielded by the anfis and genofis approaches where solely shear reynolds number was used as input into the models results of rmse and ce values are illustrated in table 10 it can be seen that rmse values of anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques are found to be 6 84 10 3 4 77 10 3 2 19 10 3 whereas 2 33 10 3 1 93 10 3 9 35 10 4 are the rmse values of genofis model for reference competence and visual based techniques are found to be respectively obviously the genofis model provided relatively smaller rmse values than the anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques this implies that the genofis model yielded better prediction accuracy of shields entrainment function than the anfis model for all techniques for the anfis model ce values under reference competence and visual based techniques are calculated as 0 95 0 98 and 0 98 and for the genofis model ce values are found as 0 98 0 99 and 0 99 respectively the genofis model has relatively smaller rmse values and relatively bigger ce values compared to the anfis model moreover a number of inputs processing time and if then rules number are presented in table 10 for comparative purposes both anfis and novel genofis used one single input however in order to reach the final results 9 5 and 9 if then rules have been applied for anfis based models for reference visual and competence based approach respectively whereas 3 3 and 3 if then rules have been applied for genofis based models for reference visual and competence based approach respectively this shows that genofis model has reduced significantly the entanglement that results from using more if then rules in a given fuzzy model jovanovic et al 2004 akrami et al 2013 in table 4 also the anfis and genofis processing time are presented for reference visual and competence based approaches slightly anfis based models have exhibited shorter periods for the processing of the final results compared to the novel genofis but overall the novel genofis based model exhibited better performance than anfis following the evaluation criteria shown in table 10 consequently this present study has chosen genofis as the best model following its smaller rmse and the larger ce values as aforementioned and presented in table 10 based on these indicator criteria the prediction accuracy of the shields entrainment function by genofis model is much better than the anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques according to the calculated ce values from prediction values of anfis and developed genofis models both models have exhibited very good performance in terms of shields entrainment function prediction however genofis model performed superior to the anfis model for all shields entrainment functions ycr furthermore rmse values calculated from genofis model results are lower than those calculated from the anfis model results for reference visual and competence based techniques rmse values of anfis and genofis models obtained from the reference based data are higher than in visual and competence based models because of previous discussed high fluctuations available in buffington and montgomery data as it can be seen from the standard deviation in table 2 this definitely indicates that the predicted ycr values by novel genofis model are significantly better than those of ycr values predicted by the anfis model by referring to donigian and love 2003 and altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 and taking evaluation criteria rmse and ce into consideration the performance of anfis model for prediction of shields entrainment function under reference competence and visual based techniques is good whereas the prediction performance of genofis model is very good additionally the predictions of shields entrainment function ycr by anfis and genofis and corresponding observed values of shields entrainment function versus shear reynolds number re values are plotted in a logarithmic scale as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively considering re and referring to shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 and many other researchers in the present study anfis and novel genofis results show that for small re numbers re 1 5 shields entrainment values are strongly dependent on shear reynolds number re for larger values of shear reynolds number shields entrainment values become independent from shear reynolds numbers and approximate to a constant value for re 3 according to fig 9 the predicted shields entrainment values by genofis model tend to follow exactly the observed shields entrainment data of reference approach while the anfis model prediction values also captured the observed shields entrainment data clearly the genofis model results follow the corresponding observed shields entrainment data of reference approach closer than the anfis model results as regards the visual approach fig 10 revealed that the prediction values of genofis model quiet captured the observed shields entrainment data better than the anfis model results for the competence approach fig 11 shows that the genofis model results are exactly matched with the corresponding observed shields entrainment data of competence approach under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions whereas the anfis model values follow the observed data closely for smooth flow condition but particularly for transitional condition over predicted the observed data and for rough flow condition under predicted observed data this means that the prediction performance of the anfis model is particularly fair for competence approach under transitional and rough flow conditions however it has been observed that the performance of genofis model is enhanced with relatively larger sets of experimental data besides genofis performed very well for visual and reference based models compared to reference based data this is because the used data of yalin and karahan 1979 and yalin and da silva 2001 visual and reference based models was collected under deterministic approaches whereas reference based data used herein was collected by using a deterministic approach considering only statistical values therefore it was not possible for the reference based approach to represent the extreme and lowest crisp values which eventually help to define fuzzy sets and allow capturing the available initial and extreme shield entrainment conditions in fuzzification process the high viscous forces present in smooth flow condition were overcome by assigning higher fuzzy membership degrees to lower shear reynolds numbers in order to make them be part of the fuzzy rough 3 r3 set which corresponds to extreme shield entrainment values gaussian mf types were used in all hydrodynamic flow conditions because of the advantage of gaussian distribution in which variables tend towards a normal distribution the latter was therefore very useful because of the available experimental data used herein that had considerable fluctuations buffington and montgomery 1997 using developed genofis model for high shear reynolds values in gravel bedded rivers gravel bedded rivers which were used by buffington and montgomery 1997 shield entrainment values varied in range 0 056 0 076 and completely stayed in the range described by buffington and montgomery 1997 in gravel bedded river under rough flow conditions additionally genofis model performed very well for visual and competence based models where shields entrainment values for rough flow conditions varied between 0 042 and 0 048 and 0 041 0 046 for visual and competence respectively these results completely encapsulate the findings of yalin and karahan 1979 miller et al 1977 and yalin and da silva 2001 where shields entrainment values under rough flow conditions were found to be 0 045 0 047 and 0 043 respectively on top of that the novel genofis model offers the ability to define the shields entrainment function ycr that initiates the sediment entrainment for each and every defined corresponding shear reynolds number re in all flow conditions unlike previous researchers who defined the critical dimensionless shear stress in turbulent flows only shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 cao et al 2006 tamburrino et al 2016 the results of this present study revealed that developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model in predicting shields entrainment data in all techniques for smooth transitional and rough flow conditions the observed shields s entrainment function versus predicted shields entrainment function by anfis and genofis models for the reference competence and visual based approaches are plotted with the exact line 1 1 in fig 12 the visual investigation of these figures indicates a strong consistency exhibited between predicted shields entrainment function values by anfis and genofis models and corresponding observed shields entrainment function data as shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 12a the prediction results of the genofis model for the reference based approach quietly scattered around the exact line while the scattering is slightly more for the predicted values by anfis around exact line compared to genofis model results this means that genofis model has a very good performance in terms of prediction of shields entrainment function for the reference based approach likewise fig 12b illustrates the results of anfis and genofis models and corresponding observed data of the competence based approach distributed around the exact line the predicted values of genofis mode matched almost exactly with the corresponding observed data of competence based approach while the anfis model results exhibit a good agreement with observed data which implies that genofis model has relatively better accuracy than anfis model for competency based approach this is to say that the developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model for prediction of shields entrainment function using observed data of the reference and competence based approaches similarly the predicted values by genofis model remarkably follow the data of visual based approach as depicted in fig 6c on the other hand the results of the anfis model is slightly scattered around the exact line referring to the relatively lower performance of the anfis model for visual based approach data consequently the results of this present study indicate that the incorporation of modified sugeno fis approach and gas tool further improved the accuracy of genofis model significantly for the reference competence and visual based approaches it is to note that the developed genofis model can accurately predict shields entrainment function better than the anfis model without expensive computation effort for all three different techniques that were used to define the threshold of the sediment incipient motion under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions the genofis and anfis model results are compared with experimental data quantitatively and qualitatively and close similarity is found under all hydrodynamic flow conditions additionally the processing time of a model is so important in order to be more useful nowadays in this study the processing time used for the training process of both anfis and genofis for 1000 iterations was recorded 586 s 476 s and 425 s were recorded for the training process of reference visual and competence based anfis models whereas 936 s 742 s and 695 s were recorded for the training process of reference visual and competence based genofis models consequently competence based anfis model has the least output processing time whereas competence based genofis model has the highest output processing time in general the training process using genetic algorithms gas for genofis manifested relatively longer output processing time while converging to the final solution compared to artificial neural networks based anfis 5 conclusions adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool is based on sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis however the anfis model has a shortcoming in defining the consequent part of the model that is it could only be represented either as a constant or a linear function this implies that anfis is not capable of describing consequent part of the model simultaneously as a constant linear non linear or combination of them in this present study geno fuzzy inferences system genofis is introduced with the incorporation of improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas tool which improved the accuracy significantly in predicting the shields entrainment values the anfis and developed genofis models are implemented to predict sediment incipient motion by utilizing the reference competence and visual based data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions respectively the prediction performance of the anfis and genofis models is evaluated quantitatively by taking calculated root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ce values into consideration clearly developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model for the reference competence and visual based data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions based on rmse and ce values as performance criteria moreover the prediction performance of the anfis and genofis models is investigated in terms of visual analysis the anfis and novel genofis performances were evaluated in predicting the instantaneous shields entrainment values ycr which is defined in terms of shear reynolds number re in sand bedded open channels under unidirectional flow regime the genofis exhibited higher performance than conventional anfis model in predicting the shields entrainment values for all considered data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in this present study sand beds with uniform packing and direction under unidirectional flow were considered these considerations helped the fuzzy expert system to define the shields entrainment values for the initiation of motion from weak to general motion of sediments under all hydrodynamic flow conditions and to define the fuzzy transition of motion that varies from weak to general motion the fuzzy transition was defined with shields entrainment values in terms of fuzzy sets as a result developed genofis is recommended to be used in predicting the shields entrainment values in gravel and sand bedded open channels with uniform packing and direction of sediment particles under unidirectional flow and in all hydrodynamic flow conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding publishing this article acknowledgment the authors are very thankful to the editor in chief and all reviewers for their insightful comments that helped to improve the clarity of the final paper 
6234,in this present study a novel approach is introduced for accurate prediction of the incipient motion of uniform grain particles in sand and gravel bedded open channels under unidirectional flow by improving sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool is based on sugeno fis consequent part of the anfis tool is limited to either as a constant or a linear function this means that not only a non linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions at the same time anfis tool optimizes antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters constant or linear functions by utilizing neural and least square methods respectively in this study a novel hybrid model named as geno fuzzy inference system genofis is introduced by integrating improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas that refer to where the antecedent fuzzy sets and consequent constant linear and non linear functions parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms gas tool a quantitative comparison is implemented between the anfis and genofis models using root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce as evaluation criteria by using three different types of incipient motion of sediment measurements that exist in the literature as reference visual and development of competence functions the results of this present study demonstrated that the novel genofis model provided more accurate prediction results in comparisons with the anfis model

introduction 1 1 incipient motion and sediment transport overview following an important increase in the volume of flow pressing against stationary sediment particles at a given level which particles cannot possibly sustain undergoing pressure acting upon them caused by the hydrodynamic forces drag force and lift force suddenly dislocation will happen and movement will initiate buffington and montgomery 1997 andrews 1994 the instantaneous changes from a no motion state to initiation of sediment motion is defined as the threshold of initial motion or threshold of incipient motion which refers to the earliest stage of sediment transport the study of the incipient motion of sediment transport is very crucial in various areas such as channel design river morphology and restoration pollutant transport sediment mobility and their transport etc paphitis 2001 ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 the sediment transport is extremely related to the bed surface morphology grain particle size protrusion to the flow and packing orders fenton and abbott 1977 giménez curto and corniero 2009 most notably the recurring behavioural aspect of turbulence in near bed flow sutherland 1967 dey et al 2012 fig 1 a illustrates a description of a bed grain particle that is targeted at the incipience of sediment entrainment by hydraulically rough wall shear flow conditions the catalyst forces for the grain particle transport are the lift force fl and drag force fd elseways the force brings the stabilizing condition to the particle is the submerged weight fg of the actual particle the targeted bed particle can be possibly under these following entrainment modes rolling sliding and lifting fig 1b fig 1c and fig 1d illustrate all those transport modes the first mode of entrainment is rolling and is depicted in fig 1b it happens when the destabilizing moment md around the pivoting point exceeds the stabilizing moment ms around the same point ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 elseways fig 1c illustrates the sliding mode where the drag force fd surpasses the frictional resistance fr at the contact points moreover in lifting mode fig 1d the lift force fl surpasses the submerged weight fg of the grain particle hence all entrainment modes of a grain particle entrainment are as follows dey and ali 2018 1a r o l l i n g m o d e m d m s f d l v f l l h f g l h 1b s l i d i n g m o d e f d f r f d k f r f d f r 1c l i f t i n g m o d e f l f g where lv and lh define the vertical and the horizontal lever arms respectively and kfr defines the coefficient of friction kfr tanø if ø is the internal friction angle the equal sign presented in eq 1 for a specific grain particle entrainment mode represents the incipience of entrainment mode conditions whilst the greater than sign means a transport or entrainment mode elhakeem et al 2017 in order to measure the incipient motion of sediment transport accurately some dimensionless variables and functions of the two phase phenomenon are used the two phase phenomenon is herein defined by the fluid cohesionless granular medium and flow characteristics such as density ρ viscosity µ density of the granular material ρs diameter of the granular material d average depth of flow h slope j and force of gravity g yalin 1977 according to yalin 1977 when defining the two phase motion it should always be preferred to use the shear velocity u and specific density ρs rather than using the slope j and force of gravity g in addition basic quantities can be defined as characteristic parameters that have independent dimensions the procedure to transform the characteristic parameters into dimensionless variables was defined by yalin 1977 as follows 2 x 1 a 1 α 1 a 2 β 1 a 3 γ 1 a 4 m 1 x 2 a 1 α 2 a 2 β 2 a 3 γ 2 a 5 m 2 xn a 1 α n a 2 β n a 3 γ n a n mn with n n 3 where a1 a2 a3 and an are n basic quantities of the set a i i 1 2 n these n basic quantities are combined with each one of the remaining n 3 power products x1 x2 xn formed by n characteristic parameters a i as shown by eq 1 as the dimensionless variables of the two phase phenomenon mj αj βj and γj must be selected so that each of the power products above eq 2 becomes dimensionless yalin 1977 in this present study the set ρ µ ρs υ d h u γs is considered for the two phase phenomenon in sediment transport furthermore selection of the parameters d ρ u which have independent dimensions as basic quantities is performed moreover the application of the procedure implied by eq 2 permits to determine the following 8 3 5 power products as the dimensionless variables of the two phase phenomenon in this study the incipient motion of sediment transport or shields entrainment function is defined by two dimensionless characteristic parameters this is because of data used in this study from previous researches that were defined by only two dimensionless characteristic parameters as follows 3 x 1 x c r d 1 ρ 1 u c r 1 μ 1 u c r d υ 4 x 2 y c r d 1 ρ 1 u c r 2 γ s 1 ρ u c r 2 γ s d where x1 and x2 in eqs 3 and 4 stand for shear reynolds number re and shield entrainment function ycr respectively d defines particle diameter ρ defines the fluid density u defines the bed shear velocity µ defines the fluid dynamic viscosity υ defines the fluid kinematic viscosity and γs defines particle specific weight for the calculation of re the roughness length is taken as d by considering uniform granular material otherwise nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness should be used 1 2 incipient motion modeling overview using purely theoretical reasoning it has been established that the initiation of sediment transport on a plane mobile bed is given by a certain condition that must be fulfilled by the dimensionless variables shear reynolds number xcr and shields entrainment function ycr yalin 1977 shields introduced to plot the experimental values ycr versus xcr with the intention of producing a curve determining the initiation of sediment transport for the first time shields 1936 thereafter in recent years some implicit and explicit mathematical approaches have been used to study the threshold of incipient motion of sediments shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 paphitis 2001 yalin and da silva 2001 cao et al 2006 kitsikoudis et al 2016 sipiliotis et al 2018 dey and ali 2018 due to the complexity and high variability in defining hydrodynamics of sediments defining the threshold of incipient motion of sediments under a natural environment also becomes very challenging shields 1936 komar and clemens 1986 paphitis 2001 vollmer and kleinhans 2007 elhakeem et al 2017 in order to overcome this challenge numerous empirical threshold curves representing the threshold critical condition for the incipient initial motion of sediments or shields entrainment function as discussed herein have been represented hjulstrom 1935 shields 1936 inman 1949 sundborg 1956 komar and clemens 1986 paphitis 2001 the most commonly used approach to defining the threshold of initiation of sediment transport up today is still regarded as the shields approach shields 1936 even though details from shields results remain extremely vague kennedy 1995 buffington 1999 this same fact was supported by shvidchenko and pender 2000 by showing how the vagueness persists in defining what actually constitutes the incipient of motion furthermore vanoni 2006 concluded that the different definitions given to the initiation of motion by different researchers highly generate a bias to the published data as it can be noted in previously several approaches to defining the initiation of motion for sediment transport have been undertaken shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 in the actual literature the incipience of sediment transport is commonly defined using three different approaches namely reference visual and competence based approaches buffington and montgomery 1997 buffington and montgomery 1998 buffington 1999 cao et al 2006 the critical shear stress defined using reference based approach is determined with either a zero or low reference entrainment rate extrapolated to from joined shear stress and bed sediment entrainment analysis ashworth and ferguson 1989 ashworth et al 1992 visual observation approach is direct but can carry high subjectivity depending on researcher s definition of how much sediment entrainment defines the incipience of sediment motion kramer 1935 neill and yalin 1969 yalin and karahan 1979 wilcock 1988 turowski et al 2011 schiereck 2017 the competence functions are highly linked to the size and efficiency of the sediment catch sample size presence of coarse sediment sizes and definitely fitting approach wilcock 1988 wathen et al 1995 even though all methods used to define the incipience of sediment transport carry methodological bias that can be the cause of subjectivities and inappropriateness while deciding which research method is the best while defining the shields entrainment function value ycr none of these research methods used to define the incipience of sediment motion is considered superior buffington and montgomery 1997 dey and ali 2018 each and every research method has relatively its weakness and strength yet every method is more competitive in a particular case than others carson and griffiths 1985 for instance since competence and reference based values of ycr are computed from bedload entrainment estimations they can be accepted as the best research approaches that can be used to compute bedload transport following the bed load and the investigative technique applied competence and reference based approaches can integrate differential bed mobility that comes from bed surface textural blotches and reach scale separation of shear stress and sediment entrainment therefore competence and reference based approaches can be considered the best alternatives while representing reach average bed sediment motion unlikeness visual based approaches specifically focus on to record local incipience of sediment entrainment and are the best fit for application to entrainment studies of distinct bed surface textural blotches carson and griffiths 1985 wilcock 1988 buffington and montgomery 1997 dey and ali 2018 moreover the approaches used to analyze the incipience of sediment entrainment carry additionally considerable drawbacks such as many iterations time consuming nature and requiring expensive experiments and unfortunately the results found still carry considerable errors undoubtedly the accurate measurement of the incipient initiation of motion could contribute great valuable information to water resources engineering planners and designers recently in order to bring a new approach to the accurate measurement of the initiation of sediment transport fuzzy approach has been used in rough flow conditions spiliotis et al 2018 kitsikoudis et al 2016 spiliotis et al 2018 applied the fuzzy set knowledge to the zanke s equation dey and ali 2018 in rough flow conditions spiliotis et al 2018 opted not to consider the application in smooth and transitional flow conditions because of higher influence of viscous forces present previously the same group of researchers kitsikoudis et al 2016 has applied the fuzzy regression analysis combined with goal programming to model the incipient motion under rough flow conditions obviously a need to extend this approach for all hydrodynamic flow conditions to contribute to the current knowledge is present knowing that neuro fuzzy approach which is a powerful combination of artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis has been successfully used in hydrology hydraulics and other water resources fields such as rainfall runoff modeling şen and altunkaynak 2006 nasr and bruen 2008 remesan et al 2009 flood hazard risk mapping sonmez and bizimana 2018 modeling of lake water level fluctuations altunkaynak and şen 2007 bizimana et al 2016 stream flow prediction özger 2009 model for equilibrium scour in sediment transport uyumaz et al 2006 moreover tütmez et al 2007 who compared the spatial interpolation of mechanical properties of rocks by using mamdani and sugeno fuzzy models concluded that sugeno fuzzy model was better than mamdani fuzzy model in investigating the randomness presented in mechanical properties of rocks under nonlinear distribution furthermore ying 1999 in their research concluded that sugeno fuzzy approach is very economical while defining the number of inputs fuzzy sets compared to mamdani fuzzy approach when nontrapezoidal nontriangular inputs fuzzy sets are applied consequently the advantages found in literature of sugeno fuzzy approach over mamdani fuzzy approach and successful application of sugeno anfis approach in previous sediment transport based studies such as in evaluation of sediment entrainment in sand bed rivers azamathulla et al 2009 kitsikoudis et al 2015 computation of bed load in gravel bedded river channels kitsikoudis et al 2014 zounemat kermani et al 2018 andcomputation of sediment entrainment in sewer pipe systems azamathulla et al 2012 increased the motivation to apply machine learning or soft computation techniques specifically sugeno anfis to determine the incipient motion of sediment in all hydrodynamic flow conditions namely hydrodynamically smooth transitional and hydrodynamically rough the neuro fuzzy method clearly makes use of a combination of artificial neural network ann architecture and fuzzy logic fl reasoning ability these two approaches fall into soft computation techniques which are very important when encountered with systems that are hard to be described analytically by conventional physical and mathematical approaches ann can be described as a black box modeling tool which is able to obtain accurate results matching with observed data according to jovanovic et al 2004 the mechanism of ann learning is free of human expertise fuzzy inference system fis has recently become a popular computing approach with its concept of fuzzy set theory fuzzy sets fuzzy operators and expert base are building components of fis the expert base of a fis together with its rule base made of a number of fuzzy if then rules and corresponding membership functions of the fuzzy sets considered in the fuzzy rules can utilize expert knowledge although fis is very easy to use when expressing the knowledge with a set of if then rules still there is no methodical approach to make this transformation jang 1992 consequently the combination of ann and fis generates a mutually beneficial relationship that tackles previously mentioned drawbacks of each individual method this has meshed through integrated neuro fuzzy nf building blocks that share data structures and knowledge representation jang 1992 jang 1993 anfis is a different type of nf building architectures which belongs to the category of full fused nf systems jovanovic et al 2004 compared to other most used nf architectures such as evolving fuzzy neural network kasabov 1999 fuzzy inference software tano et al 1996 and many more anfis architecture provides the lowest root mean square error rmse when used for prediction of any chaotic data set abraham and nath 2000 abraham 2001 1 3 research objectives the objectives of this present study are i improve the widely used adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool which is based on the sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis approach the consequent part of anfis is allowed to be represented either as a constant or a linear function this means that not only a non linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions at the same time ii develop a novel method to overcome the shortcomings of anfis model with the combination of improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas that has skills to represent the consequent part of the model simultaneously by a constant linear and non linear function or a combination of them in addition the newly developed model optimizes the antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters constant linear and non linear functions via utilizing the gas tool iii develop a model for sediment entrainment for smooth transitional and rough flow conditions iv investigate and compare the performances of anfis and newly developed model which is named as geno fuzzy inference system genofis in predicting theincipientmotion of sediments under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in the following section 2 represents the theory establishment in this study section 3 represents the materials and methods applied in this study and section 4 represents the results and discussion of this study whilst section 5 qualitatively summarizes the main conclusions of this study 2 theory establishment 2 1 adaptive neural fuzzy inference system adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis is based on takagi sugeno fis sugeno and kang 1988 the neuro fuzzy model is introduced by r jang 1992 and with the name of anfis by jang 1992 jang 1993 that used two inputs and generated one output by using two fuzzy if then rules rule 1 if is a1 and y is b1 then fi p1x q1y r1 rule 2 if is a2 and y is b2 then f2 p2x q2y r2 as depicted in fig 2 five structure layers of the anfis tool are defined as follows layer 1 every node available in this layer has a node function o ä 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 or 5 o i 1 μ b i 2 y f o r i 3 4 where x or y is the input to node i and a i or b i 2 represents the linguistic label big small high close etc in association with the node function the function defines the level to which x or y meets the quantifier a or b i 2 and also called as the membership function of ai or b i 2 the fis provides tremendous freedom in defining the type of membership functions in relation to our needs in terms of speed simplicity convenience and efficiency the only condition that should be satisfied is that a membership function must definitely vary between 0 and 1 tagaki and sugeno 1985 fig 2 depicts the anfis architecture suggested by jang 1992 however the membership function is a function of its parameters therefore changing its parameters alters the membership function shape parameters found in the first layer refer to antecedent premise parameters layer 2 every node in this layer multiplies the incoming signals and also sends the product which is defined as the firing strength of a rule 6 o i 2 w i μ ai x x μ bi y i 1 2 layer 3 the name given to the outputs in this layer are called normalized firings strengths because each i th node in this particular layer calculates the ratio of the i th strength to the total summation of all rules of the firing strengths 7 o i 3 w i w i i w i i 1 2 layer 4 every node i in this particular layer is represented by a square node with a node function 8 o i 4 w i w i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where w i is the output characteristic of layer 3 and p1 q1 r1 is a set of parameters referred to consequent parameters it should be noticed that in case of pi 0 and qi 0 i 1 2 a sugeno fis which is named as zero order is implemented otherwise it is the first order sugeno fis that is incorporated sugeno 1985 tagaki and sugeno 1985 layer 5 the computation of the overall output as the summation of all signals received is made available by the single node in this layer 9 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i in order to reach its best performance anfis makes use of the least mean square optimization method in order to determine the consequent parameters and backpropagation to obtain the antecedent premise parameters every step in the learning process is composed of two steps in the first step training data set is used as the input the antecedent or boundary parameters are considered as fixed values and the optimal consequent parameters are obtained by an iterative epoch least mean square method in the second step patterns are once again propagated but herein this step the consequent parameters are supposed to be fastened and backpropagation is utilized to alter the antecedent parameters but unfortunately anfis does represent the optimal consequent output as a constant or linear function whereas many problems behave strongly non linear therefore this present study introduces a novel approach named as genofis model which is an integration of the improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas moreover genofis allows the representation of the consequent part as constant linear and non linear functions at the same time as well as optimize antecedent and consequent parameters utilizing gas 2 2 geno fuzzy inference system practical assumptions in determination of the suitable sugeno fis architecture for any practical social or engineering problem are a compromise between the accuracy and the computational entanglement for the conventional anfis architecture for n inputs f membership functions and k parameters that are given to each input and membership function respectively need the total number of fitting parameters equal to f n f k nf k fn n 1 it should be noticed that the time needed for computation during the training process in an anfis directly rely on this number therefore caution needs to be taken when increasing it it should also be kept in mind that the relationship between computational entanglement and anfis dimensionality is one of the drawbacks of the ordinary fuzzy approach this is frequently referred to as the curse of dimensionality maguire et al 1998 furthermore as mentioned before anfis generally can only define the consequent part either as a constant or linear function at the same time consequently the present study combines the approach defined by jovanovic et al 2004 proposed that in order to enhance the accuracy of anfis and at the same time reduce the computational entanglement the number of if then rules in fis should be represented by the number of input fuzzy sets under this presumption the total number of fitting parameters is given by g n f k n f k n f n 1 n f n k 1 this approach considerably increases the accuracy as well as reduces the computation entanglement in linear problems unfortunately it cannot solve non linear problems consequently as mentioned before in section 2 this present study introduces the genofis a novel approach that permits the representation of the consequent part with a non linear function where antecedent and consequent parameters are optimized by the gas tool hence the present novel method allows presenting the consequent part of the introduced novel method as non linear functions for the particular shields entrainment function y cr prediction of uniform sediment grain materials which highly behaves in a non linear manner shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 paphitis 2001 kitsikoudis et al 2016 the general rule bases for the novel genofis model used three approaches reference visual and competence used in the literature to define the incipient motion of sediments under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions as follows rule 1 if x cr is laminar then ycr a 1 re n b 1 re n 1 c 1 re n 2 d 1 re n n e 1 rule 2 if x cr is transitional then ycr a 2 re n b 2 re n 1 c 2 re n 2 d 2 re n n e 2 rule 3 if x cr is turbulent then ycr a 3 re n b 3 re n 1 c 3 re n 2 d 3 re n n e 3 where ycr defines the shields entrainment function and re is the shear reynolds number a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 a2 b2 c2 d3 e3 a3 b3 c3 d3 and e3 are consequent parameters which are optimized using genetic algorithms gas tool which is a method that searches the optimum solution by generating random number in a defined interval the gas goal is to determine a1 which combines parameters b1 c1 d1 and e1 in rule 1 a2 which combines parameters b2 c2 d2 and e2 and a3 which combines parameters b3 c3 d3 and e3 by using its inherent properties in order to successfully achieve this objective in the beginning chromosome population belonging to firmness variables is picked out randomly in most cases gas is coded in binary 0 1 basis in order to simplify the calculation these digital series are called chromosomes foregoing and present state variables connecting the weights rules of chromosomes formation which is in binary basis digital system is depicted in fig 3 in the chromosome structure depicted in fig 3 a member of state transition rules for rule 1 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 rule 2 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 and rule 3 a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 were presented by 10 bits for each member respectively after being coded in this way the activeness of each chromosome in the community was calculated separately the roulette wheel approach was used to determine the activeness of each chromosome the activeness criterion of the chromosomes was determined according to the difference between the observed data and predicted values the global optimum solution point was reached at the point for which the root mean square error rmse value becomes the smallest the activeness of each chromosome defines whether a chromosome has to stay in or leave the population cross over transaction at gas possesses an important function in shaping the members with more activeness at the community the high activeness of any member defines its survival or otherwise its dismissal the existing generation is varied by using the operators of gas cross over and mutation according to the literature it is likely regarded that after the new member joins the population it becomes closer to the solution in order to attain the objective altunkaynak 2008 in this present study each chromosome in the population was coded with a randomly performed genetic digital series and a cross over between the genes it is called random cross over the randomness was also used to define the cross over s length unlike many other approaches such as the least square method lsm ga generates a vast number of solution points rather than only one solution point therefore gas can reach the global optimum solution among all solution points altunkaynak 2009 altunkaynak 2013 hadi and tombul 2018 in table 1 a comparison between fuzzy logic fl and genetic algorithms gas for their differences is exhibited 2 3 geno fuzzy inference system versus adaptive neural fuzzy inference system adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis is a technique that holds the capacity to self organize its network system and to train the parameters of the system the anfis tool uses the advantage of artificial neural network ann learning algorithms and fuzzy inference systems fis in other words anfis merges the verbal capacity of fis and the numerical capacity of the ann an anfis is defined as a hybrid learning algorithm that utilizes gradient descent and least squares ls methods to improve antecedent premise and consequent parameters respectively though the ls method utilizes derivatives to arrive at an optimal solution this indicates that used functions should always be continuous otherwise optimization procedure fails therefore anfis works definitely under restrictive presumptions such as linearity normality and constant variance özger 2009 akrami et al 2013 kitsikoudis et al 2016 spiliotis et al 2018 hence it can be clearly seen that anfis is inaccurate to deal with highly non linear problems moreover the anfis model parameter estimations are reached by considering the gradient descent and ls methods jang 1993 therefore the basic anfis approach demands differentiable and continuous linear target function at each and every point in the system structure in case of a nonlinear target function it definitely becomes difficult to take derivative and find an optimal solution on the other hand in order to bring a novel solution to the aforementioned problems resulting from anfis approach the novel genofis model was developed by improving consequent part of the sugeno consequent part so that it can be defined at the same time if needed as constant linear and non linear function options to optimize the novel genofis model parameters genetic algorithms gas are used the gas advantages and previous applications are discussed in details by altunkaynak 2010 2013 and also by ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 and najafzadeh et al 2017 and ouyang 2017 the novel genofis application allows that drawbacks presented by the regular sugeno approach are eliminated by a modified fis on the consequent part and at the same time solves the entanglement problems resulting from anfis approach process the entanglement problems are in terms of lack of simplicity and time effectiveness the novel genofis solves the aforementioned entanglement problems by considering equal the number of antecedents premises and consequents therefore the novel genofis reduces the number of if then rules and time used to process the final output finally in this study the shields entrainment function ycr of uniform bed grain particles under unidirectional flow conditions was predicted by using the observed shear reynolds number re additionally a comparative study between novel genofis and anfis is accomplished eventually the novel genofis model is proposed as a novel and practical alternative to the anfis model for modeling the shields entrainment function ycr of uniform bed grain particles in unidirectional flow under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in this study in order to accurately split the data space into accurate fuzzy sets a fuzzy logic clustering method is used in the literature the most cited fuzzy logic clustering approaches are the gustafson kessel gk approach gustafson and kessel 1979 and subtractive clustering sc approach chiu 1996 the gk approach is based on iterative minimization of the objective functions whereas sc is based on non iterative minimization of the objective functions in the present study the sc approach is used to compute the membership functions mfs of the fuzzy inference systems fis by using matlab commercial software together with genetic algorithm optimization operation for both anfis and genofis the selection of the best mfs was made after developing numerous models with different mf structures such as gaussian bell shape trapezoidal triangular and finding that as also supported by moosavi et al 2013 and gholami et al 2017 the gaussian shape is the best to be used fig 4 depicts the flowchart of calculation for both anfis and novel genofis 2 4 performance evaluation criteria solomatine and shrestha 2009 and others have demonstrated that among many other available model evaluation criteria in the literature root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce are most widely utilized and accepted nash and sutcliffe 1970 bowden et al 2013 also mentioned that rmse is a very good indicator of the degree of accuracy of a model hence rmse and ce are utilized to evaluate the performances of anfis and novel genofis models in this present study the following equation is used to calculate the root mean square error rmse 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n ycr pi ycr mi 2 where n is the total number of measurements ycr pi and ycr mi are the predicted and modeled shields entrainment values respectively for a perfect model rmse equals to 0 and as the perfection of a model reduces the inconsistency between the actual data and predicted model values increases rmse value also increases as regards the calculation of efficiency ce following equation is used 11 c e 1 i 1 n ycr pi ycr mi 2 i 1 n ycr mi ycr m 2 where ycr m is the mean predicted shield entrainment value ce of a model is considered acceptable when its values are greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 moreover donigian and love 2003 wang and altunkaynak 2011 and altunkaynak and wang 2012 categorized the performance of a predictive model as follows if ce values are in the range 0 65 0 75 the performance of the model is fair if ce values are in the range 0 75 0 85 the performance is good and if ce results are greater than 0 85 the performance is very good 3 materials and methods 3 1 observed data and data analysis both anfis and novel genofis models were implemented to model the shields entrainment function as indicated in the theory establishment section anfis and genofis models were developed to predict the shields entrainment function for three different shields entrainment function modeling approaches extrapolation base technique shields 1936 which involves determination of critical shear stress values that result from a low or completely a zero reference transport frequency from jointed shear stress and bed load entrainment measurements the visual base technique yalin and karahan 1979 is a direct visual observation of sediment entrainment from a given bed shear stress and development of competence functions wilcock 1988 yalin and da silva 2001 ali and dey 2016 dey and ali 2018 the development of competence functions technique relates the bed shear stress to the entrainment of the biggest sediment particle the results of these predicting models were then evaluated in terms of their performance in predicting the shields entrainment function or dimensionless shear stress the data used herein was collected from three different previous most cited researches in terms of sediment incipient motion exploited data are from yalin and karahan 1979 buffington and montgomery 1997 and yalin and da silva 2001 those data were collected and digitized using the software webplotdigitizer 3 8 fig 5 depicts plots from which the data was collected fig 5b depicts the plot for visual based data yalin and karahan 1979 dey and ali 2018 fig 5a depicts the plot for reference based data buffington and montgomery 1997 and fig 5c depicts the plot for competence based data yalin and da silva 2001 hutter and wang 2016 according to altunkaynak and şen 2007 and özger 2009 each data set should be divided into two groups before the development of the model in order to divide the original dataset into train and test data sets the subset selection of maximum dissimilarity method ssmd is applied the original datasets are divided into 60 for train dataset and 40 for the test dataset kennard and stone 1969 have described the ssmd the ssmd offers the possibility to extract data subsets in a way that the extracted subsets form the original data set contains minimum similarities with maximum dissimilarities assessed between included members moreover the use of ssmd offers the unique possibility to increase the generality in a dataset by extracting data in a way that do not centralize to the special space instead it incorporates the data from the center to the defined dataset boundary lajiness and watson 2008 also stressed that by using the ssmd to divide the original dataset provides highest dissimilarities between subsets that cover the original dataset therefore 60 and 40 remaining of observed data were used for calibration training and to validate the performance of the model respectively in this present study the available data is very diverse as they were collected from different experimental results that used different techniques to define the threshold of the incipient motion of sediment a reference based technique utilizes statistical values rather than full obtained values and thus data collected from this technique demonstrates smaller shear reynolds numbers related to the shields entrainment function values or the dimensionless shear stress than in e g visual technique that was used by yalin and karahan 1979 it can be seen that shear reynolds numbers in table 3 that are higher than those presented in table 2 furthermore table 4 contains data obtained from a development of competence function based technique used by yalin and da silva 2001 as can be seen in table 4 shear reynolds values are even higher than of those in table 2 and table 3 with respect to shields entrainment function which is because the technique used to define the incipient motion relies on selective transport wilcock 1988 the selective transport relates the bed shear stress to the largest mobile grain size jiang and haff 1993 the data collected from the research of yalin and da silva 2001 are exposed in table 4 furthermore statistically an anticipated observation from the collected data shows that the anfis and genofis model results obtained using data from table 2 will likely give higher prediction error due to relatively bigger standard deviation considering the available maximum and minimum shield entrainment function ycr values and shear reynolds number re all data sets were collected from uniform grain material and non viscous fluid base models additionally these data were obtained from laboratory experiments performed for sand bedded open channels under unidirectional flows some of the statistical parameters of the data used herein are presented in table 2 table 3 and table 4 for reference visual and development of competence functions based technique respectively 3 2 application of anfis versus genofis it is well known that the anfis tool allows representing consequent part either as a constant or a linear function this implies that not only a non linear function is not allowed but also the consequent part of the model cannot be represented with both the constant and linear function simultaneously in this present study to overcome the shortcomings of anfis a new model is developed with the combination of modified sugeno fis and gas and named as genofis which is capable of representing the consequent part of the model with constant linear or non linear functions or even with a combination of them at the same time furthermore antecedent and consequent parameters are optimized by the gas tool the anfis and genofis model results are evaluated quantitatively based on rmse and ce values these models are used to define the shields entrainment function as the consequent part of the model by using the shear reynolds number which is selected as the sole antecedent parts of both anfis and genofis models only the shear reynolds number is considered as the sole antecedent value in both models because the models are trained by using data of buffington and montgomery 1997 yalin and karahan 1979 and yalin and da silva 2001 in which only shear reynolds number was used to predict the shields entrainment function table 5 and table 6 present the decision matrix fuzzy rules at the end of the calibration phase for both anfis and genofis models respectively as it can be seen in table 5 anfis tool has a drawback of representing the consequent part of the model either as a constant or a linear function which means that it does not allow representing the consequent part of the model as a constant linear and non linear or integration of them simultaneously because of this disadvantage the anfis model can yield inaccurate results when it comes to non linear problems such as the definition of the shields entrainment function however by reconsidering the same mfs as used for the anfis but this time redefining the parameters of the mfs using gas optimization technique the developed novel genofis provides the ability to represent the consequent part of the sugeno fis as any function such as polynomial logarithmic gaussian etc or combination of them simultaneously after the determination of fis using gas optimization technique the centroid approach for defuzzification process is performed to define the final ycr optimized values in this present study the consequent part of the newly genofis model is defined as polynomial functions for sediment incipient motion or threshold of sediment entrainment under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions see table 6 fuzzy sets applied herein to develop both anfis and genofis models for reference visual and competence techniques are depicted in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively model parameters of gaussian type membership functions for the genofis approach are presented in table 7 and 8 the gas tool was used to optimize the antecedent and consequent parameters for both anfis and genofis models the same number of membership functions was used nine fuzzy sets are depicted as laminar 1 l1 laminar 2 l2 laminar 3 l3 transitional 1 t1 transitional 2 t2 transitional 3 t3 rough 1 r1 rough 2 r2 and rough 3 r3 in turbulent flow fuzzy sets were separated as follows rough 1 r1 rough 2 r2 and rough 3 r3 for reference based approach laminar 1 l1 laminar 2 l2 laminar 3 l3 transitional 1 t1 and rough 1 r1 for visual based approach additionally nine fuzzy sets were used for competence based approach and in the latter fuzzy sets were divided as similarly as in the reference based approach for anfis nine consequent linear outputs with nine fuzzy rules were used whereas for the genofis model all laminar flow sub parts were assigned to one consequent output and the same procedure was performed for the transitional flow and turbulent flow parts by assigning each of them to one consequent output as polynomial functions see table 6 4 results and discussion due to the extremely complex interrelation between the hydrodynamic forces caused by the fluid and the bed sediment particles with different packing conditions and high turbulence that occurs near the bed the developed analytical approaches cannot accurately capture the interrelationship between bed sediment particle and fluid in motion easily dey and ali 2018 the accuracy of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis and novel geno fuzzy inference system genofis models in predicting shields entrainment function ycr is investigated by utilizing shear reynolds number re as input for three different techniques namely reference visual and competence based techniques 123 73 and 50 data points were used for reference competence and visual based techniques respectively for the development of the model 72 43 and 30 data points were used for training calibration phase and remaining 51 30 and 20 data points were used for testing phase prediction for reference competence and visual based techniques respectively anfis and newly developed genofis models were simulated and fuzzy sets of the models are obtained after the training phase for anfis and developed genofis models which are depicted in figs 6 7 and 8 also the decision matrix rule bases is demonstrated in tables 5 and 6 in the anfis model the antecedent fuzzy sets and consequent parameters are trained by an artificial neural network ann and least square method respectively whereas genofis model trains antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters only by the gas tool the consequent parameters of anfis and genofis models for reference competence and visual based techniques are presented in table 5 and table 6 respectively in table 6 the equations chosen to assume the processes in the consequent part of the genofis model are presented for three different techniques these functions were chosen after the optimization of the generalized consequent part of the genofis presented in theory establishment section geno fuzzy inference system subsection artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural network ann fuzzy logic fl and genetic programming gp are black box modeling tools likewise the proposed novel genofis and anfis models are also black box methods which transform the input data to output data mathematically not using physical concepts in this study the consequent functions are generated by published data which was divided into two parts for training calibration and validation prediction phases moreover antecedent parameters fuzzy sets and consequent parameters consequent functions are optimized with training calibration data by utilizing the gas tool subsequently genofis model is validated with remaining testing data furthermore knowing that the sediment entrainment behave in a different way following the type of flow conditions ebtehaj et al 2017 spiliotis et al 2018 wan mohtar et al 2018 the novel genofis model trained with the ga and compared to the published experimental data yalin and karahan 1979 buffington and montgomery 1997 yalin and da silva 2001 generated the best optimal functions for the consequent part of the improved sugeno fuzzy inference system as presented in table 6 consequently the novel genofis model offers a practical solution to mathematically represent the behavior of sediment entrainment in all types of individual boundaries and flow conditions by offering different types of functions at the same time unlike anfis that offers only linear or constant functions and not both in the same model the constant parameters of functions consequent outputs of genofis model for laminar transitional and turbulent flows with reference competence and visual based techniques after ga training and optimization processes are presented in tables 7 and 8 respectively in this study we applied the pawn approach to investigate the sensitivity for shear reynolds number re as a sole input for all performed models in all hydrodynamic flow conditions pawn approach was explained in details by pianosi and wagener 2015 pawn is an abbreviation derived from pianosi and wagener pawn approach allows investigating the propagation of shear reynolds number re uncertainty and sensitivity when used a sole input to predict the shields entrainment function under hydrodynamically smooth transitional and rough flow conditions we therefore consider the model output which is the shields entrainment function when the predicted ycr values are highly correlated to the observed ycr values under feasible ranges or confidence ranges of variation of re as given in table 9 the confidence ranges are computed and defined in a way that model training with the defined range would exhibit a sensible output performance the pawn approach to defining the sensibility of model parameters uses a coefficient of determination r2 that is evaluated between computed and observed outcome according to pianosi and wagener 2015 any model input parameter is defined as sensitive to the model output when an r2 is higher than 60 r2 60 r2 is defined as follows 12 r 2 1 var e var q where var e defines the variance of training stochastic terms or errors and var q defines the variance of observed shields entrainment values the confidence ranges were defined moreover for the confidence level definition in this study an approach discussed by brase and brase 2009 was applied the confidence band for the dataset means μ is defined as 13 x t c s n x t c s n where tc defines the critical values for the data distribution for confidence level c x defines the mean value s is the sample standard deviation n define the number of sampled data the validation of the confidence interval is qualified as a dynamic approach in the categorization process because it requires executing the model as also stressed by banks 1998 and petty 2012 the validation process involves a comparative approach petty 2012 during this process an observed shields entrainment function value ycr is compared to the shield entrainment value ycr obtained when the model is executed for the specific confidence range or band and the value performance is recorded moreover r2is calculated for the computed and observed outcome with an estimate of a confidence limit separately for individual boundaries generated from the confidence bands and flow conditions presented in this study the results are presented in table 9 accordingly pandis 2015 discussed in detail how to calculate confidence limits the parametric outcomes described in table 9 for the sensitivity analysis by using the pawn approach indicate an increase of the sensitivity for the shear reynolds number re as an input towards the output which is the shields entrainment function ycr when genofis was performed this means that the genofis model has successfully better trained even data samples that remain very distant from the mean of the sampled data than the anfis model performance of these two models was evaluated using rmse and ce as indicator criteria good prediction accuracy was yielded by the anfis and genofis approaches where solely shear reynolds number was used as input into the models results of rmse and ce values are illustrated in table 10 it can be seen that rmse values of anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques are found to be 6 84 10 3 4 77 10 3 2 19 10 3 whereas 2 33 10 3 1 93 10 3 9 35 10 4 are the rmse values of genofis model for reference competence and visual based techniques are found to be respectively obviously the genofis model provided relatively smaller rmse values than the anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques this implies that the genofis model yielded better prediction accuracy of shields entrainment function than the anfis model for all techniques for the anfis model ce values under reference competence and visual based techniques are calculated as 0 95 0 98 and 0 98 and for the genofis model ce values are found as 0 98 0 99 and 0 99 respectively the genofis model has relatively smaller rmse values and relatively bigger ce values compared to the anfis model moreover a number of inputs processing time and if then rules number are presented in table 10 for comparative purposes both anfis and novel genofis used one single input however in order to reach the final results 9 5 and 9 if then rules have been applied for anfis based models for reference visual and competence based approach respectively whereas 3 3 and 3 if then rules have been applied for genofis based models for reference visual and competence based approach respectively this shows that genofis model has reduced significantly the entanglement that results from using more if then rules in a given fuzzy model jovanovic et al 2004 akrami et al 2013 in table 4 also the anfis and genofis processing time are presented for reference visual and competence based approaches slightly anfis based models have exhibited shorter periods for the processing of the final results compared to the novel genofis but overall the novel genofis based model exhibited better performance than anfis following the evaluation criteria shown in table 10 consequently this present study has chosen genofis as the best model following its smaller rmse and the larger ce values as aforementioned and presented in table 10 based on these indicator criteria the prediction accuracy of the shields entrainment function by genofis model is much better than the anfis model for reference competence and visual based techniques according to the calculated ce values from prediction values of anfis and developed genofis models both models have exhibited very good performance in terms of shields entrainment function prediction however genofis model performed superior to the anfis model for all shields entrainment functions ycr furthermore rmse values calculated from genofis model results are lower than those calculated from the anfis model results for reference visual and competence based techniques rmse values of anfis and genofis models obtained from the reference based data are higher than in visual and competence based models because of previous discussed high fluctuations available in buffington and montgomery data as it can be seen from the standard deviation in table 2 this definitely indicates that the predicted ycr values by novel genofis model are significantly better than those of ycr values predicted by the anfis model by referring to donigian and love 2003 and altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 and taking evaluation criteria rmse and ce into consideration the performance of anfis model for prediction of shields entrainment function under reference competence and visual based techniques is good whereas the prediction performance of genofis model is very good additionally the predictions of shields entrainment function ycr by anfis and genofis and corresponding observed values of shields entrainment function versus shear reynolds number re values are plotted in a logarithmic scale as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively considering re and referring to shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 and many other researchers in the present study anfis and novel genofis results show that for small re numbers re 1 5 shields entrainment values are strongly dependent on shear reynolds number re for larger values of shear reynolds number shields entrainment values become independent from shear reynolds numbers and approximate to a constant value for re 3 according to fig 9 the predicted shields entrainment values by genofis model tend to follow exactly the observed shields entrainment data of reference approach while the anfis model prediction values also captured the observed shields entrainment data clearly the genofis model results follow the corresponding observed shields entrainment data of reference approach closer than the anfis model results as regards the visual approach fig 10 revealed that the prediction values of genofis model quiet captured the observed shields entrainment data better than the anfis model results for the competence approach fig 11 shows that the genofis model results are exactly matched with the corresponding observed shields entrainment data of competence approach under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions whereas the anfis model values follow the observed data closely for smooth flow condition but particularly for transitional condition over predicted the observed data and for rough flow condition under predicted observed data this means that the prediction performance of the anfis model is particularly fair for competence approach under transitional and rough flow conditions however it has been observed that the performance of genofis model is enhanced with relatively larger sets of experimental data besides genofis performed very well for visual and reference based models compared to reference based data this is because the used data of yalin and karahan 1979 and yalin and da silva 2001 visual and reference based models was collected under deterministic approaches whereas reference based data used herein was collected by using a deterministic approach considering only statistical values therefore it was not possible for the reference based approach to represent the extreme and lowest crisp values which eventually help to define fuzzy sets and allow capturing the available initial and extreme shield entrainment conditions in fuzzification process the high viscous forces present in smooth flow condition were overcome by assigning higher fuzzy membership degrees to lower shear reynolds numbers in order to make them be part of the fuzzy rough 3 r3 set which corresponds to extreme shield entrainment values gaussian mf types were used in all hydrodynamic flow conditions because of the advantage of gaussian distribution in which variables tend towards a normal distribution the latter was therefore very useful because of the available experimental data used herein that had considerable fluctuations buffington and montgomery 1997 using developed genofis model for high shear reynolds values in gravel bedded rivers gravel bedded rivers which were used by buffington and montgomery 1997 shield entrainment values varied in range 0 056 0 076 and completely stayed in the range described by buffington and montgomery 1997 in gravel bedded river under rough flow conditions additionally genofis model performed very well for visual and competence based models where shields entrainment values for rough flow conditions varied between 0 042 and 0 048 and 0 041 0 046 for visual and competence respectively these results completely encapsulate the findings of yalin and karahan 1979 miller et al 1977 and yalin and da silva 2001 where shields entrainment values under rough flow conditions were found to be 0 045 0 047 and 0 043 respectively on top of that the novel genofis model offers the ability to define the shields entrainment function ycr that initiates the sediment entrainment for each and every defined corresponding shear reynolds number re in all flow conditions unlike previous researchers who defined the critical dimensionless shear stress in turbulent flows only shields 1936 yalin and karahan 1979 yalin and da silva 2001 cao et al 2006 tamburrino et al 2016 the results of this present study revealed that developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model in predicting shields entrainment data in all techniques for smooth transitional and rough flow conditions the observed shields s entrainment function versus predicted shields entrainment function by anfis and genofis models for the reference competence and visual based approaches are plotted with the exact line 1 1 in fig 12 the visual investigation of these figures indicates a strong consistency exhibited between predicted shields entrainment function values by anfis and genofis models and corresponding observed shields entrainment function data as shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 12a the prediction results of the genofis model for the reference based approach quietly scattered around the exact line while the scattering is slightly more for the predicted values by anfis around exact line compared to genofis model results this means that genofis model has a very good performance in terms of prediction of shields entrainment function for the reference based approach likewise fig 12b illustrates the results of anfis and genofis models and corresponding observed data of the competence based approach distributed around the exact line the predicted values of genofis mode matched almost exactly with the corresponding observed data of competence based approach while the anfis model results exhibit a good agreement with observed data which implies that genofis model has relatively better accuracy than anfis model for competency based approach this is to say that the developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model for prediction of shields entrainment function using observed data of the reference and competence based approaches similarly the predicted values by genofis model remarkably follow the data of visual based approach as depicted in fig 6c on the other hand the results of the anfis model is slightly scattered around the exact line referring to the relatively lower performance of the anfis model for visual based approach data consequently the results of this present study indicate that the incorporation of modified sugeno fis approach and gas tool further improved the accuracy of genofis model significantly for the reference competence and visual based approaches it is to note that the developed genofis model can accurately predict shields entrainment function better than the anfis model without expensive computation effort for all three different techniques that were used to define the threshold of the sediment incipient motion under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions the genofis and anfis model results are compared with experimental data quantitatively and qualitatively and close similarity is found under all hydrodynamic flow conditions additionally the processing time of a model is so important in order to be more useful nowadays in this study the processing time used for the training process of both anfis and genofis for 1000 iterations was recorded 586 s 476 s and 425 s were recorded for the training process of reference visual and competence based anfis models whereas 936 s 742 s and 695 s were recorded for the training process of reference visual and competence based genofis models consequently competence based anfis model has the least output processing time whereas competence based genofis model has the highest output processing time in general the training process using genetic algorithms gas for genofis manifested relatively longer output processing time while converging to the final solution compared to artificial neural networks based anfis 5 conclusions adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis tool is based on sugeno fuzzy inference system sugeno fis however the anfis model has a shortcoming in defining the consequent part of the model that is it could only be represented either as a constant or a linear function this implies that anfis is not capable of describing consequent part of the model simultaneously as a constant linear non linear or combination of them in this present study geno fuzzy inferences system genofis is introduced with the incorporation of improved sugeno fis and genetic algorithms gas tool which improved the accuracy significantly in predicting the shields entrainment values the anfis and developed genofis models are implemented to predict sediment incipient motion by utilizing the reference competence and visual based data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions respectively the prediction performance of the anfis and genofis models is evaluated quantitatively by taking calculated root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ce values into consideration clearly developed genofis model outperformed the anfis model for the reference competence and visual based data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions based on rmse and ce values as performance criteria moreover the prediction performance of the anfis and genofis models is investigated in terms of visual analysis the anfis and novel genofis performances were evaluated in predicting the instantaneous shields entrainment values ycr which is defined in terms of shear reynolds number re in sand bedded open channels under unidirectional flow regime the genofis exhibited higher performance than conventional anfis model in predicting the shields entrainment values for all considered data under smooth transitional and rough flow conditions in this present study sand beds with uniform packing and direction under unidirectional flow were considered these considerations helped the fuzzy expert system to define the shields entrainment values for the initiation of motion from weak to general motion of sediments under all hydrodynamic flow conditions and to define the fuzzy transition of motion that varies from weak to general motion the fuzzy transition was defined with shields entrainment values in terms of fuzzy sets as a result developed genofis is recommended to be used in predicting the shields entrainment values in gravel and sand bedded open channels with uniform packing and direction of sediment particles under unidirectional flow and in all hydrodynamic flow conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding publishing this article acknowledgment the authors are very thankful to the editor in chief and all reviewers for their insightful comments that helped to improve the clarity of the final paper
