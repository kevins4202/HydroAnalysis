25135,contagious processes such as fire and seed dispersal may affect landscape structure composition and dynamics and are in turn modulated by structural landscape attributes vegetation fire self reinforcing processes that lead to the dominance of either pyrophyllic or pyrophobic vegetation are well documented worldwide but it remains unclear how the interaction between spatial aggregation and contagious processes influences the dynamics of dichotomous landscapes we subjected landscapes composed by patches of pyrophyllic and pyrophobic cells to increasing frequencies of random ignitions to assess which spatial configuration may promote long term coexistence i e resilient landscapes and which ones may lead to dominance by either community i e alternative states our results indicate that aggregation favors the persistence and resilience of pyrophyllic communities whereas the resilience of pyrophobic ones is enhanced by landscape fragmentation aggregation promotes larger fires whereas fragmentation favors seed dispersal these two processes being related to total pyrophyllic core area and total pyrophobic edge respectively we propose that highly fragmented landscapes may facilitate the recovery of pyrophobic communities from fire events by affecting both the dynamics of fire and colonization large numbers of pyrophobic patches function as an immolating network of partial firebreaks that reduce fire size providing more opportunities for colonization and facing a lower individual risk of patch destruction through fire landscape attributes that reduce flammability at the local scale such as rocky outcrops creeks wetlands and roads may fragment pyrophyllic communities thereby enhancing the resilience of pyrophobic ones the resilience of pyrophyllic communities on the other hand will mainly depend on the size of their largest patches even at low ignition frequencies keywords cross scale interactions contagious processes spatially explicit modeling alternative states resilience 1 introduction contagious processes affect landscapes structure composition and dynamics and their rate of spread and recurrence is in turn modulated by landscapes structure and composition holling 1973 peterson 2002a 2002b turner 1989 fire is a contagious process that modulates vegetation dynamics of many terrestrial ecosystems and accordingly fire spread is modulated by the flammability structure and composition of the vegetation patches in the landscape kitzberger and veblen 1999 ne et al 1999 perry and enright 2002 ryan 2002 landscapes with plant communities that increase in flammability as they age are generally composed by shifting steady states mosaic of patches of different post fire age where young stands act as firebreaks modulating the size of the fires hargrove et al 2000 turner 1989 zedler and seiger 2000 zinck and grimm 2009 conversely landscapes that show a hump shaped relationship between vegetation flammability and age may display alternative stable states at the landscape level kitzberger et al 2012a dichotomous landscapes composed by alternative states of fire intolerant communities i e dominated by species that are able to re colonize the post fire community only by seeds dispersed from unburned patches hereafter pyrophobic and fire adapted communities i e dominated by heliophylous resprouting species able to rapidly recover after fire hereafter pyrophyllic may be especially sensitive to changes in ignition frequency kitzberger et al 2016 perry et al 2014 perry and enright 2002 in these landscapes increasing frequency intensity and or size of fire promotes the retraction of pyrophobic plant communities and their replacement by pyrophyllic ones the expansion of pyrophyllic communities promotes further increases in fire size and or frequency at the landscape level cochrane et al 1999 schaffhauser et al 2012 leading in some cases to landscape homogenization lloret et al 2003 loepfe et al 2010 long term reduction in fire frequency on the other hand may lead to the expansion and coalescence of pyrophobic plant communities characterized by low flammability and a concomitant reduction in fire size and frequency glitzenstein et al 1995 gowda et al 2012 peterson 2002a petit and lambin 2002 while these positive feedbacks between vegetation and fire are well documented in many dichotomous landscapes worldwide there are few simple theoretical models that explore the effect of landscape heterogeneity on its resilience to changes in disturbance regime peterson 2002b turner 2010 1989 van de leemput et al 2017 zinck and grimm 2009 simulation models based on empirical data perry and enright 2002 pausas 2006 and field based studies paritsis et al 2015 tiribelli et al 2018 indicate that pyrophyllic fire tolerant light demanding plant communities expand during periods of high fire frequency whereas pyrophobic fire intolerant plant communities persist during these periods because of their low intrinsic flammability but may need long periods of low fire frequency to expand again in the landscape through seed dispersal few models however explore the importance of landscapes configuration and seed dispersal on the transition from pyrophyllic towards pyrophobic plant communities perry et al 2015 peterson 2002a seed dispersal like fire spread is a contagious process that can be strongly influenced by landscapes heterogeneity being the main mechanism behind the expansion of pyrophobic plant communities and ultimately for the resilience of dichotomous landscapes to changes in fire regime the main objective of this simulation was to explore the effect of landscape configuration on its response to changes in ignition frequency in order to do that we developed a spatially explicit model where landscapes composed by pyrophyllic and pyrophobic elements with different levels of aggregation were subjected to increasing ignition frequencies we analyzed the interaction between fire seed dispersal from pyrophobic patches landscape structure and ignition frequency at three scales patch community and landscape through repeated periods of 1000 years of simulation to assess which scale reflected the magnitude and direction of the above named processes key model parameters such as seed dispersal reproductive age and flammability were adjusted to reflect empirical studies from temperate forests of northern patagonia where dichotomous landscapes composed by pyrophobic and pyrophyllic communities have received increasing attention during the last decade blackhall et al 2017 gowda et al 2012 kitzberger et al 2016 kitzberger and veblen 1999 landesmann et al 2016 mermoz et al 2005 paritsis et al 2015 tiribelli et al 2018 2 methods 2 1 general model description in order to assess the effects of landscape configuration and fire frequency in the landscapes resilience and resistance we developed a spatially explicit model implemented in seles seles fall and fall 1999 the model comprises two hierarchical levels cells and landscape there are two contagious processes that take place fire spread and seed dispersal cells represent a 30 x 30 m pixel 0 09 ha and the landscape is equivalent to a 3600 ha square grid 200 200 cells that varies in vegetation composition and time since fire this allowed us to adjust the flammability of the vegetation to produce fires of similar size of historical ones from northern patagonia the model simulates fires and regeneration in annual time steps and simulation runs comprise 1000 years the model was wrapped or toroidal to avoid border effects we ran the model on four landscapes with increasing degrees of initial fragmentation ranging from 1 fully aggregated to 190 patches fully fragmented of each plant community fig 1 the whole script of the model is detailed in annex 1 and the original model with its input layers and output folders has been uploaded to the mendeley depository linked to this article 2 2 main landscape elements 2 2 1 cell variables vegetation type every cell in the landscape has one of two fuel types pyropyillic or pyrophobic pyrophyllic represents a plant community which immediately resprouts after fire and increases its flammability until reaching an asymptote fig 2 whenever a cell is burned it is classed as pyrophyllic regardless of its former identity pyrophobic represents an obligate seeder community of fire intolerant plants that invade pyrophyllic cells in their vicinity after reaching maturity at this age its flammability will be reduced fig 2 time since fire tsf after a cell burns its tsf is reset to 0 tsf increases by one for every year the cell does not burn and ranges from 0 to n years tsf was set to 200 years for all cells in initial landscapes time since establishment tse after a cell burns tse is reset to 0 if a pyrophobic seed establishes in a pyrophillic cell its tse turns into 1 and every year without a new fire it increases by one year tse was set to 200 years for all pyrophobic cells in initial landscapes 2 2 1 1 model overview and scheduling the model is composed by three main events with an established order fire takes place before dispersal which is followed by ageing and succession fig 3 illustrates the main dynamics of the interaction between pyropyllic and pyrophobic communities 2 3 fire event we assumed that every simulated year has a fire season when ignitions occur the number of ignitions per year is predetermined and will not change throughout the simulation ignitions are started randomly throughout the landscape unsuccessful ignitions i e ignitions that do not burn the recipient cell will trigger a new ignition a successful ignition may spread fires to the four adjacent cardinal cells that is no diagonal spread with probability p determined by the recipient cells the baseline p pphytic is a function of tsf as described by li et al 1997 p p h y l l t i c k 1 1 e x p a 1 b 1 t s f where a1 is indicative of the age at which the slope changes b1 controls the speed of the slope increase and k1 defines the asymptote of the function being the maximum flammability that both pyrophyllic and pyrophobic cells can reach table 1 for pyrophobic cells a second logistic term is added to pphyll to trigger a reduction of p kitzberger et al 2012b p p h o b i c p p h y l l 1 k 2 1 e x p a 2 b 2 t s e where k2 defines the magnitude of the reduction in flammability with age as a proportion of k1 the parameter a2 regulates the age at which the slope starts to decrease and b2 controls the speed of the decrease following li et al 1997 the parameters for pphyll are set to a1 4 b1 0 25 and k1 0 5 in all simulations whereas the parameters for pphobic are set to a2 16 b2 0 27 and k2 0 2 table 1 this combination will result in a maximum pphyll 0 5 at tsf 80 years and a pphobic 0 4 after tse 120 fig 2 fire kills all seeds resetting both tse and tsf fig 3 this emulates the observed successional patterns in nw patagonia i e paritsis et al 2015 landesmann et al 2015 2016 tiribelli et al 2018 2 4 dispersal and succession events pyrophobic cells disperse seeds every year to neighboring pyrophyllic cells fig 3 whenever a pyrophyllic cell receives a seed tse is set to 1 tsf will increase every year regardless of whether it receives a seed or not whereas tse will only increase early after receiving a seed the succession from pyrophyllic to pyrophobic takes place when tse r where r represents reproductive age r tse80 i e trees have to be 80 years to start dispersing to neighboring cells for all runs fig 3 2 5 aggregation scenarios and ignition frequency we generated four scenarios of increasing cell aggregation using the static model generator tool of seles fall and fall 1999 we generated four neutral models with two elements pyrophyllic and pyrophobic allowing for full contagion and initiating the aggregation process at 1 100 1000 and 10 000 seeding cells s1 s2 s3 s4 fig 1 table 2 this generates landscapes with random patterns of patch size and shape with a single patch of each community for the fully aggregated landscape s1 and up to 190 patches for the fully fragmented one s4 table 2 fig 1 we subjected the four landscapes to three frequencies of ignition 1 every two years t1 one per year t2 and two per year t3 table 2 with more than two ignitions per year pyrophyllic dominates all landscape configurations 2 6 data handling and analyses we ran ten repetitions of the model for each treatment t and structure s extracting the following data for each combination every 50 years total area ta total core area tca number of patches np total edge te largest patch lp edges were defined as one cell contours of all patches of a given community we registered the total area burned tab the number of pyrophyllic and pyrophobic cells burned at each fire and the number of pyrophyllic cells that received pyrophobic seeds every year to assess the persistence of either community at the pixel level we recorded its identity throughout the run cells with 70 of the run time i e 700 years as either pyrophyllic or pyrophobic were considered persistent whereas the others were considered transitional depicted in grey in fig 1 all metrics were calculated while running in seles with 50 year intervals between output rows persistence maps were recalculated from final seles outputs in idrisi selva version 17 02 clark labs 2014 statistical tests were conducted in statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 to assess the relation between initial structure fire and regeneration we restricted the dataset to the final 50 years of the runs i e four landscape structures three treatments 10 replicates n 120 for all comparisons the relations between fire regeneration and community metrics are based on single final values of independent runs after 1000 years of being subjected to the above named 12 combinations of treatments t1 t3 and structures s1 s4 spearman correlation coefficients ϱ were calculated in statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 2 7 fire regime to test whether landscape structure modulated fire regime and how this interaction was affected by increasing ignition frequency we registered the extent of every fire during the whole simulation period as well as the area of each plant community affected fire regimes were analyzed for the whole landscape throughout the 1000 years of the runs fire regimes where defined as the number of fires by size class that affected the whole landscape throughout the simulation time excluding the first 200 years see kitzberger et al 2012 for further details and presented as log log frequency functions of fire sizes i e power functions with 50 pixel intervals between size classes landscapes that show a steeper slope for a given number of ignitions will be subjected to lower fire recurrence landscapes that respond to increasing ignition frequency with a reduction in the size of large fires are considered to be fire prone whereas landscapes that respond to increasing ignition frequency with an increment in fire size are considered to be fire sensitive kitzberger et al 2012a b 3 results 3 1 effects of initial structure and ignition frequency in general spatial aggregation had a positive effect on cover and persistence of pyrophyllic cells whereas spatial fragmentation favored pyrophobic cover and persistence table 2 fig 1 low and intermediate ignition frequencies had no significant effect on cover and persistence of either community in the fully aggregated landscape whereas they triggered the expansion of the pyrophobic community in the highly fragmented landscapes table 2 fig 4 the lowest ignition frequency promoted a slow transition towards the dominance of pyrohobic elements in the highly aggregated landscape and the opposite trend at intermediate fire frequency fig 4 under low and intermediate ignition frequencies the number of pyrophobic patches showed no significant changes for aggregated landscapes and a continuous reduction in number of patches associated with increments in area cover for fragmented ones indicating that under low and intermediate ignition frequencies fragmentation favors the coalescence of pyrophobic patches fig 4 and a concomitant loss of core area of pyrophyllic ones table 2 high ignition frequency leads to a retraction of pyrophobic cover regardless of landscape configuration having a larger effect on cover and persistence of this community in intermediately fragmented landscapes table 2 fig 4 landscape structure modulated the effect of high ignition frequency throughout the simulation period table 2 fig 4 in fully and highly aggregated landscapes the expansion of pyrophyllic cover was paralleled by increasing fragmentation of pyrophobic patches i e increasing number of patches coupled with decreasing area cover fig 4 during the first 500 years in initially aggregated landscapes followed by a loss in both number of patches and area of this community during the remaining time fig 4 landscapes of high initial fragmentation showed a continuous reduction of total pyrophobic patches and area fig 4 ignition frequency and initial landscape structure explained most of the variance inpyrophobic cover and persistence after 1000 years anova n 120 adj r2 0 98 p 0 0001 and adj r2 0 96 p 0 0001 respectively there was a significant interaction between these variables indicating that the effect of ignition frequency on persistence and cover of pyrophobic cells was influenced by initial landscape structure key structural metrics such as total edge te number of patches np and total core area tca of pyrophobic elements were also significantly affected by both initial structure and fire frequency anova n 120 adj r2 0 94 p 0 0001 adj r2 0 82 p 0 0001 and adj r2 0 94 p 0 0001 respectively indicating that initial landscape structure was an important determinant of the effects of fire throughout the simulation period regardless of ignition frequency both communities generated patches of high persistence surrounded by highly dynamic transition zones fig 1 the extent of these transition zones was influenced by initial structure and fire frequency anova n 120 adj r2 0 95 p 0 0001 with a significant interaction between these variables fully fragmented or aggregated landscapes develop narrow transitional zones that expand with increasing ignition frequency whereas intermediately fragmented landscapes are characterized by a wider transitional zone which is less influenced by ignition frequency fig 1 annex 2 3 2 structural drivers of fire and regeneration most community metrics i e nr size core area and edge of patches showed a high degree of correlation with each other being also highly related with area burned and new pyrophobic cells annex 3 we highlight those that showed the highest correlation with fire and succession total core area of pyrophyllic communities was positively related with total area burned ϱ 0 937 as well as with burned pyrophyllic cells ϱ 0 937 showing no significant correlation with pyrophobic area burned ϱ 0 19 n 120 annex 3 total pyrophyllic edge showed the most significant correlation with pyrophobic area burned ϱ 0 900 annexes 3 4 whereas total pyrophobic edge showed the most significant correlation with new pyrophobic cells ϱ 0 957 annexes 3 4 3 3 effects of landscape structure and ignition frequency on fire regime the combined effects of initial landscape structure and ignition frequency led to very different fire regimes fig 4 in aggregated landscapes increasing ignition frequency resulted in an increment in the number of small fires and a reduction in the size of large fires fig 5 a and b whereas in fragmented landscapes increasing fire ignition frequency led to an increment in both number and size of fires fig 5c and d 4 discussion spatial heterogeneity modulates the dynamics of interactions between organisms and their susceptibility to contagious processes determining their resistance i e capacity to resist and resilience i e capacity to recover to them holling 1973 differential susceptibility to contagious processes such as herbivory fire and succession may determine the retraction of some species or functional groups and their replacement by other leading to alternative states at the landscape level hargrove et al 2000 holling 1973 sibold et al 2006 turner et al 1989 even though fire is a contagious disturbance that has a negative short term effect on most plants and animals it may favor the expansion of organisms adapted to survive them or colonize recently burned areas ryan 2002 our results indicate that spatial aggregation of vegetation patches with different flammability and sensitivity to fire may favor the resistance and resilience of pyrophyllic plant communities whereas spatial fragmentation of these communities may trigger the expansion of pyrophobic ones under scenarios of low ignition frequencies fig 1 table 2 many tropical and temperate forests of the southern hemisphere have evolved under conditions of low natural ignition frequencies and may therefore have a high sensitivity to human related increments in fire frequency cochrane et al 1999 kitzberger et al 2016 kitzberger and veblen 1999 perry and enright 2002 empirical evidence indicates that in these systems wildfires promote the replacement of obligate seeder pyrophobic species by plant communities characterized by rapid growth resprouting capacity and high flammability mcwethy et al 2013 odion et al 2010 suding et al 2004 van nes and scheffer 2005 we propose that spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic communities may promote a higher fire recurrence at the landscape level perry et al 2014 perry and enright 2002 veblen et al 2008 even though these fires may mostly burn through pyrophyllic plant communities malamud et al 2005 mermoz et al 2005 morales et al 2015 they will reduce the resilience of pyrophobic plants by killing their regeneration and increasing the flammability of the boundaries between plant communities cochrane et al 1999 paritsis et al 2015 perry and enright 2002 peterson 2002a the positive feedback between the spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic elements and fire may eventually drive the whole landscape to a new fire driven state where periods of low ignition frequencies are characterized by larger fires fig 5 a b unless structural features of the landscape favor the persistence of pyrophobic patches conversely the expansion of some pyrophobic forests following fire suppression in modern times glitzenstein et al 1995 gowda et al 2012 luger and moll 1993 mouillot et al 2005 peterson 2002b staver et al 2011 may partly be attributed to the persistence of small patches that served as fire refuges for pyrophobic species along lake shores rocky outcrops and creeks camp et al 1997 landesmann et al 2015 schwilk and keeley 2006 the expansion of these species may lead to fragmentation of pyrophyllic patches due to successional processes and a reduction in fire size fig 5 c d in general the maintenance of dichotomous landscapes affected by fires has been associated with heterogeneity in structural attributes such as soil humidity and productivity equator facing slopes natural firebreaks and precipitation as well as with the variation in natural and human related ignitions glitzenstein et al 1995 heyerdahl et al 2001 kitzberger and veblen 1999 li et al 1997 high aggregation of pyrophobic communities may confer them a higher resistance to increasing ignition frequencies fig 1 3 but is also be associated with a lower resilience as indicated by a lack of expansion in scenarios of low ignition frequencies table 1 figs 2 3 resilience of pyrophobic communities may be enhanced by spatial landscape fragmentation through three mechanisms 4 1 immolating firebreaks our results indicate that pyrophobic patches function as firebreaks reducing the extent of fires of neighboring pyrophyllic parches annex 4 in highly fragmented landscapes pyrophobic patches may get partially or totally burned during individual fires but they reduce the probability of fire spread directly affecting fire size loepfe et al 2010 proposed that fine grain discontinuity in fuel bed might reduce the spread of large fires patches of pyrophobic elements embedded by pyrophyllic communities may provide this discontinuity thereby reducing both fire size and fuel homogenization changes in the rate of spread of fires have been proposed as an effective way of reducing their size and severity finney 2004 2001 4 2 higher colonization opportunities small pyrophobic patches scattered throughout the landscape enhance the potential for colonization as compared with large aggregated ones because the ratio between perimeter and area diminishes with size we restrained seed dispersal distance to the closest neighboring pyrophyllic cell setting a high initial age for reproduction 80 years after establishment even in this conservative scenario our results indicate that regardless of ignition frequency fragmentation enhances the resilience of pyrophobic communities through a higher total edge that favors seed dispersal fig 5c and annex 4 4 3 lower overall risk of patch destruction the probability that any given pyrophobic patch will be completely destroyed during a fire event decreases with its size due to a lower fire spread probability but the risk of being partially affected by successive fires will increase proportionately small pyrophobic patches may face a higher individual risk of total destruction when affected by a fire due to a higher edge with pyrophyllic elements fig 5c however as these patches act as partial firebreaks with high edge to area ratio they face a lower average risk of destruction due to reduction in fire size finney 2004 a higher rate of colonization and a higher probability for regeneration of reaching maturity before next fire reaches the same area our results are well in line with empirical observations indicating that fire regimes are influenced by the landscape heterogeneity camp et al 1997 highly fragmented landscapes will respond to increasing frequency of ignitions with larger and more frequent fires reinforcing a fire loop that may lead to the expansion of pyrophyllic patches if high ignition frequencies are maintained but also to the coalescence of pyrophobic patches whenever ignition frequency is reduced fig 1 in highly aggregated landscapes on the other hand a reduction in ignition frequency will lead to larger fires and no net reduction in total area affected by fire fig 1 therefore pyrophobic plant communities may be in general more affected by fires in landscapes characterized by large spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic elements than in those showing a high degree of heterogeneity 4 4 fragmentation resilience and management if we assume that the mechanisms outlined above reflect some simplified version of the observed fire dynamics in dichotomous landscapes we may conclude that the expansion of pyrophobic communities during periods of fire suppression will be favored in naturally heterogeneous landscapes that reduce fire spread and intensity camp et al 1997 ryan 2002 areas historically dominated by pyrophobic plant communities that are currently affected by increasing ignition frequencies may face a higher risk of destruction due to a structural degradation associated with a growing transitional edge with pyrophyllic plant communities cochrane et al 1999 moreover the concomitant aggregation of a more flammable plant community may respond to reductions in ignition frequency with increments in size and severity heyerdahl et al 2001 protecting forest remnants along creeks rocky outcrops and even in small patches spread across shrublands grasslands agricultural land and roads may enhance the recovery potential of pyrophobic communities during periods of low ignition frequency long periods of fire suppression will trigger successional processes along transitional zones where young pyrophobic elements may reduce the horizontal continuity of fuel while incrementing its vertical continuity with surrounding pyrophobic ones paritsis et al 2015 the transition zones between both communities may therefore be of special interest for understanding the resilience of the whole landscape to contagious processes landscapes with wide transition zones are probably more resilient to fluctuations in fire regimes than those characterized by narrow transition zones peterson 2002a the practice of leaving fragments of mature pyrophobic forests during harvesting operations has gained recent support in many regions where management incorporates a network of old growth forests fragments to secure the maintenance of biodiversity and favor natural regeneration driscoll et al 2010 franklin et al 2002 pastur et al 2009 this practice may enhance the resilience of pyrophobic forests through a combined effect of smaller fires and higher rates of regeneration at the other end of the continuum in regions where forests have been managed through long term fire suppression active burning of small patches has become a common practice for retaining some fire adapted species in the landscape nicklason and granstrom 2013 in these systems recurrent burning of pyrohyllic patches may prevent establishment of pyrophobic species and promote the expansion of transitional zones peterson 2002a as the core area of a pyrohyllic patch increases the frequency of ignitions needed to maintain it free of propagules will decrease this relation being dependent on its intrinsic flammability its recovery rate after fire memory sensu peterson 2002b as well as the dispersal ability of neighboring pyrophobic species their growth rate and flammability the concept of resilience of landscapes composed by two communities that respond differently to a disturbance is still diffuse we propose that resilience of dichotomous landscapes may be defined as their capacity to favor the coexistence of competing communities without long term displacement of one by the other in this case landscapes with intermediate fragmentation may lead to a dynamic balance between the expansion of pyrophyllic patches promoted by fire and their replacement by pyrophobic ones promoted by successional processes author contributions jhg conceived and designed the study analyzed the data and wrote the paper ft contributed to conceptual frame

reinforcing processes that lead to the dominance of either pyrophyllic or pyrophobic vegetation are well documented worldwide but it remains unclear how the interaction between spatial aggregation and

the whole script of the model is detailed in annex 1 and the original model with its input layers and output folders has been uploaded to the mendeley depository linked to this article 2 2 main landscape elements 2 2 1 cell variables vegetation type every cell in the landscape has one of two fuel types pyropyillic or pyrophobic pyrophyllic represents a plant community which immediately resprouts after fire and increases its flammability until reaching an asymptote fig 2 whenever a cell is burned it is classed as pyrophyllic regardless of its former identity pyrophobic represents an obligate seeder community of fire intolerant plants that invade pyrophyllic cells in their vicinity after reaching maturity at this age its flammability will be reduced fig 2 time since fire tsf after a cell burns its tsf is reset to 0 tsf increases by one for every year the cell does not burn and ranges from 0 to n years tsf was set to 200 years for all cells in initial landscapes time since establishment tse after a cell burns tse is reset to 0 if a pyrophobic seed establishes in a pyrophillic cell its tse turns into 1 and every year without a new fire it increases by one year tse was set to 200 years for all pyrophobic cells in initial landscapes 2 2 1 1 model overview and scheduling the model is composed by three main events with an established order fire takes place before dispersal which is followed by ageing and succession fig 3 illustrates the main dynamics of the interaction between pyropyllic and pyrophobic communities 2 3 fire event we assumed that every simulated year has a fire season when ignitions occur the number of ignitions per year is predetermined and will not change throughout the simulation ignitions are started randomly throughout the landscape unsuccessful ignitions i e ignitions that do not burn the recipient cell will trigger a new ignition a successful ignition may spread fires to the four adjacent cardinal cells that is no diagonal spread with probability p determined by the recipient cells the baseline p pphytic is a function of tsf as described by li et al 1997 p p h y l l t i c k 1 1 e x p a 1 b 1 t s f where a1 is indicative of the age at which the slope changes b1 controls the speed of the slope increase and k1 defines the asymptote of the function being the maximum flammability that both pyrophyllic and pyrophobic cells can reach table 1 for pyrophobic cells a second logistic term is added to pphyll to trigger a reduction of p kitzberger et al 2012b p p h o b i c p p h y l l 1 k 2 1 e x p a 2 b 2 t s e where k2 defines the magnitude of the reduction in flammability with age as a proportion of k1 the parameter a2 regulates the age at which the slope starts to decrease and b2 controls the speed of the decrease following li et al 1997 the parameters for pphyll are set to a1 4 b1 0 25 and k1 0 5 in all simulations whereas the parameters for pphobic are set to a2 16 b2 0 27 and k2 0 2 table 1 this combination will result in a maximum pphyll 0 5 at tsf 80 years and a pphobic 0 4 after tse 120 fig 2 fire kills all seeds resetting both tse and tsf fig 3 this emulates the observed successional patterns in nw patagonia i e paritsis et al 2015 landesmann et al 2015 2016 tiribelli et al 2018 2 4 dispersal and succession events pyrophobic cells disperse seeds every year to neighboring pyrophyllic cells fig 3 whenever a pyrophyllic cell receives a seed tse is set to 1 tsf will increase every year regardless of whether it receives a seed or not whereas tse will only increase early after receiving a seed the succession from pyrophyllic to pyrophobic takes place when tse r where r represents reproductive age r tse80 i e trees have to be 80 years to start dispersing to neighboring cells for all runs fig 3 2 5 aggregation scenarios and ignition frequency we generated four scenarios of increasing cell aggregation using the static model generator tool of seles fall and fall 1999 we generated four neutral models with two elements pyrophyllic and pyrophobic allowing for full contagion and initiating the aggregation process at 1 100 1000 and 10 000 seeding cells s1 s2 s3 s4 fig 1 table 2 this generates landscapes with random patterns of patch size and shape with a single patch of each community for the fully aggregated landscape s1 and up to 190 patches for the fully fragmented one s4 table 2 fig 1 we subjected the four landscapes to three frequencies of ignition 1 every two years t1 one per year t2 and two per year t3 table 2 with more than two ignitions per year pyrophyllic dominates all landscape configurations 2 6 data handling and analyses we ran ten repetitions of the model for each treatment t and structure s extracting the following data for each combination every 50 years total area ta total core area tca number of patches np total edge te largest patch lp edges were defined as one cell contours of all patches of a given community we registered the total area burned tab the number of pyrophyllic and pyrophobic cells burned at each fire and the number of pyrophyllic cells that received pyrophobic seeds every year to assess the persistence of either community at the pixel level we recorded its identity throughout the run cells with 70 of the run time i e 700 years as either pyrophyllic or pyrophobic were considered persistent whereas the others were considered transitional depicted in grey in fig 1 all metrics were calculated while running in seles with 50 year intervals between output rows persistence maps were recalculated from final seles outputs in idrisi selva version 17 02 clark labs 2014 statistical tests were conducted in statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 to assess the relation between initial structure fire and regeneration we restricted the dataset to the final 50 years of the runs i e four landscape structures three treatments 10 replicates n 120 for all comparisons the relations between fire regeneration and community metrics are based on single final values of independent runs after 1000 years of being subjected to the above named 12 combinations of treatments t1 t3 and structures s1 s4 spearman correlation coefficients ϱ were calculated in statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 2 7 fire regime to test whether landscape structure modulated fire regime and how this interaction was affected by increasing ignition frequency we registered the extent of every fire during the whole simulation period as well as the area of each plant community affected fire regimes were analyzed for the whole landscape throughout the 1000 years of the runs fire regimes where defined as the number of fires by size class that affected the whole landscape throughout the simulation time excluding the first 200 years see kitzberger et al 2012 for further details and presented as log log frequency functions of fire sizes i e power functions with 50 pixel intervals between size classes landscapes that show a steeper slope for a given number of ignitions will be subjected to lower fire recurrence landscapes that respond to increasing ignition frequency with a reduction in the size of large fires are considered to be fire prone whereas landscapes that respond to increasing ignition frequency with an increment in fire size are considered to be fire sensitive kitzberger et al 2012a b 3 results 3 1 effects of initial structure and ignition frequency in general spatial aggregation had a positive effect on cover and persistence of pyrophyllic cells whereas spatial fragmentation favored pyrophobic cover and persistence table 2 fig 1 low and intermediate ignition frequencies had no significant effect on cover and persistence of either community in the fully aggregated landscape whereas they triggered the expansion of the pyrophobic community in the highly fragmented landscapes table 2 fig 4 the lowest ignition frequency promoted a slow transition towards the dominance of pyrohobic elements in the highly aggregated landscape and the opposite trend at intermediate fire frequency fig 4 under low and intermediate ignition frequencies the number of pyrophobic patches showed no significant changes for aggregated landscapes and a continuous reduction in number of patches associated with increments in area cover for fragmented ones indicating that under low and intermediate ignition frequencies fragmentation favors the coalescence of pyrophobic patches fig 4 and a concomitant loss of core area of pyrophyllic ones table 2 high ignition frequency leads to a retraction of pyrophobic cover regardless of landscape configuration having a larger effect on cover and persistence of this community in intermediately fragmented landscapes table 2 fig 4 landscape structure modulated the effect of high ignition frequency throughout the simulation period table 2 fig 4 in fully and highly aggregated landscapes the expansion of pyrophyllic cover was paralleled by increasing fragmentation of pyrophobic patches i e increasing number of patches coupled with decreasing area cover fig 4 during the first 500 years in initially aggregated landscapes followed by a loss in both number of patches and area of this community during the remaining time fig 4 landscapes of high initial fragmentation showed a continuous reduction of total pyrophobic patches and area fig 4 ignition frequency and initial landscape structure explained most of the variance inpyrophobic cover and persistence after 1000 years anova n 120 adj r2 0 98 p 0 0001 and adj r2 0 96 p 0 0001 respectively there was a significant interaction between these variables indicating that the effect of ignition frequency on persistence and cover of pyrophobic cells was influenced by initial landscape structure key structural metrics such as total edge te number of patches np and total core area tca of pyrophobic elements were also significantly affected by both initial structure and fire frequency anova n 120 adj r2 0 94 p 0 0001 adj r2 0 82 p 0 0001 and adj r2 0 94 p 0 0001 respectively indicating that initial landscape structure was an important determinant of the effects of fire throughout the simulation period regardless of ignition frequency both communities generated patches of high persistence surrounded by highly dynamic transition zones fig 1 the extent of these transition zones was influenced by initial structure and fire frequency anova n 120 adj r2 0 95 p 0 0001 with a significant interaction between these variables fully fragmented or aggregated landscapes develop narrow transitional zones that expand with increasing ignition frequency whereas intermediately fragmented landscapes are characterized by a wider transitional zone which is less influenced by ignition frequency fig 1 annex 2 3 2 structural drivers of fire and regeneration most community metrics i e nr size core area and edge of patches showed a high degree of correlation with each other being also highly related with area burned and new pyrophobic cells annex 3 we highlight those that showed the highest correlation with fire and succession total core area of pyrophyllic communities was positively related with total area burned ϱ 0 937 as well as with burned pyrophyllic cells ϱ 0 937 showing no significant correlation with pyrophobic area burned ϱ 0 19 n 120 annex 3 total pyrophyllic edge showed the most significant correlation with pyrophobic area burned ϱ 0 900 annexes 3 4 whereas total pyrophobic edge showed the most significant correlation with new pyrophobic cells ϱ 0 957 annexes 3 4 3 3 effects of landscape structure and ignition frequency on fire regime the combined effects of initial landscape structure and ignition frequency led to very different fire regimes fig 4 in aggregated landscapes increasing ignition frequency resulted in an increment in the number of small fires and a reduction in the size of large fires fig 5 a and b whereas in fragmented landscapes increasing fire ignition frequency led to an increment in both number and size of fires fig 5c and d 4 discussion spatial heterogeneity modulates the dynamics of interactions between organisms and their susceptibility to contagious processes determining their resistance i e capacity to resist and resilience i e capacity to recover to them holling 1973 differential susceptibility to contagious processes such as herbivory fire and succession may determine the retraction of some species or functional groups and their replacement by other leading to alternative states at the landscape level hargrove et al 2000 holling 1973 sibold et al 2006 turner et al 1989 even though fire is a contagious disturbance that has a negative short term effect on most plants and animals it may favor the expansion of organisms adapted to survive them or colonize recently burned areas ryan 2002 our results indicate that spatial aggregation of vegetation patches with different flammability and sensitivity to fire may favor the resistance and resilience of pyrophyllic plant communities whereas spatial fragmentation of these communities may trigger the expansion of pyrophobic ones under scenarios of low ignition frequencies fig 1 table 2 many tropical and temperate forests of the southern hemisphere have evolved under conditions of low natural ignition frequencies and may therefore have a high sensitivity to human related increments in fire frequency cochrane et al 1999 kitzberger et al 2016 kitzberger and veblen 1999 perry and enright 2002 empirical evidence indicates that in these systems wildfires promote the replacement of obligate seeder pyrophobic species by plant communities characterized by rapid growth resprouting capacity and high flammability mcwethy et al 2013 odion et al 2010 suding et al 2004 van nes and scheffer 2005 we propose that spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic communities may promote a higher fire recurrence at the landscape level perry et al 2014 perry and enright 2002 veblen et al 2008 even though these fires may mostly burn through pyrophyllic plant communities malamud et al 2005 mermoz et al 2005 morales et al 2015 they will reduce the resilience of pyrophobic plants by killing their regeneration and increasing the flammability of the boundaries between plant communities cochrane et al 1999 paritsis et al 2015 perry and enright 2002 peterson 2002a the positive feedback between the spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic elements and fire may eventually drive the whole landscape to a new fire driven state where periods of low ignition frequencies are characterized by larger fires fig 5 a b unless structural features of the landscape favor the persistence of pyrophobic patches conversely the expansion of some pyrophobic forests following fire suppression in modern times glitzenstein et al 1995 gowda et al 2012 luger and moll 1993 mouillot et al 2005 peterson 2002b staver et al 2011 may partly be attributed to the persistence of small patches that served as fire refuges for pyrophobic species along lake shores rocky outcrops and creeks camp et al 1997 landesmann et al 2015 schwilk and keeley 2006 the expansion of these species may lead to fragmentation of pyrophyllic patches due to successional processes and a reduction in fire size fig 5 c d in general the maintenance of dichotomous landscapes affected by fires has been associated with heterogeneity in structural attributes such as soil humidity and productivity equator facing slopes natural firebreaks and precipitation as well as with the variation in natural and human related ignitions glitzenstein et al 1995 heyerdahl et al 2001 kitzberger and veblen 1999 li et al 1997 high aggregation of pyrophobic communities may confer them a higher resistance to increasing ignition frequencies fig 1 3 but is also be associated with a lower resilience as indicated by a lack of expansion in scenarios of low ignition frequencies table 1 figs 2 3 resilience of pyrophobic communities may be enhanced by spatial landscape fragmentation through three mechanisms 4 1 immolating firebreaks our results indicate that pyrophobic patches function as firebreaks reducing the extent of fires of neighboring pyrophyllic parches annex 4 in highly fragmented landscapes pyrophobic patches may get partially or totally burned during individual fires but they reduce the probability of fire spread directly affecting fire size loepfe et al 2010 proposed that fine grain discontinuity in fuel bed might reduce the spread of large fires patches of pyrophobic elements embedded by pyrophyllic communities may provide this discontinuity thereby reducing both fire size and fuel homogenization changes in the rate of spread of fires have been proposed as an effective way of reducing their size and severity finney 2004 2001 4 2 higher colonization opportunities small pyrophobic patches scattered throughout the landscape enhance the potential for colonization as compared with large aggregated ones because the ratio between perimeter and area diminishes with size we restrained seed dispersal distance to the closest neighboring pyrophyllic cell setting a high initial age for reproduction 80 years after establishment even in this conservative scenario our results indicate that regardless of ignition frequency fragmentation enhances the resilience of pyrophobic communities through a higher total edge that favors seed dispersal fig 5c and annex 4 4 3 lower overall risk of patch destruction the probability that any given pyrophobic patch will be completely destroyed during a fire event decreases with its size due to a lower fire spread probability but the risk of being partially affected by successive fires will increase proportionately small pyrophobic patches may face a higher individual risk of total destruction when affected by a fire due to a higher edge with pyrophyllic elements fig 5c however as these patches act as partial firebreaks with high edge to area ratio they face a lower average risk of destruction due to reduction in fire size finney 2004 a higher rate of colonization and a higher probability for regeneration of reaching maturity before next fire reaches the same area our results are well in line with empirical observations indicating that fire regimes are influenced by the landscape heterogeneity camp et al 1997 highly fragmented landscapes will respond to increasing frequency of ignitions with larger and more frequent fires reinforcing a fire loop that may lead to the expansion of pyrophyllic patches if high ignition frequencies are maintained but also to the coalescence of pyrophobic patches whenever ignition frequency is reduced fig 1 in highly aggregated landscapes on the other hand a reduction in ignition frequency will lead to larger fires and no net reduction in total area affected by fire fig 1 therefore pyrophobic plant communities may be in general more affected by fires in landscapes characterized by large spatial aggregation of pyrophyllic elements than in those showing a high degree of heterogeneity 4 4 fragmentation resilience and management if we assume that the mechanisms outlined above reflect some simplified version of the observed fire dynamics in dichotomous landscapes we may conclude that the expansion of pyrophobic communities during periods of fire suppression will be favored in naturally heterogeneous landscapes that reduce fire spread and intensity camp et al 1997 ryan 2002 areas historically dominated by pyrophobic plant communities that are currently affected by increasing ignition frequencies may face a higher risk of destruction due to a structural degradation associated with a growing transitional edge with pyrophyllic plant communities cochrane et al 1999 moreover the concomitant aggregation of a more flammable plant community may respond to reductions in ignition frequency with increments in size and severity heyerdahl et al 2001 protecting forest remnants along creeks rocky outcrops and even in small patches spread across shrublands grasslands agricultural land and roads may enhance the recovery potential of pyrophobic communities during periods of low ignition frequency long periods of fire suppression will trigger successional processes along transitional zones where young pyrophobic elements may reduce the horizontal continuity of fuel while incrementing its vertical continuity with surrounding pyrophobic ones paritsis et al 2015 the transition zones between both communities may therefore be of special interest for understanding the resilience of the whole landscape to contagious processes landscapes with wide transition zones are probably more resilient to fluctuations in fire regimes than those characterized by narrow transition zones peterson 2002a the practice of leaving fragments of mature pyrophobic forests during harvesting operations has gained recent support in many regions where management incorporates a network of old growth forests fragments to secure the maintenance of biodiversity and favor natural regeneration driscoll et al 2010 franklin et al 2002 pastur et al 2009 this practice may enhance the resilience of pyrophobic forests through a combined effect of smaller fires and higher rates of regeneration at the other end of the continuum in regions where forests have been managed through long term fire suppression active burning of small patches has become a common practice for retaining some fire adapted species in the landscape nicklason and granstrom 2013 in these systems recurrent burning of pyrohyllic patches may prevent establishment of pyrophobic species and promote the expansion of transitional zones peterson 2002a as the core area of a pyrohyllic patch increases the frequency of ignitions needed to maintain it free of propagules will decrease this relation being dependent on its intrinsic flammability its recovery rate after fire memory sensu peterson 2002b as well as the dispersal ability of neighboring pyrophobic species their growth rate and flammability the concept of resilience of landscapes composed by two communities that respond differently to a disturbance is still diffuse we propose that resilience of dichotomous landscapes may be defined as their capacity to favor the coexistence of competing communities without long term displacement of one by the other in this case landscapes with intermediate fragmentation may lead to a dynamic balance between the expansion of pyrophyllic patches promoted by fire and their replacement by pyrophobic ones promoted by successional processes author contributions jhg conceived and designed the study analyzed the data and wrote the paper ft contributed to conceptual frame

25136,as the most populous country over the world china has great pressure on food and resources security in this study we set the national economy of china as a whole system and apply supply chains analysis based on the input output structures to identify the food water linkage food energy linkage and the energy water linkage in the system the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute most use of resource in supply chains animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat contribute large amount of embodied water consumption while agriculture other food sector and animal husbandry sector consumes most embodied primary energy although the direct primary energy use by animal husbandry sector is not significant meanwhile by importing or exporting resources international trade impacts on the resources flow through input output structures when making polices the interactions of various resources and international trade should be considered by applying food energy water nexus fewn approach keywords food energy water nexus structural chains input output analysis 1 introduction according to the un world urbanization prospects 2018 at the mid year of 2018 the world s population has reached 7 63 billion people and it is expected to reach around 9 77 billion people by 2050 in particular more people live in urban areas rather than in rural areas with 55 of the world s population residing in urban areas until 2018 in 1950 only 30 of the world s population lived in cities however by 2050 68 of the world s population will live in cities since the increase in demands of food energy and water driven by population growth urbanization and economic development the supplies of these three resources face significant challenges traditional thinking treats energy water and food in completion owen et al 2018 in fact these three factors are relevant it is clear that water and energy are the crucial inputs along the whole food supply chain e g from production of rice and wheat to harvesting processing storage and transportation energy production process consumes a large amount of water while a lot of energy consumption is embodied during the production and distribution of water it is essential to focus on the interrelationships and dependencies between them nexus thinking represents a sustained effort to recognize the interconnections among the three resources and uses an integrated perspective on the management of them al saidi and elagib 2017 sharmina et al 2016 actually policies need to look at the interlinks that one policy target on one resource inevitably has effects on another one wang et al 2017 the food energy water nexus fewn analyses integrate these three factors into an interconnected system investigating the relationships among them while considering the impacts from human activities the fewn is widely used in analyses of ecological processes and for the resources management studies approach the nexus by using a variety of methods tools and frameworks al ansari et al 2015 balkema et al 2002 chang et al 2015 feng et al 2014 hamiche et al 2016 li et al 2018 mannan et al 2018 nair et al 2014 a difficulty in nexus issue is the lack of a unified base for energy and water flow analysis which hinders sustainable energy and water resource utilization wang et al 2017 given that input output analysis ioa serves as a foundation for defining the relations among the three resources as one of the main methodologies for evaluating the interactions between economic factors and natural resources it provides effective tools to investigate both the physical flows and monetary flows through economic trade networks and detects the driving force of resources consumption from an economic structure perspective fang and chen 2017 su et al 2013 the ioa method is useful to examine the interactions and trade offs between multiple entities for example applying ioa method both direct and indirect flows embodied in interactive chains of production and consumption both direct and indirect flows can be investigated chen and chen 2015 this framework can be used in a wide range such as different metabolic flows in urban metabolism chen and chen 2017 global trade of energy duan and chen 2017 virtual water tracking yang et al 2012 from the perspective of nexus ioa approach also applies an effective way to assessing the supply and demand relations between the food energy and water resources on the global level yang et al 2012 apply ecological network analysis to shed insight into the complicated system interactions and find that control and utility relations can well depict the mutual relation in trade system and direct observable relations differ from integral ones with indirect interactions considered holland et al 2015 reveal that energy driven pressures on freshwater resources and the consequences of energy production should be considered when designing policy chen et al 2018a follow nexus thinking to expound global land water nexus by tracking agricultural land and freshwater use flows along the global supply chains and reveal that developed countries e g usa and japan and major large developing economies e g mainland china and india are the overriding drivers of agricultural freshwater comsumption globally on the national level white et al 2018 demonstrate the hidden virtual flows of water energy and food embodied in intra regional and transnational inter regional trade they claim that china s prioritization of economic growth and trade in low value added and pollution intensive sectors consumes a great amount of nexus resources within its territory to satisfy consumers demands in japan and south korea owen et al 2018 take uk as a case use input output analysis techniques to investigate the interaction between the energy water and food impacts of products and recognize that strategies that aim to reduce environmental impacts should not harm the socioeconomic well being of the uk on the regional level chen et al 2018b present a demonstration of the water energy mixed unit input output approach by analyzing hong kong and its associated hinterland in mainland china their study shows that the current water infrastructures will meet the demand for water treatment in 2050 and suggests that all types of water for energy and energy for water will increase by 7 8 9 by using beijing as an example chen and chen 2015 find that the impact of nexus on energy networks is larger than water networks and the most urban sectors rely on manufacturing in the energy water nexus similarly wang et al 2017 propose a modified input output analysis which provides a unified framework to balance urban energy and water comsumption by using the case of beijing the results show that manufacture provides the largest outflow of hybrid energy and agriculture is the largest receiver compared with beijing yang et al 2018 find that shanghai is facing greater environmental challenges in the process of urban sustainability as the world s most populous country and fastest growing economy china has a population of 1 42 billion people and keeps fast economic growth rate during the last three decades with the development in society and economy china has great challenges in food energy and water in particular china is poor of water resources with 2300 m3 of per capita availability which is less than one third of the world s average guan and hubacek 2008 china s per capita water availability is low and unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally which is inconsistent with the rising socio economic need for water jiang 2015 therefore to investigate the relations among food energy and water in china from the perspective of nexus thinking is valuable to the global food and resources security the study by qin et al 2015 shows that future energy plans could conflict with the industrial water policy but the amount of water used in the energy sector is highly dependant on technology choices especially for power plant cooling they predict high electricity demand in the future is expected to be met mainly by coal and nuclear power and planned inland development of nuclear power presents a new source of freshwater demand in the study of wu and chen 2017 all the input items are inclusively inventoried as products of the economy the previous analysis shows that the industrial water use induced by the solar power plant infrastructure is revealed to be over one order of magnitude higher than that in previous scoping however there is still lack uniform way to investigate the process of the integrated framework in scientific analysis especially few studies focus on the supply chains of these three resources in china we thus introduce the supply chains analysis based on the ioa method to present the details of impact among food energy and water in this study we apply taylor s series expansion to show the supply chains impact particular stage 0 represents direct impacts and stage 1 10 represent indirect impacts 2 methodology and data 2 1 framework for water energy and food nexus in this study china is considered as a system while considering the physical exchange of the whole system with outside there are two approaches for the resources flow into the whole system from outside by one approach the resources flow from the environment boundary into the system for example water flows from the natural environment into agriculture forestry sector animal husbandry sector fishery sector and the sector of production and distribution of water similarly energy flows from the environment into the economic system by the sector of mining washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas by the other approach the resources flow into or out of the system through international trade while considering the monetary and physical flows in the system it is both an economic system and an ecological system as an economic system values flow throughout a network among interdependent economic sectors via the input output relations as an ecological system water and energy flows from the original components to other sectors via the input output links which are revealed in the monetary input output tables specially for each sector the consumed resources can be identified as for direct use or indirect use by investigation the supply chains this analysis provides more information on the interactions among food water and energy 2 2 accounting resources flow in a typical io analysis the leontief equation can be expressed as follows 1 x i a 1 y l y where x is a n 1 vector representing output of each sector l i a 1 is leontief inverse and i is the n n unity matrix a stands for the technology coefficient matrix n n y is the n 1 vector of sectoral final demand 2 f e x ˆ where f is a 1 n vector which represents resources flows from the environment to the whole system by n sectors e is the resources use coefficient vector referring to resources directly explored from the environment per unit of output the symbol ˆ indicates a diagonal matrix using eqs 1 and 2 the total resources consumption can be rewritten as 3 p e l y ˆ where p is a 1 n vector shows the embodied resources consumption by each sector 2 3 supply chains analysis following owen et al 2018 the leontief inverse l can be expanded by taylor s series 4 l i a a 2 a 3 a n applying eq 4 to eq 3 p can be expanded as 5 p e i y ˆ e ˆ a y e ˆ a 2 y e ˆ a 3 y e ˆ a n y where e ˆ a k y calculates the impact from the k t h stage in production the stages in production are defined to recognize the direct and indirect relations in the supply chains as e ˆ i y is the original resources consumption which directly from the environment driven by final demand y of each sector e ˆ a y is the direct resources consumption which is from the input output structure in particular a y is the inputs from other industries and e ˆ a y represents the resources supplied to each sectors through the materials inflow from the original component in the next stage these sectors require inputs of a a y along with e ˆ a 2 y of water or energy is supplied furthermore the supply chains can be expanded infinitely similar with the stage 2 e ˆ a t y t 2 shows the indirect resources consumption to evaluate the interlinkages of food and natural resources we apply eq 5 to identify the supply chains of food production by using matlab 2 4 data sources we used the monetary input output tables for 2012 obtained from nbsc national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china the original input output database includes 139 sectors the water withdrawal data were collected from the china statistical yearbook on environment 2013 the energy production data is from the china energy statistical yearbook and is measured in standard coal equivalent as table 1 listed there are 16 sectors related with agriculture or food manufacture 3 results and discussion 3 1 food water linkages all of the agriculture and food manufacture sectors jointly consumed 2408 10 billion m3 embodied water accounted to 39 98 of total embodied water consumption by the whole system in 2012 it is clear that water is the essential fundamental for food table 2 shows the embodied water consumption driven by final demand of agriculture and food manufacture sectors in china at 2012 in terms of total embodied water consumption animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat fishery other food sector processing of fruit sector vegetables nuts and other agriculture food sector and manufacture of grain mill products were the leading embodied water consumer all of them consumed more than 100 billion m3 embodied water compared with other sectors these are still remarkable among all of the 139 sectors the largest water consumer is the production and distribution of water with the amount of 961 53 billion m3 of embodied water followed by animal husbandry sector agriculture construction of buildings and slaughtering and processing of meat fig 1 shows the top 10 embodied water consumers and the green bars represent agriculture and food manufacturing sectors furthermore we divided the total embodied water consumption into direct or indirect water consumption at different stages by taylor s expansion in eq 5 fig 2 shows the different water use in supply chains from stage 0 to stage 10 of the top 10 water use agriculture and food manufacture sectors for agriculture animal husbandry sector and fishery the highest water use in stage 0 of the supply chains because water directly flows into these three sectors from the environmental boundary these four sectors are the original component for water resources where is the beginning of water flows in the whole system for most of other agriculture and food manufacture sector stage 1 contains the largest water use this is because majority of immediate productions for food manufacture are from agriculture forestry and fishing sectors and these immediate products contain a large amount of water use specially other food sector is an exception in stage 2 other food sector still has large indirect water consumption it reveals that besides immediate productions made by the original component of water other food sector uses a large amount of other input these inputs are not made in the original component sectors but using a lot of products from original component after stage 2 the indirect water consumption decreases sharply 3 2 food energy linkages all of the 16 agriculture and food manufacture sectors jointly use 404 75 million ton embodied minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent of coal accounting for 13 60 of total minerals use for energy production use in the whole system among these 16 sectors agriculture uses the largest amount of embodied minerals use for energy production with 78 15 million ton minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent of coal followed by other food sector and animal husbandry which use 59 29 and 58 58 million ton equivalent coal measured embodied minerals use for energy production respectively to understand the interaction relations between food and energy we use taylor s series in eq 5 to show the minerals use for energy production flow in the supply chains of agriculture and food manufacture as fig 3 shows minerals use for energy production the embodied minerals use for energy production in the agriculture and food manufacture specifics has some typical features first the embodied minerals use for energy production flow impact at stage 0 is zero since the minerals use for energy production only flows into the economic system through the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas in the 16 sectors it doesn t exit a channel for minerals flow from the nature to agriculture or food manufacture second in the stage 1 the impact of embodied energy consumption conducted in supply chains is also zero in all sectors this result indicates that the input output analysis shows these 16 sectors rarely use primary energy third in stage 3 the indirect uses of minerals for energy production in the 16 sectors are significant this impact composed two sources of energy one is the use of electricity which is product by primary energy and the other is from the immediate products in which use primary energy as immediate inputs compared with the decomposition of embodied water in section 3 1 the impact of embodied minerals use for energy production during stage 0 to stage 10 is more flexible the impacts declined in a slower rate in most sectors the embodied minerals use for energy production keep a high amount even in stage 8 also the decrease varies among sectors for example in agriculture the impacts are significant during the whole period 3 3 water energy linkages besides agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery sectors the sector of production and distribution of water is another original component for water as a node water flows into the system from the environment boundary in the sector of production and distribution of water and flows into other sectors by the supply chains this sector consumes 0 12 million ton minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent coal as fig 4 shows in the first two stages the embodied minerals use for energy production equals zero the results show the sector of production and distribution of water does not consume primary energy furthermore from stage 2 to stage 6 the impact of embodied minerals use for energy production is significant and variable while investigating water consumption for energy production the water uses for various purposes the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas are for the energy flow from the natural environment to the human s social and economic activities the production and distribution of electricity and heats sector is to convert and transport energy the embodied water consumption of the sector of production and distribution of electricity and heats is 13 91 billion m3 as fig 5 shows in stage 2 the energy production sector consumes largest embodied water and the impacts of its use decline through supply chains the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas use little embodied water instead of consumed resources sector i generate resources for the national system by trade more exactly these sectors save water from net flows in the international trade 3 4 discussion in this article we investigate the national economy of china as a whole system it is crucial to identify the entry points in the national level system instead of distribution resources from the environment and trade to all sectors in this framework resources e g water and miners used for energy production enter the system only through agriculture and energy production sectors this way help to trace the resources flows more exactly what is more it shows the resources flow through intermediate inputs before final demand the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute largest use of resource in supply chains there is no doubt studies by applying different methods all admit the fact that agriculture is the largest consumer of resources however besides the nexus thinking the contribution of energy consumption in animal husbandry is not always revealed as its embodied use of primary energy is low in stage 0 2 it shows that not only this sector does not consume energy directly but its inputs do not consume energy significantly however the immediate products for its inputs consumes a large amount of energy like the tracing of embodied energy the investigation on supply chains help us to understand the virtual flows of the resources and reveal both the direct and indirect relations among them globalization increases the products and resources flows all over the world to make policies in global view and nexus thinking it is skeptical to realize the impact of international trade on resources the nexus analysis based on ioa method provides an efficient way to reveal and manage tradeoffs between monetary flows and physical flows of resources the analysis on supply chains shows not only goods flows in international trade but also resources flow in or out a country by trade if the net import of sector i is large and its international trade impact exceeds impact generated in production proceeds the embodied resources impact of sector i will be negative that is to say instead of consuming resources sector i generate resources for the national system by trade the results show that the forestry sector contributes both water and energy to the whole system the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas contributes water to the system in traditional trade theory exports can bring monetary flow to a country and the development of export industries have benefited from the trade however driving by the nexus thinking the exporters bore the burden of scarce resources with the production of exports for the benefit of importers on the contrary the international trade brings benefits to importers especially in the sectors which rely on a large amount of inputs in resources e g agriculture and manufacturing of food since people enjoy the final use but not burden the scarcity natural resources the investigations of supply chains evaluate the ripples through the international trade and provide practical ways to decrease the trade deflect with other countries 4 conclusion in this paper china s economic activities are taken into consider as a whole system in this system we apply supply chains analysis based on input output structures to identify the different type of resource use we focus on several linkages including the linkages between social and economic activities and the natural environment the food water linkage the food energy linkage and the energy water linkages the energy and water sectors provide immediate inputs for each other the impact at stage 0 represents the resources directly extracted from nature only the original component sectors directly consume resources by this way the impact at stage 1 represents primary energy consumption or water consumption from agriculture or the sector of production and distribution of water at most cases this is the largest impact the impacts after stage 2 combine effects from both the secondary energy virtual water and the other immediate productions the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute most use of resource in supply chains animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat jointly contribute large amount of embodied water consumption while agriculture other food sector and animal husbandry sector consumes most embodied primary energy although the direct primary energy use by animal husbandry sector is not significant meanwhile by importing or exporting resources international trade impacts on the resources flow through input output structures as a result when making polices the interactions of various resources and international trade are need to be considered by applying food energy water nexus fewn approach acknowledgement this study is supported by the fundamental

25136,as the most populous country over the world china has great pressure on food and resources security in this study we set the national economy of china as a whole system and apply supply chains analysis based on the input output structures to identify the food water linkage food energy linkage and the energy water linkage in the system the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute most use of resource in supply chains animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat contribute large amount of embodied water consumption while agriculture other food sector and animal husbandry sector consumes most embodied primary energy although the direct primary energy use by animal husbandry sector is not significant meanwhile by importing or exporting resources international trade impacts on the resources flow through input output structures when making polices the interactions of various resources and international trade should be considered by applying food energy water nexus fewn approach keywords food energy water nexus structural chains input output analysis 1 introduction according to the un world urbanization prospects 2018 at the mid year of 2018 the world s population has reached 7 63 billion people and it is expected to reach around 9 77 billion people by 2050 in particular more people live in urban areas rather than in rural areas with 55 of the world s population residing in urban areas until 2018 in 1950 only 30 of the world s population lived in cities however by 2050 68 of the world s population will live in cities since the increase in demands of food energy and water driven by population growth urbanization and economic development the supplies of these three resources face significant challenges traditional thinking treats energy water and food in completion owen et al 2018 in fact these three factors are relevant it is clear that water and energy are the crucial inputs along the whole food supply chain e g from production of rice and wheat to harvesting processing storage and transportation energy production process consumes a large amount of water while a lot of energy consumption is embodied during the production and distribution of water it is essential to focus on the interrelationships and dependencies between them nexus thinking represents a sustained effort to recognize the interconnections among the three resources and uses an integrated perspective on the management of them al saidi and elagib 2017 sharmina et al 2016 actually policies need to look at the interlinks that one policy target on one resource inevitably has effects on another one wang et al 2017 the food energy water nexus fewn analyses integrate these three factors into an interconnected system investigating the relationships among them while considering the impacts from human activities the fewn is widely used in analyses of ecological processes and for the resources management studies approach the nexus by using a variety of methods tools and frameworks al ansari et al 2015 balkema et al 2002 chang et al 2015 feng et al 2014 hamiche et al 2016 li et al 2018 mannan et al 2018 nair et al 2014 a difficulty in nexus issue is the lack of a unified base for energy and water flow analysis which hinders sustainable energy and water resource utilization wang et al 2017 given that input output analysis ioa serves as a foundation for defining the relations among the three resources as one of the main methodologies for evaluating the interactions between economic factors and natural resources it provides effective tools to investigate both the physical flows and monetary flows through economic trade networks and detects the driving force of resources consumption from an economic structure perspective fang and chen 2017 su et al 2013 the ioa method is useful to examine the interactions and trade offs between multiple entities for example applying ioa method both direct and indirect flows embodied in interactive chains of production and consumption both direct and indirect flows can be investigated chen and chen 2015 this framework can be used in a wide range such as different metabolic flows in urban metabolism chen and chen 2017 global trade of energy duan and chen 2017 virtual water tracking yang et al 2012 from the perspective of nexus ioa approach also applies an effective way to assessing the supply and demand relations between the food energy and water resources on the global level yang et al 2012 apply ecological network analysis to shed insight into the complicated system interactions and find that control and utility relations can well depict the mutual relation in trade system and direct observable relations differ from integral ones with indirect interactions considered holland et al 2015 reveal that energy driven pressures on freshwater resources and the consequences of energy production should be considered when designing policy chen et al 2018a follow nexus thinking to expound global land water nexus by tracking agricultural land and freshwater use flows along the global supply chains and reveal that developed countries e g usa and japan and major large developing economies e g mainland china and india are the overriding drivers of agricultural freshwater comsumption globally on the national level white et al 2018 demonstrate the hidden virtual flows of water energy and food embodied in intra regional and transnational inter regional trade they claim that china s prioritization of economic growth and trade in low value added and pollution intensive sectors consumes a great amount of nexus resources within its territory to satisfy consumers demands in japan and south korea owen et al 2018 take uk as a case use input output analysis techniques to investigate the interaction between the energy water and food impacts of products and recognize that strategies that aim to reduce environmental impacts should not harm the socioeconomic well being of the uk on the regional level chen et al 2018b present a demonstration of the water energy mixed unit input output approach by analyzing hong kong and its associated hinterland in mainland china their study shows that the current water infrastructures will meet the demand for water treatment in 2050 and suggests that all types of water for energy and energy for water will increase by 7 8 9 by using beijing as an example chen and chen 2015 find that the impact of nexus on energy networks is larger than water networks and the most urban sectors rely on manufacturing in the energy water nexus similarly wang et al 2017 propose a modified input output analysis which provides a unified framework to balance urban energy and water comsumption by using the case of beijing the results show that manufacture provides the largest outflow of hybrid energy and agriculture is the largest receiver compared with beijing yang et al 2018 find that shanghai is facing greater environmental challenges in the process of urban sustainability as the world s most populous country and fastest growing economy china has a population of 1 42 billion people and keeps fast economic growth rate during the last three decades with the development in society and economy china has great challenges in food energy and water in particular china is poor of water resources with 2300 m3 of per capita availability which is less than one third of the world s average guan and hubacek 2008 china s per capita water availability is low and unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally which is inconsistent with the rising socio economic need for water jiang 2015 therefore to investigate the relations among food energy and water in china from the perspective of nexus thinking is valuable to the global food and resources security the study by qin et al 2015 shows that future energy plans could conflict with the industrial water policy but the amount of water used in the energy sector is highly dependant on technology choices especially for power plant cooling they predict high electricity demand in the future is expected to be met mainly by coal and nuclear power and planned inland development of nuclear power presents a new source of freshwater demand in the study of wu and chen 2017 all the input items are inclusively inventoried as products of the economy the previous analysis shows that the industrial water use induced by the solar power plant infrastructure is revealed to be over one order of magnitude higher than that in previous scoping however there is still lack uniform way to investigate the process of the integrated framework in scientific analysis especially few studies focus on the supply chains of these three resources in china we thus introduce the supply chains analysis based on the ioa method to present the details of impact among food energy and water in this study we apply taylor s series expansion to show the supply chains impact particular stage 0 represents direct impacts and stage 1 10 represent indirect impacts 2 methodology and data 2 1 framework for water energy and food nexus in this study china is considered as a system while considering the physical exchange of the whole system with outside there are two approaches for the resources flow into the whole system from outside by one approach the resources flow from the environment boundary into the system for example water flows from the natural environment into agriculture forestry sector animal husbandry sector fishery sector and the sector of production and distribution of water similarly energy flows from the environment into the economic system by the sector of mining washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas by the other approach the resources flow into or out of the system through international trade while considering the monetary and physical flows in the system it is both an economic system and an ecological system as an economic system values flow throughout a network among interdependent economic sectors via the input output relations as an ecological system water and energy flows from the original components to other sectors via the input output links which are revealed in the monetary input output tables specially for each sector the consumed resources can be identified as for direct use or indirect use by investigation the supply chains this analysis provides more information on the interactions among food water and energy 2 2 accounting resources flow in a typical io analysis the leontief equation can be expressed as follows 1 x i a 1 y l y where x is a n 1 vector representing output of each sector l i a 1 is leontief inverse and i is the n n unity matrix a stands for the technology coefficient matrix n n y is the n 1 vector of sectoral final demand 2 f e x ˆ where f is a 1 n vector which represents resources flows from the environment to the whole system by n sectors e is the resources use coefficient vector referring to resources directly explored from the environment per unit of output the symbol ˆ indicates a diagonal matrix using eqs 1 and 2 the total resources consumption can be rewritten as 3 p e l y ˆ where p is a 1 n vector shows the embodied resources consumption by each sector 2 3 supply chains analysis following owen et al 2018 the leontief inverse l can be expanded by taylor s series 4 l i a a 2 a 3 a n applying eq 4 to eq 3 p can be expanded as 5 p e i y ˆ e ˆ a y e ˆ a 2 y e ˆ a 3 y e ˆ a n y where e ˆ a k y calculates the impact from the k t h stage in production the stages in production are defined to recognize the direct and indirect relations in the supply chains as e ˆ i y is the original resources consumption which directly from the environment driven by final demand y of each sector e ˆ a y is the direct resources consumption which is from the input output structure in particular a y is the inputs from other industries and e ˆ a y represents the resources supplied to each sectors through the materials inflow from the original component in the next stage these sectors require inputs of a a y along with e ˆ a 2 y of water or energy is supplied furthermore the supply chains can be expanded infinitely similar with the stage 2 e ˆ a t y t 2 shows the indirect resources consumption to evaluate the interlinkages of food and natural resources we apply eq 5 to identify the supply chains of food production by using matlab 2 4 data sources we used the monetary input output tables for 2012 obtained from nbsc national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china the original input output database includes 139 sectors the water withdrawal data were collected from the china statistical yearbook on environment 2013 the energy production data is from the china energy statistical yearbook and is measured in standard coal equivalent as table 1 listed there are 16 sectors related with agriculture or food manufacture 3 results and discussion 3 1 food water linkages all of the agriculture and food manufacture sectors jointly consumed 2408 10 billion m3 embodied water accounted to 39 98 of total embodied water consumption by the whole system in 2012 it is clear that water is the essential fundamental for food table 2 shows the embodied water consumption driven by final demand of agriculture and food manufacture sectors in china at 2012 in terms of total embodied water consumption animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat fishery other food sector processing of fruit sector vegetables nuts and other agriculture food sector and manufacture of grain mill products were the leading embodied water consumer all of them consumed more than 100 billion m3 embodied water compared with other sectors these are still remarkable among all of the 139 sectors the largest water consumer is the production and distribution of water with the amount of 961 53 billion m3 of embodied water followed by animal husbandry sector agriculture construction of buildings and slaughtering and processing of meat fig 1 shows the top 10 embodied water consumers and the green bars represent agriculture and food manufacturing sectors furthermore we divided the total embodied water consumption into direct or indirect water consumption at different stages by taylor s expansion in eq 5 fig 2 shows the different water use in supply chains from stage 0 to stage 10 of the top 10 water use agriculture and food manufacture sectors for agriculture animal husbandry sector and fishery the highest water use in stage 0 of the supply chains because water directly flows into these three sectors from the environmental boundary these four sectors are the original component for water resources where is the beginning of water flows in the whole system for most of other agriculture and food manufacture sector stage 1 contains the largest water use this is because majority of immediate productions for food manufacture are from agriculture forestry and fishing sectors and these immediate products contain a large amount of water use specially other food sector is an exception in stage 2 other food sector still has large indirect water consumption it reveals that besides immediate productions made by the original component of water other food sector uses a large amount of other input these inputs are not made in the original component sectors but using a lot of products from original component after stage 2 the indirect water consumption decreases sharply 3 2 food energy linkages all of the 16 agriculture and food manufacture sectors jointly use 404 75 million ton embodied minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent of coal accounting for 13 60 of total minerals use for energy production use in the whole system among these 16 sectors agriculture uses the largest amount of embodied minerals use for energy production with 78 15 million ton minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent of coal followed by other food sector and animal husbandry which use 59 29 and 58 58 million ton equivalent coal measured embodied minerals use for energy production respectively to understand the interaction relations between food and energy we use taylor s series in eq 5 to show the minerals use for energy production flow in the supply chains of agriculture and food manufacture as fig 3 shows minerals use for energy production the embodied minerals use for energy production in the agriculture and food manufacture specifics has some typical features first the embodied minerals use for energy production flow impact at stage 0 is zero since the minerals use for energy production only flows into the economic system through the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas in the 16 sectors it doesn t exit a channel for minerals flow from the nature to agriculture or food manufacture second in the stage 1 the impact of embodied energy consumption conducted in supply chains is also zero in all sectors this result indicates that the input output analysis shows these 16 sectors rarely use primary energy third in stage 3 the indirect uses of minerals for energy production in the 16 sectors are significant this impact composed two sources of energy one is the use of electricity which is product by primary energy and the other is from the immediate products in which use primary energy as immediate inputs compared with the decomposition of embodied water in section 3 1 the impact of embodied minerals use for energy production during stage 0 to stage 10 is more flexible the impacts declined in a slower rate in most sectors the embodied minerals use for energy production keep a high amount even in stage 8 also the decrease varies among sectors for example in agriculture the impacts are significant during the whole period 3 3 water energy linkages besides agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery sectors the sector of production and distribution of water is another original component for water as a node water flows into the system from the environment boundary in the sector of production and distribution of water and flows into other sectors by the supply chains this sector consumes 0 12 million ton minerals use for energy production measured by equivalent coal as fig 4 shows in the first two stages the embodied minerals use for energy production equals zero the results show the sector of production and distribution of water does not consume primary energy furthermore from stage 2 to stage 6 the impact of embodied minerals use for energy production is significant and variable while investigating water consumption for energy production the water uses for various purposes the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas are for the energy flow from the natural environment to the human s social and economic activities the production and distribution of electricity and heats sector is to convert and transport energy the embodied water consumption of the sector of production and distribution of electricity and heats is 13 91 billion m3 as fig 5 shows in stage 2 the energy production sector consumes largest embodied water and the impacts of its use decline through supply chains the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas use little embodied water instead of consumed resources sector i generate resources for the national system by trade more exactly these sectors save water from net flows in the international trade 3 4 discussion in this article we investigate the national economy of china as a whole system it is crucial to identify the entry points in the national level system instead of distribution resources from the environment and trade to all sectors in this framework resources e g water and miners used for energy production enter the system only through agriculture and energy production sectors this way help to trace the resources flows more exactly what is more it shows the resources flow through intermediate inputs before final demand the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute largest use of resource in supply chains there is no doubt studies by applying different methods all admit the fact that agriculture is the largest consumer of resources however besides the nexus thinking the contribution of energy consumption in animal husbandry is not always revealed as its embodied use of primary energy is low in stage 0 2 it shows that not only this sector does not consume energy directly but its inputs do not consume energy significantly however the immediate products for its inputs consumes a large amount of energy like the tracing of embodied energy the investigation on supply chains help us to understand the virtual flows of the resources and reveal both the direct and indirect relations among them globalization increases the products and resources flows all over the world to make policies in global view and nexus thinking it is skeptical to realize the impact of international trade on resources the nexus analysis based on ioa method provides an efficient way to reveal and manage tradeoffs between monetary flows and physical flows of resources the analysis on supply chains shows not only goods flows in international trade but also resources flow in or out a country by trade if the net import of sector i is large and its international trade impact exceeds impact generated in production proceeds the embodied resources impact of sector i will be negative that is to say instead of consuming resources sector i generate resources for the national system by trade the results show that the forestry sector contributes both water and energy to the whole system the sector of mining and washing of coal and the sector of extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas contributes water to the system in traditional trade theory exports can bring monetary flow to a country and the development of export industries have benefited from the trade however driving by the nexus thinking the exporters bore the burden of scarce resources with the production of exports for the benefit of importers on the contrary the international trade brings benefits to importers especially in the sectors which rely on a large amount of inputs in resources e g agriculture and manufacturing of food since people enjoy the final use but not burden the scarcity natural resources the investigations of supply chains evaluate the ripples through the international trade and provide practical ways to decrease the trade deflect with other countries 4 conclusion in this paper china s economic activities are taken into consider as a whole system in this system we apply supply chains analysis based on input output structures to identify the different type of resource use we focus on several linkages including the linkages between social and economic activities and the natural environment the food water linkage the food energy linkage and the energy water linkages the energy and water sectors provide immediate inputs for each other the impact at stage 0 represents the resources directly extracted from nature only the original component sectors directly consume resources by this way the impact at stage 1 represents primary energy consumption or water consumption from agriculture or the sector of production and distribution of water at most cases this is the largest impact the impacts after stage 2 combine effects from both the secondary energy virtual water and the other immediate productions the results show that agriculture and animal husbandry contribute most use of resource in supply chains animal husbandry sector agriculture slaughtering and processing of meat jointly contribute large amount of embodied water consumption while agriculture other food sector and animal husbandry sector consumes most embodied primary energy although the direct primary energy use by animal husbandry sector is not significant meanwhile by importing or exporting resources international trade impacts on the resources flow through input output structures as a result when making polices the interactions of various resources and international trade are need to be considered by applying food energy water nexus fewn approach acknowledgement this study is supported by the fundamental

25137,one dimensional coupled ecological hydrodynamic numerical models of lakes require extensive calibration of their chemical and biological parameters application of these models to future projections relies on the time invariance of the calibrated model parameters and of the adopted schematisation this is mere speculation for real ecosystems so that it is relevant to explore the limits of coupled models over extended periods to date almost all applications in literature have been calibrated over a couple of years at most with comparable validation periods if present furthermore past studies mostly concerned shallow to moderately deep small lakes so that reproducing the hypolimnetic chemical evolution of very deep large lakes has generally been overlooked last most works did not compare with observations or even model the succession of phytoplankton species but only dealt with total chlorophyll a here the glm aed2 general lake model aquatic ecodynamics coupled model was calibrated and validated for an overall 16 75 year period for the 370 m deep and 213 km2 wide lake maggiore northern italy southern switzerland focusing on the reproduction of both deep water chemistry and phytoplankton biomass and succession despite the modelling simplifications needed for this complex basin the resulting performances are comparable to those in literature for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods still extreme care must be put when interpreting the results of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models for long term projections especially regarding the evolution of phytoplankton keywords 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic model long term calibration validation deep water chemistry phytoplankton succession ecosystem evolution climate change effects 1 introduction coupled ecological hydrodynamic numerical models are today s most advanced tools for managing the ecosystems of lakes and reservoirs being able to reproduce the feedbacks between physics and biogeochemistry hamilton and schladow 1997 they potentially yield additional insight to that of field data for present conditions and forecast the effects of future changes bruce et al 2006 inland basins are ordinarily exposed to pollution and climate change which alter their ecosystems both directly and through the changes in the physical dynamics i e water temperatures and internal mixing predictions of the effects of such processes and of the relative remediation measures are increasingly needed trolle et al 2012 despite three dimensional 3d coupled models can solve horizontal heterogeneities from the physical e g baroclinic motions to the biological level e g phytoplankton patchiness they still are computationally burdensome not being suited to long term simulations furthermore they require spatially distributed boundary and initial conditions which are troublesome to obtain recognising that their output is horizontally averaged one dimensional 1d models allow obtaining more pragmatic outcomes than 3d models hamilton and schladow 1997 with much smaller computational effort hence they are the standard for long term applications and thus the object of this study reliability of model predictions depends on the availability of proper data for boundary and initial conditions marcé et al 2010 and on the accuracy in reproducing the relevant processes at the time scale of interest jørgensen 1999 the schematisation of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models grows from the physical level to the chemical and biological ones due to the increase in involved processes cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 while the description of hydrodynamics is essentially complete and hence site independent that of biological processes is still a simplification of actual mechanisms and relies on site specific calibration to interpret the diversity of plankton among basins hamilton and schladow 1997 rinke et al 2009 establishing a general parameterisation is elusive romero et al 2004 even for neighbouring lakes with the same plankton species burger et al 2008 dietzel et al 2013 theoretically parameters could be obtained from field data gal et al 2009 but many chemical and biological processes cannot be isolated özkundakci et al 2011 furthermore field estimates may not lead to the best fit kara et al 2012 tweaked parameters being needed to make up for the basic representation of processes hamilton and schladow 1997 marcé et al 2010 time consuming calibration is hence necessary the use of literature values being restricted to less sensitive parameters for which reliable values from similar environments are available rising schematisation leads to declining model accuracy from the physical to the chemical and biological levels carraro et al 2012 dietzel et al 2013 kara et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 the increasing patchiness of variables also contributes to the drop of performances gal et al 2009 while horizontal temperature and salinity gradients are mostly opposed by gravity chemical and biological variables negligibly affect water density and hence can display significant horizontal inhomogeneities hamilton and schladow 1997 the laterally averaged results of 1d models and the vertical samples could therefore deviate build up of errors from underlying model levels carraro et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 and growing analytical uncertainties on observations trolle et al 2008b also increase inaccuracy the limits of models should be acknowledged when interpreting their results parameterisation induces stationarity as ecosystem changes would require a new calibration or an adjustment to the schematisation trolle et al 2008a 2008b this is particularly limiting for plankton for which the adopted parameters are averaged over assemblages of species during the calibration period even if multiple functional groups are introduced changes in the species living in the lake in the proportions among species within single groups and in the physiology of individual species cannot be reproduced burger et al 2008 özkundakci et al 2011 trolle et al 2008b however for management purposes only qualitative evaluations of the response of the ecosystem to external changes are needed gal et al 2014 özkundakci et al 2011 nevertheless we must make sure that the model does not drift from reality in the long term calibration and independent validation over long time series would be needed to assess the predictive power of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models dietzel et al 2013 trolle et al 2008b good fit of field data being far more likely over short periods snortheim et al 2017 due to lack of observations most applications to date have been calibrated at most over a couple of years being occasionally validated over comparable periods table 1 in addition most studies concerned shallow to moderately deep lakes table 1 where a segregated hypolimnion connected to surface waters only during full turnovers is not present furthermore literature applications mainly dealt with small basins table 1 in which the 1d hypothesis of horizontal homogeneity is more straightforward last many studies did not model the seasonal succession of phytoplankton groups or did not compare the results against field data considering only total chlorophyll a chl a this is due to the demanding analytics needed to characterise the sampled biomass including multiple functional groups does not imply a better fit of total observed phytoplankton shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the strongest constraint being applied by the limiting nutrient on the total biomass mieleitner and reichert 2008 mieleitner et al 2008 which also causes errors on each class to propagate over all the others adopting functional groups yet allows a higher sensitivity to changing external conditions due to the more heterogeneous parameterisation shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the applicability of 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic models to future projections in very deep large lakes is therefore quite unexplored especially regarding the evolution of deep hypolimnion chemistry and phytoplankton succession these two aspects are the main concerns of climate change for deep lakes in temperate zones in fact more prominent phytoplankton blooms peeters et al 2007 with predominance of cyanophytes jöhnk et al 2008 hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rogora et al 2018 and accumulation of nutrients in bottom waters salmaso 2005 are expected to follow the higher water temperatures and drop of mixing fenocchi et al 2018 in the only long term ecological modelling study on deep lakes familiar to us dietzel et al 2013 simulated three swiss lakes table 1 with a pure ecological model assuming time invariant seasonal mixing coefficients between epilimnion and hypolimnion the long term trends of chemical and biological variables were well reproduced yet with substantial error at the intra annual scale a significant decrease of model performances was obtained during validation they attributed most errors to the simplified vertical mixing last they adopted single phytoplankton and zooplankton groups we thus aim at performing a similar investigation with a coupled ecological hydrodynamic model and multiple phytoplankton groups to assess intra annual dynamics reproduction and discuss the applicability to long term studies in the present study we calibrated and validated the glm aed2 general lake model aquatic ecodynamics hipsey et al 2013 2014 1d coupled model for the 370 m deep and 213 km2 wide lake maggiore northern italy southern switzerland for a 16 75 year period between 1998 and 2014 in view of applying the model to climate change projections we optimised the calibration of deep water chemistry and of phytoplankton biomass and succession evaluating the performances over such aspects and determining whether a single application could catch both 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data lake maggiore is a deep lake of fluvio glacial origin at the foothills of the southern central alps its surface being shared between italy 80 and switzerland 20 fig 1 the lake drains the upstream watershed of river ticino its only outflow including the surrounding lakes lugano orta and varese lake maggiore has 33 tributaries the largest ones being rivers ticino and toce miorina dam fig 1 controls its water level and ordinarily allows for a 0 5 m difference between winter and summer periods for water storage purposes the main morphometric and hydrologic features of lake maggiore are listed in table 2 lake maggiore is oligomictic full turnovers occurring only at the end of particularly cold and windy winters ambrosetti and barbanti 1999 warming of surface temperatures pareeth et al 2017 and decreasing mixing frequency ambrosetti and barbanti 1999 rogora et al 2018 have been observed over the last decades in response to climate change causing relevant ecological effects cnr ise 2016 salmaso et al 2014 such trends would likely continue for the rest of the 21st century fenocchi et al 2018 the basin is presently oligotrophic p limited primary production being dominated by diatoms due to the siliceous watershed morabito et al 2012 the lake suffered from eutrophication in the 1960s and 1970s reaching the limit between mesotrophy and eutrophy ruggiu et al 1998 the establishment of wastewater treatment plants and the reduction of phosphorus in detergents allowed a slow reversal to natural oligotrophy from the 1980s kamenir and morabito 2009 input nutrient loads having stabilised in the 2000s cnr ise 2016 salmaso et al 2014 within the 1998 2014 study period lake maggiore mixed completely with chemical homogenisation at the end of winters 1999 and 2006 fenocchi et al 2018 yet partial turnovers provided hypolimnetic mixing also in 2000 2004 and 2005 an extraordinary bloom of the chlorophyte mougeotia occurred in summer 2011 reaching a 20 g m3 biomass 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than its previous annual peaks stefani et al 2016 tapolczai et al 2015 mougeotia blooms have been happening in large deep perialpine lakes under ordinary nutrient loads as opposed to those of cyanophytes and dinophytes possibly as a by product of re oligotrophication tapolczai et al 2015 lake maggiore has been routinely monitored since 1981 by the water research institute of the national research council of italy cnr irsa of verbania pallanza formerly institute of ecosystem study cnr ise within the framework of the international commission for the protection of italian swiss waters cipais vertical limnological profiles have been collected at the ghiffa site of maximum depth fig 1 table 2 with an approximate monthly frequency water temperature measurements and water samples for chemical analyses have been taken at depths 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 50 m 100 m 150 m 200 m 250 m 300 m 360 m integrated 0 20 m samples have been taken for phytoplankton being analysed for total chl a concentration and the biovolumes of phytoplankton species grouped in the six classes present in lake maggiore cyanophytes diatoms dinophytes chlorophytes chrysophytes cryptophytes chemical and water temperature data have also been simultaneously collected at the mouths of the 12 main tributaries fig 1 daily discharges for these streams are available yet with several gaps for the less relevant ones the simulated period is the 16 75 year span between 19 january 1998 and 14 october 2014 the hydrodynamic module having been already calibrated in fenocchi et al 2017 over such interval for which almost complete and validated data series are available for model feeding and evaluation daily series of air temperature shortwave radiation relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure were obtained from the verbania pallanza weather station retrieving few missing radiation data from the locarno monti station fig 1 2 2 calculation of input loads mean monthly input loads to the model were calculated for dissolved oxygen o2 orthophosphate po4 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 silica sio2 dissolved organic phosphorus dop and nitrogen don dissolved inorganic dic and organic doc carbon incoming particulate organic phosphorus pop nitrogen pon and carbon poc and plankton are negligible for lake maggiore bertoni and callieri 1992 cnr ise 2013 mean monthly discharges of the 12 main tributaries fig 1 were employed neglecting minor inflows diffuse runoff and groundwater input due to the lack of data these tributaries account for 77 of the inflow volume during the study period missing monthly discharge values 10 of the total ones were reconstructed from the discharges of the other tributaries according to hydrologic similarity developed on a meteorological season basis to consider the different rainfall and runoff regimes during the year pearson correlation matrices among the mean monthly discharges of the 12 streams were built for each meteorological season to model missing data for a tributary for a specific season linearly regressed values from the discharges of the best correlated river for that season were adopted in case concurrent discharges for the best correlated stream were also missing regressed values from the second best correlated tributary were employed and so on up to the third best correlated river for the herein reconstructed data the correlation coefficients of the adopted regressions ranged r 0 39 0 98 with mean and standard deviation r 0 76 0 16 and always p 0 01 although daily discharges were available monthly means were adopted to provide a source of averaging partially balancing the distortion caused by the approximate monthly frequency of chemical samples reconstructing missing daily discharges would have also required a rainfall runoff model of each tributary as applying hydrologic similarity would have resulted in much lower correlation coefficients due to the far more individual characters of watersheds at shorter time scales the concentrations adopted to compute mean monthly input loads were obtained as follows 1 the sampled concentrations at the tributaries mouths were linearly interpolated at a daily scale 2 approximate mean monthly values were calculated from the interpolated data in the aed2 model and in the remainder of the manuscript nutrients are expressed as concentrations and loads of their fundamental element p po4 n no3 n nh4 si sio2 saturation concentrations were assumed for o2 at the tributaries due to the turbulence of lotic waters and the lack of measurements burger et al 2008 hamilton and schladow 1997 saturation values were calculated with henry s law estimating henry s constant as function of the atmospheric pressure recorded at verbania pallanza and of the sampled river water temperatures as per sander 2015 concentrations of dop and don were obtained as differences between the total tp and tn and the dissolved inorganic p po4 and n no3 n nh4 forms fig 2 displays the overall input load series for the limiting nutrient po4 peaks correspond to the 2000 and 2002 flood events 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 hydrodynamic module the general lake model glm v2 2 0b 1d model hipsey et al 2014 was employed for the hydrodynamic simulation of lake maggiore the conceptual model of the present application is given in fig 3 a here in view of applying the coupled ecological hydrodynamic model to future projections we adopted the fixed level enclosed lake model configuration calibrated in fenocchi et al 2017 such formulation does not consider actual inflows outflow and direct rainfall discharges whose inclusion over a projection study would entail a highly uncertain reconstruction of the future hydrologic regime and balance evolution fenocchi et al 2018 the lake elevation is set to the reference one of lake maggiore table 2 through a calibrated input discharge that opposes daily evaporation the model reproduces the relevant features of thermal evolution in the study period adopting a fictitiously low light extinction coefficient to mimic the advective heat of riverine intrusions the limits of this assumption are discussed in fenocchi et al 2017 the same schematisation parameters boundary and initial conditions used in fenocchi et al 2017 were retained except for the following modifications a fictitious surface inflow was employed instead of a fictitious rainfall to fulfil the fixed level constraint this way nutrient loads from tributaries were input at the lake surface the employed daily inflow concentrations were obtained as follows 1 the overall calculated mean monthly loads e g fig 2a were linearly interpolated at a daily scale 2 the daily inflow concentrations were calculated as ratios between the total loads and the calibrated fictitious discharges this modification did not impact the hydrodynamic model accuracy assuming input loads to always enter at the surface may be realistic for minor inflows their momentum and buoyancy forces being rapidly damped the main tributaries rivers ticino and toce intrude at shallow depths 10 20 m during most of the year sometimes reaching the surface in early spring yet they sink to much lower depths also 200 m throughout late autumn and winter fenocchi et al 2017 the employed schematisation seemed however the most reasonable one given the heterogeneity of the tributaries of lake maggiore spanning large rivers natural and dammed mountain streams creeks and outflows of smaller lakes and reservoirs with a wide range of discharges and temperatures fenocchi et al 2017 and the aim of reproducing future scenarios in which changes in the intrusion behaviour are expected fenocchi et al 2018 in the present model nutrients are hence passed to lower layers only through vertical mixing and sinking of particulate organic matter and phytoplankton outflow of nutrients is not represented due to missing emissary in the model such approximation is suitable for lake maggiore due to its large surface and volume and relatively long renewal time table 2 which make nutrient recycling prevalent for primary production the minimum and maximum thicknesses of the model layers were increased from hmin 0 1 m to hmin 0 2 m and from hmax 0 5 m to hmax 2 0 m respectively this was done to speed up calculations in view of the manifold realisations needed to obtain robust statistical predictions with a monte carlo approach for future climate change scenarios fenocchi et al 2018 this modification impacted model accuracy requiring a slight recalibration of the light extinction coefficient from k d 0 098 m 1 to k d 0 100 m 1 and of the wind enhancement factor from kw 1 15 to kw 1 14 the final root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae for water temperature over the whole depth and over separate epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion are nevertheless 10 larger than in fenocchi et al 2017 2 3 2 ecological module the glm model was coupled to the aquatic ecodynamics aed2 ecological model hipsey et al 2013 the conceptual model of the current application is illustrated in fig 3b a basic npd nutrients phytoplankton detritus structure was employed oxygen phosphorus nitrogen silica carbon organic matter and phytoplankton cycles were included mortality of phytoplankton due to grazing by zooplankton and fish was subsumed into phytoplankton respiration bruce et al 2006 burger et al 2008 rigosi et al 2011 snortheim et al 2017 heterotrophic bacterial respiration was captured through mineralisation of particulate pom and dissolved dom organic matter bruce et al 2006 2008 li et al 2013 snortheim et al 2017 the contribution of macrophytes to primary production in lake maggiore is negligible compared to that of phytoplankton guilizzoni et al 1989 as typical of large deep lakes due to the relatively restricted littoral zone grzybowski 2014 rounsefell 1946 nutrient release from sediments was not considered because the overlying water column was well oxygenated in the simulated period rogora et al 2018 the ecological module runs with the same hourly time step of the hydrodynamic one allowing the resolution of photosynthesis bruce et al 2006 phytoplankton was modelled through four functional groups based on taxonomic classes cyanophytes diatoms dinophytes and c3phytes which includes chlorophytes chrysophytes and cryptophytes the latter group was created to reduce parameterisation the three constituents having similar annual cycles the employed segmentation could potentially allow reproducing the main specific features of phytoplankton in lake maggiore 1 cyanophytes bloom in late summer and resist high water temperatures 2 diatoms rapidly bloom between late winter and early spring at low temperatures and uptake silica for their shells 3 dinophytes bloom in early summer can withstand low phosphorus levels and have low winter survival rate 4 c3phytes bloom in late spring primary peak and in early autumn secondary peak at tepid temperatures and survive at moderate concentrations during winter with chrysophytes 26 of the observed biovolume of the functional group in the study period uptaking silica for their shells fixed c n and c si ratios were assumed for phytoplankton functional groups dynamic c p ratios being adopted only for the limiting nutrient to which the output is most sensitive bruce et al 2008 carraro et al 2012 martins et al 2008 omlin et al 2001 constant c chl a ratios were also employed for the functional groups these being actually variable in time for each species kara et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 silica uptake was activated for diatoms and c3phytes photoinhibition and n fixation were not simulated as the calibrated k d value is artificial feedback of bio turbidity on the light extinction coefficient was not considered as the resulting alterations would have triggered non linear effects rinke et al 2010 observed that adopting a variable k d rather than a constant one resulted in surface temperature differences in the order of 1 c for simulations of lake constance germany switzerland austria even under altered trophic status these are much lower than the expected warming over the 21st century fenocchi et al 2018 a proper light extinction coefficient k d 0 227 m 1 was yet considered in the phytoplankton submodule to reproduce light limitation as resulting from the poole and atkins 1929 equation given the mean observed secchi depth in the study period s d 7 49 m fenocchi et al 2017 the initial vertical profiles of chemical variables i e o2 po4 no3 nh4 sio2 dop don dic doc poc were set to piecewise linear interpolations of the sampled values on the first day of simulation as done for water temperature fenocchi et al 2017 concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients were again calculated as dop tp p po4 and don tn n nh3 n nh4 pop and pon being negligible also in lake maggiore cnr ise 2013b for phytoplankton groups initial constant concentrations equal to the observed integrated values were assumed in the sampled 0 20 m layer linearly decreasing to zero in the 20 30 m layer with null phytoplankton below the measured series of biovolumes of the functional groups were converted into the carbon concentrations needed by aed2 according to reynolds 2006 2 4 ecological module calibration the considered time span was split into calibration and validation periods the former including the 8 year interval between 1 january 1999 and 31 december 2006 and the latter the 7 79 year one between 1 january 2007 and 14 october 2014 table 1 the initial 1998 year of simulation served as model spin up systematic inferior performances being observed in the first annual phytoplankton cycle likely due to the approximate initial conditions manual trial and error calibration was adopted to tune the ecological module adjusting the parameters mostly within literature boundaries until the fit to observations could no longer be improved appreciably automatic calibration techniques rigosi et al 2011 still cannot be applied successfully to coupled models of deep lakes with multiple plankton groups defining an optimisation function including several variables at various depths would be ambiguous huge computational resources would be needed due to the dimensions of the parameter space trolle et al 2011 and convergence problems would arise because of the non linear interactions between physics chemistry and biology rigosi et al 2011 literature values when applicable were taken from the modelling studies in table 1 employing the dyresm caedym elcom caedym glm aed and dyresm wq coupled models which share the schematisation and main algorithms with glm aed2 to be sure that parameters have the same meaning adopting a literature value for a parameter did not imply that the latter was omitted from the calibration process as multiple published values were tested due to the many variables compromises to the fit of single ones had to be made for the sake of overall model performances resulting errors were compared with published ones to state their acceptability model fit of chemical variables was optimised in the deep hypolimnion i e in the 200 370 m layer being the predictability of the long term evolution in this layer one of the research aims furthermore chemical processes are more properly calibrated in the deep hypolimnion being most isolated from the biological and physical ones sample results are also given for the epilimnetic 0 20 m layer for chemical variables both observations and model results were numerically integrated from the values at the sampling depths calibrated variables were those for which extended observations were available o2 po4 no3 nh4 sio2 dop and don for phytoplankton fit was monitored in the 0 20 m layer of the integrated samples numerically integrating model results at 1 m resolution parameters of the phytoplankton groups were calibrated to allow growth up to the observed biomasses despite excess surface nutrients so that the obtained values reflect the adopted schematisation results for 0 20 m and 200 370 m water temperatures are also reported numerically integrated as for the chemical variables preliminary manual calibration was based on visual screening of the agreement of the trends of chemical variables and of overall quantitative equivalence and suitable succession timing for phytoplankton multiple goodness of fit metrics were employed for fine tuning both the pearson and the spearman correlation coefficients r and rs were considered tested for p value significance the pearson correlation coefficient measures the ability of the model to reproduce observed trends at the intra and inter annual scales the spearman correlation coefficient has a similar meaning yet it weighs the error on the timing of fluctuations disregarding quantitative differences gal et al 2009 thus being meaningful to evaluate the prediction of phytoplankton succession the normalised mean absolute error nmae and the normalised mean error nme indices were also considered while nmae states the average error nme expresses the systematic one revealing the bias and drift effects which can be significant over long time series the target of calibration was a compromise between maximum r and rs and minimum nmae and nme for each variable the calibration process required multiple shifts between chemical and phytoplankton levels due to the interactions between them normalisation by mean observed value is standard practice for nmae and nme this is adequate for variables displaying small gradients and whose mean values are important to be reproduced kara et al 2012 but leads to error misrepresentation when peak values are much larger than mean ones alewell and manderscheid 1998 bruce et al 2006 it is then inappropriate for phytoplankton for which prominent seasonal blooms occur and the mean is biased by very small winter concentrations and for nutrients in the epilimnion which have much higher concentrations in winter with minimum primary production than during the rest of the year therefore for fluctuating variables in the epilimnion we also normalised by the observed mean annual range nmaer and nmer in addition to by the mean value nmaem and nmem 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameters the final values of the chemical parameters resulting from the calibration and literature selection processes are listed in table 3 specific tuning had to be performed for 10 out of 27 chemical parameters a very high nitrification rate and a very low denitrification rate compared to the literature range had to be used to match the very low reducing properties of lake maggiore waters these are due to the present oligotrophic conditions and to the oxygenation of deep layers preventing denitrification and redox processes rogora et al 2018 at the same time lake maggiore is characterised by quite high no3 concentrations mainly due to the nitrogen input from atmospheric deposition mosello et al 2001 table 4 lists the final values of the phytoplankton parameters for the four functional groups specific tuning was performed for 31 out of 80 parameters unusually high growth rate and low standard optimum and maximum temperatures were adopted for diatoms to reproduce their remarkably rapid early and prominent blooms in cold waters and their early decay due to the spring bloom of zooplankton not included in the model similar less extreme parameters were employed for c3phytes which bloom later in spring to much smaller biomasses very low phytoplankton temperature parameters were also used by carraro et al 2012 and copetti et al 2006 to reproduce very early blooms of similar phytoplankton assemblages in the neighbouring lake pusiano northern italy a respiration loss rate well outside the upper literature boundary was employed to model the late peak and low winter survival rate of dinophytes the moderate winter concentrations of c3phytes were reproduced through a small value of the same parameter despite the approximation on nutrients wholly entering at the surface adopted phosphorus parameters are all inside literature ranges maximum internal p concentrations being set to the upper boundaries for diatoms and dinophytes peculiarly high internal nitrogen concentrations had to be used for the four functional groups to avoid excess no3 concentrations in the epilimnion being spread to the hypolimnion with mixing events these may be due to lacking nutrient immobilisation by heterotrophic bacteria as well as possible input load overestimation 3 2 model results the evaluations on water temperature modelling in fenocchi et al 2017 are still valid the seasonal cycle of water temperature in the 0 20 m layer is well reproduced fig 4 a with comparable performances to literature table 5 an overestimation of summer epilimnetic temperatures is yet obtained in the 2007 2014 period being maximum for 2013 a staircase like evolution results in the 200 370 m layer instead of the irregular observed trend fig 4b this should be ascribed to 1 missing heat advection by deep intrusions of tributaries in the model 2 approximate reproduction of deep mixing in all 1d models fenocchi et al 2017 2018 3 absent local horizontal inhomogeneities 1d models returning laterally averaged results 4 analytical errors on observations goodness of fit metrics in the deep hypolimnion are nevertheless equivalent to published ones with a particularly small nmaem table 5 homeothermic conditions correctly result at the end of winters 1999 and 2006 when complete mixing events occurred the evolution of dissolved oxygen concentration in the 200 370 m layer is well simulated fig 5 a reproducing the replenishments from upper layers during full 1999 2006 and partial 2000 2004 2005 turnovers the simulated oxygen consumption curve in the validation period after the last chemical homogenisation is straighter than the observed one missing deep oxygen input from interflows and underestimated diffusion from water layers above would contribute to this mismatch in addition model parameters for o2 consuming processes were calibrated over a period in which frequent deep mixing events occurred whereas none of them occurred during validation however measured data for the last few years 2016 2018 agree with the steeper decrease of o2 predicted by the model rogora et al 2018 optimal prediction of deep water orthophosphate is obtained in calibration and validation fig 5b the accumulation curve being properly matched during the latter period for nitrate fig 5c the model reproduces small concentration jumps in the deep hypolimnion with complete and partial mixing events absent in the observations this should be ascribed to a more heterogeneous modelled vertical distribution of no3 than the observed one observations also display a steadier nitrate concentration due to perfect equilibrium between nitrification and denitrification which could not be fully reproduced for deep water o2 po4 and no3 model performances are analogous or better than literature ones in calibration and validation table 5 with distinctly lower nmaem values the model does not reproduce the short scale irregularities of all chemical variables in the deep hypolimnion such issue is common to modelling studies burger et al 2008 copetti et al 2006 trolle et al 2008a 2008b 2011 and should be credited to the same error sources identified for water temperature high frequency oscillations are particularly relevant for ammonium fig 5d and dissolved organic phosphorus fig 5f and nitrogen fig 5g their amplitude being comparable or predominant over that of inter annual trends this results in low non significant correlation coefficients and higher nmaem values than for o2 po4 and no3 table 5 even though inter annual trends in the calibration and validation periods are visually satisfactorily reproduced comparing model results to moving averages of observed data for nh4 dop and don in the deep hypolimnion leads to similar goodness of fit metrics to those of o2 po4 and no3 for ammonium the relevant observed oscillations should be mostly caused by the very low measured concentrations around or below the limit of detection 0 32 mmol n m3 producing an analytical error comparable to the actual signal cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 li et al 2013 trolle et al 2011 strong irregularities in the observed trends of dop and don would be also due to these being calculated variables affected by analytical errors on both total and inorganic forms in addition to oscillations of neglected pop and pon the worst agreement is attained for deep water silica concentrations fig 5e for which an increase is correctly reproduced yet with an improper staircase like evolution in addition to the error sources listed for water temperature such behaviour is ascribable to the simplified silica cycle within aed2 hipsey et al 2013 agreement of chemical variables in the 0 20 m layer is less accurate straightforward causes are the chemical module being optimised in the deep hypolimnion and the assumption of all nutrients entering the lake at the surface most importantly the annual cycles of nutrients in the epilimnion are much harder to reproduce than the long term trends in deep waters as surface values strongly depend on the quantitative accuracy of phytoplankton modelling in addition in oligotrophic systems as lake maggiore seasonal epilimnetic oscillations are not as clearly defined as in eutrophic ones making model fit more difficult chemical variables are also more horizontally heterogeneous in the epilimnion due to the higher interaction with physical and biological patchiness sources therefore laboriously optimising chemical processes in the epilimnion could not produce a significant improvement we herein report sample results for the limiting nutrient po4 fig 6 and table 5 whose annual cycle is adequately reproduced in the calibration period with some underestimation model fit however degrades during validation together with that of phytoplankton due to the strong influence of its uptake significant pearson and spearman correlation coefficients r 0 36 and r 0 23 rs 0 39 and rs 0 29 also result in the calibration period for epilimnetic no3 and nh4 respectively for phytoplankton fig 7 table 5 cycling and succession among functional groups are satisfactorily reproduced larger errors occurring in biomasses estimation as also observed in cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 li et al 2013 özkundakci et al 2011 and rigosi et al 2011 this is confirmed by the generally higher spearman correlation coefficients than the pearson ones in calibration and validation the huge mougeotia bloom in summer 2011 is not reproduced as this distorts the validation error metrics for c3phytes and total chl a values excluding 2011 are considered for such variables pearson correlation coefficients for calibration and validation are higher than the average literature values for both total phytoplankton and individual groups equivalent to only slightly inferior performances are obtained for single functional groups compared to total chl a regarding annual cycling as revealed by spearman correlation coefficients worst correlations are obtained for the aggregated c3phytes group due to the less specific calibrated parameters modelling of total chl a seems better than that of individual groups according to nmaem whose values are all aligned with literature ones in calibration and validation yet comparable performances result for nmaer phytoplankton modelling deteriorates in validation first annual cycling is less accurate as revealed by the decrease of spearman correlation coefficients for total chl a and all functional groups except cyanophytes being most relevant for diatoms second a notable underestimation of peak concentrations occurs for cyanophytes and diatoms whereas an overestimation is obtained for c3phytes as highlighted by nmem and nmer underprediction results for total chl a even if less evident than considering the total phytoplankton carbon concentration highlighting the error of employing constant c chl a ratios pearson correlation coefficients consequently decrease for all phytoplankton variables from calibration to validation to a higher extent than spearman ones accuracy variations between calibration and validation were not systematically observed in the considered literature studies likely due to the short simulated periods table 1 3 3 model validity the performances of the present coupled ecological hydrodynamic model of lake maggiore in calibration and validation are equivalent if not superior to those of literature studies table 5 for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods table 1 the chemical evolution of the deep hypolimnion throughout the simulated period is well reproduced especially for dissolved oxygen and orthophosphate fig 5 table 5 whose future trends are of great concern in relation to climate change lake maggiore as the other deep lakes south of the alps is already showing a decrease of o2 and an accumulation of po4 in deep waters rogora et al 2018 see also figs 5a 5b due to the increasing water column stability brought by climate warming fenocchi et al 2018 the much smaller nmaem values obtained for deep water chemical variables compared to literature studies table 5 descend also from the great depth of lake maggiore whose deep hypolimnion is isolated from seasonal primary production so that its modelling is mostly unaffected by errors on phytoplankton reproduction of phytoplankton is satisfactory even for single functional groups yet model performances decrease during validation fig 7 table 5 this is due to the extensive parameterisation of biological processes and the consequent dependence on calibration shifts in the assemblages of functional groups are a fundamental source of error in phytoplankton modelling and cannot be reproduced unless all individual species entered the model leading to a prohibitive number of parameters during the calibration period substantial stability of the dominant species established with oligotrophication in the early 1990s was observed in lake maggiore cnr ise 2003 2008 morabito et al 2012 likely allowing suitable calibration results to be attained yet some obtained discrepancies in that period should still be ascribed to inter annual changes in the proportions among species and in the physiology of the same species with adaptation compositional shifts of diatoms and cyanophytes towards species typical of more nutrient enriched waters which had been dominant during eutrophication were observed in the validation period cnr ise 2013 2016 marchetto et al 2004 such changes would explain the performance drop in validation for these two groups figs 7b 7c table 5 the overestimation of summer epilimnetic temperatures in the validation period fig 4a table 5 may contribute to the underestimation of diatoms the missing exceptional mougeotia bloom in 2011 fig 7e is unavoidable since a specific functional group for the taxon would have been needed its parameterisation yet eluding the present knowledge as the positive conditions for growth are not clear tapolczai et al 2015 recent changes in phytoplankton assemblages in lake maggiore occurred despite stable nutrient loads fig 2 and oligotrophic conditions according to total chl a fig 7a these shifts could have been triggered by the shallower mixing depths and the surface warming fig 4a occurred after 2006 the new dominant species favouring warmer and more stratified waters cnr ise 2016 even if physical factors which are the main drivers of phytoplankton evolution under nutrient limitation morabito et al 2012 are simulated by the coupled model the inability to reproduce species shifts would be a severe limitation when forecasting climate change effects as blooms of new dominant species would not be detected bruce et al 2006 özkundakci et al 2011 snortheim et al 2017 phytoplankton shifts would increase in the future as surface water temperature and lake stratification are set to keep increasing fenocchi et al 2018 salmaso 2010 adopting multiple functional groups as done here would hence allow better long term results than using a single variable as some large scale features of phytoplankton shifting could be reproduced future shifts in phytoplankton species could also be caused by shifts at higher ecosystem levels not even explicitly modelled herein through different predation as happened in the past for lake maggiore manca and ruggiu 1998 latest phytoplankton blooms under oligotrophic conditions have been speculated to be supported by scarcely detectable nutrient inputs such as diffuse sources during impulse rainfalls callieri et al 2014 morabito et al 2018 such feeding is not included in the present model in which diffuse runoff and groundwater input are neglected and mean monthly discharges and isolated sampled concentrations at the main tributaries were employed to calculate input loads approximate nutrient loads also contribute to general discrepancies on chemical and biological variables errors in the estimation of missing discharges should also be considered in addition the approximate monthly frequency of water chemistry and phytoplankton observations used for model calibration and validation is probably too sparse to catch epilimnetic seasonal variability discrepancies coming from input loads all entering at the surface should finally be recognised horizontal heterogeneity is another fundamental error source patchiness peaks at the surface due to maximum influence of non uniform external factors and declines with depth due to growing isolation and inertia the validity of the 1d hypothesis therefore increases with depth though some patchiness still affects chemical variables in the deep hypolimnion due to non uniform mixing at small spatial and time scales phytoplankton patchiness is most relevant depending on the combination of horizontal physical chemical and biological heterogeneities hillmer et al 2008 kara et al 2012 systematic horizontal heterogeneity patterns observed in the vertical samples over longer time scales are included into the calibrated parameters causing a drop of performances if they change during validation hillmer et al 2008 an issue which we cannot exclude for the present case theoretically a 1d model could return results that better describe laterally averaged conditions than those in the vertical samples in this regard the ghiffa station is in the centre of lake maggiore and has been demonstrated to experience average surface water temperature epilimnion thickness chemical and phytoplankton trends to those of the northern and southern regions cnr ise 2013b the casual patchiness at local and brief time scales instead cannot be represented by 1d models and represents a significant part of the error due to phytoplankton horizontal heterogeneity in the present case given the limits discussed above a modelling application targeting phytoplankton succession alone specialising chemical variables calibration in the epilimnion could not give much better results than the present ones in fact a less parametrical ecosystem description would be needed to significantly improve the forecasting performances under changing conditions schladow and hamilton 1997 progress in the description of biochemical processes could make models less dependent on calibration and hence on data availability otherwise observation availability would keep impairing coupled ecological hydrodynamic modelling in this study we were able to calibrate the model over an extended period and accomplish a thorough analysis of results thanks to the large dataset available for lake maggiore yet we still had to adopt some simplifications due to the lack of information which increased the dependence on parameterisation thus impacting model performances in validation 4 conclusions the present application of glm aed2 to lake maggiore over 1998 2014 has shown that through extensive calibration 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic models can have for prolonged simulations of deep large lakes comparable performances to those found in literature for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods the chemical evolution of the deep hypolimnion was successfully reproduced also thanks to proper simulation of mixing dynamics a noteworthy decrease of model performances was yet detected in validation for phytoplankton and epilimnetic water chemistry due to the dependence on parameterisation the duration and peculiar features of the considered calibration and validation periods highlighted some relevant limits of coupled models for long term prognoses of climate change effects on phytoplankton especially for basins with stable oligotrophic loading and reduced mixing as expected for many oligomictic lakes in the western world for the 21st century the impossibility to reproduce shifts in phytoplankton species stands out against other factors nevertheless the forecasting abilities would be compatible with management purposes the feedback to nutrient load variations over single years being qualitatively reproduced features such as variations in the timing of the succession and in the proportions among functional groups could also be inferred a single application can address hypolimnetic chemistry and phytoplankton evolution in deep temperate lakes given the marginal benefits of specific models quantitative results should be interpreted with care according to the limitations and assumptions behind each model experience from validation may help to characterise the forecasting behaviour of a model yet unexpected errors may always arise with changing external conditions these may especially originate from out of bounds parameter values employed to amend for improperly described biochemical processes which could potentially cause relevant non linear misbehaviours comparison against a reference scenario without variations in climate and nutrient loads is strongly recommended to critically frame the obtained results acknowledgments and data the limnological and meteorological data used in the present study were collected through the research programs funded for lake maggiore by the

25137,one dimensional coupled ecological hydrodynamic numerical models of lakes require extensive calibration of their chemical and biological parameters application of these models to future projections relies on the time invariance of the calibrated model parameters and of the adopted schematisation this is mere speculation for real ecosystems so that it is relevant to explore the limits of coupled models over extended periods to date almost all applications in literature have been calibrated over a couple of years at most with comparable validation periods if present furthermore past studies mostly concerned shallow to moderately deep small lakes so that reproducing the hypolimnetic chemical evolution of very deep large lakes has generally been overlooked last most works did not compare with observations or even model the succession of phytoplankton species but only dealt with total chlorophyll a here the glm aed2 general lake model aquatic ecodynamics coupled model was calibrated and validated for an overall 16 75 year period for the 370 m deep and 213 km2 wide lake maggiore northern italy southern switzerland focusing on the reproduction of both deep water chemistry and phytoplankton biomass and succession despite the modelling simplifications needed for this complex basin the resulting performances are comparable to those in literature for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods still extreme care must be put when interpreting the results of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models for long term projections especially regarding the evolution of phytoplankton keywords 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic model long term calibration validation deep water chemistry phytoplankton succession ecosystem evolution climate change effects 1 introduction coupled ecological hydrodynamic numerical models are today s most advanced tools for managing the ecosystems of lakes and reservoirs being able to reproduce the feedbacks between physics and biogeochemistry hamilton and schladow 1997 they potentially yield additional insight to that of field data for present conditions and forecast the effects of future changes bruce et al 2006 inland basins are ordinarily exposed to pollution and climate change which alter their ecosystems both directly and through the changes in the physical dynamics i e water temperatures and internal mixing predictions of the effects of such processes and of the relative remediation measures are increasingly needed trolle et al 2012 despite three dimensional 3d coupled models can solve horizontal heterogeneities from the physical e g baroclinic motions to the biological level e g phytoplankton patchiness they still are computationally burdensome not being suited to long term simulations furthermore they require spatially distributed boundary and initial conditions which are troublesome to obtain recognising that their output is horizontally averaged one dimensional 1d models allow obtaining more pragmatic outcomes than 3d models hamilton and schladow 1997 with much smaller computational effort hence they are the standard for long term applications and thus the object of this study reliability of model predictions depends on the availability of proper data for boundary and initial conditions marcé et al 2010 and on the accuracy in reproducing the relevant processes at the time scale of interest jørgensen 1999 the schematisation of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models grows from the physical level to the chemical and biological ones due to the increase in involved processes cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 while the description of hydrodynamics is essentially complete and hence site independent that of biological processes is still a simplification of actual mechanisms and relies on site specific calibration to interpret the diversity of plankton among basins hamilton and schladow 1997 rinke et al 2009 establishing a general parameterisation is elusive romero et al 2004 even for neighbouring lakes with the same plankton species burger et al 2008 dietzel et al 2013 theoretically parameters could be obtained from field data gal et al 2009 but many chemical and biological processes cannot be isolated özkundakci et al 2011 furthermore field estimates may not lead to the best fit kara et al 2012 tweaked parameters being needed to make up for the basic representation of processes hamilton and schladow 1997 marcé et al 2010 time consuming calibration is hence necessary the use of literature values being restricted to less sensitive parameters for which reliable values from similar environments are available rising schematisation leads to declining model accuracy from the physical to the chemical and biological levels carraro et al 2012 dietzel et al 2013 kara et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 the increasing patchiness of variables also contributes to the drop of performances gal et al 2009 while horizontal temperature and salinity gradients are mostly opposed by gravity chemical and biological variables negligibly affect water density and hence can display significant horizontal inhomogeneities hamilton and schladow 1997 the laterally averaged results of 1d models and the vertical samples could therefore deviate build up of errors from underlying model levels carraro et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 and growing analytical uncertainties on observations trolle et al 2008b also increase inaccuracy the limits of models should be acknowledged when interpreting their results parameterisation induces stationarity as ecosystem changes would require a new calibration or an adjustment to the schematisation trolle et al 2008a 2008b this is particularly limiting for plankton for which the adopted parameters are averaged over assemblages of species during the calibration period even if multiple functional groups are introduced changes in the species living in the lake in the proportions among species within single groups and in the physiology of individual species cannot be reproduced burger et al 2008 özkundakci et al 2011 trolle et al 2008b however for management purposes only qualitative evaluations of the response of the ecosystem to external changes are needed gal et al 2014 özkundakci et al 2011 nevertheless we must make sure that the model does not drift from reality in the long term calibration and independent validation over long time series would be needed to assess the predictive power of coupled ecological hydrodynamic models dietzel et al 2013 trolle et al 2008b good fit of field data being far more likely over short periods snortheim et al 2017 due to lack of observations most applications to date have been calibrated at most over a couple of years being occasionally validated over comparable periods table 1 in addition most studies concerned shallow to moderately deep lakes table 1 where a segregated hypolimnion connected to surface waters only during full turnovers is not present furthermore literature applications mainly dealt with small basins table 1 in which the 1d hypothesis of horizontal homogeneity is more straightforward last many studies did not model the seasonal succession of phytoplankton groups or did not compare the results against field data considering only total chlorophyll a chl a this is due to the demanding analytics needed to characterise the sampled biomass including multiple functional groups does not imply a better fit of total observed phytoplankton shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the strongest constraint being applied by the limiting nutrient on the total biomass mieleitner and reichert 2008 mieleitner et al 2008 which also causes errors on each class to propagate over all the others adopting functional groups yet allows a higher sensitivity to changing external conditions due to the more heterogeneous parameterisation shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the applicability of 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic models to future projections in very deep large lakes is therefore quite unexplored especially regarding the evolution of deep hypolimnion chemistry and phytoplankton succession these two aspects are the main concerns of climate change for deep lakes in temperate zones in fact more prominent phytoplankton blooms peeters et al 2007 with predominance of cyanophytes jöhnk et al 2008 hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rogora et al 2018 and accumulation of nutrients in bottom waters salmaso 2005 are expected to follow the higher water temperatures and drop of mixing fenocchi et al 2018 in the only long term ecological modelling study on deep lakes familiar to us dietzel et al 2013 simulated three swiss lakes table 1 with a pure ecological model assuming time invariant seasonal mixing coefficients between epilimnion and hypolimnion the long term trends of chemical and biological variables were well reproduced yet with substantial error at the intra annual scale a significant decrease of model performances was obtained during validation they attributed most errors to the simplified vertical mixing last they adopted single phytoplankton and zooplankton groups we thus aim at performing a similar investigation with a coupled ecological hydrodynamic model and multiple phytoplankton groups to assess intra annual dynamics reproduction and discuss the applicability to long term studies in the present study we calibrated and validated the glm aed2 general lake model aquatic ecodynamics hipsey et al 2013 2014 1d coupled model for the 370 m deep and 213 km2 wide lake maggiore northern italy southern switzerland for a 16 75 year period between 1998 and 2014 in view of applying the model to climate change projections we optimised the calibration of deep water chemistry and of phytoplankton biomass and succession evaluating the performances over such aspects and determining whether a single application could catch both 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data lake maggiore is a deep lake of fluvio glacial origin at the foothills of the southern central alps its surface being shared between italy 80 and switzerland 20 fig 1 the lake drains the upstream watershed of river ticino its only outflow including the surrounding lakes lugano orta and varese lake maggiore has 33 tributaries the largest ones being rivers ticino and toce miorina dam fig 1 controls its water level and ordinarily allows for a 0 5 m difference between winter and summer periods for water storage purposes the main morphometric and hydrologic features of lake maggiore are listed in table 2 lake maggiore is oligomictic full turnovers occurring only at the end of particularly cold and windy winters ambrosetti and barbanti 1999 warming of surface temperatures pareeth et al 2017 and decreasing mixing frequency ambrosetti and barbanti 1999 rogora et al 2018 have been observed over the last decades in response to climate change causing relevant ecological effects cnr ise 2016 salmaso et al 2014 such trends would likely continue for the rest of the 21st century fenocchi et al 2018 the basin is presently oligotrophic p limited primary production being dominated by diatoms due to the siliceous watershed morabito et al 2012 the lake suffered from eutrophication in the 1960s and 1970s reaching the limit between mesotrophy and eutrophy ruggiu et al 1998 the establishment of wastewater treatment plants and the reduction of phosphorus in detergents allowed a slow reversal to natural oligotrophy from the 1980s kamenir and morabito 2009 input nutrient loads having stabilised in the 2000s cnr ise 2016 salmaso et al 2014 within the 1998 2014 study period lake maggiore mixed completely with chemical homogenisation at the end of winters 1999 and 2006 fenocchi et al 2018 yet partial turnovers provided hypolimnetic mixing also in 2000 2004 and 2005 an extraordinary bloom of the chlorophyte mougeotia occurred in summer 2011 reaching a 20 g m3 biomass 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than its previous annual peaks stefani et al 2016 tapolczai et al 2015 mougeotia blooms have been happening in large deep perialpine lakes under ordinary nutrient loads as opposed to those of cyanophytes and dinophytes possibly as a by product of re oligotrophication tapolczai et al 2015 lake maggiore has been routinely monitored since 1981 by the water research institute of the national research council of italy cnr irsa of verbania pallanza formerly institute of ecosystem study cnr ise within the framework of the international commission for the protection of italian swiss waters cipais vertical limnological profiles have been collected at the ghiffa site of maximum depth fig 1 table 2 with an approximate monthly frequency water temperature measurements and water samples for chemical analyses have been taken at depths 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 50 m 100 m 150 m 200 m 250 m 300 m 360 m integrated 0 20 m samples have been taken for phytoplankton being analysed for total chl a concentration and the biovolumes of phytoplankton species grouped in the six classes present in lake maggiore cyanophytes diatoms dinophytes chlorophytes chrysophytes cryptophytes chemical and water temperature data have also been simultaneously collected at the mouths of the 12 main tributaries fig 1 daily discharges for these streams are available yet with several gaps for the less relevant ones the simulated period is the 16 75 year span between 19 january 1998 and 14 october 2014 the hydrodynamic module having been already calibrated in fenocchi et al 2017 over such interval for which almost complete and validated data series are available for model feeding and evaluation daily series of air temperature shortwave radiation relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure were obtained from the verbania pallanza weather station retrieving few missing radiation data from the locarno monti station fig 1 2 2 calculation of input loads mean monthly input loads to the model were calculated for dissolved oxygen o2 orthophosphate po4 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 silica sio2 dissolved organic phosphorus dop and nitrogen don dissolved inorganic dic and organic doc carbon incoming particulate organic phosphorus pop nitrogen pon and carbon poc and plankton are negligible for lake maggiore bertoni and callieri 1992 cnr ise 2013 mean monthly discharges of the 12 main tributaries fig 1 were employed neglecting minor inflows diffuse runoff and groundwater input due to the lack of data these tributaries account for 77 of the inflow volume during the study period missing monthly discharge values 10 of the total ones were reconstructed from the discharges of the other tributaries according to hydrologic similarity developed on a meteorological season basis to consider the different rainfall and runoff regimes during the year pearson correlation matrices among the mean monthly discharges of the 12 streams were built for each meteorological season to model missing data for a tributary for a specific season linearly regressed values from the discharges of the best correlated river for that season were adopted in case concurrent discharges for the best correlated stream were also missing regressed values from the second best correlated tributary were employed and so on up to the third best correlated river for the herein reconstructed data the correlation coefficients of the adopted regressions ranged r 0 39 0 98 with mean and standard deviation r 0 76 0 16 and always p 0 01 although daily discharges were available monthly means were adopted to provide a source of averaging partially balancing the distortion caused by the approximate monthly frequency of chemical samples reconstructing missing daily discharges would have also required a rainfall runoff model of each tributary as applying hydrologic similarity would have resulted in much lower correlation coefficients due to the far more individual characters of watersheds at shorter time scales the concentrations adopted to compute mean monthly input loads were obtained as follows 1 the sampled concentrations at the tributaries mouths were linearly interpolated at a daily scale 2 approximate mean monthly values were calculated from the interpolated data in the aed2 model and in the remainder of the manuscript nutrients are expressed as concentrations and loads of their fundamental element p po4 n no3 n nh4 si sio2 saturation concentrations were assumed for o2 at the tributaries due to the turbulence of lotic waters and the lack of measurements burger et al 2008 hamilton and schladow 1997 saturation values were calculated with henry s law estimating henry s constant as function of the atmospheric pressure recorded at verbania pallanza and of the sampled river water temperatures as per sander 2015 concentrations of dop and don were obtained as differences between the total tp and tn and the dissolved inorganic p po4 and n no3 n nh4 forms fig 2 displays the overall input load series for the limiting nutrient po4 peaks correspond to the 2000 and 2002 flood events 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 hydrodynamic module the general lake model glm v2 2 0b 1d model hipsey et al 2014 was employed for the hydrodynamic simulation of lake maggiore the conceptual model of the present application is given in fig 3 a here in view of applying the coupled ecological hydrodynamic model to future projections we adopted the fixed level enclosed lake model configuration calibrated in fenocchi et al 2017 such formulation does not consider actual inflows outflow and direct rainfall discharges whose inclusion over a projection study would entail a highly uncertain reconstruction of the future hydrologic regime and balance evolution fenocchi et al 2018 the lake elevation is set to the reference one of lake maggiore table 2 through a calibrated input discharge that opposes daily evaporation the model reproduces the relevant features of thermal evolution in the study period adopting a fictitiously low light extinction coefficient to mimic the advective heat of riverine intrusions the limits of this assumption are discussed in fenocchi et al 2017 the same schematisation parameters boundary and initial conditions used in fenocchi et al 2017 were retained except for the following modifications a fictitious surface inflow was employed instead of a fictitious rainfall to fulfil the fixed level constraint this way nutrient loads from tributaries were input at the lake surface the employed daily inflow concentrations were obtained as follows 1 the overall calculated mean monthly loads e g fig 2a were linearly interpolated at a daily scale 2 the daily inflow concentrations were calculated as ratios between the total loads and the calibrated fictitious discharges this modification did not impact the hydrodynamic model accuracy assuming input loads to always enter at the surface may be realistic for minor inflows their momentum and buoyancy forces being rapidly damped the main tributaries rivers ticino and toce intrude at shallow depths 10 20 m during most of the year sometimes reaching the surface in early spring yet they sink to much lower depths also 200 m throughout late autumn and winter fenocchi et al 2017 the employed schematisation seemed however the most reasonable one given the heterogeneity of the tributaries of lake maggiore spanning large rivers natural and dammed mountain streams creeks and outflows of smaller lakes and reservoirs with a wide range of discharges and temperatures fenocchi et al 2017 and the aim of reproducing future scenarios in which changes in the intrusion behaviour are expected fenocchi et al 2018 in the present model nutrients are hence passed to lower layers only through vertical mixing and sinking of particulate organic matter and phytoplankton outflow of nutrients is not represented due to missing emissary in the model such approximation is suitable for lake maggiore due to its large surface and volume and relatively long renewal time table 2 which make nutrient recycling prevalent for primary production the minimum and maximum thicknesses of the model layers were increased from hmin 0 1 m to hmin 0 2 m and from hmax 0 5 m to hmax 2 0 m respectively this was done to speed up calculations in view of the manifold realisations needed to obtain robust statistical predictions with a monte carlo approach for future climate change scenarios fenocchi et al 2018 this modification impacted model accuracy requiring a slight recalibration of the light extinction coefficient from k d 0 098 m 1 to k d 0 100 m 1 and of the wind enhancement factor from kw 1 15 to kw 1 14 the final root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae for water temperature over the whole depth and over separate epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion are nevertheless 10 larger than in fenocchi et al 2017 2 3 2 ecological module the glm model was coupled to the aquatic ecodynamics aed2 ecological model hipsey et al 2013 the conceptual model of the current application is illustrated in fig 3b a basic npd nutrients phytoplankton detritus structure was employed oxygen phosphorus nitrogen silica carbon organic matter and phytoplankton cycles were included mortality of phytoplankton due to grazing by zooplankton and fish was subsumed into phytoplankton respiration bruce et al 2006 burger et al 2008 rigosi et al 2011 snortheim et al 2017 heterotrophic bacterial respiration was captured through mineralisation of particulate pom and dissolved dom organic matter bruce et al 2006 2008 li et al 2013 snortheim et al 2017 the contribution of macrophytes to primary production in lake maggiore is negligible compared to that of phytoplankton guilizzoni et al 1989 as typical of large deep lakes due to the relatively restricted littoral zone grzybowski 2014 rounsefell 1946 nutrient release from sediments was not considered because the overlying water column was well oxygenated in the simulated period rogora et al 2018 the ecological module runs with the same hourly time step of the hydrodynamic one allowing the resolution of photosynthesis bruce et al 2006 phytoplankton was modelled through four functional groups based on taxonomic classes cyanophytes diatoms dinophytes and c3phytes which includes chlorophytes chrysophytes and cryptophytes the latter group was created to reduce parameterisation the three constituents having similar annual cycles the employed segmentation could potentially allow reproducing the main specific features of phytoplankton in lake maggiore 1 cyanophytes bloom in late summer and resist high water temperatures 2 diatoms rapidly bloom between late winter and early spring at low temperatures and uptake silica for their shells 3 dinophytes bloom in early summer can withstand low phosphorus levels and have low winter survival rate 4 c3phytes bloom in late spring primary peak and in early autumn secondary peak at tepid temperatures and survive at moderate concentrations during winter with chrysophytes 26 of the observed biovolume of the functional group in the study period uptaking silica for their shells fixed c n and c si ratios were assumed for phytoplankton functional groups dynamic c p ratios being adopted only for the limiting nutrient to which the output is most sensitive bruce et al 2008 carraro et al 2012 martins et al 2008 omlin et al 2001 constant c chl a ratios were also employed for the functional groups these being actually variable in time for each species kara et al 2012 rigosi et al 2011 silica uptake was activated for diatoms and c3phytes photoinhibition and n fixation were not simulated as the calibrated k d value is artificial feedback of bio turbidity on the light extinction coefficient was not considered as the resulting alterations would have triggered non linear effects rinke et al 2010 observed that adopting a variable k d rather than a constant one resulted in surface temperature differences in the order of 1 c for simulations of lake constance germany switzerland austria even under altered trophic status these are much lower than the expected warming over the 21st century fenocchi et al 2018 a proper light extinction coefficient k d 0 227 m 1 was yet considered in the phytoplankton submodule to reproduce light limitation as resulting from the poole and atkins 1929 equation given the mean observed secchi depth in the study period s d 7 49 m fenocchi et al 2017 the initial vertical profiles of chemical variables i e o2 po4 no3 nh4 sio2 dop don dic doc poc were set to piecewise linear interpolations of the sampled values on the first day of simulation as done for water temperature fenocchi et al 2017 concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients were again calculated as dop tp p po4 and don tn n nh3 n nh4 pop and pon being negligible also in lake maggiore cnr ise 2013b for phytoplankton groups initial constant concentrations equal to the observed integrated values were assumed in the sampled 0 20 m layer linearly decreasing to zero in the 20 30 m layer with null phytoplankton below the measured series of biovolumes of the functional groups were converted into the carbon concentrations needed by aed2 according to reynolds 2006 2 4 ecological module calibration the considered time span was split into calibration and validation periods the former including the 8 year interval between 1 january 1999 and 31 december 2006 and the latter the 7 79 year one between 1 january 2007 and 14 october 2014 table 1 the initial 1998 year of simulation served as model spin up systematic inferior performances being observed in the first annual phytoplankton cycle likely due to the approximate initial conditions manual trial and error calibration was adopted to tune the ecological module adjusting the parameters mostly within literature boundaries until the fit to observations could no longer be improved appreciably automatic calibration techniques rigosi et al 2011 still cannot be applied successfully to coupled models of deep lakes with multiple plankton groups defining an optimisation function including several variables at various depths would be ambiguous huge computational resources would be needed due to the dimensions of the parameter space trolle et al 2011 and convergence problems would arise because of the non linear interactions between physics chemistry and biology rigosi et al 2011 literature values when applicable were taken from the modelling studies in table 1 employing the dyresm caedym elcom caedym glm aed and dyresm wq coupled models which share the schematisation and main algorithms with glm aed2 to be sure that parameters have the same meaning adopting a literature value for a parameter did not imply that the latter was omitted from the calibration process as multiple published values were tested due to the many variables compromises to the fit of single ones had to be made for the sake of overall model performances resulting errors were compared with published ones to state their acceptability model fit of chemical variables was optimised in the deep hypolimnion i e in the 200 370 m layer being the predictability of the long term evolution in this layer one of the research aims furthermore chemical processes are more properly calibrated in the deep hypolimnion being most isolated from the biological and physical ones sample results are also given for the epilimnetic 0 20 m layer for chemical variables both observations and model results were numerically integrated from the values at the sampling depths calibrated variables were those for which extended observations were available o2 po4 no3 nh4 sio2 dop and don for phytoplankton fit was monitored in the 0 20 m layer of the integrated samples numerically integrating model results at 1 m resolution parameters of the phytoplankton groups were calibrated to allow growth up to the observed biomasses despite excess surface nutrients so that the obtained values reflect the adopted schematisation results for 0 20 m and 200 370 m water temperatures are also reported numerically integrated as for the chemical variables preliminary manual calibration was based on visual screening of the agreement of the trends of chemical variables and of overall quantitative equivalence and suitable succession timing for phytoplankton multiple goodness of fit metrics were employed for fine tuning both the pearson and the spearman correlation coefficients r and rs were considered tested for p value significance the pearson correlation coefficient measures the ability of the model to reproduce observed trends at the intra and inter annual scales the spearman correlation coefficient has a similar meaning yet it weighs the error on the timing of fluctuations disregarding quantitative differences gal et al 2009 thus being meaningful to evaluate the prediction of phytoplankton succession the normalised mean absolute error nmae and the normalised mean error nme indices were also considered while nmae states the average error nme expresses the systematic one revealing the bias and drift effects which can be significant over long time series the target of calibration was a compromise between maximum r and rs and minimum nmae and nme for each variable the calibration process required multiple shifts between chemical and phytoplankton levels due to the interactions between them normalisation by mean observed value is standard practice for nmae and nme this is adequate for variables displaying small gradients and whose mean values are important to be reproduced kara et al 2012 but leads to error misrepresentation when peak values are much larger than mean ones alewell and manderscheid 1998 bruce et al 2006 it is then inappropriate for phytoplankton for which prominent seasonal blooms occur and the mean is biased by very small winter concentrations and for nutrients in the epilimnion which have much higher concentrations in winter with minimum primary production than during the rest of the year therefore for fluctuating variables in the epilimnion we also normalised by the observed mean annual range nmaer and nmer in addition to by the mean value nmaem and nmem 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameters the final values of the chemical parameters resulting from the calibration and literature selection processes are listed in table 3 specific tuning had to be performed for 10 out of 27 chemical parameters a very high nitrification rate and a very low denitrification rate compared to the literature range had to be used to match the very low reducing properties of lake maggiore waters these are due to the present oligotrophic conditions and to the oxygenation of deep layers preventing denitrification and redox processes rogora et al 2018 at the same time lake maggiore is characterised by quite high no3 concentrations mainly due to the nitrogen input from atmospheric deposition mosello et al 2001 table 4 lists the final values of the phytoplankton parameters for the four functional groups specific tuning was performed for 31 out of 80 parameters unusually high growth rate and low standard optimum and maximum temperatures were adopted for diatoms to reproduce their remarkably rapid early and prominent blooms in cold waters and their early decay due to the spring bloom of zooplankton not included in the model similar less extreme parameters were employed for c3phytes which bloom later in spring to much smaller biomasses very low phytoplankton temperature parameters were also used by carraro et al 2012 and copetti et al 2006 to reproduce very early blooms of similar phytoplankton assemblages in the neighbouring lake pusiano northern italy a respiration loss rate well outside the upper literature boundary was employed to model the late peak and low winter survival rate of dinophytes the moderate winter concentrations of c3phytes were reproduced through a small value of the same parameter despite the approximation on nutrients wholly entering at the surface adopted phosphorus parameters are all inside literature ranges maximum internal p concentrations being set to the upper boundaries for diatoms and dinophytes peculiarly high internal nitrogen concentrations had to be used for the four functional groups to avoid excess no3 concentrations in the epilimnion being spread to the hypolimnion with mixing events these may be due to lacking nutrient immobilisation by heterotrophic bacteria as well as possible input load overestimation 3 2 model results the evaluations on water temperature modelling in fenocchi et al 2017 are still valid the seasonal cycle of water temperature in the 0 20 m layer is well reproduced fig 4 a with comparable performances to literature table 5 an overestimation of summer epilimnetic temperatures is yet obtained in the 2007 2014 period being maximum for 2013 a staircase like evolution results in the 200 370 m layer instead of the irregular observed trend fig 4b this should be ascribed to 1 missing heat advection by deep intrusions of tributaries in the model 2 approximate reproduction of deep mixing in all 1d models fenocchi et al 2017 2018 3 absent local horizontal inhomogeneities 1d models returning laterally averaged results 4 analytical errors on observations goodness of fit metrics in the deep hypolimnion are nevertheless equivalent to published ones with a particularly small nmaem table 5 homeothermic conditions correctly result at the end of winters 1999 and 2006 when complete mixing events occurred the evolution of dissolved oxygen concentration in the 200 370 m layer is well simulated fig 5 a reproducing the replenishments from upper layers during full 1999 2006 and partial 2000 2004 2005 turnovers the simulated oxygen consumption curve in the validation period after the last chemical homogenisation is straighter than the observed one missing deep oxygen input from interflows and underestimated diffusion from water layers above would contribute to this mismatch in addition model parameters for o2 consuming processes were calibrated over a period in which frequent deep mixing events occurred whereas none of them occurred during validation however measured data for the last few years 2016 2018 agree with the steeper decrease of o2 predicted by the model rogora et al 2018 optimal prediction of deep water orthophosphate is obtained in calibration and validation fig 5b the accumulation curve being properly matched during the latter period for nitrate fig 5c the model reproduces small concentration jumps in the deep hypolimnion with complete and partial mixing events absent in the observations this should be ascribed to a more heterogeneous modelled vertical distribution of no3 than the observed one observations also display a steadier nitrate concentration due to perfect equilibrium between nitrification and denitrification which could not be fully reproduced for deep water o2 po4 and no3 model performances are analogous or better than literature ones in calibration and validation table 5 with distinctly lower nmaem values the model does not reproduce the short scale irregularities of all chemical variables in the deep hypolimnion such issue is common to modelling studies burger et al 2008 copetti et al 2006 trolle et al 2008a 2008b 2011 and should be credited to the same error sources identified for water temperature high frequency oscillations are particularly relevant for ammonium fig 5d and dissolved organic phosphorus fig 5f and nitrogen fig 5g their amplitude being comparable or predominant over that of inter annual trends this results in low non significant correlation coefficients and higher nmaem values than for o2 po4 and no3 table 5 even though inter annual trends in the calibration and validation periods are visually satisfactorily reproduced comparing model results to moving averages of observed data for nh4 dop and don in the deep hypolimnion leads to similar goodness of fit metrics to those of o2 po4 and no3 for ammonium the relevant observed oscillations should be mostly caused by the very low measured concentrations around or below the limit of detection 0 32 mmol n m3 producing an analytical error comparable to the actual signal cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 li et al 2013 trolle et al 2011 strong irregularities in the observed trends of dop and don would be also due to these being calculated variables affected by analytical errors on both total and inorganic forms in addition to oscillations of neglected pop and pon the worst agreement is attained for deep water silica concentrations fig 5e for which an increase is correctly reproduced yet with an improper staircase like evolution in addition to the error sources listed for water temperature such behaviour is ascribable to the simplified silica cycle within aed2 hipsey et al 2013 agreement of chemical variables in the 0 20 m layer is less accurate straightforward causes are the chemical module being optimised in the deep hypolimnion and the assumption of all nutrients entering the lake at the surface most importantly the annual cycles of nutrients in the epilimnion are much harder to reproduce than the long term trends in deep waters as surface values strongly depend on the quantitative accuracy of phytoplankton modelling in addition in oligotrophic systems as lake maggiore seasonal epilimnetic oscillations are not as clearly defined as in eutrophic ones making model fit more difficult chemical variables are also more horizontally heterogeneous in the epilimnion due to the higher interaction with physical and biological patchiness sources therefore laboriously optimising chemical processes in the epilimnion could not produce a significant improvement we herein report sample results for the limiting nutrient po4 fig 6 and table 5 whose annual cycle is adequately reproduced in the calibration period with some underestimation model fit however degrades during validation together with that of phytoplankton due to the strong influence of its uptake significant pearson and spearman correlation coefficients r 0 36 and r 0 23 rs 0 39 and rs 0 29 also result in the calibration period for epilimnetic no3 and nh4 respectively for phytoplankton fig 7 table 5 cycling and succession among functional groups are satisfactorily reproduced larger errors occurring in biomasses estimation as also observed in cui et al 2016 gal et al 2009 li et al 2013 özkundakci et al 2011 and rigosi et al 2011 this is confirmed by the generally higher spearman correlation coefficients than the pearson ones in calibration and validation the huge mougeotia bloom in summer 2011 is not reproduced as this distorts the validation error metrics for c3phytes and total chl a values excluding 2011 are considered for such variables pearson correlation coefficients for calibration and validation are higher than the average literature values for both total phytoplankton and individual groups equivalent to only slightly inferior performances are obtained for single functional groups compared to total chl a regarding annual cycling as revealed by spearman correlation coefficients worst correlations are obtained for the aggregated c3phytes group due to the less specific calibrated parameters modelling of total chl a seems better than that of individual groups according to nmaem whose values are all aligned with literature ones in calibration and validation yet comparable performances result for nmaer phytoplankton modelling deteriorates in validation first annual cycling is less accurate as revealed by the decrease of spearman correlation coefficients for total chl a and all functional groups except cyanophytes being most relevant for diatoms second a notable underestimation of peak concentrations occurs for cyanophytes and diatoms whereas an overestimation is obtained for c3phytes as highlighted by nmem and nmer underprediction results for total chl a even if less evident than considering the total phytoplankton carbon concentration highlighting the error of employing constant c chl a ratios pearson correlation coefficients consequently decrease for all phytoplankton variables from calibration to validation to a higher extent than spearman ones accuracy variations between calibration and validation were not systematically observed in the considered literature studies likely due to the short simulated periods table 1 3 3 model validity the performances of the present coupled ecological hydrodynamic model of lake maggiore in calibration and validation are equivalent if not superior to those of literature studies table 5 for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods table 1 the chemical evolution of the deep hypolimnion throughout the simulated period is well reproduced especially for dissolved oxygen and orthophosphate fig 5 table 5 whose future trends are of great concern in relation to climate change lake maggiore as the other deep lakes south of the alps is already showing a decrease of o2 and an accumulation of po4 in deep waters rogora et al 2018 see also figs 5a 5b due to the increasing water column stability brought by climate warming fenocchi et al 2018 the much smaller nmaem values obtained for deep water chemical variables compared to literature studies table 5 descend also from the great depth of lake maggiore whose deep hypolimnion is isolated from seasonal primary production so that its modelling is mostly unaffected by errors on phytoplankton reproduction of phytoplankton is satisfactory even for single functional groups yet model performances decrease during validation fig 7 table 5 this is due to the extensive parameterisation of biological processes and the consequent dependence on calibration shifts in the assemblages of functional groups are a fundamental source of error in phytoplankton modelling and cannot be reproduced unless all individual species entered the model leading to a prohibitive number of parameters during the calibration period substantial stability of the dominant species established with oligotrophication in the early 1990s was observed in lake maggiore cnr ise 2003 2008 morabito et al 2012 likely allowing suitable calibration results to be attained yet some obtained discrepancies in that period should still be ascribed to inter annual changes in the proportions among species and in the physiology of the same species with adaptation compositional shifts of diatoms and cyanophytes towards species typical of more nutrient enriched waters which had been dominant during eutrophication were observed in the validation period cnr ise 2013 2016 marchetto et al 2004 such changes would explain the performance drop in validation for these two groups figs 7b 7c table 5 the overestimation of summer epilimnetic temperatures in the validation period fig 4a table 5 may contribute to the underestimation of diatoms the missing exceptional mougeotia bloom in 2011 fig 7e is unavoidable since a specific functional group for the taxon would have been needed its parameterisation yet eluding the present knowledge as the positive conditions for growth are not clear tapolczai et al 2015 recent changes in phytoplankton assemblages in lake maggiore occurred despite stable nutrient loads fig 2 and oligotrophic conditions according to total chl a fig 7a these shifts could have been triggered by the shallower mixing depths and the surface warming fig 4a occurred after 2006 the new dominant species favouring warmer and more stratified waters cnr ise 2016 even if physical factors which are the main drivers of phytoplankton evolution under nutrient limitation morabito et al 2012 are simulated by the coupled model the inability to reproduce species shifts would be a severe limitation when forecasting climate change effects as blooms of new dominant species would not be detected bruce et al 2006 özkundakci et al 2011 snortheim et al 2017 phytoplankton shifts would increase in the future as surface water temperature and lake stratification are set to keep increasing fenocchi et al 2018 salmaso 2010 adopting multiple functional groups as done here would hence allow better long term results than using a single variable as some large scale features of phytoplankton shifting could be reproduced future shifts in phytoplankton species could also be caused by shifts at higher ecosystem levels not even explicitly modelled herein through different predation as happened in the past for lake maggiore manca and ruggiu 1998 latest phytoplankton blooms under oligotrophic conditions have been speculated to be supported by scarcely detectable nutrient inputs such as diffuse sources during impulse rainfalls callieri et al 2014 morabito et al 2018 such feeding is not included in the present model in which diffuse runoff and groundwater input are neglected and mean monthly discharges and isolated sampled concentrations at the main tributaries were employed to calculate input loads approximate nutrient loads also contribute to general discrepancies on chemical and biological variables errors in the estimation of missing discharges should also be considered in addition the approximate monthly frequency of water chemistry and phytoplankton observations used for model calibration and validation is probably too sparse to catch epilimnetic seasonal variability discrepancies coming from input loads all entering at the surface should finally be recognised horizontal heterogeneity is another fundamental error source patchiness peaks at the surface due to maximum influence of non uniform external factors and declines with depth due to growing isolation and inertia the validity of the 1d hypothesis therefore increases with depth though some patchiness still affects chemical variables in the deep hypolimnion due to non uniform mixing at small spatial and time scales phytoplankton patchiness is most relevant depending on the combination of horizontal physical chemical and biological heterogeneities hillmer et al 2008 kara et al 2012 systematic horizontal heterogeneity patterns observed in the vertical samples over longer time scales are included into the calibrated parameters causing a drop of performances if they change during validation hillmer et al 2008 an issue which we cannot exclude for the present case theoretically a 1d model could return results that better describe laterally averaged conditions than those in the vertical samples in this regard the ghiffa station is in the centre of lake maggiore and has been demonstrated to experience average surface water temperature epilimnion thickness chemical and phytoplankton trends to those of the northern and southern regions cnr ise 2013b the casual patchiness at local and brief time scales instead cannot be represented by 1d models and represents a significant part of the error due to phytoplankton horizontal heterogeneity in the present case given the limits discussed above a modelling application targeting phytoplankton succession alone specialising chemical variables calibration in the epilimnion could not give much better results than the present ones in fact a less parametrical ecosystem description would be needed to significantly improve the forecasting performances under changing conditions schladow and hamilton 1997 progress in the description of biochemical processes could make models less dependent on calibration and hence on data availability otherwise observation availability would keep impairing coupled ecological hydrodynamic modelling in this study we were able to calibrate the model over an extended period and accomplish a thorough analysis of results thanks to the large dataset available for lake maggiore yet we still had to adopt some simplifications due to the lack of information which increased the dependence on parameterisation thus impacting model performances in validation 4 conclusions the present application of glm aed2 to lake maggiore over 1998 2014 has shown that through extensive calibration 1d coupled ecological hydrodynamic models can have for prolonged simulations of deep large lakes comparable performances to those found in literature for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods the chemical evolution of the deep hypolimnion was successfully reproduced also thanks to proper simulation of mixing dynamics a noteworthy decrease of model performances was yet detected in validation for phytoplankton and epilimnetic water chemistry due to the dependence on parameterisation the duration and peculiar features of the considered calibration and validation periods highlighted some relevant limits of coupled models for long term prognoses of climate change effects on phytoplankton especially for basins with stable oligotrophic loading and reduced mixing as expected for many oligomictic lakes in the western world for the 21st century the impossibility to reproduce shifts in phytoplankton species stands out against other factors nevertheless the forecasting abilities would be compatible with management purposes the feedback to nutrient load variations over single years being qualitatively reproduced features such as variations in the timing of the succession and in the proportions among functional groups could also be inferred a single application can address hypolimnetic chemistry and phytoplankton evolution in deep temperate lakes given the marginal benefits of specific models quantitative results should be interpreted with care according to the limitations and assumptions behind each model experience from validation may help to characterise the forecasting behaviour of a model yet unexpected errors may always arise with changing external conditions these may especially originate from out of bounds parameter values employed to amend for improperly described biochemical processes which could potentially cause relevant non linear misbehaviours comparison against a reference scenario without variations in climate and nutrient loads is strongly recommended to critically frame the obtained results acknowledgments and data the limnological and meteorological data used in the present study were collected through the research programs funded for lake maggiore by the

25138,this research aims to develop a decision support system based on the conservation of biotopes within a mediterranean agricultural landscape through the optimization of agricultural productivity the first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium resolution satellite sensor data recorded by landsat and sentinel 2 over lower seyhan plain lsp located at the eastern mediterranean coast of turkey between 2010 and 2016 in the second stage crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat corn and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the cropsyst model additionally the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related n load in the last stage conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels the model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat cotton first crop corn and second crop corn 21 28 47 and 4 of total production in lsp respectively the average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161 548 tons and equal to 16 5 of the total plain area the largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation the largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second crop corn whereas the smallest amount from wheat it can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics reduced by 5 for wheat 10 for first crop corn and 50 for second crop corn as a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and n load to the wetlands will decrease keywords wetlands remote sensing crop yield cropsyst 1 introduction soils are losing their fertile characteristics due to intensive production as a result of this application of fertilisers are intensified therefore biotope conservation and management become an important agenda in agricultural landscapes where contain a network of ecological corridors including field boundaries margins and hedgerows dominated by reed and wetlands as crucial habitats gulcin and yilmaz 2017 jaskulski and jaskulska 2012 intensive agricultural use has definitely changed wetland ecological character thus biodiversity around wetlands has often been affected severely and large parts may no longer even qualify as wetlands however nature protection based agricultural practices takes place in wetlands containing a regime of extensive use without fertilizers or pesticides the species diversity and composition of wetland habitat could be improved verhoeven and setter 2010 fertilizers used to increase agricultural production and quality make a significant impact on food safety and resulted up to 40 yield increase however inappropriate use of fertilizers has detrimental effects on agricultural productivity and natural environment therefore a new approach is needed to devise agricultural landscape management for nature conservation by changing agricultural crop pattern considering the sensitive biotope areas thus appropriate crop rotations should be applied based on the productivity of the agricultural area and the water and fertiliser demands which may have impact on wetlands globally a significant portion of the freshwater resources 72 are used in agricultural irrigation geerts and raes 2009 rapid increase in the world population and the larger demand for water use across the sectors increase the importance of efficient use of irrigation water thus determining the optimum strategies for management and planning of existing water resources in agriculture is becoming a national and global priority smith 2000 as studies continue to increase the agricultural production in the world monitoring and modelling activities to diminish the negative effects of agricultural activities on the environment morgan 2003 researchers have concentrated on topics such as water sensitivity and water production functions of plants during different developmental periods as a result of rapid decline of water resources in recent years one of the promising approaches is the study of water use analyses based on the efficiency of the consumed water instead of crop yield by determining the relationship of water potential with soil plants and the atmosphere molden and sakthivadivel 1999 especially in locations and periods where water is scarce knowing the periods when plants are most affected by water stress has become very important in terms of irrigation management in such cases obtaining the highest production per unit water is possible by administrating the water allocation during critical growth stages sezen 2000 crop growth models for estimating and simulating plant and environmental interactions include different geodetic scales for different objectives boote et al 1996 such as the evaluation of management strategies bergez et al 2010 and environmental impact assessment ewert et al 2009 they can be used at any scale from global such as the impact of climate change to local studies such as land quality and crop change in general they are designed to model the complex interactions between crop management soil and the atmosphere and to estimate agricultural yields taking into account the environmental impacts of crop cultivation such as leaching erosion adekalu and fapohunda 2006 bechini et al 2006 gary et al 1998 johnsson et al 2002 wetlands take place between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with unique hydrological and biological characteristics however increased human activities have resulted wetland destruction at alarming rates wetlands not only provide water resources and aquatic products for human but also support ecological functions such as improving climate increasing water quality and maintaining ecological balance additionally wetlands have been used for agriculture for thousands of years they provide a range of valuable ecosystem services such as the provision of food and clean water the retention of soil and the cycling of nutrients although wetland protection is officially a priority for 159 nations as of 2009 that have ratified the ramsar convention www ramsar org wetlands continue to be under threat of being drained and reclaimed based on the expected growth of the world population in the next 25 years the need for food products will increase 50 by 2030 hassan et al 2005 in addition there is a growing trend to grow energy crops for use in biofuel production smeets et al 2007 all these developments will lead to a greater pressure to reclaim the remaining natural areas for agricultural purposes this could mean that wetlands run an increasingly higher risk of being drained and destroyed another consequence may be the active search for more flood tolerant and salt tolerant crop varieties that may grow successfully under limited periods of waterlogging or drought associated salt stress this may lead to agricultural activities in wetlands that leave the water regime of the wetland intact but still disturb the wetland ecosystem by adding fertilizer or pesticides important aspects of a wetland s character will therefore be harmed and functions other than productivity may still be diminished or destroyed verhoeven and setter 2010 the main output of the agricultural landscape decision support system is the realization of a more successful nature compatible agricultural production by providing more efficient decision and policy making at each component and scale of regional agriculture however it is impossible to think of the regulation of agricultural activities independently of nature conservation elements in this context ensuring the protection and continuity of the biotopes in the region is an important element of holistic planning the aim of this study was to create an agricultural landscape decision support system for lsp to devise nature conservation strategies based on crop growth modelling using cropsyst crop development model to understand agricultural productivity and water consumption in relation with water quantitiy and quality to the wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the çukurova delta is located at the eastern mediterranean coast of turkey it is one of the most fertile plains in turkey seyhan and ceyhan rivers have formed the delta by sediment movements the ceyhan and seyhan rivers have a narrow reservoir both have very high water flow rates due to melting snow and high precipitation in the spring major floods have occurred in the plain during this period and the beds of the rivers have frequently changed fig 1 thus many ponds lagoons oxbows and marsh areas have been formed mainly at the south part of the plain there are three major lagoons in the study area from west to east tuzla akyatan and agyatan lagoons dinçer 2007 donmez et al 2016 satir and berberoglu 2016 the margins of wetlands covered with dense reed beds are the most important habitat for fauna including water fowl and fish the depth of water is generally shallow and silt and suspended sediment from the agricultural drainage canals threaten to these biotopes yilmaz 1998 spontaneous hedgerows dominated by reed are the essential elements of biotope network in irrigated plains in the mediterranean the southern part of the study area where the largest coastal dune area in europe exists is a breeding site of endangered sea turtle species such as loggerhead caretta caretta and green turtles chelonia mydas alphan and yilmaz 2005 baran and kasparek 1989 yilmaz et al 2002 2 2 dataset the seyhan and ceyhan rivers play an important role in the formation of the soil in çukurova delta the lsp was mapped on the basis of soil series dinc et al 1990 vertosol soil 76 5 and red brown mediterranean soil 10 6 are widely present in the çukurova region soil profiles profile depth ph values amount of organic matter cation exchange capacity amount of lime texture volume and total porosity have been studied in detail for 20 soil series in the study area akça et al 2018 dinc et al 1990 özcan et al 2018 fig 2 lsp is under mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 18 19 c the lowest average monthly temperature is 9 10 c january and the highest is 28 c august the low annual temperature difference in the plain allows agricultural activities throughout the year the average annual precipitation is 721 mm and the dominant wind direction is north northeast in winter and south southwest in summer çelik et al 2013 tsms 2017 since the amount of evapotranspiration is higher than the amount of precipitation between november and april irrigation for the plain is also carried out during this period the groundwater level in the area ranges between 80 and 120 cm and an average of 430 million m3 of water is used annually from the wells sentinel 2 a landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli satellite data were used to map the agricultural land cover in the study area the sentinel 2 a satellite contains visible near infrared and medium range infrared sensors with a scan width of 290 km including 13 spectral bands four bands at 10 m geodetic resolution six bands at 20 m resolution and three bands at 60 m resolution along a 185 km wide swath covering wide areas of the earth s landscape while providing sufficient resolution to distinguish features like settlements farms forests and other land uses landsat 8 oli consists of nine spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 7 and 9 2 3 method this study aims to create an agricultural landscape decision support system considers wetland conservation at the lsp this process includes two major phases fig 3 2 3 1 object based classification homogeneous image objects were produced in the first stage of object based classification by applying different algorithms and approaches to image pixels then spatial and spectral properties of these image objects were determined and training and test data were prepared for controlled classification finally a class is assigned to each image object in accordance with the specified properties belgiu and drǎguţ 2014 in the pixel based classification technique each pixel was evaluated and assigned to a class while in object based classification a level was assigned to the homogeneous objects composed of pixels the most common approach for image pixels is the implementation of the multi resolution segmentation algorithm this algorithm allows for different users with three different parameters such as scale shape and compactness belgiu and drǎguţ 2014 kavzaoglu et al 2015 myint et al 2011 a group of pixels having near reflections for each band in the image are grouped by variables such as texture length area colour as well as selected scale shape and compactness properties thus the heterogeneity within the segments is reduced to the lowest after the segmentation process each segment is assigned to the nearest neighbour class according to the supervised classification then the whole segments are classified according to mean values of each selected class 2 3 2 cropsyst crop development model the cropsyst plant development model was developed to serve as an analytical tool to investigate the impacts of climate soil and management on productivity and the environment it was mainly developed as a user friendly interface by integrating geographic information systems gis climate data generator and other utility programs therefore we used the cropsyst model to simulate yield and water use of the main crops in this study this model is suitable for use in the study of soil water budget nitrogen budget and weather variables these processes are influenced by plant management practices such as climate soil characteristics crop characteristics and planting season variety selection irrigation nitrogen fertilization soil and irrigation salinity soil treatment and residue management stöckle et al 2003 the development of cropsyst began at the beginning of the 1990s it is based on relevant observations that require plant development models that are not particularly capable of regular crop alternations for their development model developers have collaborated with many researchers to design this fast and low cost computer software for users in scientific projects stöckle et al 2003 cropsyst is a multi year multi crop simulation model developed to study the effect of cropping systems management on productivity and environment stöckle et al 2003 stöckle and nelson 2000 this model has been used to model the growth and development of several crops such as wheat maize barley soybean and sorghum in the western usa southern france northern and southern italy northern syria northern spain and western australia with generally good results stöckle 1996 cropsyst has also been used to assess the effect of climate change on crop yield abraha and savage 2006 díaz ambrona et al 2013 donatelli et al 2015 2003 sommer et al 2013 stöckle et al 2010 tingem et al 2008 tubiello et al 2000 this model was also calibrated and validated for many regions to estimate yield and phonological data abraha 2003 the model comprises several integrated components and different managing opportunities details about parts and usages can be obtained in the model user s manual stöckle and nelson 2000 and elsewhere stöckle et al 1994 3 results and discussion in the first stage of the study agricultural crop pattern of lsp was mapped through object based classification method using landsat and sentinel 2 satellite data between 2010 and 2016 in the crop classification crop phenology was determined by generating minimum maximum and average ndvi normalized difference vegetation index values for each land cover at the monthly period therefore two different periods were defined as winter and summer crop patterns for the study area images recorded in march and april are ideal for mapping winter crop pattern and images of may and august period are suitable for summer crop mapping the dominant agricultural crop pattern for the plain was derived by mapping the last seven years crop pattern in the study area wheat and watermelon are typical winter crops and 1 st and 2nd crop corn cotton soybean and peanut are included as summer crops in the second stage of the study the cropsyst crop simulation model was applied to estimate the spatial and temporal yields of winter wheat corn and cotton using agricultural crop pattern classification performed in the first stage modelling was conducted in four steps database creation model calibration validation and model results calibration and validation procedures were carried out using climate soil crop pattern management and rotation data previously measured during the field surveys performed in the region the cropsyst model was applied using climate data derived from 19 stations together with crop maps including wheat corn and cotton parcels planted on 20 different soil series in the third stage of the study wetlands where agricultural applications directly influence through contaminated drainage water were determined the amount of water from agricultural drainage and the total nitrogen load to wetlands were evaluated management and monitoring of agricultural practices in the region have great importance as the water needs of wetlands are mostly supplied from these streams that come from agricultural drainage and precipitation 3 1 mapping the agricultural land cover in lsp the atmospheric correction was applied to remotely sensed images to remove the atmospheric effects on electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth the dark object subtraction dos method chavez 1988 which is widely used to remove atmospheric distortions was used this method assumes that atmospheric conditions are homogeneous and there are dark objects with shallow reflection values in the image the minimum reflectance value in the image histogram is determined from very dark areas and then applied to all pixels for each band since the minimum reflectance values are different for each band these operations are performed separately each land cover class shows different reflection values at different wavelengths however reflections from some classes are similar in certain growing periods images recorded in march and april were used to classify winter crop pattern may june and july august images were chosen for summer crop patterns to discriminate agricultural classes successfully minimum maximum and average ndvi values for each land cover were produced for 12 different time periods in 2016 based on the samples taken from the field as a result wheat has the highest ndvi value in mid march while watermelon has the highest in the middle of may citrus plantations have similar values throughout the year as it is evergreen however ndvi values for reeds located near the drainage channel were low ndvi values during the winter water surfaces usually have ndvi values below zero but ndvi values ascend during the summer due to the shallow water and plants become visible in the lagoons the average ndvi values range from 0 1 to 0 3 throughout the year for fallow and these values increase from january to march for wheat and decrease until mid may close to harvesting period for watermelon ndvi values are high in the months of april may and june the maize starts to grow in april and reaches in mature stage in june ndvi values of summer crops such as peanuts cotton and soybean increase after june and reach the highest values in july fig 4 image classification is a process where an image is separated into classes or clusters and then defined by revealing the similarities between the pixels using the numerical values on the image townshend 1981 today advanced digital image processing techniques and various methods are used while pixel based classification is a traditional approach the object based classification method is now being used efficiently as geodetic resolutions have improved in recent years in the pixel based classification method each pixel is assigned to a class whereas in object based classification the form of the image is grouped in such a way that it will be meaningful with neighbouring pixels while taking into consideration the reflection properties and textures in this grouping method namely segmentation different weight coefficients can be entered for each band in object based classification the image is transformed into image objects for the size of the objects scale parameter shape and intensity value are entered and image object layers are created since the data are grouped into meaningful polygons in object based classification selected sample areas are homogeneous and the accuracy of the generated classification is higher than that of the pixel based method berberoglu et al 2000 moreover accuracy is further enhanced especially in agricultural areas since it allows manual correction of classification errors agricultural crop pattern was categorized as winter and summer for each year in the whole study area between 2010 and 2016 each agricultural parcel in the study area was classified including winter and summer crop patterns for these periods the wheat plantation area decreased in 2016 by an average of 44 compared to the last six years a decrease of 33 in watermelon and 11 of cotton were estimated there is also an increase of 22 in maize 8 in soya 11 in citrus fruits and 185 in peanut fig 5 crop pattern were mapped to determine dominant agricultural crop patterns from 2010 to 2016 and estimate the yield this enabled modelling the estimated impact loads of pollutants originating from agricultural applications on wetland areas fig 6 object based classification technique with landsat satellite sensor data for the years 2010 2015 and sentinel 2 data for 2016 was used ground truth data together with ndvi and ndmi normalized difference moisture index indices were used as input data to increase classification accuracy ground truth data can also be derived from interpreting high resolution imagery existing classified images or gis data layers the most common way to assess the accuracy of a classified map is to create a set of random points from the ground truth data and compare that to the classified data in a confusion matrix 600 random points were used to derive accuracy figures gps coordinates from agricultural parcels including summer and winter crops were collected to create ground truth data according to accuracy assessment the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy for each class as well as overall kappa index of the agreement were calculated table 1 classification accuracy was evaluated by comparing ground truth with the predicted class results are expressed in an error matrix including the overall and class accuracies table 1 3 2 crop development modeling with cropsyst the cropsyst crop development model was applied to the lower seyhan plain for the modelling of crop development in agricultural crops yield estimation and agricultural pollution for the period of 2010 2016 for the cropsyst model field measurements for the calibration of plant phenology of agricultural crops and management practices were derived from past studies implemented within the research area baydar and kanber 2012 gençel 2009 maya 2007 müjdeci et al 2005 tekin 2011 plant phenological stages for wheat cotton and corn leaf area index lai biomass yield data irrigation and fertilization practices were used in the calibration and validation process of the model parameters used in cropsyst were evaluated for each crop table 2 3 2 1 wheat the data used for the wheat contains 2000 2001 and 2002 data of the field trials performed by müjdeci et al 2005 müjdeci et al 2005 used parcels of 8 m by 8 m and 450 seeds per square meter phenological properties of the wheat crop were calibrated by using the development period dates and total temperature values day degree recorded for 2000 2001 2002 2009 and 2010 during the 1999 2000 winter period simulated lai values were calibrated by the model for wheat and a similar distribution was modelled it was observed that the times of plant development stages such as bolting flowering and physiological maturity were similar to the measurement data the tillering stage was reached 20 days after plantation the bolting stage was reached on day 103 the flowering on day 129 and the physiological maturity stage was reached on day 158 fig 7 calibrated values were modelled during the specified plantation period in the trial in 2000 2001 for wheat and lai distribution was tested according to the model results the emergence stage was reached on day 19 after plantation the flowering stage was reached on day 116 and physiological maturity was reached on day 147 lai values measured between days 120 and 130 were higher than the model estimation owing to the early flowering stage in the model however a two day difference was found in the physiological maturity times as a result there was a 100 kg ha differences between the measurements and the model estimated results in the 2000 2001 winter period these results showed that the calibration of the model for wheat was done precisely when lai and biomass estimation of wheat for the years 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 were assessed similar results with field measurements were obtained with the rapid increase of the biomass amount after the spike stage therefore the calibrated model with lai clearly shows that the parameters for wheat were calibrated for biomass accumulation all measurement and modelled data were compared and the correlation graphs were given by fig 8 3 2 2 cotton the amount of lai and biomass modelled in a full irrigation application was calibrated for the cotton plant lai which increased after crop sprout showed a rapid increase during the formation of the first comb and the first flower but the rate of increase slowed down after the opening of seed capsules the values of lai and biomass increased until the first harvest time showed a minor decrease afterwards and then continued around the same levels until the second harvest since no manual first harvest event was defined for cotton in the model it was determined that 30 of the biomass would be harvested for the first harvest within the model this was the main reason for the decrease in biomass after the first harvest fig 9 lai and biomass data were measured for the cotton from 2005 to 2006 the adjusted r2 or pearson correlation were calculated as 98 6 for lai and 98 1 for biomass fig 10 3 2 3 maize the model was calibrated using management data for maize physiological values were defined according to planting date sprouting eight leaves and top tassel times plant morphology and growth parameters were determined using lai and biomass data the estimations based on the modelled lai values were close to measured values the highest measured lai value was 5 8 on 19 08 2005 the model result was 5 94 on the same date there was a rapid increase in plant biomass after the eight leaf stage for both measured and modelled results fig 11 lai and biomass measurements were implemented for the maize from 2005 to 2006 the adjusted r2 or pearson correlation were 90 0 for lai and 98 3 for biomass fig 12 3 3 modeling crop yield in lsp with cropsyst the cropsyst model was applied to estimate the yield of wheat corn and cotton crops in lsp agricultural crop pattern soil information and climate data recorded between 2010 and 2016 were processed and integrated into agricultural parcels an arccs database was created for each agricultural parcel within a gis environment agricultural crop yields were derived using cropsyst model for 118 348 agricultural parcels as a result of model a consistent increase was observed between 2010 and 2016 despite a decrease in wheat yield in 2013 the highest average yield throughout the plain was estimated as 6206 kg ha in 2016 and the lowest yield was 4751 kg ha in 2010 fig 13 in the study area an average of 36 905 ha of agricultural area was cultivated in seven years and 20 515 78 ton year of wheat were cultivated the annual average wheat yield was estimated as 5514 6 kg ha a significant decline in maize yield was seen in 2012 reached its highest level in 2016 during the last six years the highest average yield of 1 st crop maize and 2nd crop maize throughout the plain was estimated as 10 392 and 9270 kg ha in 2016 respectively and the lowest yield period was in 2012 for 1 st crop maize 5570 kg ha and 2nd crop maize 5571 kg ha fig 14 an average of 6337 9 ha area was cultivated for seven years and 45 297 ton year of second maize was produced the average annual yield of second maize was estimated as 7146 9 kg ha for the last seven years an average of 20 515 8 ha were cultivated and 272 193 ton year of cotton were produced the average annual cotton yield was calculated as 13 267 5 kg ha 3 4 modeling the polluted water from agricultural drainage to the wetlands watershed of each wetland was identified in lsp to take into account the agricultural drainage networks limiting elements such as irrigation and drainage networks and roads were considered during the deliniation of these borders using high resolution imagery cropsyst model results were evaluated based on these watersheds to understand and quantify the impact of agriculture on each wetland as a result the average crop yield was calculated as 161 548 ton year between 2010 and 2016 the yield was ranging from 20 83 kg ha to 10 526 2 kg ha and these agricultural parcels carried in the range of 4 mm to 254 mm drainage water per year to the wetlands 1 7 of total wheat corn and cotton 16 745 4 tons production per year was harvested within the protection zone of wetlands the maximum crop yield was modelled from the akyatan lagoon protection zone number 1 and the lowest yield was from cagirkanli protection zone number 6 amongst the thirteen wetlands shown in fig 1 in terms of mean crop production agyatan and akyatan lagoon zones have the largest while akdam and karayusuflu have the smalest mean production agricultural productivity was higher in these areas due to warmer climatic conditions for crops the maximum production within the thirteen protection zones of wetlands was akyatan lagoon area number 1 and the lowest one was the cagirkanli wetlands number 6 the agricultural drainage coming from cotton and 2nd crop maize was higher than wheat and 1 st crop maize according to the hydrological modelling for these basins this clearly demonstrated that government subsidies for cotton cultivation rather than 1 st crop maize in these locations will result more environmental friendly management practices for wetlands in terms of agricultural drainage water supply especially more crucial for wetlands that have water shortage in summer months the amount of water running into wetlands from agricultural drainage of wetland protection zones was modelled for 2016 11 617 8 m3 of agricultural water came from akyatan lagoon protection zone in 2016 while 183 4 m3 of agricultural water came from tuzla lagoon protection zone the cultivation of cotton and wheat instead of high water consumption crops like maize resulted amount of agricultural drainage to the agyatan lagoon protection zone 0 17 mm modelling results indicated that the largest amount of agricultural drainage water came from cotton whereas the lowest amount came from 1 st crop maize table 3 cotton wheat or wheat and 2nd crop maize cultivation in these zones will enable higher amount of agricultural drainage supply for the sustainability of wetlands ibrikci et al 2015 investigated n inputs and outputs of wheat and maize in lsp through survey studies it was indicated that majority of farmers have used the similar amount of n application the n application for wheat 1 st crop maize 2nd crop maize and cotton were 195 kgn ha 325 kgn ha 325 kgn ha and 232 kgn ha respectively when crop n intake was examined 185 kgn ha for wheat 307 kg n ha for 1 st crop maize and 162 kgn ha for 2nd crop maize was used by plants for photosynthesis and crop growth therefore the amount of applied n remained in soil was 10 kg n ha for wheat 18 kg n ha for 1 st crop maize and 163 kg n ha for 2nd crop maize these values except 2nd crop maize seem to be suitable values for the protection of soil and water resources n applied in agriculture is estimated as the total budget in the soil systems for this study only n as a fertilizer was evaluated within this study the proportion of total n applied in agriculture was 48 9 for 1 st crop maize 31 7 for cotton 18 6 for wheat and 0 8 for 2nd crop maize at the akyatan protection zone number 1 the applied fertilizer efficiency of plants was 95 for wheat and 90 3 for 1 st crop maize however 2nd crop maize taken 49 8 of the applied fertilizer for growth which means50 2 of applied n remained in the soil and discharged to the wetlands thus the use of reduced n fertilizer for 2nd crop maize is highly recommended for these protection zones n application by farmers is generally similar across the lsp due to the homogenious cultural profile of farmers at the region unsufficient number of soil and plant analyses by farmers and uniform subsidy policy for the crop production resulted excessive use of n thus fertilizer application did not vary according to soil properties and years n utilization efficiency is maximized when n fertilizer is used according to plant and soil properties for the lsp alternatively 5 reduction for wheat 10 for 1 st crop maize and 50 for 2nd crop maize will result environmental friendly management practices when the applied fertilizer use is reduced at these rates together with given priority to cotton and 2nd crop maize will improve quality and quantity of drainage water to the wetlands n use efficiency increase will enable protection and sustaining wetland ecosystems which constitute many bird breeding habitats without any income loss of farmers at the wetland protection zones these protection zones are covered with dense reed beds phragmites australis and typha spp which supply excellent habitats for waders and waterfowl this dense vegetation cover forms an ideal habitat for nesting birds yilmaz 1998 therefore these wetlands should be kept away from agricultural pollutants as well as water demand should be met there are many different ecosystem services provided by wetlands that can provide benefit to agriculture and contribute human wellbeing wetlands can support fertile soils reduce erosion and retain sediments and nutrients as well as reduce the potential for salinity and acid sulfate soils support aquaculture or grazing provide habitat for harvestable plant and animal species provide drinking water for stock provide shade wind buffering protection from floods and habitat for birds provide a range of raw products such as timber stock fodder salt peat and firewood act as natural filters in waste water treatment and assist in drought resilience a key challenge for farmers the major outcome of this study was modelling studies can be integrated to the strategic planning of conservation sites at regional and sub catchment scale to achieve more effective management policies by considering and maintaining natural process and income generation of locals additionally crop yield can be assessed on the field based which will support the agricultural management and production strategies more accurately these strategies will be helpful to regulate the type and location of the new establishments and specializations in agricultural production these findings allow the water user associations to make more cost effective and accurate pricing and parcel based monitoring 4 conclusions this study included modeling mapping and analyses of agricultural activities within an intensive agricultural area to keep sustainability of the environment and agricultural activities these conservation and economical issues were considered quantitatively for following objectives management plans that assess and evaluate natural habitats wetland ecosystems and agriculture in a holistic manner use of geodetic models as well as declaration based agricultural data will ensure early and accurate calculation of production reports the identification of habitats consisting of natural and cultural landscapes creates ecological base data for the functional sustainability of protected areas this contributes to the identification and conservation of biological diversity on site determination of conservation areas determination of regional land use capabilities and national needs on the parcel based system in which agricultural incentives are managed regionally rather than basin based and for several years instead of one year may be more productive for production protection use and economic return moreover in yield based systems the damage to agriculture by non agricultural land uses can be more accurately calculated and the long term damage of non agricultural use to the economy and ecosystem can be demonstrated in concrete terms when agricultural areas are considered in the context of ecosystem services the contribution of economic value to the ecosystem can also be calculated accurately when hydrological conditions are neglegted for wetlands the management scheme will be affected negatively therefore the amount of water in wetlands will be decreased seasonally or permanently as a result of this the surface or root zone will begin to dry their ecological character will be definetly altered due to the inappropriate crop cultivation in the wetland protection zone water and soil resources management services need to consider agricultural drainage and irrigation water use together with ecological balance and biodiversity protection in such sensitive zones acknowledgments this work was supported by the scientific projects administrator unit of cukurova university under grant number fdk 2016

25138,this research aims to develop a decision support system based on the conservation of biotopes within a mediterranean agricultural landscape through the optimization of agricultural productivity the first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium resolution satellite sensor data recorded by landsat and sentinel 2 over lower seyhan plain lsp located at the eastern mediterranean coast of turkey between 2010 and 2016 in the second stage crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat corn and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the cropsyst model additionally the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related n load in the last stage conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels the model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat cotton first crop corn and second crop corn 21 28 47 and 4 of total production in lsp respectively the average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161 548 tons and equal to 16 5 of the total plain area the largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation the largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second crop corn whereas the smallest amount from wheat it can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics reduced by 5 for wheat 10 for first crop corn and 50 for second crop corn as a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and n load to the wetlands will decrease keywords wetlands remote sensing crop yield cropsyst 1 introduction soils are losing their fertile characteristics due to intensive production as a result of this application of fertilisers are intensified therefore biotope conservation and management become an important agenda in agricultural landscapes where contain a network of ecological corridors including field boundaries margins and hedgerows dominated by reed and wetlands as crucial habitats gulcin and yilmaz 2017 jaskulski and jaskulska 2012 intensive agricultural use has definitely changed wetland ecological character thus biodiversity around wetlands has often been affected severely and large parts may no longer even qualify as wetlands however nature protection based agricultural practices takes place in wetlands containing a regime of extensive use without fertilizers or pesticides the species diversity and composition of wetland habitat could be improved verhoeven and setter 2010 fertilizers used to increase agricultural production and quality make a significant impact on food safety and resulted up to 40 yield increase however inappropriate use of fertilizers has detrimental effects on agricultural productivity and natural environment therefore a new approach is needed to devise agricultural landscape management for nature conservation by changing agricultural crop pattern considering the sensitive biotope areas thus appropriate crop rotations should be applied based on the productivity of the agricultural area and the water and fertiliser demands which may have impact on wetlands globally a significant portion of the freshwater resources 72 are used in agricultural irrigation geerts and raes 2009 rapid increase in the world population and the larger demand for water use across the sectors increase the importance of efficient use of irrigation water thus determining the optimum strategies for management and planning of existing water resources in agriculture is becoming a national and global priority smith 2000 as studies continue to increase the agricultural production in the world monitoring and modelling activities to diminish the negative effects of agricultural activities on the environment morgan 2003 researchers have concentrated on topics such as water sensitivity and water production functions of plants during different developmental periods as a result of rapid decline of water resources in recent years one of the promising approaches is the study of water use analyses based on the efficiency of the consumed water instead of crop yield by determining the relationship of water potential with soil plants and the atmosphere molden and sakthivadivel 1999 especially in locations and periods where water is scarce knowing the periods when plants are most affected by water stress has become very important in terms of irrigation management in such cases obtaining the highest production per unit water is possible by administrating the water allocation during critical growth stages sezen 2000 crop growth models for estimating and simulating plant and environmental interactions include different geodetic scales for different objectives boote et al 1996 such as the evaluation of management strategies bergez et al 2010 and environmental impact assessment ewert et al 2009 they can be used at any scale from global such as the impact of climate change to local studies such as land quality and crop change in general they are designed to model the complex interactions between crop management soil and the atmosphere and to estimate agricultural yields taking into account the environmental impacts of crop cultivation such as leaching erosion adekalu and fapohunda 2006 bechini et al 2006 gary et al 1998 johnsson et al 2002 wetlands take place between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with unique hydrological and biological characteristics however increased human activities have resulted wetland destruction at alarming rates wetlands not only provide water resources and aquatic products for human but also support ecological functions such as improving climate increasing water quality and maintaining ecological balance additionally wetlands have been used for agriculture for thousands of years they provide a range of valuable ecosystem services such as the provision of food and clean water the retention of soil and the cycling of nutrients although wetland protection is officially a priority for 159 nations as of 2009 that have ratified the ramsar convention www ramsar org wetlands continue to be under threat of being drained and reclaimed based on the expected growth of the world population in the next 25 years the need for food products will increase 50 by 2030 hassan et al 2005 in addition there is a growing trend to grow energy crops for use in biofuel production smeets et al 2007 all these developments will lead to a greater pressure to reclaim the remaining natural areas for agricultural purposes this could mean that wetlands run an increasingly higher risk of being drained and destroyed another consequence may be the active search for more flood tolerant and salt tolerant crop varieties that may grow successfully under limited periods of waterlogging or drought associated salt stress this may lead to agricultural activities in wetlands that leave the water regime of the wetland intact but still disturb the wetland ecosystem by adding fertilizer or pesticides important aspects of a wetland s character will therefore be harmed and functions other than productivity may still be diminished or destroyed verhoeven and setter 2010 the main output of the agricultural landscape decision support system is the realization of a more successful nature compatible agricultural production by providing more efficient decision and policy making at each component and scale of regional agriculture however it is impossible to think of the regulation of agricultural activities independently of nature conservation elements in this context ensuring the protection and continuity of the biotopes in the region is an important element of holistic planning the aim of this study was to create an agricultural landscape decision support system for lsp to devise nature conservation strategies based on crop growth modelling using cropsyst crop development model to understand agricultural productivity and water consumption in relation with water quantitiy and quality to the wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the çukurova delta is located at the eastern mediterranean coast of turkey it is one of the most fertile plains in turkey seyhan and ceyhan rivers have formed the delta by sediment movements the ceyhan and seyhan rivers have a narrow reservoir both have very high water flow rates due to melting snow and high precipitation in the spring major floods have occurred in the plain during this period and the beds of the rivers have frequently changed fig 1 thus many ponds lagoons oxbows and marsh areas have been formed mainly at the south part of the plain there are three major lagoons in the study area from west to east tuzla akyatan and agyatan lagoons dinçer 2007 donmez et al 2016 satir and berberoglu 2016 the margins of wetlands covered with dense reed beds are the most important habitat for fauna including water fowl and fish the depth of water is generally shallow and silt and suspended sediment from the agricultural drainage canals threaten to these biotopes yilmaz 1998 spontaneous hedgerows dominated by reed are the essential elements of biotope network in irrigated plains in the mediterranean the southern part of the study area where the largest coastal dune area in europe exists is a breeding site of endangered sea turtle species such as loggerhead caretta caretta and green turtles chelonia mydas alphan and yilmaz 2005 baran and kasparek 1989 yilmaz et al 2002 2 2 dataset the seyhan and ceyhan rivers play an important role in the formation of the soil in çukurova delta the lsp was mapped on the basis of soil series dinc et al 1990 vertosol soil 76 5 and red brown mediterranean soil 10 6 are widely present in the çukurova region soil profiles profile depth ph values amount of organic matter cation exchange capacity amount of lime texture volume and total porosity have been studied in detail for 20 soil series in the study area akça et al 2018 dinc et al 1990 özcan et al 2018 fig 2 lsp is under mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 18 19 c the lowest average monthly temperature is 9 10 c january and the highest is 28 c august the low annual temperature difference in the plain allows agricultural activities throughout the year the average annual precipitation is 721 mm and the dominant wind direction is north northeast in winter and south southwest in summer çelik et al 2013 tsms 2017 since the amount of evapotranspiration is higher than the amount of precipitation between november and april irrigation for the plain is also carried out during this period the groundwater level in the area ranges between 80 and 120 cm and an average of 430 million m3 of water is used annually from the wells sentinel 2 a landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli satellite data were used to map the agricultural land cover in the study area the sentinel 2 a satellite contains visible near infrared and medium range infrared sensors with a scan width of 290 km including 13 spectral bands four bands at 10 m geodetic resolution six bands at 20 m resolution and three bands at 60 m resolution along a 185 km wide swath covering wide areas of the earth s landscape while providing sufficient resolution to distinguish features like settlements farms forests and other land uses landsat 8 oli consists of nine spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 7 and 9 2 3 method this study aims to create an agricultural landscape decision support system considers wetland conservation at the lsp this process includes two major phases fig 3 2 3 1 object based classification homogeneous image objects were produced in the first stage of object based classification by applying different algorithms and approaches to image pixels then spatial and spectral properties of these image objects were determined and training and test data were prepared for controlled classification finally a class is assigned to each image object in accordance with the specified properties belgiu and drǎguţ 2014 in the pixel based classification technique each pixel was evaluated and assigned to a class while in object based classification a level was assigned to the homogeneous objects composed of pixels the most common approach for image pixels is the implementation of the multi resolution segmentation algorithm this algorithm allows for different users with three different parameters such as scale shape and compactness belgiu and drǎguţ 2014 kavzaoglu et al 2015 myint et al 2011 a group of pixels having near reflections for each band in the image are grouped by variables such as texture length area colour as well as selected scale shape and compactness properties thus the heterogeneity within the segments is reduced to the lowest after the segmentation process each segment is assigned to the nearest neighbour class according to the supervised classification then the whole segments are classified according to mean values of each selected class 2 3 2 cropsyst crop development model the cropsyst plant development model was developed to serve as an analytical tool to investigate the impacts of climate soil and management on productivity and the environment it was mainly developed as a user friendly interface by integrating geographic information systems gis climate data generator and other utility programs therefore we used the cropsyst model to simulate yield and water use of the main crops in this study this model is suitable for use in the study of soil water budget nitrogen budget and weather variables these processes are influenced by plant management practices such as climate soil characteristics crop characteristics and planting season variety selection irrigation nitrogen fertilization soil and irrigation salinity soil treatment and residue management stöckle et al 2003 the development of cropsyst began at the beginning of the 1990s it is based on relevant observations that require plant development models that are not particularly capable of regular crop alternations for their development model developers have collaborated with many researchers to design this fast and low cost computer software for users in scientific projects stöckle et al 2003 cropsyst is a multi year multi crop simulation model developed to study the effect of cropping systems management on productivity and environment stöckle et al 2003 stöckle and nelson 2000 this model has been used to model the growth and development of several crops such as wheat maize barley soybean and sorghum in the western usa southern france northern and southern italy northern syria northern spain and western australia with generally good results stöckle 1996 cropsyst has also been used to assess the effect of climate change on crop yield abraha and savage 2006 díaz ambrona et al 2013 donatelli et al 2015 2003 sommer et al 2013 stöckle et al 2010 tingem et al 2008 tubiello et al 2000 this model was also calibrated and validated for many regions to estimate yield and phonological data abraha 2003 the model comprises several integrated components and different managing opportunities details about parts and usages can be obtained in the model user s manual stöckle and nelson 2000 and elsewhere stöckle et al 1994 3 results and discussion in the first stage of the study agricultural crop pattern of lsp was mapped through object based classification method using landsat and sentinel 2 satellite data between 2010 and 2016 in the crop classification crop phenology was determined by generating minimum maximum and average ndvi normalized difference vegetation index values for each land cover at the monthly period therefore two different periods were defined as winter and summer crop patterns for the study area images recorded in march and april are ideal for mapping winter crop pattern and images of may and august period are suitable for summer crop mapping the dominant agricultural crop pattern for the plain was derived by mapping the last seven years crop pattern in the study area wheat and watermelon are typical winter crops and 1 st and 2nd crop corn cotton soybean and peanut are included as summer crops in the second stage of the study the cropsyst crop simulation model was applied to estimate the spatial and temporal yields of winter wheat corn and cotton using agricultural crop pattern classification performed in the first stage modelling was conducted in four steps database creation model calibration validation and model results calibration and validation procedures were carried out using climate soil crop pattern management and rotation data previously measured during the field surveys performed in the region the cropsyst model was applied using climate data derived from 19 stations together with crop maps including wheat corn and cotton parcels planted on 20 different soil series in the third stage of the study wetlands where agricultural applications directly influence through contaminated drainage water were determined the amount of water from agricultural drainage and the total nitrogen load to wetlands were evaluated management and monitoring of agricultural practices in the region have great importance as the water needs of wetlands are mostly supplied from these streams that come from agricultural drainage and precipitation 3 1 mapping the agricultural land cover in lsp the atmospheric correction was applied to remotely sensed images to remove the atmospheric effects on electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth the dark object subtraction dos method chavez 1988 which is widely used to remove atmospheric distortions was used this method assumes that atmospheric conditions are homogeneous and there are dark objects with shallow reflection values in the image the minimum reflectance value in the image histogram is determined from very dark areas and then applied to all pixels for each band since the minimum reflectance values are different for each band these operations are performed separately each land cover class shows different reflection values at different wavelengths however reflections from some classes are similar in certain growing periods images recorded in march and april were used to classify winter crop pattern may june and july august images were chosen for summer crop patterns to discriminate agricultural classes successfully minimum maximum and average ndvi values for each land cover were produced for 12 different time periods in 2016 based on the samples taken from the field as a result wheat has the highest ndvi value in mid march while watermelon has the highest in the middle of may citrus plantations have similar values throughout the year as it is evergreen however ndvi values for reeds located near the drainage channel were low ndvi values during the winter water surfaces usually have ndvi values below zero but ndvi values ascend during the summer due to the shallow water and plants become visible in the lagoons the average ndvi values range from 0 1 to 0 3 throughout the year for fallow and these values increase from january to march for wheat and decrease until mid may close to harvesting period for watermelon ndvi values are high in the months of april may and june the maize starts to grow in april and reaches in mature stage in june ndvi values of summer crops such as peanuts cotton and soybean increase after june and reach the highest values in july fig 4 image classification is a process where an image is separated into classes or clusters and then defined by revealing the similarities between the pixels using the numerical values on the image townshend 1981 today advanced digital image processing techniques and various methods are used while pixel based classification is a traditional approach the object based classification method is now being used efficiently as geodetic resolutions have improved in recent years in the pixel based classification method each pixel is assigned to a class whereas in object based classification the form of the image is grouped in such a way that it will be meaningful with neighbouring pixels while taking into consideration the reflection properties and textures in this grouping method namely segmentation different weight coefficients can be entered for each band in object based classification the image is transformed into image objects for the size of the objects scale parameter shape and intensity value are entered and image object layers are created since the data are grouped into meaningful polygons in object based classification selected sample areas are homogeneous and the accuracy of the generated classification is higher than that of the pixel based method berberoglu et al 2000 moreover accuracy is further enhanced especially in agricultural areas since it allows manual correction of classification errors agricultural crop pattern was categorized as winter and summer for each year in the whole study area between 2010 and 2016 each agricultural parcel in the study area was classified including winter and summer crop patterns for these periods the wheat plantation area decreased in 2016 by an average of 44 compared to the last six years a decrease of 33 in watermelon and 11 of cotton were estimated there is also an increase of 22 in maize 8 in soya 11 in citrus fruits and 185 in peanut fig 5 crop pattern were mapped to determine dominant agricultural crop patterns from 2010 to 2016 and estimate the yield this enabled modelling the estimated impact loads of pollutants originating from agricultural applications on wetland areas fig 6 object based classification technique with landsat satellite sensor data for the years 2010 2015 and sentinel 2 data for 2016 was used ground truth data together with ndvi and ndmi normalized difference moisture index indices were used as input data to increase classification accuracy ground truth data can also be derived from interpreting high resolution imagery existing classified images or gis data layers the most common way to assess the accuracy of a classified map is to create a set of random points from the ground truth data and compare that to the classified data in a confusion matrix 600 random points were used to derive accuracy figures gps coordinates from agricultural parcels including summer and winter crops were collected to create ground truth data according to accuracy assessment the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy for each class as well as overall kappa index of the agreement were calculated table 1 classification accuracy was evaluated by comparing ground truth with the predicted class results are expressed in an error matrix including the overall and class accuracies table 1 3 2 crop development modeling with cropsyst the cropsyst crop development model was applied to the lower seyhan plain for the modelling of crop development in agricultural crops yield estimation and agricultural pollution for the period of 2010 2016 for the cropsyst model field measurements for the calibration of plant phenology of agricultural crops and management practices were derived from past studies implemented within the research area baydar and kanber 2012 gençel 2009 maya 2007 müjdeci et al 2005 tekin 2011 plant phenological stages for wheat cotton and corn leaf area index lai biomass yield data irrigation and fertilization practices were used in the calibration and validation process of the model parameters used in cropsyst were evaluated for each crop table 2 3 2 1 wheat the data used for the wheat contains 2000 2001 and 2002 data of the field trials performed by müjdeci et al 2005 müjdeci et al 2005 used parcels of 8 m by 8 m and 450 seeds per square meter phenological properties of the wheat crop were calibrated by using the development period dates and total temperature values day degree recorded for 2000 2001 2002 2009 and 2010 during the 1999 2000 winter period simulated lai values were calibrated by the model for wheat and a similar distribution was modelled it was observed that the times of plant development stages such as bolting flowering and physiological maturity were similar to the measurement data the tillering stage was reached 20 days after plantation the bolting stage was reached on day 103 the flowering on day 129 and the physiological maturity stage was reached on day 158 fig 7 calibrated values were modelled during the specified plantation period in the trial in 2000 2001 for wheat and lai distribution was tested according to the model results the emergence stage was reached on day 19 after plantation the flowering stage was reached on day 116 and physiological maturity was reached on day 147 lai values measured between days 120 and 130 were higher than the model estimation owing to the early flowering stage in the model however a two day difference was found in the physiological maturity times as a result there was a 100 kg ha differences between the measurements and the model estimated results in the 2000 2001 winter period these results showed that the calibration of the model for wheat was done precisely when lai and biomass estimation of wheat for the years 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 were assessed similar results with field measurements were obtained with the rapid increase of the biomass amount after the spike stage therefore the calibrated model with lai clearly shows that the parameters for wheat were calibrated for biomass accumulation all measurement and modelled data were compared and the correlation graphs were given by fig 8 3 2 2 cotton the amount of lai and biomass modelled in a full irrigation application was calibrated for the cotton plant lai which increased after crop sprout showed a rapid increase during the formation of the first comb and the first flower but the rate of increase slowed down after the opening of seed capsules the values of lai and biomass increased until the first harvest time showed a minor decrease afterwards and then continued around the same levels until the second harvest since no manual first harvest event was defined for cotton in the model it was determined that 30 of the biomass would be harvested for the first harvest within the model this was the main reason for the decrease in biomass after the first harvest fig 9 lai and biomass data were measured for the cotton from 2005 to 2006 the adjusted r2 or pearson correlation were calculated as 98 6 for lai and 98 1 for biomass fig 10 3 2 3 maize the model was calibrated using management data for maize physiological values were defined according to planting date sprouting eight leaves and top tassel times plant morphology and growth parameters were determined using lai and biomass data the estimations based on the modelled lai values were close to measured values the highest measured lai value was 5 8 on 19 08 2005 the model result was 5 94 on the same date there was a rapid increase in plant biomass after the eight leaf stage for both measured and modelled results fig 11 lai and biomass measurements were implemented for the maize from 2005 to 2006 the adjusted r2 or pearson correlation were 90 0 for lai and 98 3 for biomass fig 12 3 3 modeling crop yield in lsp with cropsyst the cropsyst model was applied to estimate the yield of wheat corn and cotton crops in lsp agricultural crop pattern soil information and climate data recorded between 2010 and 2016 were processed and integrated into agricultural parcels an arccs database was created for each agricultural parcel within a gis environment agricultural crop yields were derived using cropsyst model for 118 348 agricultural parcels as a result of model a consistent increase was observed between 2010 and 2016 despite a decrease in wheat yield in 2013 the highest average yield throughout the plain was estimated as 6206 kg ha in 2016 and the lowest yield was 4751 kg ha in 2010 fig 13 in the study area an average of 36 905 ha of agricultural area was cultivated in seven years and 20 515 78 ton year of wheat were cultivated the annual average wheat yield was estimated as 5514 6 kg ha a significant decline in maize yield was seen in 2012 reached its highest level in 2016 during the last six years the highest average yield of 1 st crop maize and 2nd crop maize throughout the plain was estimated as 10 392 and 9270 kg ha in 2016 respectively and the lowest yield period was in 2012 for 1 st crop maize 5570 kg ha and 2nd crop maize 5571 kg ha fig 14 an average of 6337 9 ha area was cultivated for seven years and 45 297 ton year of second maize was produced the average annual yield of second maize was estimated as 7146 9 kg ha for the last seven years an average of 20 515 8 ha were cultivated and 272 193 ton year of cotton were produced the average annual cotton yield was calculated as 13 267 5 kg ha 3 4 modeling the polluted water from agricultural drainage to the wetlands watershed of each wetland was identified in lsp to take into account the agricultural drainage networks limiting elements such as irrigation and drainage networks and roads were considered during the deliniation of these borders using high resolution imagery cropsyst model results were evaluated based on these watersheds to understand and quantify the impact of agriculture on each wetland as a result the average crop yield was calculated as 161 548 ton year between 2010 and 2016 the yield was ranging from 20 83 kg ha to 10 526 2 kg ha and these agricultural parcels carried in the range of 4 mm to 254 mm drainage water per year to the wetlands 1 7 of total wheat corn and cotton 16 745 4 tons production per year was harvested within the protection zone of wetlands the maximum crop yield was modelled from the akyatan lagoon protection zone number 1 and the lowest yield was from cagirkanli protection zone number 6 amongst the thirteen wetlands shown in fig 1 in terms of mean crop production agyatan and akyatan lagoon zones have the largest while akdam and karayusuflu have the smalest mean production agricultural productivity was higher in these areas due to warmer climatic conditions for crops the maximum production within the thirteen protection zones of wetlands was akyatan lagoon area number 1 and the lowest one was the cagirkanli wetlands number 6 the agricultural drainage coming from cotton and 2nd crop maize was higher than wheat and 1 st crop maize according to the hydrological modelling for these basins this clearly demonstrated that government subsidies for cotton cultivation rather than 1 st crop maize in these locations will result more environmental friendly management practices for wetlands in terms of agricultural drainage water supply especially more crucial for wetlands that have water shortage in summer months the amount of water running into wetlands from agricultural drainage of wetland protection zones was modelled for 2016 11 617 8 m3 of agricultural water came from akyatan lagoon protection zone in 2016 while 183 4 m3 of agricultural water came from tuzla lagoon protection zone the cultivation of cotton and wheat instead of high water consumption crops like maize resulted amount of agricultural drainage to the agyatan lagoon protection zone 0 17 mm modelling results indicated that the largest amount of agricultural drainage water came from cotton whereas the lowest amount came from 1 st crop maize table 3 cotton wheat or wheat and 2nd crop maize cultivation in these zones will enable higher amount of agricultural drainage supply for the sustainability of wetlands ibrikci et al 2015 investigated n inputs and outputs of wheat and maize in lsp through survey studies it was indicated that majority of farmers have used the similar amount of n application the n application for wheat 1 st crop maize 2nd crop maize and cotton were 195 kgn ha 325 kgn ha 325 kgn ha and 232 kgn ha respectively when crop n intake was examined 185 kgn ha for wheat 307 kg n ha for 1 st crop maize and 162 kgn ha for 2nd crop maize was used by plants for photosynthesis and crop growth therefore the amount of applied n remained in soil was 10 kg n ha for wheat 18 kg n ha for 1 st crop maize and 163 kg n ha for 2nd crop maize these values except 2nd crop maize seem to be suitable values for the protection of soil and water resources n applied in agriculture is estimated as the total budget in the soil systems for this study only n as a fertilizer was evaluated within this study the proportion of total n applied in agriculture was 48 9 for 1 st crop maize 31 7 for cotton 18 6 for wheat and 0 8 for 2nd crop maize at the akyatan protection zone number 1 the applied fertilizer efficiency of plants was 95 for wheat and 90 3 for 1 st crop maize however 2nd crop maize taken 49 8 of the applied fertilizer for growth which means50 2 of applied n remained in the soil and discharged to the wetlands thus the use of reduced n fertilizer for 2nd crop maize is highly recommended for these protection zones n application by farmers is generally similar across the lsp due to the homogenious cultural profile of farmers at the region unsufficient number of soil and plant analyses by farmers and uniform subsidy policy for the crop production resulted excessive use of n thus fertilizer application did not vary according to soil properties and years n utilization efficiency is maximized when n fertilizer is used according to plant and soil properties for the lsp alternatively 5 reduction for wheat 10 for 1 st crop maize and 50 for 2nd crop maize will result environmental friendly management practices when the applied fertilizer use is reduced at these rates together with given priority to cotton and 2nd crop maize will improve quality and quantity of drainage water to the wetlands n use efficiency increase will enable protection and sustaining wetland ecosystems which constitute many bird breeding habitats without any income loss of farmers at the wetland protection zones these protection zones are covered with dense reed beds phragmites australis and typha spp which supply excellent habitats for waders and waterfowl this dense vegetation cover forms an ideal habitat for nesting birds yilmaz 1998 therefore these wetlands should be kept away from agricultural pollutants as well as water demand should be met there are many different ecosystem services provided by wetlands that can provide benefit to agriculture and contribute human wellbeing wetlands can support fertile soils reduce erosion and retain sediments and nutrients as well as reduce the potential for salinity and acid sulfate soils support aquaculture or grazing provide habitat for harvestable plant and animal species provide drinking water for stock provide shade wind buffering protection from floods and habitat for birds provide a range of raw products such as timber stock fodder salt peat and firewood act as natural filters in waste water treatment and assist in drought resilience a key challenge for farmers the major outcome of this study was modelling studies can be integrated to the strategic planning of conservation sites at regional and sub catchment scale to achieve more effective management policies by considering and maintaining natural process and income generation of locals additionally crop yield can be assessed on the field based which will support the agricultural management and production strategies more accurately these strategies will be helpful to regulate the type and location of the new establishments and specializations in agricultural production these findings allow the water user associations to make more cost effective and accurate pricing and parcel based monitoring 4 conclusions this study included modeling mapping and analyses of agricultural activities within an intensive agricultural area to keep sustainability of the environment and agricultural activities these conservation and economical issues were considered quantitatively for following objectives management plans that assess and evaluate natural habitats wetland ecosystems and agriculture in a holistic manner use of geodetic models as well as declaration based agricultural data will ensure early and accurate calculation of production reports the identification of habitats consisting of natural and cultural landscapes creates ecological base data for the functional sustainability of protected areas this contributes to the identification and conservation of biological diversity on site determination of conservation areas determination of regional land use capabilities and national needs on the parcel based system in which agricultural incentives are managed regionally rather than basin based and for several years instead of one year may be more productive for production protection use and economic return moreover in yield based systems the damage to agriculture by non agricultural land uses can be more accurately calculated and the long term damage of non agricultural use to the economy and ecosystem can be demonstrated in concrete terms when agricultural areas are considered in the context of ecosystem services the contribution of economic value to the ecosystem can also be calculated accurately when hydrological conditions are neglegted for wetlands the management scheme will be affected negatively therefore the amount of water in wetlands will be decreased seasonally or permanently as a result of this the surface or root zone will begin to dry their ecological character will be definetly altered due to the inappropriate crop cultivation in the wetland protection zone water and soil resources management services need to consider agricultural drainage and irrigation water use together with ecological balance and biodiversity protection in such sensitive zones acknowledgments this work was supported by the scientific projects administrator unit of cukurova university under grant number fdk 2016

25139,an age structured bioeconomic model which is completely continuous in age and time is developed in order to compare with traditional discrete models both types have advantages and disadvantages the continuous framework complements discrete models as it allows for deeper and more transparent analytical study and leads to analytical results that would be difficult to achieve within a discrete framework to make the model realistic a nonlinear recruitment function is introduced and steady state solutions and constant effort optimal fishing are studied analytically in addition the framework has been used for numerical analysis simulations are used to investigate how optimal harvesting patterns vary with parameter values keywords bioeconomic modeling age structured models optimal renewable resource management fisheries economics pulse fishing 1 introduction traditional lumped parameter bioeconomic models may have many advantages especially for educational purposes but may also provide inadequate predictions since they do not take into account how fish fertility mortality catchability and weight depend on the age as a result such models may lead to suboptimal strategies both for sustainable fishery and stock recovery for a more accurate presentation of resource dynamics it is often better to consider age structured population models age structured models have been applied in the literature on fisheries economics for decades and they are more and more replacing aggregated biomass models as a tool for bioeconomic analysis the structure of such models usually follow the leslie matrix leslie 1945 1948 which represents discrete updating of the stock combining the leslie matrix structure with a discrete time version of the baranov equation baranov 1938 we get the classical age structured beverton holt model beverton and holt 1957 when age structured models are applied for actual management of real world fish stocks they are usually in discrete time and this has proved quite useful see tahvonen 2010 and the references therein often such studies focus not on optimal harvesting but on bioeconomic viability de lara et al 2007 gourguet et al 2013 in ecology biology and medicine age structured models that are completely continuous both in state and time are often analyzed usually only for the purpose of studying the population dynamics kapur 1979 li and brauer 2008 ellner 2009 these models usually do not contain harvesting or maximization of net revenue if they contain harvesting it is at most maximization of sustainable yield murphy and smith 1991 in this article we develop a bioeconomic age structured model that is completely continuous both in state and time like the ecological models and which in addition can be used for bioeconomic analysis and optimization including non linearities both in the economic and biological model in the economic model the non linearity consists of a downward sloping demand function and in the biological model we introduce a concave stock recruitment relationship among other things continuous models may complement discrete models as they more easily lend themselves to analytical study of special cases and sometimes even closed form solutions given by an explicit expression it is recognized that it is very difficult to derive analytical results from discrete time age structured bioeconomic models clark 2010 although tahvonen 2009 2010 has found some certainly restricting the number of age classes to a small number as in skonhoft et al 2012 only 3 classes with all fish aged 2 and older assigned to the last class may simplify analysis by focusing on individual cohorts optimization of yield per recruit in an age structured stock can be found clark 2010 chapter 6 this approach avoids partial differential equations a critical assumption is that recruitment is independent of stock size and age distribution and another assumption is that the gear selectivity function has knife edge preciseness or perfect selectivity as in diekert 2012 where agents can choose an arbitrary gear selectivity function and optimize their profits with respect to its shape such assumptions especially constant exogenous recruitment are avoided in the continuous model by introducing partial differential equations on the other hand if there are discontinuities in weight natural mortality etc as functions of age discrete models may be to prefer as they typically do not use continuous functions for these parameters thus in some regards discrete models may be preferable and in other regards the continuous models will have certain advantages besides continuous and discrete models tend to coincide as the number of time periods in the discrete model goes to infinity and the length of the periods approach zero the outline of the article is as follows first we present the basic model with simplified assumptions that yield some analytical solutions then we present the model with various extensions in order to make it more realistic after that results from the numerical analysis are presented and finally some conclusions and policy implications are drawn more specifically in the extended model first a linear and then a nonlinear recruitment function are introduced describing how the number of survived recruits depends on the spawning stock we show analytically that linear models in which recruitment is proportional to spawning stock size do not have nontrivial structurally stable steady states for this reason biological models often take into account overpopulation effects which make them nonlinear our continuous model incorporates a nonlinear recruitment function which is similar to the one in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for a discrete age structured model this nonlinear model can be used to study the long term effect of constant effort and analytically identify the upper critical effort level above which the stock will collapse below this critical level the stock will approach a certain steady state distribution which is given by an explicit expression in the economic submodel non linearities are introduced through a downward sloping demand curve thereby making interior solutions more likely in dynamic optimization models non linearity in the objective function typically implies more complex dynamics than just bang bang see clark 2010 the analysis is also complemented by numerical examples the purpose of this is to investigate how optimal effort and harvesting patterns vary with different assumptions and parameter values the parameters that will be investigated are first and foremost demand and cost parameters such as the slope of the demand curve and the cost per unit effort 2 the basic model in this section we specify the basic bioeconomic model and formulate the optimization problem we will start the analysis within simplified settings and gradually introduce all the details regarding stock dynamics here we concentrate on assumptions and formulations that will allow us to obtain some analytical results thus this section can be regarded as a brief introduction outlining some basic notions later we will introduce and analyze various complications to the model which will make it more realistic 2 1 the formulation of the bioeconomic model let the age structured fish stock be represented by a function u a t where a 0 a is age and a is the maximum age for any time t u a t is the stock density at age a the whole stock measured in number of fish at time t is then given by 1 n t 0 a u a t d a to describe the dynamics of the stock we will assume that its mortality is proportional to u a t the proportionality factor includes natural mortality m and fishing mortality e it can be shown that u a t should satisfy the following dynamics equation 2 u a u t m e u a t which can be obtained formally in many ways see e g ellner 2009 the initial condition is given by 3 u a 0 u o a a 0 and the boundary recruitment condition is 4 u 0 t r t the distribution u 0 a can be interpreted as the age distribution of the initial stock and r t can be interpreted as the recruitment at time t at each time t the harvested biomass rate is given by 5 y t e 0 a u a t d a and the current net revenue is defined as 6 π t p y t c e where p is the fish sale price and c is the cost parameter the harvesting optimization problem consists of finding an optimal rate of fishing effort e that maximizes the discounted net revenue 7 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents the discount rate 2 2 harvesting optimization with constant recruitment here we wish to find an operational expression for stock density the solution to the partial derivatives eq 2 with the initial and boundary conditions 3 and 4 is quite straightforward see section 3 3 1 for more details 8 u a t r t a e m e a for t a 9 u a t u 0 a t e m e t for a t where we assume that r t and u 0 a are given functions if recruitment r is constant then we have the simplest possible case of the maximization problem in this case after t a periods the system settles on a steady state 10 u e a r e m e a yield or catch in this case after the stock has settled is given as 11 y e r 1 e m e a e m e as net revenue is independent of time the fishing mortality that maximizes instantaneous net revenue at the steady state corresponding effort e 12 π e p y r 1 e m e a e m e c y e will also maximize the discounted net present value n p v e 0 e δ t π e d t π e δ for any discount rate 1 1 here we assume that by the moment t 0 the system has already settled at the steady state 10 corresponding to the chosen effort e formally it means that the initial condition 3 coincide with the steady state age distribution i e u e a u 0 a in fact it means that in the case of constant effort steady state harvesting the problem of optimizing nvp originally a dynamic optimization problem reduces to an ordinary static optimization in general if the initial state is different from u e the instantaneous net revenue π would depend on t at least for some period and as a result optimal constant effort e should depend on the initial state u 0 in the special case where maximum age a these expressions become even simpler 13 y e r e m e and 14 π e p y y e c y e 2 2 1 constant price and cost if p and c do not depend on the yield 15 π e p r e m e c e harvesting can be profitable only if p r c m i e price and recruitment are high enough to compensate for cost of harvest and natural mortality otherwise π 0 for any e 0 maximizing this expression for π yields a closed form solution for effort 16 e p c m r m c c assuming that pr mc this is one of the few cases where we can find a closed form solution for optimal fishing mortality or effort and thereby perform some comparative statics in more advanced settings we must resort to numerical sensitivity analysis it is immediately seen from this that optimal effort is increasing in p and r and decreasing in c with respect to m it increases for 0 m pr 4c and decreases for pr 4c m pr c 2 2 2 linear inverse demand function another fairly simple closed form solution for optimality can be found when c 0 and p y p 0 p 1 y that is we have a linear inverse demand function and solve the problem for a sole owner who also is a monopolist we will study both the case of constant price and downward sloping demand evidence for downward sloping demand market power can be found in barten and bettendorf 1989 for various demersal species in grafton et al 2000 for canadian cod and to some extent in hammarlund 2015 for baltic cod asche et al 2004 on the other hand provide evidence for a constant price it is important to keep in mind that we only assume market power at an aggregated national level and not for individual fishing companies after all it is the national level that is important for the managing authorities now π e p y y where y e r e m e is a continuous increasing function for all e 0 with y 0 0 and y r as e since π e p 0 2p 1 y y and y 0 if p 0 2p 1 r the net revenue π e achieves its maximum when yield is y p 0 2 p 1 and the corresponding fishing effort is given by 17 e p 0 m 2 r p 1 p 0 indeed since π e 2 p 1 y 2 p 0 2 p 1 y y and thus π e 2 p 1 y 2 0 the second order condition ensures that it is a maximum if p 0 2p 1 r then p 0 2p 1 y 0 for any e since 0 y r which implies that π e 0 in this case optimal effort is infinite e and y r optimal effort when finite is increasing in m and p 0 and decreasing in r and p 1 the nature of the behavior with regard to r m on one hand and p 0 p 1 on the other hand is different indeed when r or m is varied e must be adjusted accordingly increased or decreased respectively to keep y on the fixed optimal level p 0 2 p 1 however when p 0 or p 1 is varied optimal y is changed increased or decreased respectively and the corresponding e must be adjusted according to that another interesting thing to notice is that in the first expression 16 optimal effort is increasing in r whereas in the second expression 17 optimal effort is actually decreasing in r proposition 1 in an age structured model as described above if maximum age is infinite and recruitment constant then optimal effort is increasing in recruitment when price is constant and cost of effort constant whereas optimal effort is decreasing in recruitment if the price is harvest dependent and effort is costless proof this follows immediately from the expressions for e in 16 and 17 a possible intuition behind this proposition is that higher r implies higher harvest which drives down the price and therefore must be compensated by lower effort in the second case it is actually also possible to find closed form solutions in the case with linear demand and c 0 but these expressions are so messy as they involve solving a third degree equation that they are not shown 2 2 3 linear cost function a similar expression can be found for optimal effort in the social optimum with linear costs c y c 0 c 1 y where we maximize consumers and producers surplus 18 π soc y 0 y p q c q d q in this case optimal harvest is y p 0 c 0 p 1 c 1 and according to eq 13 19 e p 0 c 0 m r p 1 c 1 p 0 c 0 it is seen that the social optimum always implies higher effort and harvest than the sole owner monopolist similar results in a discrete setting using lagrangian approach can be found in skonhoft et al 2012 if maximum age a is finite on the other hand it is no longer straightforward to find explicit closed form solutions to the maximization problem although the optimal fishing mortality is clearly defined by an implicit analytical expression and easy to find numerically by eq 12 3 the extended model in this section we introduce stock recruitment relationship and specify the complete bioeconomic model later we will discuss ingredients of this model in more details and analyze how they make it more realistic 3 1 general formulation of the bioeconomic model and optimization problem in section 2 2 we looked at the simplest case where u 0 t r is just given however recruitment r t is often supposed to stem from a biological reproduction function or so called stock recruitment function suppose that r a 0 represents sexual maturity or more precisely average fertility of individuals at age a then the spawning stock at time t is defined as 20 s t 0 a u a t r a d a t 0 it is assumed that the stock recruitment relationship is given by a non linear function 21 r t σ s t i e the number of survived recruits is a function σ of the spawning stock this serves as boundary condition to reflect effects of overpopulation of recruits we will assume that the function σ x is continuous positive monotonically increasing and concave for all x 0 σ 0 0 σ 0 1 i e for small spawning stock there is no effect of overpopulation of recruits and almost all the recruits survive and σ r max where r max is the upper limit on recruitment an example of such a function is shown in fig 5 later in section 3 2 1 we will see that these assumptions on the stock recruitment function σ can be substantially relaxed to cover a much broader class of functions it may seem natural to start with a model where all recruits survive i e σ x x however although it has interesting analytical properties see appendix b it leads to an unrealistic long term behavior which makes such a model inappropriate for describing long term dynamics and optimization therefore we will focus on the model with non linear stock recruitment function and leave the linear case for the appendix many biological models introduce various forms of nonlinearity to capture overpopulation effects the corresponding nonlinearity is often represented by mortality and possibly fertility rates depending on current population gurtin and maccamy 1974 gurtin and murphy 1981 brokate 1985 anita et al 2009 or on current biomass belyakov and veliov 2014 our model incorporates a nonlinear recruitment function which reflects overpopulation effects on recruitment survival and is similar to the ones in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for discrete age structured models such nonlinearity is simpler to analyze and its parameters easier to extract from experimental studies let us first briefly introduce a general representation of the optimization problem we assume that the density of fish of age a at time t measured in numbers is represented by the function u a t which satisfies the dynamic equation 22 u a u t m a k a e t u a t the renewal relation given by 21 and the initial condition 3 here e t is time dependent fishing effort m a represents age dependent natural mortality k a is gear selectivity let w a 0 be the weight of a fish at age a then the total biomass at time t is 23 b t 0 a u a t w a d a and the harvested biomass rate is given by 24 y t e t 0 a u a t w a k a d a the current net revenue is defined as 25 π t p y t y t c e t where p y is the inverse demand function and c is the cost parameter the harvesting optimization problem consists of finding an optimal rate of fishing effort e t that maximizes the discounted net revenue 26 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents the discount rate notice that the model is autonomous i e parameters of the model functions m k r w and σ do not depend on time however if there are strong seasonal features for example if there is a distinct spawning season continuous model would require non autonomous ingredients which might make it less transparent and more complex for analysis in such cases a discrete model with a year step might have certain advantages 3 2 steady state optimization in this section we analyze the optimization problem for the steady state harvesting under constant fishing effort 3 2 1 complete steady state analysis consider stationary fishing effort e t e const and find a corresponding steady state i e when stock age distribution does not depend on t thus 27 u a t u a and eq 22 transforms into 28 d u d a m a e k a u a a 0 its general solution is 29 u a r e 0 a m a e k a d α can be written in the form 30 u a r e m a e k a r l e a where m a 0 a m α d α and k a 0 a k α d α are the accumulated mortality and selectivity functions respectively and r is an unknown recruitment to be found from the stationarity condition eq 32 here the function 31 l e a e m a e k a represents the survival curve ellner 2009 i e the fraction of all recruits survived from birth at age 0 to age a this function depends on e as a parameter since u 0 r the stock recruitment relation 21 immediately implies that recruitment r should satisfy the stationarity equation 32 r σ γ e r where 33 γ e 0 a e m a e k a r a d a 0 a l e a r a d a so γ e can be interpreted as a regeneration factor which reflects an interplay of mortality effects represented by e and the functions m a and ek a and fertility represented by the function r a it represents integral fertility per each survived recruit in terms of stock s γ e r the stationarity equation 32 can be rewritten as 34 s γ e σ s according to eqs 32 and 34 γ e compensates the loss introduced by the function σ to keep s and r at steady levels note that since σ 0 0 eq 32 always has a trivial solution r 0 which corresponds to the trivial steady state u a t 0 proposition 2 for a fixed e a nontrivial steady state exists and is structurally stable if and only if γ e 1 if γ e 1 there is no nontrivial steady state and the stock would collapse proof see appendix c obviously γ e is monotone decreasing continuous and γ 0 this observation and the above proposition immediately imply corollary if γ 0 1 the stock will collapse for any harvesting level e if γ 0 1 there exists a unique critical harvesting level e 0 such that γ e 0 1 in that case a nontrivial steady age distribution exists if and only if e e 0 harvesting level is below critical it is structurally stable and the steady state age distribution for the constant harvesting e is 35 u e a r e e m a e k a proposition 3 if r t is close enough to r e for t t 0 then r t r e as t which implies that u a t u e a as t this means that the steady state solution u e corresponding to r e is asymptotically stable the convergence has an exponential type e λt and the speed of convergence to the steady state is determined by the parameter λ 0 which is the unique solution of the equation 36 σ γ e r e 0 a e m a e k a r a e λ a d a 1 proof see appendix c in terms of the stock s γ e r the stationarity equation 34 can be rewritten as 37 σ s β e s where β e 1 γ e is the inverse regeneration factor eq 37 suggests simple interpretation and analysis indeed a steady state pair s e r e which corresponds to the harvesting effort e is determined by the intersection of the curve σ s and the straight line β e s see fig 1 equations similar to 37 and corresponding geometric interpretations can often be found in equilibrium analysis see e g skonhoft et al 2012 being an inverse of the regeneration factor γ e the function β e is monotonically increasing in e for sufficiently large e the line β e s becomes too steep which results in a single trivial intersection s e r e 0 the above observation shows that we could consider a much wider class of functions σ providing steady states for the whole interval 0 e e 0 see appendix c for more details the analysis in appendix b shows that the age structured stock model with linear stock recruitment does not have nontrivial steady states and under certain conditions in the long term leads to an unlimited growth of the stock as a result such a model cannot be used for constant effort steady state optimization as in section 3 2 2 for such purposes one should introduce nonlinearity in the dynamics as it is done for example in this section in contrast to a linear model the modified one with a non linear stock recruitment relation provides a steady state stable population in demography for any fixed effort e which makes it adequate for steady state optimization 3 2 2 constant fishing effort optimization the problem of optimizing a harvesting profile e t involves solving a complete initial problem for any given profile e t as we will do in section 3 3 2 however if focus is on the long term effects of fishing with constant effort over time e we will arrive at a much simpler optimization problem this may be relevant for many fisheries because there is a tendency to apply all the capacity that is available and this does not change very fast the question is then what is the optimal capacity suppose that harvesting is performed with the constant fishing effort rate e and u e a is the corresponding stationary age distribution see section 3 2 1 the stationary harvested biomass rate corresponding to the effort rate e is given by the expression 38 y e e 0 a u e a w a k a d a consider the following optimization problem find a stationary effort rate e that maximizes the steady state net revenue rate 39 π e p y e y e c e and thus the corresponding npv π e δ like in section 2 2 2 2 here again a dynamic optimization problem reduces to a non dynamic one the optimal age distribution depends on e and the stock recruitment feedback needs to be considered to find the optimal effort level here p y is the inverse demand function see section 2 2 2 and c is the cost parameter perhaps the main advantage of the steady state case is that for each value of e it can be solved analytically reduces to a simple equation and does not require solving the complete initial problem besides it gives an adequate description of the long term harvesting with constant e the steady state corresponding to the stationary harvesting with the effort rate e is analyzed in section 3 2 1 and can be found from eqs 30 and 32 in fact to find a steady state optimum we use a mixture of analytical and numerical approaches the analytical part implies that finding a steady state age distribution corresponding to effort e reduces to solving a simple equation 32 as a result the optimized function is easily computed and the optimal e level is found via simple one dimensional numerical minimization another approach to age structured stock optimization which focuses on individual cohorts and avoids partial differential equations can be found in clark 2010 chapter 6 however some of the assumptions used there are quite different from ours the most critical one is that recruitment is independent of stock size and age distribution as a result any optimal fishing mortality profile with respect to cohorts would lead to a non optimal recruitment level to be more precise if e is optimal with respect to yield per recruit or discounted net revenue per recruit then a slight decrease in e would almost not change yield per recruit but would lead to an increase in the number of recruits as a result total yield would increase in general it is also possible to use k a as control variable by adjusting mesh sizes in clark 2010 it is assumed that gear selectivity k a is knife edge shaped with an adjustable cut off age and considered a problem of finding an optimal mesh size of a fishing net diekert 2012 also studies optimization with respect to perfectly adjustable gear selectivity function some authors brokate 1985 hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 consider 2 dimensional harvesting control e a t that represents the rate of removal of individuals of age a at time t and thus effectively incorporates perfectly adjustable selectivity allowing fishing effort to depend not just on time but also on age usually allows simplification of the analysis but it might not always be applicable to fishing where selectivity functions are determined by the fishing gear for example hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 apply their results to harvesting of a forest population they even move further and simplify the control problem and analyze a harvesting optimization model that involves the harvesting age a as the only control variable in their settings the optimal management would be cutting all the trees of certain age the resulting population size will be constantly increasing balanced growth in our case k a is assumed to be of a rather general shape determined by the fishing gear and as a result fixed these differences in assumptions lead to quite different problems 3 3 variable fishing effort optimization in this section we analyze the optimization problem under varying fishing effort 3 3 1 initial boundary problem consider the problem with exogenously given boundary condition u 0 t r t which specifies recruitment at any moment t and the condition for the initial stock given by 3 combining it with the stock dynamics equation an initial boundary problem is obtained 40 u t u a z a t u a 0 t 0 here z a t represents the sum of natural and fishing mortality and using the same assumptions as in eq 22 we have 41 z a t m a k a e t this initial boundary problem can be solved via the change of variables technique such change of variables also yields interesting interpretations of the age structured stock dynamics let us transfer from the original independent variables a t to the new ones a s where 42 s t a the new independent variable s identifies the cohort recruited at time s in new terms the initial condition u o a can be interpreted as the stock density at age a for the a cohort i e a cohort that appeared at time a and the boundary condition r s is the recruitment of the s cohort the details about how the solution is derived can be found in appendix a returning to the original a t variables we obtain the solution for any a t 0 43 u a t u o a t exp a t t z α α a t d α a t r t a exp 0 a z α α a t d α a t in these expressions integration is taken along the s cohort line for s t a characteristic line of eq 40 from the initial age a i at which the s cohort line meets the a axis initial condition a i a t s or t axis boundary condition a i 0 to the age a see fig 2 introducing the integration variable τ a α and reversing the order of integration we can rewrite the solution in the following form 44 u a t u o a t exp 0 t z a τ t τ d τ a t r t a exp 0 a z a τ t τ d τ a t when boundary conditions are exogenously given this gives the complete solution if boundary values are not given it does not give the complete solution specifically in what follows we will assume that the boundary value at any time t is expressed through the values of u a t via the stock recruitment relation determined by eqs 20 and 21 3 3 2 optimization problem suppose that harvesting is performed with the fishing effort rate e t for a certain period of time t 0 t the resulting stock dynamics u e a t for the given harvesting profile e is a solution of the initial problem given by 21 22 and 3 at each time t the harvested biomass or supply rate 45 y e t e t 0 a u e a t w a k a d a is proportional to the harvesting effort e at time t and also depends on e t at any preceding moment t t indirectly since u e a t depends on the profile of e t on the interval t 0 t we will assume that the net revenue rate π e t at time t is determined by the following factors costs are proportional to fishing effort i e linear in e but the revenue is proportional to the sold biomass y e t with the price coefficient which by itself may depend on y e t 46 π e t p y e t y e t c e t now consider the following optimization problem find an optimal rate of fishing effort that maximizes the discounted net revenue 47 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents discounting perhaps the most promising analytical approach to analyze such a problem is to transform the pde model to an equivalent volterra integral equation and derive a maximum principle for the optimization problem see e g brokate 1985 or hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 however as it is emphasized in brokate 1985 to compute the optimal effort u from the equations given in the maximum principles is by no means easy neither theoretically nor numerically with time variant effort we have to resort to numerics in order to find optimal paths numerical simulations for this optimization problem are presented in section 4 3 sometimes it might be needed to take into account that the value depends explicitly on age diekert 2012 gourguet et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011a b such features can easily be added to the model by redefining w a in eq 45 to v a w a where v a represents the relative value of kg of fish as a function of age another generalization gourguet et al 2013 takes into account a discard rate d a at age a again this can be introduced by replacing w a with 1 d a w a it means that implicitly such generalizations are already present in the continuous model and including them implicitly would complicate nothing but the notations 4 numerical examples this section presents all the functions and parameters of the model and illustrates results of computer simulations we also perform numerical sensitivity analysis by varying the parameters to see how that affects the optimal paths the units are as follows stock number is measured in million individuals stock and catch biomass are measured in thousand tons weight is measured in kilos price in nok per kilo and costs and pay off in million nok 4 1 numerical specification in order to perform optimization a number of relationships have to be numerically determined and specified in particular information about initial distribution recruitment growth natural mortality and age selectivity the numbers chosen here make the stock resemble the north east arctic cod stock with respect to certain long term average characteristics we think this makes the example more interesting than just making up a hypothetical stock similar parameters have been used in arnason et al 2004 but they have been updated here using data from the norwegian directorate of fisheries annual profitability survey it is however not meant to represent an up to date case study of the nea cod the purpose is rather to illustrate how sensitive optimal policies based on this model are to some main economic parameters namely the slope of the demand curve and the cost parameter as these parameters are varied quite broadly none of the numerical examples are meant to be particularly representative of the cod stock regarding the initial stock distribution this is found as the final distribution after optimal harvesting has been in place for a sufficiently long period first run this is done in order to mimic a sort of equilibrium situation the input in the first run is u 0 a subsequent recruitment is based on eq 20 where r a represents number of recruits per fish over one year individual growth is w a and natural mortality m a we assume that natural mortality decreases with age mainly due to reduced predation pressure and stabilizes at 0 2 age selectivity of the fishing mortality is given by k a the numerical specifications are summarized in the table below function functional form measurement units u 0 a 800 e 2 7 a 1 1 5 ln a 1 number of fish millions age interval year r a 25 e 6 a 1 1 year σ s 20000 1 e s 20000 number of fish millions age interval year w a 90

stylized facts associated with cod and using simple curve fitting they are only meant to illustrate the model and not to represent a serious case study and are used in all runs figs 3 8 illustrate the corresponding functions in addition to this two parameters are varied in order to see how they affect optimal effort and harvest patterns these are related to the economic submodel and are the cost and demand parameters respectively the cost parameter is a constant cost per unit effort and the demand parameter is the slope of a linear demand curve cost parameters applied here are 5000 low cost 10 000 medium cost and 20 000 high cost regarding the demand parameter two linear demand functions are used in addition to constant price the parameters are as follows where p is the demand function and h is harvest constant p y p 10 slight p y 10 1 0 0005 y p varies approx from 9 9 to 10 1 steep p y 11 0 005 y p varies approx from 9 to 11 4 2 steady state optimum first consider results for the steady state optimization problem formulated in section 3 2 2 find a stationary effort rate e that maximizes the steady state net revenue rate π e we study the case where the stock does not collapse without harvesting i e γ 0 0 a e m a r a d a 1 where γ e is defined by 33 as was mentioned in section 3 2 2 u e is determined by eqs 30 and 32 and thus computing π e for each e reduces to the solution of a simple equation 32 figs 9 11 illustrate steady state age distribution net revenue and biomass for various values of e computed using eqs 35 and 32 the parameters of the model are given in section 4 1 4 3 optimal paths now consider results of numerical optimization for the variable fishing problem formulated in section 3 3 2 we have performed over 100 runs of the model under various assumptions based on these we decided to concentrate on variations in cost and demand parameters as indicated in the previous section with other assumptions constant the three values of the cost parameter combined with three values of the demand slope parameter including zero give us nine possible combinations that we analyze in more detail in addition a maximum limit on fishing effort e max 0 5 which represents a limited capacity of the fishing fleet is applied together with a discount rate of 3 percent first we look at the optimal time path for the fishing effort e t given an initial stock profile and the corresponding harvest stock development and pay off as an alternative to this in the next section we also consider the constant effort level that maximizes the steady state pay off as a simplified optimization routine the results are illustrated in the panel in fig 12 going from left to right in the panel shows the effect of increasing the cost parameter going from top to bottom in the panel illustrates the effect of increasing the slope of the demand curve from the upper row of figures it is seen that increasing the cost parameter decreases the amplitude of the pulses the amplitude that is the level of fishing effort is a direct effect of the cost parameter and it is a usual result that higher costs have a conservating effect on the stock higher costs implies a larger stock and at the same time less pressure on the stock in terms of effort the effect of a steeper demand curve is shown when we go from top to bottom in the panel and this is even more interesting it is seen that even a very modest slope namely 0 0005 which causes price variations of around 1 attenuates the pulses and replace them by a cyclical fishing pattern instead of pulse fishing as seen in the middle row of figures again it is seen by going from left to right that an increased cost parameter implies lower amplitude in the bottom row of figures it is seen that increasing the slope of the demand curve further to 0 005 with corresponding price variations around 10 removes both pulses and cycles more or less completely from the optimal pattern this comes out as the most robust and interesting result from this analysis even very modest downward sloping demand curves tend to eliminate pulses and cycles from the optimal fishing pattern in other words constant price seems to be a necessary condition for optimal pulse fishing and although there is an extensive literature on pulse fishing this is an aspect that has been paid very little attention earlier and although the relationship between demand and pulse fishing may not be very surprising with the suggested model we can calculate the exact relationship and the relationship between costs and pulse fishing are not that obvious as the cost function still is linear in e all of the simulations demonstrate reduced harvesting at the beginning that is first a conservation period in order to increase subsequent harvesting there is also a sharp increase in effort in the final periods as there are no benefits from conservation any longer a concise description of the numerical approach used in the simulations can be found in appendix d the numerical simulations of this section suggest that there should be a critical slope value if the slope of the demand function is above this critical value there will be no pulsations in the optimal harvesting perhaps the most promising approach to analyze stability and sensitivity of the constant effort harvesting could be performed in the spirit of belyakov and veliov 2014 by adding a small sinusoidal disturbance to an optimal constant effort the authors show that under certain conditions a periodic fishing effort can be strictly better than any constant one this implies that under optimal fishing strategy the whole bioeconomic system will not converge to a steady state developing such approach might provide an accurate sensitivity analysis with respect to the slope of the demand curve such analysis could pinpoint the bifurcation point i e the critical slope value that separates constant effort and periodic effort optimal fishing patterns it might be interesting to compare our results with the study of brokate 1985 and hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 who consider control u as depending on time and age u u a t in such settings the authors show the possibility of bang bang control which may lead to switching between 0 and the maximum value brokate also considers a case of age indiscriminate harvesting u u t and proves weak bang bang principle for this case which allows singular intervals to occur on which the optimal control is not bang bang these results are obtained for a linear economic model with zero cost in another illustrative problem of birth control with costs also placed on the controls brokate arrives at control switching between 0 and a value which is inversely proportional to the cost parameter the first row of graphs in fig 12 demonstrates similar behavior zero slope of the demand curve leads to the linear economic model introducing nonlinearity to the economic model changes the behavior dramatically by making the control smooth and even completely remove pulsations at a large enough slope of the demand curve 5 policy implications and conclusions pulse fishing as an optimal strategy in age structured models was first discovered by hannesson 1975 such policies are optimal in linear discrete time age structured models of the beverton holt type as long as there is less than perfect selectivity and it seems reasonable to claim that selectivity is less than perfect in virtually all real world fisheries numeric simulations also suggest that at least for small slope in demand function harvesting will tend to diverge from the constant level towards pulsating pattern the analysis by belyakov and veliov 2014 albeit for a slightly different model confirms that possibility on the other hand from a practical point of view pulse fishing would be difficult to implement by any responsible managing authority as it would imply that fishers would be without income for long periods rotating fishing might be an alternative where fishing fleets target one species after the other but this too is improbable from a practical viewpoint these days although it was applied by the japanese and soviet fishing fleets back in the 60s and 70s before extended economic zones it is therefore of some relief to see that the conclusion that pulse fishing is optimal hinges heavily on an assumption about linearity in the economic model as soon as only slightly downward sloping demand is introduced pulse fishing patterns start disappearing as optimal policies the sole owner must not necessarily be a monopolist it is sufficient that she has some degree of market power many times the sole owner also has some degree of market power and then the resulting policies become more realistic namely in the form of more even harvesting patterns by making age structured models more realistic from an economic point of view as well as from a biological point of view we get more even and more realistic optimal management policies highly volatile harvesting patterns may have unfortunate consequences for example around 1990 the cod stock off newfoundland suffered a collapse following decades of quite rugged landings pattern grafton et al 2000 and just recently autumn 2017 the gulf of alaska cod was subject to an 80 decrease in tac on the same background there are lots of other examples of species that have experienced a similar history peruvian anchovy north sea herring to mention a couple applying the suggested model we show that introducing even slightly downward sloping demand or slight increments in the cost parameter attenuate pulse fishing patterns significantly a conjecture could therefore be that if a sufficiently realistic version of this model had been applied to the stocks that have experienced dramatic reductions in tac or collapse such unfortunate events could have been mitigated the reason is that the present model typically advocates quite conservative and stable harvesting profiles over time which also contribute to stabilizing the stock acknowledgements the authors are grateful to rögnvaldur hannesson jose maroto and ola flaaten for valuable comments and suggestions financial support from the norwegian research council through the message project grant no 255530 is gratefully acknowledged appendix a change of variables technique the initial boundary problem can be solved via change of variables technique what is even more important such change of variables has an interesting meaning in the context of age structured stock dynamics let us transfer from the original independent variables a t to the new ones a s where 48 s t a the new independent variable s identifies the cohort of species recruited at time s in new variables 49 v a s u a s a u a t 50 ζ a s z a s a z a t and 51 v a u t u a v t u t now 52 0 a and s in new age cohort variables eqs 40 3 and 4 transform to 53 v a ζ a s v a 0 s a 0 54 v a a u o a a 0 55 v 0 s r s s 0 in new terms the initial condition u o a can be interpreted as the stock density at age a for the a cohort i e a cohort that appeared at time a and the boundary condition r s is the recruitment of the s cohort eq 53 describes dynamics of an s cohort while it is aging notice that this equation does not depend on other cohorts it means that after it s appearance or recruitment at time s this cohort does not experience any influence from other cohorts as a result s can be considered as a parameter in eq 53 and for any fixed s this equation is in fact a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation its general solution can be written in the form 56 v a s c exp a o a ζ α s d α where age a o 0 can be chosen arbitrary for any given cohort s and c is determined from the initial or boundary conditions to find the solution consider the two cases a t and a t a a t in this case s t a 0 i e the corresponding cohort already exists or appears if a t at time 0 taking a o s age of this cohort at time 0 we immediately get 57 v a s c exp s a ζ α s d α the state of this cohort at time 0 is given by the initial condition 54 as v a o a o u o a o which can be written in terms of cohort s a o as v s s u o s thus 58 v s s c exp s s ζ α s d α c which implies that c u o s this gives a solution for a t 59 v a s u o s exp s a ζ α s d α b a t it means that s t a 0 i e the corresponding cohort appears after the initial moment 0 and its recruitment specified by the boundary condition v 0 s r s choosing a o 0 we obtain 60 v a s c exp 0 a ζ α s d α and thus 61 v 0 s c exp 0 0 ζ α s d α c which gives c r s as a result the solution for a t 62 v a s r s exp 0 a ζ α s d α returning to the original a t variables and taking into account that 63 ζ α s z α s α z α α a t z α α a t we obtain from eqs 59 and 62 and the solution for any a t 0 64 u a t u o a t exp a t t z α α a t d α a t r t a exp 0 a z α α a t d α a t in these expressions integration is taken along the s cohort line for s t a characteristic line of eq 40 from the initial age a i at which s cohort line meets a axis initial condition a i a t s or t axis boundary condition a i 0 to the age a see fig 2 appendix b long term stock dynamics with linear stock recruitment in this section we analyze long term behavior of the dynamic equation 40 and linear stock recruitment 65 u 0 t 0 a u a t r a d a t 0 i e σ x x more precisely we focus on age distributions that do not change their shape in time i e 66 u a t v a y t where v a represents the shape and y t is the scale consider the problem where total mortality z is age dependent but not time dependent z a t z a it happens if total mortality is as in 22 but fishing effort e is constant in this case the dynamics equation becomes autonomous 67 u t u a z a u a 0 t 0 substituting 66 into the problem statement 67 and 65 yields 68 v y v y z a v y a 0 t 0 69 v 0 0 a r a v a da separation of variables for eq 68 leads to equations for y t and v a 70 y t μ y t 71 v a z a μ v a where μ is some constant the general solution for 70 is 72 y t c e μ t which means that the constant μ represents growth rate coefficient if it is positive the stock exponentially grows and if μ is negative the stock exponentially decays similarly the general solution for 71 is 73 v a d e 0 a z α μ d α d e 0 a z α d α e μ a d e z a e μ a where z a 0 a z α d α is accumulated total mortality since z α 0 z a is a monotone non decreasing function and z 0 0 if z a z const z a za and 74 v a d e z μ a substituting the general solution 73 for v a into eq 69 yields the following condition for μ 75 0 a e z a e μ a r a d a 1 known as euler lotka equation lotka 1922 1939 ellner 2009 which uniquely determines μ the complete quasi stationary solution is now given by 76 u a t c e z a μ a μ t r t e z a μ a and corresponds to exponentially evolving recruitment r t c e μt if μ 0 the age profile exponentially grows in time conversely if μ 0 the age profile exponentially decays only if μ 0 the age profile remains unchanged stationary in this case c is in fact steady state recruitment r however this steady state u a t ce z a in fact infinitely many steady states since c can be any non negative value is not structurally stable whatever small variations of functions z a and r a would immediately move μ away from 0 and result in a solution which exponentially grows or decays in time let us note that the parameter μ has an interesting interpretation it represents the whole interplay of production and mortality mechanisms presented by fertility r a and mortality z a functions respectively because of their different nature these two mechanisms enter eq 75 in different forms however if we define ρ a ln r a then r a e ρ a and the equation which determines μ becomes 77 0 a e ρ a z a μ a d a 1 although it does not seem possible to solve eq 77 analytically in general for a special case of z a and r a it can be solved specifically suppose that z a m const thus z a ma and r a e ga where g is some constant then eq 77 becomes 78 0 a e g m μ a d a 1 if a this immediately yields explicit solution μ 1 g m so 79 u a t c e 1 g m t e 1 g a age distribution has shape e 1 g a which in time exponentially grows if 1 g m production overweights mortality or decays if 1 g m now consider the problem with stationary natural mortality factor m a with the added fishing mortality caused by constant fishing effort rate e the effective fishing mortality affecting u a t is now f a e k a where k a 0 is a fishing selectivity function then stock dynamics is determined by eq 67 in which z a is replaced with m a ek a thus the quasi stationary solution for constant harvesting effort e is 80 u a t c e m a e k a μ e a t where m a 0 a m α d α and k a 0 a k α d α are the accumulated mortality and selectivity functions respectively and μ e is a unique solution of the equation 81 0 a e m a e k a e μ a r a d a 1 let μ 0 be a unique solution of 81 for e 0 i e corresponds to zero harvesting it can be shown that if μ 0 0 which implies that in the absence of harvesting the stock exponentially grows in t there exists a unique e 0 0 such that μ e 0 0 harvesting at rate e 0 would keep the stock constant in time 82 u 0 a c e m a e 0 k a in other words e 0 is the sustainable level of fishing effort in this case if e e 0 the stock will grow and if e e 0 it will decline here as always before c 0 is an arbitrary constant which is interpreted as the steady state recruitment r the only possible steady state solution corresponding to e e 0 is not unique and structurally unstable in the case of constant uniform selectivity k a k const k a ka and 81 can be rewritten 83 0 a e m a e μ e k a r a d a 1 in this case the relation between e and μ e is quite simple μ e μ 0 ek so e 0 μ 0 k where μ 0 is a unique solution of 83 for e 0 appendix c steady state existence and convergence to a steady state proposition 2 for a fixed e a nontrivial steady state exists and is structurally stable if and only if γ e 1 if γ e 1 there is no nontrivial steady state and the stock would collapse proof consider a function 84 φ r σ γ e r r for r 0 then eq 32 can be written as φ r 0 since σ is continuous concave and σ 0 0 σ 0 1 it implies that φ r is also continuous concave φ 0 0 and φ 0 γ e 1 remark we could consider a much wider class of functions σ providing steady states for the whole interval 0 e e 0 specifically it is sufficient for σ to satisfy the following condition a there exists a constant c 0 0 such that for any c 0 c c 0 there exists a unique x 0 for which σ x cx b if c 0 c this equation holds only at x 0 here c 0 is some fixed positive constant which can be equal to or in other words the graph of σ x has a unique nontrivial intersection with the straight line cx if 0 c c 0 and there is only a trivial intersection if c 0 c for the function σ x introduced in section 3 1 c 0 σ 0 1 such an extended class of functions would include many important variants of stock recruitment relations such as the ricker function σ x x exp r 1 x k which is not everywhere concave with c 0 r the beverton holt stock recruitment relation σ x ax 1 bx with c 0 a the logistic relation σ x ax 1 x b with c 0 a the power function σ x cx α where 0 α 1 with c 0 the constant function σ x r 0 as in section 2 2 with c 0 and many more in the latter example and always when σ 0 0 a nontrivial solution for the equation σ x cx exists for any 0 c which means that c 0 and as a result a nontrivial steady state will exist for any harvesting level e let us note here that the linear stock recruitment function σ x ax does not satisfy the above condition and requires special treatment see appendix b in particular eq 32 transforms into γ e 1 a as a result a nontrivial steady state may exist for at most one level of fishing effort and for such fishing effort there are infinitely many steady states proposition 3 if r t is close enough to r e for t t 0 then r t r e as t which implies that u a t u e a as t this means that the steady state solution u e corresponding to r e is asymptotically stable the convergence has an exponential type e λt and the speed of convergence to the steady state is determined by the parameter λ 0 which is the unique solution of the equation 85 σ γ e r e 0 a e m a e k a r a e λ a d a 1 proof according to eq 44 u a t at any time t can be expressed through the corresponding value of recruitment at time t a on the other hand r t a is expressed through the stock distribution via eq 21 see also fig 2 combining these two equations allows to express

discrete age and time model in all simulations we used a discrete age time analogue of the continuous model with equal steps in age and time such discrete model seems to be the most natural and intuitive specifically suppose that the time and age ranges are discrete and all the discretization steps are equal δa δt δ so the age and time grids are a 0 δ 2δ kδ and t 0 δ 2δ nδ and the complete stock dynamics is represented by a set of values u kn where k 0 1 k and n 0 1 n then all the functions of the model which depend on a i e u 0 a r a w a m a k a are represented by the corresponding discrete functions u k 0 r k w k m k k k and the discrete model is specified by the following ingredients 94 initial condition 94 u k 0 u k 0 k 0 1 k 95 recruitment boundary condition 95 u 0 n 1 σ k 1

quite close to the discrete model used in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for very small steps e z kn δ 1 z kn δ thus 98 u k 1 n 1 u kn 1 z k n δ in the numerical simulations presented in this paper for any given profile e we compute dynamics using the above scheme 94 97 the age time step is 0 5 years so there are 25 age nodes and 101 time nodes thus in the optimization procedure e is treated as a 101 dimentional parameter while checking the algorithm and cross checking numerical and analytical parts we ran the complete numerical model for the constant optimal effort rate which was determined analytically as in section 4 2 the simulations showed that the stock level and age distribution approach the ones predicted analytically even in the cases when the initial distribution was far away from the steady state one 
25139,an age structured bioeconomic model which is completely continuous in age and time is developed in order to compare with traditional discrete models both types have advantages and disadvantages the continuous framework complements discrete models as it allows for deeper and more transparent analytical study and leads to analytical results that would be difficult to achieve within a discrete framework to make the model realistic a nonlinear recruitment function is introduced and steady state solutions and constant effort optimal fishing are studied analytically in addition the framework has been used for numerical analysis simulations are used to investigate how optimal harvesting patterns vary with parameter values keywords bioeconomic modeling age structured models optimal renewable resource management fisheries economics pulse fishing 1 introduction traditional lumped parameter bioeconomic models may have many advantages especially for educational purposes but may also provide inadequate predictions since they do not take into account how fish fertility mortality catchability and weight depend on the age as a result such models may lead to suboptimal strategies both for sustainable fishery and stock recovery for a more accurate presentation of resource dynamics it is often better to consider age structured population models age structured models have been applied in the literature on fisheries economics for decades and they are more and more replacing aggregated biomass models as a tool for bioeconomic analysis the structure of such models usually follow the leslie matrix leslie 1945 1948 which represents discrete updating of the stock combining the leslie matrix structure with a discrete time version of the baranov equation baranov 1938 we get the classical age structured beverton holt model beverton and holt 1957 when age structured models are applied for actual management of real world fish stocks they are usually in discrete time and this has proved quite useful see tahvonen 2010 and the references therein often such studies focus not on optimal harvesting but on bioeconomic viability de lara et al 2007 gourguet et al 2013 in ecology biology and medicine age structured models that are completely continuous both in state and time are often analyzed usually only for the purpose of studying the population dynamics kapur 1979 li and brauer 2008 ellner 2009 these models usually do not contain harvesting or maximization of net revenue if they contain harvesting it is at most maximization of sustainable yield murphy and smith 1991 in this article we develop a bioeconomic age structured model that is completely continuous both in state and time like the ecological models and which in addition can be used for bioeconomic analysis and optimization including non linearities both in the economic and biological model in the economic model the non linearity consists of a downward sloping demand function and in the biological model we introduce a concave stock recruitment relationship among other things continuous models may complement discrete models as they more easily lend themselves to analytical study of special cases and sometimes even closed form solutions given by an explicit expression it is recognized that it is very difficult to derive analytical results from discrete time age structured bioeconomic models clark 2010 although tahvonen 2009 2010 has found some certainly restricting the number of age classes to a small number as in skonhoft et al 2012 only 3 classes with all fish aged 2 and older assigned to the last class may simplify analysis by focusing on individual cohorts optimization of yield per recruit in an age structured stock can be found clark 2010 chapter 6 this approach avoids partial differential equations a critical assumption is that recruitment is independent of stock size and age distribution and another assumption is that the gear selectivity function has knife edge preciseness or perfect selectivity as in diekert 2012 where agents can choose an arbitrary gear selectivity function and optimize their profits with respect to its shape such assumptions especially constant exogenous recruitment are avoided in the continuous model by introducing partial differential equations on the other hand if there are discontinuities in weight natural mortality etc as functions of age discrete models may be to prefer as they typically do not use continuous functions for these parameters thus in some regards discrete models may be preferable and in other regards the continuous models will have certain advantages besides continuous and discrete models tend to coincide as the number of time periods in the discrete model goes to infinity and the length of the periods approach zero the outline of the article is as follows first we present the basic model with simplified assumptions that yield some analytical solutions then we present the model with various extensions in order to make it more realistic after that results from the numerical analysis are presented and finally some conclusions and policy implications are drawn more specifically in the extended model first a linear and then a nonlinear recruitment function are introduced describing how the number of survived recruits depends on the spawning stock we show analytically that linear models in which recruitment is proportional to spawning stock size do not have nontrivial structurally stable steady states for this reason biological models often take into account overpopulation effects which make them nonlinear our continuous model incorporates a nonlinear recruitment function which is similar to the one in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for a discrete age structured model this nonlinear model can be used to study the long term effect of constant effort and analytically identify the upper critical effort level above which the stock will collapse below this critical level the stock will approach a certain steady state distribution which is given by an explicit expression in the economic submodel non linearities are introduced through a downward sloping demand curve thereby making interior solutions more likely in dynamic optimization models non linearity in the objective function typically implies more complex dynamics than just bang bang see clark 2010 the analysis is also complemented by numerical examples the purpose of this is to investigate how optimal effort and harvesting patterns vary with different assumptions and parameter values the parameters that will be investigated are first and foremost demand and cost parameters such as the slope of the demand curve and the cost per unit effort 2 the basic model in this section we specify the basic bioeconomic model and formulate the optimization problem we will start the analysis within simplified settings and gradually introduce all the details regarding stock dynamics here we concentrate on assumptions and formulations that will allow us to obtain some analytical results thus this section can be regarded as a brief introduction outlining some basic notions later we will introduce and analyze various complications to the model which will make it more realistic 2 1 the formulation of the bioeconomic model let the age structured fish stock be represented by a function u a t where a 0 a is age and a is the maximum age for any time t u a t is the stock density at age a the whole stock measured in number of fish at time t is then given by 1 n t 0 a u a t d a to describe the dynamics of the stock we will assume that its mortality is proportional to u a t the proportionality factor includes natural mortality m and fishing mortality e it can be shown that u a t should satisfy the following dynamics equation 2 u a u t m e u a t which can be obtained formally in many ways see e g ellner 2009 the initial condition is given by 3 u a 0 u o a a 0 and the boundary recruitment condition is 4 u 0 t r t the distribution u 0 a can be interpreted as the age distribution of the initial stock and r t can be interpreted as the recruitment at time t at each time t the harvested biomass rate is given by 5 y t e 0 a u a t d a and the current net revenue is defined as 6 π t p y t c e where p is the fish sale price and c is the cost parameter the harvesting optimization problem consists of finding an optimal rate of fishing effort e that maximizes the discounted net revenue 7 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents the discount rate 2 2 harvesting optimization with constant recruitment here we wish to find an operational expression for stock density the solution to the partial derivatives eq 2 with the initial and boundary conditions 3 and 4 is quite straightforward see section 3 3 1 for more details 8 u a t r t a e m e a for t a 9 u a t u 0 a t e m e t for a t where we assume that r t and u 0 a are given functions if recruitment r is constant then we have the simplest possible case of the maximization problem in this case after t a periods the system settles on a steady state 10 u e a r e m e a yield or catch in this case after the stock has settled is given as 11 y e r 1 e m e a e m e as net revenue is independent of time the fishing mortality that maximizes instantaneous net revenue at the steady state corresponding effort e 12 π e p y r 1 e m e a e m e c y e will also maximize the discounted net present value n p v e 0 e δ t π e d t π e δ for any discount rate 1 1 here we assume that by the moment t 0 the system has already settled at the steady state 10 corresponding to the chosen effort e formally it means that the initial condition 3 coincide with the steady state age distribution i e u e a u 0 a in fact it means that in the case of constant effort steady state harvesting the problem of optimizing nvp originally a dynamic optimization problem reduces to an ordinary static optimization in general if the initial state is different from u e the instantaneous net revenue π would depend on t at least for some period and as a result optimal constant effort e should depend on the initial state u 0 in the special case where maximum age a these expressions become even simpler 13 y e r e m e and 14 π e p y y e c y e 2 2 1 constant price and cost if p and c do not depend on the yield 15 π e p r e m e c e harvesting can be profitable only if p r c m i e price and recruitment are high enough to compensate for cost of harvest and natural mortality otherwise π 0 for any e 0 maximizing this expression for π yields a closed form solution for effort 16 e p c m r m c c assuming that pr mc this is one of the few cases where we can find a closed form solution for optimal fishing mortality or effort and thereby perform some comparative statics in more advanced settings we must resort to numerical sensitivity analysis it is immediately seen from this that optimal effort is increasing in p and r and decreasing in c with respect to m it increases for 0 m pr 4c and decreases for pr 4c m pr c 2 2 2 linear inverse demand function another fairly simple closed form solution for optimality can be found when c 0 and p y p 0 p 1 y that is we have a linear inverse demand function and solve the problem for a sole owner who also is a monopolist we will study both the case of constant price and downward sloping demand evidence for downward sloping demand market power can be found in barten and bettendorf 1989 for various demersal species in grafton et al 2000 for canadian cod and to some extent in hammarlund 2015 for baltic cod asche et al 2004 on the other hand provide evidence for a constant price it is important to keep in mind that we only assume market power at an aggregated national level and not for individual fishing companies after all it is the national level that is important for the managing authorities now π e p y y where y e r e m e is a continuous increasing function for all e 0 with y 0 0 and y r as e since π e p 0 2p 1 y y and y 0 if p 0 2p 1 r the net revenue π e achieves its maximum when yield is y p 0 2 p 1 and the corresponding fishing effort is given by 17 e p 0 m 2 r p 1 p 0 indeed since π e 2 p 1 y 2 p 0 2 p 1 y y and thus π e 2 p 1 y 2 0 the second order condition ensures that it is a maximum if p 0 2p 1 r then p 0 2p 1 y 0 for any e since 0 y r which implies that π e 0 in this case optimal effort is infinite e and y r optimal effort when finite is increasing in m and p 0 and decreasing in r and p 1 the nature of the behavior with regard to r m on one hand and p 0 p 1 on the other hand is different indeed when r or m is varied e must be adjusted accordingly increased or decreased respectively to keep y on the fixed optimal level p 0 2 p 1 however when p 0 or p 1 is varied optimal y is changed increased or decreased respectively and the corresponding e must be adjusted according to that another interesting thing to notice is that in the first expression 16 optimal effort is increasing in r whereas in the second expression 17 optimal effort is actually decreasing in r proposition 1 in an age structured model as described above if maximum age is infinite and recruitment constant then optimal effort is increasing in recruitment when price is constant and cost of effort constant whereas optimal effort is decreasing in recruitment if the price is harvest dependent and effort is costless proof this follows immediately from the expressions for e in 16 and 17 a possible intuition behind this proposition is that higher r implies higher harvest which drives down the price and therefore must be compensated by lower effort in the second case it is actually also possible to find closed form solutions in the case with linear demand and c 0 but these expressions are so messy as they involve solving a third degree equation that they are not shown 2 2 3 linear cost function a similar expression can be found for optimal effort in the social optimum with linear costs c y c 0 c 1 y where we maximize consumers and producers surplus 18 π soc y 0 y p q c q d q in this case optimal harvest is y p 0 c 0 p 1 c 1 and according to eq 13 19 e p 0 c 0 m r p 1 c 1 p 0 c 0 it is seen that the social optimum always implies higher effort and harvest than the sole owner monopolist similar results in a discrete setting using lagrangian approach can be found in skonhoft et al 2012 if maximum age a is finite on the other hand it is no longer straightforward to find explicit closed form solutions to the maximization problem although the optimal fishing mortality is clearly defined by an implicit analytical expression and easy to find numerically by eq 12 3 the extended model in this section we introduce stock recruitment relationship and specify the complete bioeconomic model later we will discuss ingredients of this model in more details and analyze how they make it more realistic 3 1 general formulation of the bioeconomic model and optimization problem in section 2 2 we looked at the simplest case where u 0 t r is just given however recruitment r t is often supposed to stem from a biological reproduction function or so called stock recruitment function suppose that r a 0 represents sexual maturity or more precisely average fertility of individuals at age a then the spawning stock at time t is defined as 20 s t 0 a u a t r a d a t 0 it is assumed that the stock recruitment relationship is given by a non linear function 21 r t σ s t i e the number of survived recruits is a function σ of the spawning stock this serves as boundary condition to reflect effects of overpopulation of recruits we will assume that the function σ x is continuous positive monotonically increasing and concave for all x 0 σ 0 0 σ 0 1 i e for small spawning stock there is no effect of overpopulation of recruits and almost all the recruits survive and σ r max where r max is the upper limit on recruitment an example of such a function is shown in fig 5 later in section 3 2 1 we will see that these assumptions on the stock recruitment function σ can be substantially relaxed to cover a much broader class of functions it may seem natural to start with a model where all recruits survive i e σ x x however although it has interesting analytical properties see appendix b it leads to an unrealistic long term behavior which makes such a model inappropriate for describing long term dynamics and optimization therefore we will focus on the model with non linear stock recruitment function and leave the linear case for the appendix many biological models introduce various forms of nonlinearity to capture overpopulation effects the corresponding nonlinearity is often represented by mortality and possibly fertility rates depending on current population gurtin and maccamy 1974 gurtin and murphy 1981 brokate 1985 anita et al 2009 or on current biomass belyakov and veliov 2014 our model incorporates a nonlinear recruitment function which reflects overpopulation effects on recruitment survival and is similar to the ones in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for discrete age structured models such nonlinearity is simpler to analyze and its parameters easier to extract from experimental studies let us first briefly introduce a general representation of the optimization problem we assume that the density of fish of age a at time t measured in numbers is represented by the function u a t which satisfies the dynamic equation 22 u a u t m a k a e t u a t the renewal relation given by 21 and the initial condition 3 here e t is time dependent fishing effort m a represents age dependent natural mortality k a is gear selectivity let w a 0 be the weight of a fish at age a then the total biomass at time t is 23 b t 0 a u a t w a d a and the harvested biomass rate is given by 24 y t e t 0 a u a t w a k a d a the current net revenue is defined as 25 π t p y t y t c e t where p y is the inverse demand function and c is the cost parameter the harvesting optimization problem consists of finding an optimal rate of fishing effort e t that maximizes the discounted net revenue 26 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents the discount rate notice that the model is autonomous i e parameters of the model functions m k r w and σ do not depend on time however if there are strong seasonal features for example if there is a distinct spawning season continuous model would require non autonomous ingredients which might make it less transparent and more complex for analysis in such cases a discrete model with a year step might have certain advantages 3 2 steady state optimization in this section we analyze the optimization problem for the steady state harvesting under constant fishing effort 3 2 1 complete steady state analysis consider stationary fishing effort e t e const and find a corresponding steady state i e when stock age distribution does not depend on t thus 27 u a t u a and eq 22 transforms into 28 d u d a m a e k a u a a 0 its general solution is 29 u a r e 0 a m a e k a d α can be written in the form 30 u a r e m a e k a r l e a where m a 0 a m α d α and k a 0 a k α d α are the accumulated mortality and selectivity functions respectively and r is an unknown recruitment to be found from the stationarity condition eq 32 here the function 31 l e a e m a e k a represents the survival curve ellner 2009 i e the fraction of all recruits survived from birth at age 0 to age a this function depends on e as a parameter since u 0 r the stock recruitment relation 21 immediately implies that recruitment r should satisfy the stationarity equation 32 r σ γ e r where 33 γ e 0 a e m a e k a r a d a 0 a l e a r a d a so γ e can be interpreted as a regeneration factor which reflects an interplay of mortality effects represented by e and the functions m a and ek a and fertility represented by the function r a it represents integral fertility per each survived recruit in terms of stock s γ e r the stationarity equation 32 can be rewritten as 34 s γ e σ s according to eqs 32 and 34 γ e compensates the loss introduced by the function σ to keep s and r at steady levels note that since σ 0 0 eq 32 always has a trivial solution r 0 which corresponds to the trivial steady state u a t 0 proposition 2 for a fixed e a nontrivial steady state exists and is structurally stable if and only if γ e 1 if γ e 1 there is no nontrivial steady state and the stock would collapse proof see appendix c obviously γ e is monotone decreasing continuous and γ 0 this observation and the above proposition immediately imply corollary if γ 0 1 the stock will collapse for any harvesting level e if γ 0 1 there exists a unique critical harvesting level e 0 such that γ e 0 1 in that case a nontrivial steady age distribution exists if and only if e e 0 harvesting level is below critical it is structurally stable and the steady state age distribution for the constant harvesting e is 35 u e a r e e m a e k a proposition 3 if r t is close enough to r e for t t 0 then r t r e as t which implies that u a t u e a as t this means that the steady state solution u e corresponding to r e is asymptotically stable the convergence has an exponential type e λt and the speed of convergence to the steady state is determined by the parameter λ 0 which is the unique solution of the equation 36 σ γ e r e 0 a e m a e k a r a e λ a d a 1 proof see appendix c in terms of the stock s γ e r the stationarity equation 34 can be rewritten as 37 σ s β e s where β e 1 γ e is the inverse regeneration factor eq 37 suggests simple interpretation and analysis indeed a steady state pair s e r e which corresponds to the harvesting effort e is determined by the intersection of the curve σ s and the straight line β e s see fig 1 equations similar to 37 and corresponding geometric interpretations can often be found in equilibrium analysis see e g skonhoft et al 2012 being an inverse of the regeneration factor γ e the function β e is monotonically increasing in e for sufficiently large e the line β e s becomes too steep which results in a single trivial intersection s e r e 0 the above observation shows that we could consider a much wider class of functions σ providing steady states for the whole interval 0 e e 0 see appendix c for more details the analysis in appendix b shows that the age structured stock model with linear stock recruitment does not have nontrivial steady states and under certain conditions in the long term leads to an unlimited growth of the stock as a result such a model cannot be used for constant effort steady state optimization as in section 3 2 2 for such purposes one should introduce nonlinearity in the dynamics as it is done for example in this section in contrast to a linear model the modified one with a non linear stock recruitment relation provides a steady state stable population in demography for any fixed effort e which makes it adequate for steady state optimization 3 2 2 constant fishing effort optimization the problem of optimizing a harvesting profile e t involves solving a complete initial problem for any given profile e t as we will do in section 3 3 2 however if focus is on the long term effects of fishing with constant effort over time e we will arrive at a much simpler optimization problem this may be relevant for many fisheries because there is a tendency to apply all the capacity that is available and this does not change very fast the question is then what is the optimal capacity suppose that harvesting is performed with the constant fishing effort rate e and u e a is the corresponding stationary age distribution see section 3 2 1 the stationary harvested biomass rate corresponding to the effort rate e is given by the expression 38 y e e 0 a u e a w a k a d a consider the following optimization problem find a stationary effort rate e that maximizes the steady state net revenue rate 39 π e p y e y e c e and thus the corresponding npv π e δ like in section 2 2 2 2 here again a dynamic optimization problem reduces to a non dynamic one the optimal age distribution depends on e and the stock recruitment feedback needs to be considered to find the optimal effort level here p y is the inverse demand function see section 2 2 2 and c is the cost parameter perhaps the main advantage of the steady state case is that for each value of e it can be solved analytically reduces to a simple equation and does not require solving the complete initial problem besides it gives an adequate description of the long term harvesting with constant e the steady state corresponding to the stationary harvesting with the effort rate e is analyzed in section 3 2 1 and can be found from eqs 30 and 32 in fact to find a steady state optimum we use a mixture of analytical and numerical approaches the analytical part implies that finding a steady state age distribution corresponding to effort e reduces to solving a simple equation 32 as a result the optimized function is easily computed and the optimal e level is found via simple one dimensional numerical minimization another approach to age structured stock optimization which focuses on individual cohorts and avoids partial differential equations can be found in clark 2010 chapter 6 however some of the assumptions used there are quite different from ours the most critical one is that recruitment is independent of stock size and age distribution as a result any optimal fishing mortality profile with respect to cohorts would lead to a non optimal recruitment level to be more precise if e is optimal with respect to yield per recruit or discounted net revenue per recruit then a slight decrease in e would almost not change yield per recruit but would lead to an increase in the number of recruits as a result total yield would increase in general it is also possible to use k a as control variable by adjusting mesh sizes in clark 2010 it is assumed that gear selectivity k a is knife edge shaped with an adjustable cut off age and considered a problem of finding an optimal mesh size of a fishing net diekert 2012 also studies optimization with respect to perfectly adjustable gear selectivity function some authors brokate 1985 hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 consider 2 dimensional harvesting control e a t that represents the rate of removal of individuals of age a at time t and thus effectively incorporates perfectly adjustable selectivity allowing fishing effort to depend not just on time but also on age usually allows simplification of the analysis but it might not always be applicable to fishing where selectivity functions are determined by the fishing gear for example hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 apply their results to harvesting of a forest population they even move further and simplify the control problem and analyze a harvesting optimization model that involves the harvesting age a as the only control variable in their settings the optimal management would be cutting all the trees of certain age the resulting population size will be constantly increasing balanced growth in our case k a is assumed to be of a rather general shape determined by the fishing gear and as a result fixed these differences in assumptions lead to quite different problems 3 3 variable fishing effort optimization in this section we analyze the optimization problem under varying fishing effort 3 3 1 initial boundary problem consider the problem with exogenously given boundary condition u 0 t r t which specifies recruitment at any moment t and the condition for the initial stock given by 3 combining it with the stock dynamics equation an initial boundary problem is obtained 40 u t u a z a t u a 0 t 0 here z a t represents the sum of natural and fishing mortality and using the same assumptions as in eq 22 we have 41 z a t m a k a e t this initial boundary problem can be solved via the change of variables technique such change of variables also yields interesting interpretations of the age structured stock dynamics let us transfer from the original independent variables a t to the new ones a s where 42 s t a the new independent variable s identifies the cohort recruited at time s in new terms the initial condition u o a can be interpreted as the stock density at age a for the a cohort i e a cohort that appeared at time a and the boundary condition r s is the recruitment of the s cohort the details about how the solution is derived can be found in appendix a returning to the original a t variables we obtain the solution for any a t 0 43 u a t u o a t exp a t t z α α a t d α a t r t a exp 0 a z α α a t d α a t in these expressions integration is taken along the s cohort line for s t a characteristic line of eq 40 from the initial age a i at which the s cohort line meets the a axis initial condition a i a t s or t axis boundary condition a i 0 to the age a see fig 2 introducing the integration variable τ a α and reversing the order of integration we can rewrite the solution in the following form 44 u a t u o a t exp 0 t z a τ t τ d τ a t r t a exp 0 a z a τ t τ d τ a t when boundary conditions are exogenously given this gives the complete solution if boundary values are not given it does not give the complete solution specifically in what follows we will assume that the boundary value at any time t is expressed through the values of u a t via the stock recruitment relation determined by eqs 20 and 21 3 3 2 optimization problem suppose that harvesting is performed with the fishing effort rate e t for a certain period of time t 0 t the resulting stock dynamics u e a t for the given harvesting profile e is a solution of the initial problem given by 21 22 and 3 at each time t the harvested biomass or supply rate 45 y e t e t 0 a u e a t w a k a d a is proportional to the harvesting effort e at time t and also depends on e t at any preceding moment t t indirectly since u e a t depends on the profile of e t on the interval t 0 t we will assume that the net revenue rate π e t at time t is determined by the following factors costs are proportional to fishing effort i e linear in e but the revenue is proportional to the sold biomass y e t with the price coefficient which by itself may depend on y e t 46 π e t p y e t y e t c e t now consider the following optimization problem find an optimal rate of fishing effort that maximizes the discounted net revenue 47 w 0 t e δ t π t d t max e where δ represents discounting perhaps the most promising analytical approach to analyze such a problem is to transform the pde model to an equivalent volterra integral equation and derive a maximum principle for the optimization problem see e g brokate 1985 or hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 however as it is emphasized in brokate 1985 to compute the optimal effort u from the equations given in the maximum principles is by no means easy neither theoretically nor numerically with time variant effort we have to resort to numerics in order to find optimal paths numerical simulations for this optimization problem are presented in section 4 3 sometimes it might be needed to take into account that the value depends explicitly on age diekert 2012 gourguet et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011a b such features can easily be added to the model by redefining w a in eq 45 to v a w a where v a represents the relative value of kg of fish as a function of age another generalization gourguet et al 2013 takes into account a discard rate d a at age a again this can be introduced by replacing w a with 1 d a w a it means that implicitly such generalizations are already present in the continuous model and including them implicitly would complicate nothing but the notations 4 numerical examples this section presents all the functions and parameters of the model and illustrates results of computer simulations we also perform numerical sensitivity analysis by varying the parameters to see how that affects the optimal paths the units are as follows stock number is measured in million individuals stock and catch biomass are measured in thousand tons weight is measured in kilos price in nok per kilo and costs and pay off in million nok 4 1 numerical specification in order to perform optimization a number of relationships have to be numerically determined and specified in particular information about initial distribution recruitment growth natural mortality and age selectivity the numbers chosen here make the stock resemble the north east arctic cod stock with respect to certain long term average characteristics we think this makes the example more interesting than just making up a hypothetical stock similar parameters have been used in arnason et al 2004 but they have been updated here using data from the norwegian directorate of fisheries annual profitability survey it is however not meant to represent an up to date case study of the nea cod the purpose is rather to illustrate how sensitive optimal policies based on this model are to some main economic parameters namely the slope of the demand curve and the cost parameter as these parameters are varied quite broadly none of the numerical examples are meant to be particularly representative of the cod stock regarding the initial stock distribution this is found as the final distribution after optimal harvesting has been in place for a sufficiently long period first run this is done in order to mimic a sort of equilibrium situation the input in the first run is u 0 a subsequent recruitment is based on eq 20 where r a represents number of recruits per fish over one year individual growth is w a and natural mortality m a we assume that natural mortality decreases with age mainly due to reduced predation pressure and stabilizes at 0 2 age selectivity of the fishing mortality is given by k a the numerical specifications are summarized in the table below function functional form measurement units u 0 a 800 e 2 7 a 1 1 5 ln a 1 number of fish millions age interval year r a 25 e 6 a 1 1 year σ s 20000 1 e s 20000 number of fish millions age interval year w a 90

stylized facts associated with cod and using simple curve fitting they are only meant to illustrate the model and not to represent a serious case study and are used in all runs figs 3 8 illustrate the corresponding functions in addition to this two parameters are varied in order to see how they affect optimal effort and harvest patterns these are related to the economic submodel and are the cost and demand parameters respectively the cost parameter is a constant cost per unit effort and the demand parameter is the slope of a linear demand curve cost parameters applied here are 5000 low cost 10 000 medium cost and 20 000 high cost regarding the demand parameter two linear demand functions are used in addition to constant price the parameters are as follows where p is the demand function and h is harvest constant p y p 10 slight p y 10 1 0 0005 y p varies approx from 9 9 to 10 1 steep p y 11 0 005 y p varies approx from 9 to 11 4 2 steady state optimum first consider results for the steady state optimization problem formulated in section 3 2 2 find a stationary effort rate e that maximizes the steady state net revenue rate π e we study the case where the stock does not collapse without harvesting i e γ 0 0 a e m a r a d a 1 where γ e is defined by 33 as was mentioned in section 3 2 2 u e is determined by eqs 30 and 32 and thus computing π e for each e reduces to the solution of a simple equation 32 figs 9 11 illustrate steady state age distribution net revenue and biomass for various values of e computed using eqs 35 and 32 the parameters of the model are given in section 4 1 4 3 optimal paths now consider results of numerical optimization for the variable fishing problem formulated in section 3 3 2 we have performed over 100 runs of the model under various assumptions based on these we decided to concentrate on variations in cost and demand parameters as indicated in the previous section with other assumptions constant the three values of the cost parameter combined with three values of the demand slope parameter including zero give us nine possible combinations that we analyze in more detail in addition a maximum limit on fishing effort e max 0 5 which represents a limited capacity of the fishing fleet is applied together with a discount rate of 3 percent first we look at the optimal time path for the fishing effort e t given an initial stock profile and the corresponding harvest stock development and pay off as an alternative to this in the next section we also consider the constant effort level that maximizes the steady state pay off as a simplified optimization routine the results are illustrated in the panel in fig 12 going from left to right in the panel shows the effect of increasing the cost parameter going from top to bottom in the panel illustrates the effect of increasing the slope of the demand curve from the upper row of figures it is seen that increasing the cost parameter decreases the amplitude of the pulses the amplitude that is the level of fishing effort is a direct effect of the cost parameter and it is a usual result that higher costs have a conservating effect on the stock higher costs implies a larger stock and at the same time less pressure on the stock in terms of effort the effect of a steeper demand curve is shown when we go from top to bottom in the panel and this is even more interesting it is seen that even a very modest slope namely 0 0005 which causes price variations of around 1 attenuates the pulses and replace them by a cyclical fishing pattern instead of pulse fishing as seen in the middle row of figures again it is seen by going from left to right that an increased cost parameter implies lower amplitude in the bottom row of figures it is seen that increasing the slope of the demand curve further to 0 005 with corresponding price variations around 10 removes both pulses and cycles more or less completely from the optimal pattern this comes out as the most robust and interesting result from this analysis even very modest downward sloping demand curves tend to eliminate pulses and cycles from the optimal fishing pattern in other words constant price seems to be a necessary condition for optimal pulse fishing and although there is an extensive literature on pulse fishing this is an aspect that has been paid very little attention earlier and although the relationship between demand and pulse fishing may not be very surprising with the suggested model we can calculate the exact relationship and the relationship between costs and pulse fishing are not that obvious as the cost function still is linear in e all of the simulations demonstrate reduced harvesting at the beginning that is first a conservation period in order to increase subsequent harvesting there is also a sharp increase in effort in the final periods as there are no benefits from conservation any longer a concise description of the numerical approach used in the simulations can be found in appendix d the numerical simulations of this section suggest that there should be a critical slope value if the slope of the demand function is above this critical value there will be no pulsations in the optimal harvesting perhaps the most promising approach to analyze stability and sensitivity of the constant effort harvesting could be performed in the spirit of belyakov and veliov 2014 by adding a small sinusoidal disturbance to an optimal constant effort the authors show that under certain conditions a periodic fishing effort can be strictly better than any constant one this implies that under optimal fishing strategy the whole bioeconomic system will not converge to a steady state developing such approach might provide an accurate sensitivity analysis with respect to the slope of the demand curve such analysis could pinpoint the bifurcation point i e the critical slope value that separates constant effort and periodic effort optimal fishing patterns it might be interesting to compare our results with the study of brokate 1985 and hritonenko and yatsenko 2007 who consider control u as depending on time and age u u a t in such settings the authors show the possibility of bang bang control which may lead to switching between 0 and the maximum value brokate also considers a case of age indiscriminate harvesting u u t and proves weak bang bang principle for this case which allows singular intervals to occur on which the optimal control is not bang bang these results are obtained for a linear economic model with zero cost in another illustrative problem of birth control with costs also placed on the controls brokate arrives at control switching between 0 and a value which is inversely proportional to the cost parameter the first row of graphs in fig 12 demonstrates similar behavior zero slope of the demand curve leads to the linear economic model introducing nonlinearity to the economic model changes the behavior dramatically by making the control smooth and even completely remove pulsations at a large enough slope of the demand curve 5 policy implications and conclusions pulse fishing as an optimal strategy in age structured models was first discovered by hannesson 1975 such policies are optimal in linear discrete time age structured models of the beverton holt type as long as there is less than perfect selectivity and it seems reasonable to claim that selectivity is less than perfect in virtually all real world fisheries numeric simulations also suggest that at least for small slope in demand function harvesting will tend to diverge from the constant level towards pulsating pattern the analysis by belyakov and veliov 2014 albeit for a slightly different model confirms that possibility on the other hand from a practical point of view pulse fishing would be difficult to implement by any responsible managing authority as it would imply that fishers would be without income for long periods rotating fishing might be an alternative where fishing fleets target one species after the other but this too is improbable from a practical viewpoint these days although it was applied by the japanese and soviet fishing fleets back in the 60s and 70s before extended economic zones it is therefore of some relief to see that the conclusion that pulse fishing is optimal hinges heavily on an assumption about linearity in the economic model as soon as only slightly downward sloping demand is introduced pulse fishing patterns start disappearing as optimal policies the sole owner must not necessarily be a monopolist it is sufficient that she has some degree of market power many times the sole owner also has some degree of market power and then the resulting policies become more realistic namely in the form of more even harvesting patterns by making age structured models more realistic from an economic point of view as well as from a biological point of view we get more even and more realistic optimal management policies highly volatile harvesting patterns may have unfortunate consequences for example around 1990 the cod stock off newfoundland suffered a collapse following decades of quite rugged landings pattern grafton et al 2000 and just recently autumn 2017 the gulf of alaska cod was subject to an 80 decrease in tac on the same background there are lots of other examples of species that have experienced a similar history peruvian anchovy north sea herring to mention a couple applying the suggested model we show that introducing even slightly downward sloping demand or slight increments in the cost parameter attenuate pulse fishing patterns significantly a conjecture could therefore be that if a sufficiently realistic version of this model had been applied to the stocks that have experienced dramatic reductions in tac or collapse such unfortunate events could have been mitigated the reason is that the present model typically advocates quite conservative and stable harvesting profiles over time which also contribute to stabilizing the stock acknowledgements the authors are grateful to rögnvaldur hannesson jose maroto and ola flaaten for valuable comments and suggestions

be solved via change of variables technique what is even more important such change of variables has an interesting meaning in the context of age structured stock dynamics let us transfer from the original independent variables a t to the new ones a s where 48 s t a the new independent variable s identifies the cohort of species recruited at time s in new variables 49 v a s u a s a u a t 50 ζ a s z a s a z a t and 51 v a u t u a v t u t now 52 0 a and s in new age cohort variables eqs 40 3 and 4 transform to 53 v a ζ a s v a 0 s a 0 54 v a a u o a a 0 55 v 0 s r s s 0 in new terms the initial condition u o a can be interpreted as the stock density at age a for the a cohort i e a cohort that appeared at time a and the boundary condition r s is the recruitment of the s cohort eq 53 describes dynamics of an s cohort while it is aging notice that this equation does not depend on other cohorts it means that after it s appearance or recruitment at time s this cohort does not experience any influence from other cohorts as a result s can be considered as a parameter in eq 53 and for any fixed s this equation is in fact a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation its general solution can be written in the form 56 v a s c exp a o a ζ α s d α where age a o 0 can be chosen arbitrary for any given cohort s and c is determined from the initial or boundary conditions to find the solution consider the two cases a t and a t a a t in this case s t a 0 i e the corresponding cohort already exists or appears if a t at time 0 taking a o s age of this cohort at time 0 we immediately get 57 v a s c exp s a ζ α s d α the state of this cohort at time 0 is given by the initial condition 54 as v a o a o u o a o which can be written in terms of cohort s a o as v s s u o s thus 58 v s s c exp s s ζ α s d α c which implies that c u o s this gives a solution for a t 59 v a s u o s exp s a ζ α s d α b a t it means that s t a 0 i e the corresponding cohort appears after the initial moment 0 and its recruitment specified by the boundary condition v 0 s r s choosing a o 0 we obtain 60 v a s c exp 0 a ζ α s d α and thus 61 v 0 s c exp 0 0 ζ α s d α c which gives c r s as a result the solution for a t 62 v a s r s exp 0 a ζ α s d α returning to the original a t variables and taking into account that 63 ζ α s z α s α z α α a t z α α a t we obtain from eqs 59 and 62 and the solution for any a t 0 64 u a t u o a t exp a t t z α α a t d α a t r t a exp 0 a z α α a t d α a t in these expressions integration is taken along the s cohort line for s t a characteristic line of eq 40 from the initial age a i at which s cohort line meets a axis initial condition a i a t s or t axis boundary condition a i 0 to the age a see fig 2 appendix b long term stock dynamics with linear stock recruitment in this section we analyze long term behavior of the dynamic equation 40 and linear stock recruitment 65 u 0 t 0 a u a t r a d a t 0 i e σ x x more precisely we focus on age distributions that do not change their shape in time i e 66 u a t v a y t where v a represents the shape and y t is the scale consider the problem where total mortality z is age dependent but not time dependent z a t z a it happens if total mortality is as in 22 but fishing effort e is constant in this case the dynamics equation becomes autonomous 67 u t u a z a u a 0 t 0 substituting 66 into the problem statement 67 and 65 yields 68 v y v y z a v y a 0 t 0 69 v 0 0 a r a v a da separation of variables for eq 68 leads to equations for y t and v a 70 y t μ y t 71 v a z a μ v a where μ is some constant the general solution for 70 is 72 y t c e μ t which means that the constant μ represents growth rate coefficient if it is positive the stock exponentially grows and if μ is negative the stock exponentially decays similarly the general solution for 71 is 73 v a d e 0 a z α μ d α d e 0 a z α d α e μ a d e z a e μ a where z a 0 a z α d α is accumulated total mortality since z α 0 z a is a monotone non decreasing function and z 0 0 if z a z const z a za and 74 v a d e z μ a substituting the general solution 73 for v a into eq 69 yields the following condition for μ 75 0 a e z a e μ a r a d a 1 known as euler lotka equation lotka 1922 1939 ellner 2009 which uniquely determines μ the complete quasi stationary solution is now given by 76 u a t c e z a μ a μ t r t e z a μ a and corresponds to exponentially evolving recruitment r t c e μt if μ 0 the age profile exponentially grows in time conversely if μ 0 the age profile exponentially decays only if μ 0 the age profile remains unchanged stationary in this case c is in fact steady state recruitment r however this steady state u a t ce z a in fact infinitely many steady states since c can be any non negative value is not structurally stable whatever small variations of functions z a and r a would immediately move μ away from 0 and result in a solution which exponentially grows or decays in time let us note that the parameter μ has an interesting interpretation it represents the whole interplay of production and mortality mechanisms presented by fertility r a and mortality z a functions respectively because of their different nature these two mechanisms enter eq 75 in different forms however if we define ρ a ln r a then r a e ρ a and the equation which determines μ becomes 77 0 a e ρ a z a μ a d a 1 although it does not seem possible to solve eq 77 analytically in general for a special case of z a and r a it can be solved specifically suppose that z a m const thus z a ma and r a e ga where g is some constant then eq 77 becomes 78 0 a e g m μ a d a 1 if a this immediately yields explicit solution μ 1 g m so 79 u a t c e 1 g m t e 1 g a age distribution has shape e 1 g a which in time exponentially grows if 1 g m production overweights mortality or decays if 1 g m now consider the problem with stationary natural mortality factor m a with the added fishing mortality caused by constant fishing effort rate e the effective fishing mortality affecting u a t is now f a e k a where k a 0 is a fishing selectivity function then stock dynamics is determined by eq 67 in which z a is replaced with m a ek a thus the quasi stationary solution for constant harvesting effort e is 80 u a t c e m a e k a μ e a t where m a 0 a m α d α and k a 0 a k α d α are the accumulated mortality and selectivity functions respectively and μ e is a unique solution of the equation 81 0 a e m a e k a e μ a r a d a 1 let μ 0 be a unique solution of 81 for e 0 i e corresponds to zero harvesting it can be shown that if μ 0 0 which implies that in the absence of harvesting the stock exponentially grows in t there exists a unique e 0 0 such that μ e 0 0 harvesting at rate e 0 would keep the stock constant in time 82 u 0 a c e m a e 0 k a in other words e 0 is the sustainable level of fishing effort in this case if e e 0 the stock will grow and if e e 0 it will decline here as always before c 0 is an arbitrary constant which is interpreted as the steady state recruitment r the only possible steady state solution corresponding to e e 0 is not unique and structurally unstable in the case of constant uniform selectivity k a k const k a ka and 81 can be rewritten 83 0 a e m a e μ e k a r a d a 1 in this case the relation between e and μ e is quite simple μ e μ 0 ek so e 0 μ 0 k where μ 0 is a unique solution of 83 for e 0 appendix c steady state existence and convergence to a steady state proposition 2 for a fixed e a nontrivial steady state exists and is structurally stable if and only if γ e 1 if γ e 1 there is no nontrivial steady state and the stock would collapse proof consider a function 84 φ r σ γ e r r for r 0 then eq 32 can be written as φ r 0 since σ is continuous concave and σ 0 0 σ 0 1 it implies that φ r is also continuous concave φ 0 0 and φ 0 γ e 1 remark we could consider a much wider class of functions σ providing steady states for the whole interval 0 e e 0 specifically it is sufficient for σ to satisfy the following condition a there exists a constant c 0 0 such that for any c 0 c c 0 there exists a unique x 0 for which σ x cx b if c 0 c this equation holds only at x 0 here c 0 is some fixed positive constant which can be equal to or in other words the graph of σ x has a unique nontrivial intersection with the straight line cx if 0 c c 0 and there is only a trivial intersection if c 0 c for the function σ x introduced in section 3 1 c 0 σ 0 1 such an extended class of functions would include many important variants of stock recruitment relations such as the ricker function σ x x exp r 1 x k which is not everywhere concave with c 0 r the beverton holt stock recruitment relation σ x ax 1 bx with c 0 a the logistic relation σ x ax 1 x b with c 0 a the power function σ x cx α where 0 α 1 with c 0 the constant function σ x r 0 as in section 2 2 with c 0 and many more in the latter example and always when σ 0 0 a nontrivial solution for the equation σ x cx exists for any 0 c which means that c 0 and as a result a nontrivial steady state will exist for any harvesting level e let us note here that the linear stock recruitment function σ x ax does not satisfy the above condition and requires special treatment see appendix b in particular eq 32 transforms into γ e 1 a as a result a nontrivial steady state may exist for at most one level of fishing effort and for such fishing effort there are infinitely many steady states proposition 3 if r t is close enough to r e for t t 0 then r t r e as t which implies that u a t u e a as t this means that the steady state solution u e corresponding to r e is asymptotically stable the convergence has an exponential type e λt and the speed of convergence to the steady state is determined by the parameter λ 0 which is the unique solution of the equation 85 σ γ e r e 0 a e m a e k a r a e λ a d a 1 proof according to eq 44 u a t at any time t can be expressed through the corresponding value of recruitment at time t a on the other hand r t a is expressed through the stock distribution via eq 21 see also fig 2 combining these two equations allows to express recruitment at time t through the previous values of recruitment 86 r t σ 0 a r a u a t d a σ 0 a r a e 0 a m a e k a d α r t a d a 87 μ a r a e 0 a m a e k a d α r a l e a a given nonnegative

discrete age and time model in all simulations we used a discrete age time analogue of the continuous model with equal steps in age and time such discrete model seems to be the most natural and intuitive specifically suppose that the time and age ranges are discrete and all the discretization steps are equal δa δt δ so the age and time grids are a 0 δ 2δ kδ and t 0 δ 2δ nδ and the complete stock dynamics is represented by a set of values u kn where k 0 1 k and n 0 1 n then all the functions of the model which depend on a i e u 0 a r a w a m a k a are represented by the corresponding discrete functions u k 0 r k w k m k k k and the discrete model is specified by the following ingredients 94 initial condition 94 u k 0 u k 0 k 0 1 k 95 recruitment boundary condition 95 u 0 n 1 σ k 1

quite close to the discrete model used in de lara et al 2007 and gourguet et al 2013 for very small steps e z kn δ 1 z kn δ thus 98 u k 1 n 1 u kn 1 z k n δ in the numerical simulations presented in this paper for any given profile e we compute dynamics using the above scheme 94 97 the age time step is 0 5 years so there are 25 age nodes and 101 time nodes thus in the optimization procedure e is treated as a 101 dimentional parameter while checking the algorithm and cross checking numerical and analytical parts we ran the complete numerical model for the constant optimal effort rate which was determined analytically as in section 4 2 the simulations showed that the stock level and age distribution approach the ones predicted analytically even in the cases when the initial distribution was far away from the steady state one
