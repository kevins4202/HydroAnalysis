24345,biological invasions represent one of the most significant threats to the conservation of biological diversity understanding the population dynamics of an invasive species is essential to detecting key components that allow the development of an effective management strategy south american pampas are particularly vulnerable to the invasion by alien woody plants that threaten the last remnants of native biodiversity aleppo pine pinus halepensis invades mountain grasslands in southern buenos aires province argentina where it changes the structure and dynamics of the whole ecosystem we combined information on the biology of the species in its native range with our data in the invaded area to develop a population model aimed at understanding the invasion process and detecting key parameters associated with its success a 12 12 stage structured matrix model was used to describe the dynamics of the species in the area through deterministic and stochastic projections population growth rates were greater than one for both types of projections in accordance with its invasive capacity in the area elasticity analysis highlights the contribution of survival at the first adult stage seven to 14 years to the population growth rate and in this way draws attention to this stage when developing a species control strategy aleppo pine shares key biological characteristics with other high impact invasive pine species in argentina and other countries in the southern hemisphere these similarities include the presence of serotinous cones and an abundant seed bank in the canopy recruitment conditioned by competition in the regeneration niche and a relatively short juvenile period in this way the model developed in this work could be easily adjusted for similar situations

spread of biological invasions is essential to defining optimal management strategies epanchin niell and hastings 2010 and population modeling could be especially useful for this purpose demographic models allow testing hypotheses about key processes or abiotic factors that affect invasion and exploring the consequences of different management strategies before conducting costly and time consuming field interventions buckley et al 2003 population projection matrices are one of the most popular tools to evaluate the contribution of the fecundity and survival schedules of a population on its dynamics ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 sebert cuvillier et al 2007 shefferson et al 2021 van mantgem and stephenson 2005 matrix projection models address demographic processes by considering the complete life cycle of organisms and allow identifying which transition stages or underlying parameters are most likely to impact population growth caplat et al 2012a matrices represent structured populations with discrete time steps in which individuals are classified into stages that may represent age or size classes developmental stages or spatial locations individuals within a stage are assumed to share the same figures in their vital rates caswell 2006 even though matrix models simplify much of the complexity inherent to population dynamics they offer conceptual clarity and allow a quick diagnosis of the probabilities of persistence and spread ezard et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 due to their standard construction analytical studies of disturbance and dynamic and interpretable population metrics it is possible to perform very useful comparative analyses with them kerr et al 2016 population matrices contain two types of data the average probability of all the individuals included in a given class remaining in the same class or changing to another class within the selected time interval and the mean fertility of all individuals in each class during the same time interval picó 2002 population vectors can be multiplied by the corresponding matrices and iterated over many time steps to project population dynamics in the future reynolds et al 2019 including its growth rate lambda λ which indicates when the population tends to grow λ 1 decline λ 1 or remain constant λ 1 over time lambda is dependent on age or stage specific vital rates of survival growth and reproduction ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 perturbation analysis sensitivity or elasticity explores the effects of small changes in underlying vital rates or state transitions on the population growth rate kerr et al 2016 sensitivity is a direct measure of how much the population growth rate changes in response to a small change in each vital rate elasticity measures how much the population growth rate changes due to a proportional change in each vital rate sensitivity assumes that a small and feasible change in one vital rate is equally small and feasible for all others which may not be true if some vital rates are measured on different scales caswell 2019 cox et al 2018 in many cases the response of λ to proportional changes is more relevant than to absolute changes ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 this type of information allows for example identifying critical stages in the life cycle of the species of interest and concentrating efforts there to achieve the desired population response with greater ease or less cost hodgson and townley 2004 the genus pinus includes ca twenty species that have been cited as invasive throughout the world particularly in the southern hemisphere rejmánek and richardson 2013 richardson and rejmánek 2004 their invasiveness is attributed to early and abundant seed production rapid establishment in exposed sites rapid growth long distance dispersal and self fertilization dezzotti et al 2009 richardson and rundel 1998 pines invasive success in grassland environments is especially remarkable and implies the addition of a new life form to the system usually driving profound changes in ecosystem functioning higgins and richardson 1998 deep root systems reach underground water reservoirs not accessible to native vegetation modifying the hydrological regime gorgens and van wilgen 2004 mobilize minerals by altering the structure and chemical composition of soils amiotti et al 2007 jobbágy and jackson 2003 quickly replace native vegetation with little to no shade tolerance and modify the frequency and intensity of fires higgins and richardson 1998 the pampas biome is one of the most intensely affected by human activities in south america bilenca and miñarro 2004 fonseca et al 2013 pretelli et al 2015 many of the valuable remaining grasslands in the region have been invaded by pine trees pinus halepensis p radiata p pinaster and p ellioti among others dispersed from nearby cultivated areas yezzi et al 2018 zalba and villamil 2002 the ventania mountains at the southern tip of the south american pampas constitute a particularly valuable relict since its rocky soils kept it apart from the advance of agriculture the area however undergoes an intense process of colonization by invasive woody plants especially aleppo pine pinus halepensis zalba and villamil 2002 different aspects of the species biology were studied in the area including age at first reproduction and the chronology of seed release cuevas 2010 its interaction with fires zalba et al 2008 and with grazing by exotic herbivores de villalobos and zalba 2010 de villalobos et al 2011 de villalobos and schwerdt 2020 at the same time an intense control strategy of the species based on an adaptive management approach was implemented where the control actions themselves were used to gather information to adjust further interventions brancatelli and zalba 2018 brancatelli et al 2020 cuevas and zalba 2010 in this work we built a population projection model that allows understanding the behavior of p halepensis in the ventania mountains aimed at understanding the invasion process and detecting key parameters to guide management actions we expect the population growth rates to be greater than 1 even when considering stochastic variability in its demographic parameters in line with the invasive capacity of this tree in the study area we also expect that the population growth rate will show the highest sensibility to the first adult stage considering that it represents the first phase of the life cycle with the ability to produce seeds and is associated with high survival rates in comparison with juvenile stages despite the extension of the use of pines as forest species at a global level and the frequency and impacts of their escapes towards natural environments lavi et al 2005 rejmánek and richardson 2013 richardson 2000 richardson et al 2008 there are very few examples of demographic models developed for these trees except for forest models focused on growth and development buckley et al 2005 caplat et al 2012b loudermilk 2005 the compadre plant matrix database which gathers models structured by stages for more than 700 species of plants includes population matrices for 12 species of pines among which p halepensis is not found salguero gómez et al 2015 in this context this work represents an original contribution with significant potential to advance the understanding of the population dynamics of this and other species of pines growing spontaneously outside of plantations and to contribute to its effective management under invasion scenarios 2 methods 2 1 study species and site aleppo pine pinus halepensis is a conifer native to the mediterranean basin that shows a remarkable capacity to thrive under a variety of climatic and ecological conditions this plasticity added to short juvenile periods massive annual production of seeds and the capacity for long distance dispersal are the main features that explain the invasiveness of p halepensis in the southern hemisphere higgins and richardson 1998 richardson 2000 its reproduction combines two alternatives for seed releasing serotinous cones that open in response to fire and non serotinous cones that open regularly even in the absence of fire thus part of its seeds accumulates in the canopy for long periods while others are released regularly goubitz et al 2004 nathan et al 1999 nathan and ne eman 2004 the percentage of serotiny is related to intrinsic features of the individuals such as age and height but also external components including the density of individuals and the historical frequency of fires goubitz et al 2004 nathan et al 2000 ne eman et al 2004 in the study area the percentage of serotiny reaches 72 in a forest with trees between 35 and 40 years old on average cuevas 2010 aleppo pine cones require three seasons to mature cones at different stages are distinguished by their size color and position along the branch nathan et al 1999 new cones pollinated during their first season are reddish and located at the end of the upper branches of the canopy during their second season immature cones already fertilized turn green and are located on branches below those with the youngest cones mature cones in their third season after pollination are bright brown and are located on the branches below those containing green cones serotine cones are usually grayish in color verkaik and espelta 2006 cones in their second year of maturation are easy to count by careful observation with binoculars daskalakou and thanos 1996 since the number of aborted cones between the transition from green cones to brown mature cones is negligible espelta et al 2011 a good estimate of fertility can be obtained from this count fruiting in aleppo pine is notoriously abundant with average annual seed production of more than 15 000 per tree nathan et al 1999 once released most of the seeds fall near the parental tree nathan and ne eman 2000 in the study region the seeds in the soil remain viable for a year or less cuevas 2010 and both germination and establishment are influenced by the altitude and orientation of the slope brancatelli et al 2021 and by herbivory de villalobos et al 2011 the slopes located to the southwest with respect to the main line of mountain peaks at medium and high altitudes are those with the highest rates of recruitment emergence and establishment brancatelli et al 2021 in turn grazed sites present a higher recruitment rate than non grazed sites de villalobos et al 2011 the length of the juvenile period is variable in their native region trees can begin to bear cones between the ages of five and ten ne eman et al 2004 skordilis and thanos 1997 thanos and daskalakou 2000 while almost the entire population reaches the reproductive age between 12 and 20 years of age thanos and daskalakou 2000 in the study area the trees begin to have cones between the ages of three and five while between the ages of 9 and 17 most of the population is already reproductive brancatelli et al 2020 the mortality of reproductive individuals is assumed to be low troupin et al 2006 except during fire events in fire situations adult mortality is highly variable depending on the intensity or severity of the fire rigolot 2004 the species is considered relatively short lived as it rarely exceeds 90 years in nature ne eman et al 2011 ventania mountains are located at the southern tip of the south american pampas buenos aires argentina 38 10 s 62 8 w climate is temperate and the native landscape is dominated by grasslands kristensen and frangi 1995 although the region was almost naturally devoid of trees before european settlement parodi 1942 it is currently facing invasion processes that rapidly replace the natural steppe with pine stands pinus halepensis and p radiata together with thickets of invasive legumes and rosacea amodeo et al 2017 sanhueza and zalba 2012 zalba and villamil 2002 2 2 life cycle graph and stage description a life cycle graph for p halepensis was built from data on its biology from the bibliography relevant information previously obtained in the study area and complementary field surveys performed for this study based on life history we consider 12 stages fig 1 seeds stored in the canopy due to serotiny part of the seeds produced annually will remain retained in the canopy indicated with a looped arrow in the life cycle graph generating a canopy seed bank as seeds do not remain viable for more than a year once released cuevas 2005 nathan and ne eman 2000 we do not include a true soil seed bank in the model juveniles in the study area the earliest individuals begin their reproduction between 6 and 7 years of age cuevas 2010 we decided to separate juvenile non reproductive individuals into seven annual stages juvenile 1 stage is considered from the emergence to one year old adults data obtained from the control strategy carried out within the ernesto tornquist provincial park see brancatelli et al 2020 cuevas and zalba 2009 includes estimates of the number of open and closed cones of each felled tree allowing us to perform a fertility analysis using generalized linear models the probability of carrying cones was considered as a variable that defines the transition between the last juvenile stage and the first reproductive stage adult 1 the probability of carrying open cones for the transition between the reproductive adult and the seed releasing adult adult 2 and the probability of carrying more than 50 open cones for the transition to a massive seed releasing adult adults 3 and 4 we divided this last stage into two parts considering the variations in the number of cones associated with the increase in the volume of the crown as the trees grow each transition was defined considering the value of the predictor variable age in which the predicted probability of transition was 0 5 according to these results we classified adult individuals into four classes adults 1 includes trees from 7 to 14 years inclusive we consider that individuals in this category may present cones but most of them are closed they will only open under fire conditions adults 2 trees from 15 to 23 years adults 3 trees from 24 to 44 years adults 4 trees from 45 to 90 years since aleppo pine rarely lives beyond this time in the wild ne eman et al 2011 and since an upper limit of survival is required to perform matrix calculations we define this as the cutoff age 2 3 parameter estimation to parameterize the model we considered published data as well as our field measurements recorded between 2017 and 2021 i the annual production of seeds was evaluated through the counting of green cones in trees located in foothills valleys between 350 and 450 m a s l the individuals were selected according to the measurement of the perimeter of their trunk from which their age was estimated according to a size age model previously constructed brancatelli 2022 twenty trees between seven and 14 years old 19 trees between 15 and 23 years old and 43 trees between 24 and 60 years old were studied adding a total of 82 individuals the relationship between the number of cones produced and the age of the trees was analyzed using a generalized linear model glm with a negative binomial distribution log link function and the logarithm of age as the predictor variable this model and distribution were chosen because of the count nature of the response variable and to account for overdispersion the distribution was evaluated using q q plots according to previous studies cuevas 2010 the trees reach an average of 103 9 se 3 8 seeds per cone in the study area using this information fertility was calculated for each class ii the release of seeds in regular non fire years r was calculated from the proportion of non serotinous cones seeds retained in serotinous cones and released only under fire conditions were represented as 1 r in the absence of fires we consider this value to be 0 72 cuevas 2010 after the occurrence of fires aleppo pines massively release their seeds from both types of cones serotinous and non serotinous ne eman et al 2004 thanos et al 1996 verkaik and espelta 2006 abruptly decreasing the stock of seeds in the canopy bank we assumed that under these conditions only 3 of the seeds remained in the canopy bank iii the germination percentage g was calculated as an average of the values at different altitudes and slope orientations six data brancatelli et al 2021 and according to grazing two data de villalobos et al 2011 we define post fire germination according to bibliographic data saracino et al 1997 the percentage of survival from emergence to one year of life hereinafter establishment e was also calculated as an average of the values at different altitudes and slope orientation six data brancatelli et al 2021 and according to grazing two data de villalobos et al 2011 the establishment rate value after fire conditions was obtained from the bibliography daskalakou and thanos 2004 iv to estimate the survival of juveniles js1 7 ten trees of each age from 0 to 7 years were selected in three different populations age determination was made based on stem diameter according to the diameter age relationship mentioned before brancatelli 2022 each tree was marked with a numbered tag and all 240 individuals 80 per population were monitored quarterly over a year to measure growth in diameter and the average survival rate for each age class was calculated using time to event analysis using the sampling month as the time scale for each age class the year over year survival percentage and its standard deviation were estimated v we assumed that all individuals under seven years of age die in the event of a fire vi as mortality of adults is usually very low in forest trees in general and aleppo pine in particular troupin et al 2006 we assumed the annual mortality of adults sa to be the same as that observed in the last juvenile stages in fire free conditions under fire situations adult mortality is highly variable according to fire intensity or severity we estimated a general mortality rate based on bibliographic data rigolot 2004 2 4 transition rules taking into account that the production of seeds and the processes related to the growth and mortality of trees follow annual cycles the time step in the model was set at one year so the retention rate is equal to zero for each juvenile stage for those stages lasting more than one year adults and cone seeds a correction was applied in the calculation of permanence and growth based on the annual survival of each stage as proposed by bruce and shernock 2002 the survival of individuals within each stage pi can be calculated from the annual survival for those ages pi and the duration of the stage di through the following correction p i 1 p i d i 1 1 p i d i p i this is because the annual survival probability is applied to all the individuals of each year belonging to the stage except the last one since they will be the individuals that at time t 1 will pass to the next category similarly the probability of growth or transition from one stage to another gi is corrected as follows since it is applied to individuals in the last year of the considered stage g i p i d i 1 p i 1 p i d i in this way the complete survivals for the adults of each class and the transition values between one class and the next were obtained 2 5 model development all analyzes and graphs were performed using r r core team 2019 and the packages survival therneau 2015 survminer kassambara et al 2019 ggplot2 wickham 2016 y popdemo stott et al 2012 2 5 1 deterministic projections projections were made for 100 years assuming density independence one simulating an incipient invasion state from an initial vector with a single adult individual in class 4 colonization vector hereinafter the transient dynamics or short term dynamics were analyzed and the reactivity and inertia indices were calculated considering that seeds are six million times more abundant than individuals in any other stage it is particularly appropriate to consider elasticity instead of sensitivity analysis cox et al 2018 as it estimates how much the growth rate changes due to a proportional change in each demographic parameter elasticity analyses of the stable growth rate were calculated based on the population parameters included in the model primitivity irreducibility and ergodicity of the matrix were checked 2 5 2 stochastic projections to consider stochasticity within the model we constructed 100 matrices for each projection taking random values of the demographic parameters within their range of variation according to our records and considering a normal distribution of the data at each time step one of these matrices was randomly selected ten 100 year projections were made from the initial colonization vector to observe the trend in population dynamics population growth rate lambda was calculated by averaging the growth rates per time step based on 2000 iterations stoch function of the popdemo package stott et al 2012 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation 3 1 1 annual seed production the perimeter of the trunk of the trees selected to estimate seed production varied between 24 and 425 cm and the age assigned to each tree was between seven and 60 years cone counts ranged between 0 and 1240 and adjusted well to a negative binomial distribution the glm represented well the power relationship between the number of observed cones and the age of the tree fig 2 based on this model the average number of cones their standard deviation and the range of variation were calculated for each adult class considering that the average number of seeds per cone is 103 9 se 3 8 cuevas 2010 the same measures were obtained for the number of seeds in each class table 1 3 1 2 juvenile survival in the survival experiment 64 6 of tagged individuals remained alive after one year 155 individuals plants considered less than 0 years old i e at the beginning of the test they had a diameter smaller than that corresponding to one year according to the constructed model suffered the highest mortality within the classes considered with only eight individuals surviving at the end of the test survival increased from 27 for the first age class to 97 for the 7 year age class table 2 3 2 life cycle and demographic analysis the twelve life stages defined in the life cycle diagram of p

values assigned to each of the demographic parameters 3 3 deterministic projections the matrix defined in this work met the conditions of primitivity irreducibility and ergodicity according to the tests proposed by stott et al 2012 the analysis of the asymptotic dynamics showed that the population settles in a stable geometric growth rate with an annual finite rate of increase of the population λ 1 32 the 100 year projection from the initial colonization vector led to a population stable growth at approximately 20 years starting from the initial vector that represents the stable structure by age this delay is avoided and the population grows steadily from the first time step fig 3 when the transitory dynamics were examined the size of the population in the first step of the projection reactivity was r 120 323 9 indicating that in the first year of the projection the population grows 120 thousand times faster concerning a population with stable growth the inertia relationship between the long term population size and the size of a population with stable growth for this population is i 73 500 6 showing that after the transitory phase the population stabilizes at a growth rate 73 thousand times greater than that of a population growing from its stable age structure in the elasticity analysis the highest value corresponds to the adults 1 stage this means that the population growth rate shows the highest variation to a proportional change in the adult 1 survival rate 3 4 stochastic projections in the projections that consider the range of variability of the demographic parameters table 2 using the initial colonization vector a clear growth trend can be observed regardless of the variations in the parameters fig 4 fig 5 shows the projection distinguishing between seeds juveniles and adults stages the average growth rate calculated for 2000 iterations was λ 1 45 var 0 4 4 discussion this work constitutes a pioneering contribution to the use of population projection models to understand the spontaneous advance of pines in natural environments the deterministic analysis of asymptotic dynamics shows that the population settles at a rate of growth above one λ 1 32 indicating a 30 annual increase in size even when the simulation starts from the initial colonization vector a single adult individual ramula et al 2008 compare population dynamics of 21 invasive terrestrial plant species and 179 native species based on published studies with population matrices they found that the growth rates of the invasive species are significantly higher than those of the native ones 1 47 and 1 05 respectively the highly invasive exotic tree ligustrum sinense has a growth rate of 1 48 according to a study carried out in louisiana usa klock 2009 for the genus pinus buckley et al 2005 calculated lambdas of between 1 0 and 2 8 according to different environments ungrazed intermediate and heavy grazed grassland and shrubland for p nigra invading new zealand the value calculated in this work is consistent with those found for p nigra and other invasive trees and plants in addition our results agree with the hypothesis raised that the population dynamics of p halepensis are adequately represented by a lefkovitch matrix with lambda greater than 1 and they highlight the invasive capacity of the species in the area the analysis of the transitory dynamics also supports this hypothesis since both the reactivity index and the inertia index indicate that the population grows much faster than what could be expected for a population with stable growth as is foreseeable for an invasive species during the expansion phase aleppo pine would have been planted for the first time in the study region between the 1940s and 1960s zalba 1995 as such its presence in the region could be considered relatively recent where the earliest specimens have not yet reached their life expectancy 90 years ne eman et al 2011 according to zalba and villamil 2002 the species increased 24 times its occupancy in the study area in the last 30 years of the xxth century and our own more recent observations reflect continuity in this dynamic reinforcing the idea the invasion is still at the expansion phase williamson 1996 our perturbation analysis reveals that the adults 1 stage is the one that most significantly contributes to changes in the population growth rate according to hartshorn 1975 the maximum reproductive potential of an organism occurs just when it enters the reproductive stage and so reducing the survival of this stage of the life cycle would have a strong effect on population dynamics for long lived plants changes in survival transitions have the greatest influence on the population growth rates i e survivorship has a high elasticity ramula et al 2008 the invasive chinese privet tree also exhibits the highest elasticity in the first adult stage according to a study conducted in a us forest where it invades klock 2009 in pinus maximartinezii elasticity analysis carried out to identify the combined effects of changes in fertility and other elements of the matrix indicate the juvenile and first reproductive adults as the stages with the greatest influence on the growth rate lópez mata 2013 the results obtained agreed with what we expected and indicate that management actions focused on individuals aged seven to 14 years could be the most effective in slowing the rate of population expansion this may be because although adults 2 3 and 4 have higher fertility rates by directing management actions to the previous stage individuals are eliminated before they reach their reproductive potential thus preventing them from acting as seed dispersers which would occur if management were focused on adults stages 2 3 or 4 from a practical point of view cutting trees in the juvenile stage requires less time and lower costs in supplies and maintenance of equipment considering in addition the low mortality of the trees at the latest juvenile stages and above it seems highly recommended to concentrate on the removal tasks at this stage of life when stochasticity is included in the model the population growth trend is maintained with a lambda even greater than that estimated from deterministic projections these results agree with the proposed hypothesis and with the perceived invasion process in the field the population of p halepensis shows an increasing trend even under environmental variability although in this model the effect of density dependence on population dynamics is not explicitly addressed it can be considered that it is included in the survival rates of the juvenile stages that were measured in the field under conditions of spontaneous recruitment juvenile pines can grow at high densities especially after massive seed releases following fires and so intraspecific competition could play an important role among the causes of mortality in this stage sebert cuvillier et al 2007 density dependent mortality is expected to occur primarily in the first stages of life further reinforcing the importance of implementing control over young adult trees 5 conclusion we developed a stochastic stage structured population model to describe the dynamics of an invasive alien tree the kind of population model structured by stages used in this paper to describe the dynamics of p halepensis can be considered a priori more appropriate than an individual based one considering the abundance of the species in the invaded area cannas et al 2003 guichard 2004 the model integrates the complete life history of the aleppo pine by including all life stages in discrete stages and time and allows the simulation of general population dynamics caswell 2001 because of their flexibility and simplicity matrix models are very helpful and are capable of working at least as well as other available models for example partial differential equations are continuous time continuous state models that are currently used when density dependent parameters have to be included berestycki et al 2005 however matrix population models are more useful when there are naturally discrete stages as in the case of the aleppo pine alternatively delay differential equations which are continuous in time but discrete in the state also allow taking into account time lags between discrete developmental stages schley and bees 2003 however such modeling remains difficult to study numerically and often requires time discretization to perform simulations instead the matrix is suitable for numerical simulations in addition population matrix models through perturbation analysis allow the identification of target life stages which is a critical step in the design of efficient control strategies the model provides a broader understanding of the population dynamics of the species in the study area and will eventually allow prioritizing management options aimed to reduce the advance of the invasion the perturbation analysis determined that the first adult stage had the greatest influence on the population growth rate additionally deterministic and stochastic projections suggest that the population is still expanding according to these results it is recommended to focus control actions on the life stage from seven to 14 years and implement preventive or early control measures in areas where the invasion is still under low density conditions integrating this matrix model with a dispersion model of p halepensis in the region would allow generating a spatially explicit model that includes environmental heterogeneity in the analysis furthermore the model developed can be parameterized and adjusted for other species with similar characteristics such as invasive pines in other grassland regions around the world author contributions g i e b and s m z conceived the study g i e b collected the data m r a analyzed the data all the authors led the writing of the manuscript and

models allow testing hypotheses about key processes or abiotic factors that affect invasion and exploring the consequences of different management strategies before conducting costly and time consuming field interventions buckley et al 2003 population projection matrices are one of the most popular tools to evaluate the contribution of the fecundity and survival schedules of a population on its dynamics ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 sebert cuvillier et al 2007 shefferson et al 2021 van mantgem and stephenson 2005 matrix projection models address demographic processes by considering the complete life cycle of organisms and allow identifying which transition stages or underlying parameters are most likely to impact population growth caplat et al 2012a matrices represent structured populations with discrete time steps in which individuals are classified into stages that may represent age or size classes developmental stages or spatial locations individuals within a stage are assumed to share the same figures in their vital rates caswell 2006 even though matrix models simplify much of the complexity inherent to population dynamics they offer conceptual clarity and allow a quick diagnosis of the probabilities of persistence and spread ezard et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 due to their standard construction analytical studies of disturbance and dynamic and interpretable population metrics it is possible to perform very useful comparative analyses with them kerr et al 2016 population matrices contain two types of data the average probability of all the individuals included in a given class remaining in the same class or changing to another class within the selected time interval and the mean fertility of all individuals in each class during the same time interval picó 2002 population vectors can be multiplied by the corresponding matrices and iterated over many time steps to project population dynamics in the future reynolds et al 2019 including its growth rate lambda λ which indicates when the population tends to grow λ 1 decline λ 1 or remain constant λ 1 over time lambda is dependent on age or stage specific vital rates of survival growth and reproduction ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 perturbation analysis sensitivity or elasticity explores the effects of small changes in underlying vital rates or state transitions on the population growth rate kerr et al 2016 sensitivity is a direct measure of how much the population growth rate changes in response to a small change in each vital rate elasticity measures how much the population growth rate changes due to a proportional change in each vital rate sensitivity assumes that a small and feasible change in one vital rate is equally small and feasible for all others which may not be true if some vital rates are measured on different scales caswell 2019 cox et al 2018 in many cases the response of λ to proportional changes is more relevant than to absolute changes ehrlén and van groenendael 1998 this type of information allows for example identifying critical stages in the life cycle of the species of interest and concentrating efforts there to achieve the desired population response with greater ease or less cost hodgson and townley 2004 the genus pinus includes ca twenty species that have been cited as invasive throughout the world particularly in the southern hemisphere rejmánek and richardson 2013 richardson and rejmánek 2004 their invasiveness is attributed to early and abundant seed production rapid establishment in exposed sites rapid growth long distance dispersal and self fertilization dezzotti et al 2009 richardson and rundel 1998 pines invasive success in grassland environments is especially remarkable and implies the addition of a new life form to the system usually driving profound changes in ecosystem functioning higgins and richardson 1998 deep root systems reach underground water reservoirs not accessible to native vegetation

native vegetation with little to no shade tolerance and modify the frequency and intensity of fires higgins and richardson 1998 the pampas biome is one of the most intensely affected by human activities in south america bilenca and miñarro 2004 fonseca et al 2013 pretelli et al 2015 many of the valuable remaining grasslands in the region have been invaded by pine trees pinus halepensis p radiata p pinaster and p ellioti among others dispersed from nearby cultivated areas yezzi et al 2018 zalba and villamil 2002 the ventania mountains at the southern tip of the south american pampas constitute a particularly valuable relict since its rocky soils kept it apart from the advance of agriculture the area however undergoes an intense process of colonization by invasive woody plants especially aleppo pine pinus halepensis zalba and villamil 2002 different aspects of the species biology were studied in the area including age at first reproduction and the chronology of seed release cuevas 2010 its interaction with fires zalba et al 2008 and with grazing by exotic herbivores de villalobos and zalba 2010 de villalobos et al 2011 de villalobos and schwerdt 2020 at the same time an intense control strategy of the species based on an adaptive management approach was implemented where the control actions themselves were used to gather information to adjust further interventions brancatelli and zalba 2018 brancatelli et al 2020 cuevas and zalba 2010 in this work we built a population projection model that allows understanding the behavior of p halepensis in the ventania mountains aimed at understanding the invasion process and detecting key parameters to guide management actions we expect the population growth rates to be greater than 1 even when considering stochastic variability in its demographic parameters in line with the invasive capacity of this tree in the study area we also expect that the population growth rate will show the highest sensibility to the first adult stage considering that it represents the first phase of the life cycle with the ability to produce seeds and is associated with high survival rates in comparison with juvenile stages despite the extension of the use of pines as forest species at a global level and the frequency and impacts of their escapes towards natural environments lavi et al 2005 rejmánek and richardson 2013 richardson 2000 richardson et al 2008 there are very few examples of demographic models developed for these trees except for forest models focused on growth and development buckley et al 2005 caplat et al 2012b loudermilk 2005 the compadre plant matrix database which gathers models structured by stages for more than 700 species of plants includes population matrices for 12 species of pines among which p halepensis is not found salguero gómez et al 2015 in this context this work represents an original contribution with significant potential to advance the understanding of the population dynamics of this and other species of pines growing spontaneously outside of plantations and to contribute to its effective management under invasion scenarios 2 methods 2 1 study species and site aleppo pine pinus halepensis is a conifer native to the mediterranean basin that shows a remarkable capacity to thrive under a variety of climatic and ecological conditions this plasticity added to short juvenile periods massive annual production of seeds and the capacity for long distance dispersal are the main features that explain the invasiveness of p halepensis in the southern hemisphere higgins and richardson 1998 richardson 2000 its reproduction combines two alternatives for seed releasing serotinous cones that open in response to fire and non serotinous cones that open regularly even in the absence of fire thus part of its seeds accumulates in the canopy for long periods while others are released regularly goubitz et al 2004 nathan et al 1999 nathan and ne eman 2004 the percentage of serotiny is related to intrinsic features of the individuals such as age and height but also external components including the density of individuals and the historical frequency of fires goubitz et al 2004 nathan et al 2000 ne eman et al 2004 in the study area the percentage of serotiny reaches 72 in a forest with trees between 35 and 40 years old on average cuevas 2010 aleppo pine cones require three seasons to mature cones at different stages are distinguished by their size color and position along the branch nathan et al 1999 new cones pollinated during their first season are reddish and located at the end of the upper branches of the canopy during their second season immature cones already fertilized turn green and are located on branches below those with the youngest cones mature cones in their third season after pollination are bright brown and are located on the branches below those containing green cones serotine cones are usually grayish in color verkaik and espelta 2006 cones in their second year of maturation are easy to count by careful observation with binoculars daskalakou and thanos 1996 since the number of aborted cones between the transition from green cones to brown mature cones is negligible espelta et al 2011 a good estimate of fertility can be obtained from this count fruiting in aleppo pine is notoriously abundant with average annual seed production of more than 15 000 per tree nathan et al 1999 once released most of the seeds fall near the parental tree nathan and ne eman 2000 in the study region the seeds in the soil remain viable for a year or less cuevas 2010 and both germination and establishment are influenced by the altitude and orientation of the slope brancatelli et al 2021 and by herbivory de villalobos et al 2011 the slopes located to the southwest with respect to the main line of mountain peaks at medium and high altitudes are those with the highest rates of recruitment emergence and establishment brancatelli et al 2021 in turn grazed sites present a higher recruitment rate than non grazed sites de villalobos et al 2011 the length of the juvenile period is variable in their native region trees can begin to bear cones between the ages of five and ten ne eman et al 2004 skordilis and thanos 1997 thanos and daskalakou 2000 while almost the entire population reaches the reproductive age between 12 and 20 years of age thanos and daskalakou 2000 in the study area the trees begin to have cones between the ages of three and five while between the ages of 9 and 17 most of the population is already reproductive brancatelli et al 2020 the mortality of reproductive individuals is assumed to be low troupin et al 2006 except during fire events in fire situations adult mortality is highly variable depending on the intensity or severity of the fire rigolot 2004 the species is considered relatively short lived as it rarely exceeds 90 years in nature ne eman et al 2011 ventania mountains are located at the southern tip of the south american pampas buenos aires argentina 38 10 s 62 8 w climate is temperate and the native landscape is dominated by grasslands kristensen and frangi 1995 although the region was almost naturally devoid of trees before european settlement parodi 1942 it is currently facing invasion processes that rapidly replace the natural steppe with pine stands pinus halepensis and p radiata together with thickets of invasive legumes and rosacea amodeo et al 2017 sanhueza and zalba 2012 zalba and villamil 2002 2 2 life cycle graph and stage description a life cycle graph for p halepensis was built from data on its biology from the bibliography relevant information previously obtained in the study area and complementary field surveys performed for this study based on life history we consider 12 stages fig 1 seeds stored in the canopy due to serotiny part of the seeds produced annually will remain retained in the canopy indicated with a looped arrow in the life cycle graph generating a canopy seed bank as seeds do not remain viable for more than a year once released cuevas 2005 nathan and ne eman 2000 we do not include a true soil seed bank in the model juveniles in the study area the earliest individuals begin their reproduction between 6 and 7 years of age cuevas 2010 we decided to separate juvenile non reproductive individuals into seven annual stages juvenile 1 stage is considered from the emergence to one year old adults data obtained from the control strategy carried out within the ernesto tornquist provincial park see brancatelli et al 2020 cuevas and zalba 2009 includes estimates of the number of open and closed cones of each felled tree allowing us to perform a fertility analysis using generalized linear models the probability of carrying cones was considered as a variable that defines the transition between the last juvenile stage and the first reproductive stage adult 1 the probability of carrying open cones for the transition between the reproductive adult and the seed releasing adult adult 2 and the probability of carrying more than 50 open cones for the transition to a massive seed releasing adult adults 3 and 4 we divided this last stage into two parts considering the variations in the number of cones associated with the increase in the volume of the crown as the trees grow each transition was defined considering the value of the predictor variable age in which the predicted probability of transition was 0 5 according to these results we classified adult individuals into four classes adults 1 includes trees from 7 to 14 years inclusive we consider that individuals in this category may present cones but most of them are closed they will only open under fire conditions adults 2 trees from 15 to 23 years adults 3 trees from 24 to 44 years adults 4 trees from 45 to 90 years since aleppo pine rarely lives beyond this time in the wild ne eman et al 2011 and since an upper limit of survival is required to perform matrix calculations we define this as the cutoff age 2 3 parameter estimation to parameterize the model we considered published data as well as our field measurements recorded between 2017 and 2021 i the annual production of seeds was evaluated through the counting of green cones in trees located in foothills valleys between 350 and 450 m a s l the individuals were selected according to the measurement of the perimeter of their trunk from which their age was estimated according to a size age model previously constructed brancatelli 2022 twenty trees between seven and 14 years old 19 trees between 15 and 23 years old and 43 trees between 24 and 60 years old were studied adding a total of 82 individuals the relationship between the number of cones produced and the age of the trees was analyzed using a generalized linear model glm with a negative binomial distribution log link function and the logarithm of age as the predictor variable this model and distribution were chosen because of the count nature of the response variable and to account for overdispersion the distribution was evaluated using q q plots according to previous studies cuevas 2010 the trees reach an average of 103 9 se 3 8 seeds per cone in the study area using this information fertility was calculated for each class ii the release of seeds in regular non fire years r was calculated from the proportion of non serotinous cones seeds retained in serotinous cones and released only under fire conditions were represented as 1 r in the absence of fires we consider this value to be 0 72 cuevas 2010 after the occurrence of fires aleppo pines massively release their seeds from both types of cones serotinous and non serotinous ne eman et al 2004 thanos et al 1996 verkaik and espelta 2006 abruptly decreasing the stock of seeds in the canopy bank we assumed that under these conditions only 3 of the seeds remained in the canopy bank iii the germination percentage g was calculated as an average of the values at different altitudes and slope orientations six data brancatelli et al 2021 and according to grazing two data de villalobos et al 2011 we define post fire germination according to bibliographic data saracino et al 1997 the percentage of survival from emergence to one year of life hereinafter establishment e was also calculated as an average of the values at different altitudes and slope orientation six data brancatelli et al 2021 and according to grazing two data de villalobos et al 2011 the establishment rate value after fire conditions was obtained from the bibliography daskalakou and thanos 2004 iv to estimate the survival of juveniles js1 7 ten trees of each age from 0 to 7 years were selected in three different populations age determination was made based on stem diameter according to the diameter age relationship mentioned before brancatelli 2022 each tree was marked with a numbered tag and all 240 individuals 80 per population were monitored quarterly over a year to measure growth in diameter and the average survival rate for each age class was calculated using time to event analysis using the sampling month as the time scale for each age class the year over year survival percentage and its standard deviation were estimated v we assumed that all individuals under seven years of age die in the event of a fire vi as mortality of adults is usually very low in forest trees in general and aleppo pine in particular troupin et al 2006 we assumed the annual mortality of adults sa to be the same as that observed in the last juvenile stages in fire free conditions under fire situations adult mortality is highly variable according to fire intensity or severity we estimated a general mortality rate based on bibliographic data rigolot 2004 2 4 transition rules taking into account that the production of seeds and the processes related to the growth and mortality of trees follow annual cycles the time step in the model was set at one year so the retention rate is equal to zero for each juvenile stage for those stages lasting more than one year adults and cone seeds a correction was applied in the calculation of permanence and growth based on the annual survival of each stage as proposed by bruce and shernock 2002 the survival of individuals within each stage pi can be calculated from the annual survival for those ages pi and the duration of the stage di through the following correction p i 1 p i d i 1 1 p i d i p i this is because the annual survival probability is applied to all the individuals of each year belonging to the stage except the last one since they will be the individuals that at time t 1 will pass to the next category similarly the probability of growth or transition from one stage to another gi is corrected as follows since it is applied to individuals in the last year of the considered stage g i p i d i 1 p i 1 p i d i in this way the complete survivals for the adults of each class and the transition values between one class and the next were obtained 2 5 model development all analyzes and graphs were performed using r r core team 2019 and the packages survival therneau 2015 survminer kassambara et al 2019 ggplot2 wickham 2016 y popdemo stott et al 2012 2 5 1 deterministic projections projections were made for 100 years assuming density independence one simulating an incipient invasion state from an initial vector with a single adult individual in class 4 colonization vector hereinafter the transient dynamics or short term dynamics were analyzed and the reactivity and inertia indices were calculated considering that seeds are six million times more abundant than individuals in any other stage it is particularly appropriate to consider elasticity instead of sensitivity analysis cox et al 2018 as it estimates how much the growth rate changes due to a proportional change in each demographic parameter elasticity analyses of the stable growth rate were calculated based on the population parameters included in the model primitivity irreducibility and ergodicity of the matrix were checked 2 5 2 stochastic projections to consider stochasticity within the model we constructed 100 matrices for each projection taking random values of the demographic parameters within their range of variation according to our records and considering a normal distribution of the data at each time step one of these matrices was randomly selected ten 100 year projections were made from the initial colonization vector to observe the trend in population dynamics population growth rate lambda was calculated by averaging the growth rates per time step based on 2000 iterations stoch function of the popdemo package stott et al 2012 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation 3 1 1 annual seed production the perimeter of the trunk of the trees selected to estimate seed production varied between 24 and 425 cm and the age assigned to each tree was between seven and 60 years cone counts ranged between 0 and 1240 and adjusted well to a negative binomial distribution the glm represented well the power relationship between the number of observed cones and the age of the tree fig 2 based on this model the average number of cones their standard deviation and the range of variation were calculated for each adult class considering that the average number of seeds per cone is 103 9 se 3 8 cuevas 2010 the same measures were obtained for the number of seeds in each class table 1 3 1 2 juvenile survival in the survival experiment 64 6 of tagged individuals remained alive after one year 155 individuals plants considered less than 0 years old i e at the beginning of the test they had a diameter smaller than that corresponding to one year according to the constructed model suffered the highest mortality within the classes considered with only eight individuals surviving at the end of the test survival increased from 27 for the first age class to 97 for the 7 year age class table 2 3 2 life cycle and demographic analysis the twelve life stages defined in the life cycle diagram of p

tests proposed by stott et al 2012 the analysis of the asymptotic dynamics showed that the population settles in a stable geometric growth rate with an annual finite rate of increase of the population λ 1 32 the 100 year projection from the initial colonization vector led to a population stable growth at approximately 20 years starting from the initial vector that represents the stable structure by age this delay is avoided and the population grows steadily from the first time step fig 3 when the transitory dynamics were examined the size of the population in the first step of the projection reactivity was r 120 323 9 indicating that in the first year of the projection the population grows 120 thousand times faster concerning a population with stable growth the inertia relationship between the long term population size and the size of a population with stable growth for this population is i 73 500 6 showing that after the transitory phase the population stabilizes at a growth rate 73 thousand times greater than that of a population growing from its stable age structure in the elasticity analysis the highest value corresponds to the adults 1 stage this means that the population growth rate shows the highest variation to a proportional change in the adult 1 survival rate 3 4 stochastic projections in the projections that consider the range of variability of the demographic parameters table 2 using the initial colonization vector a clear growth trend can be observed regardless of the variations in the parameters fig 4 fig 5 shows the projection distinguishing between seeds juveniles and adults stages the average growth rate calculated for 2000 iterations was λ 1 45 var 0 4 4 discussion this work constitutes a pioneering contribution to the use of population projection models to understand the spontaneous advance of pines in natural environments the deterministic analysis of asymptotic dynamics shows that the population settles at a rate of growth above one λ 1 32 indicating a 30 annual increase in size even when the simulation starts from the initial colonization vector a single adult individual ramula et al 2008 compare population dynamics of 21 invasive terrestrial plant species and 179 native species based on published studies with population matrices they found that the growth rates of the invasive species are significantly higher than those of the native ones 1 47 and 1 05 respectively the highly invasive exotic tree ligustrum sinense has a growth rate of 1 48 according to a study carried out in louisiana usa klock 2009 for the genus pinus buckley et al 2005 calculated lambdas of between 1 0 and 2 8 according to different environments ungrazed intermediate and heavy grazed grassland and shrubland for p nigra invading new zealand the value calculated in this work is consistent with those found for p nigra and other invasive trees and plants in addition our results agree with the hypothesis raised that the population dynamics of p halepensis are adequately represented by a lefkovitch matrix with lambda greater than 1 and they highlight the invasive capacity of the species in the area the analysis of the transitory dynamics also supports this hypothesis since both the reactivity index and the inertia index indicate that the population grows much faster than what could be expected for a population with stable growth as is foreseeable for an invasive species during the expansion phase aleppo pine would have been planted for the first time in the study region between the 1940s and 1960s zalba 1995 as such its presence in the region could be considered relatively recent where the earliest specimens have not yet reached their life expectancy 90 years ne eman et al 2011 according to zalba and villamil 2002 the species increased 24 times its occupancy in the study area in the last 30 years of the xxth century and our own more recent observations reflect continuity in this dynamic reinforcing the idea the invasion is still at the expansion phase williamson 1996 our perturbation analysis reveals that the adults 1 stage is the one that most significantly contributes to changes in the population growth rate according to hartshorn 1975 the maximum reproductive potential of an organism occurs just when it enters the reproductive stage and so reducing the survival of this stage of the life cycle would have a strong effect on population dynamics for long lived plants changes in survival transitions have the greatest influence on the population growth rates i e survivorship has a high elasticity ramula et al 2008 the invasive chinese privet tree also exhibits the highest elasticity in the first adult stage according to a study conducted in a us forest where it invades klock 2009 in pinus maximartinezii elasticity analysis carried out to identify the combined effects of changes in fertility and other elements of the matrix indicate the juvenile and first reproductive adults as the stages with the greatest influence on the growth rate lópez mata 2013 the results obtained agreed with what we expected and indicate that management actions focused on individuals aged seven to 14 years could be the most effective in slowing the rate of population expansion this may be because although adults 2 3 and 4 have higher fertility rates by directing management actions to the previous stage individuals are eliminated before they reach their reproductive potential thus preventing them from acting as seed dispersers which would occur if management were focused on adults stages 2 3 or 4 from a practical point of view cutting trees in the juvenile stage requires less time and lower costs in supplies and maintenance of equipment considering in addition the low mortality of the trees at the latest juvenile stages and above it seems highly recommended to concentrate on the removal tasks at this stage of life when stochasticity is included in the model the population growth trend is maintained with a lambda even greater than that estimated from deterministic projections these results agree with the proposed hypothesis and with the perceived invasion process in the field the population of p halepensis shows an increasing trend even under environmental variability although in this model the effect of density dependence on population dynamics is not explicitly addressed it can be considered that it is included in the survival rates of the juvenile stages that were measured in the field under conditions of spontaneous recruitment juvenile pines can grow at high densities especially after massive seed releases following fires and so intraspecific competition could play an important role among the causes of mortality in this stage sebert cuvillier et al 2007 density dependent mortality is expected to occur primarily in the first stages of life further reinforcing the importance of implementing control over young adult trees 5 conclusion we developed a stochastic stage structured population model to describe the dynamics of an invasive alien tree the kind of population model structured by stages used in this paper to describe the dynamics of p halepensis can be considered a priori more appropriate than an individual based one considering the abundance of the species in the invaded area cannas et al 2003 guichard 2004 the model integrates the complete life history of the aleppo pine by including all life stages in discrete stages and time and allows the simulation of general population dynamics caswell 2001 because of their flexibility and simplicity matrix models are very helpful and are capable of working at least as well as other available models for example partial differential equations are continuous time continuous state models that are currently used when density dependent parameters have to be included berestycki et al 2005 however matrix population models are more useful when there are naturally discrete stages as in the case of the aleppo pine alternatively delay differential equations which are continuous in time but discrete in the state also allow taking into account time lags between discrete developmental stages schley and bees 2003 however such modeling remains difficult to study numerically and often requires time discretization to perform simulations instead the matrix is suitable for numerical simulations in addition population matrix models through perturbation analysis allow the identification of target life stages which is a critical step in the design of efficient control strategies the model provides a broader understanding of the population dynamics of the species in the study area and will eventually allow prioritizing management options aimed to reduce the advance of the invasion the perturbation analysis determined that the first adult stage had the greatest influence on the population growth rate additionally deterministic and stochastic projections suggest that the population is still expanding according to these results it is recommended to focus control actions on the life stage from seven to 14 years and implement preventive or early control measures in areas where the invasion is still under low density conditions integrating this matrix model with a dispersion model of p halepensis in the region would allow generating a spatially explicit model that includes environmental heterogeneity in the analysis furthermore the model developed can be parameterized and adjusted for other species with similar characteristics such as invasive pines in other

24346,species distribution models sdm s such as the popular maxent software are frequently used to guide conservation programmes predict the potential distribution of invasive species forecast the impacts of climate change and develop applied ecological research e g biological control many applications of these models require that sdm s be transferred in either space and or time however few studies to date have tested the transferability and thus usefulness of maxent models using fully independent data moreover numerous authors have raised concerns over how model complexity controlled primarily by feature class and regularisation multiplier settings may affect maxent model transferability in this paper we evaluated the usefulness of maxent models when transferred in space using the native australian insect dasineura rubiformis kolesik diptera cecidomyiidae which has been intentionally introduced as a biological control agent of the invasive plant acacia mearnsii de wild fabaceae in south africa maxent s models were developed using native range records only australia and projected over south africa to identify the potential climatic suitability for the insect using a range of model parameter configurations model transferability was assessed using independent post release data from south africa our results demonstrated that maxent scores were positively correlated with increased probabilities of recording d rubiformis at field sites in south africa however the accuracy of the maxent models and their climatic suitability projections depended on the parameter configurations i e features classes and regularisation multipliers used to calibrate the models taken together maxent models can be useful in predicting where a species may establish even when projected into a novel geographic area but users need to be aware of how model parameter configurations and model extrapolation can influence model outputs and uncertainty we demonstrate how statistical validation of the d rubiformis maxent models can be used to develop an environmental management programme towards improving the biological control of a mearnsii using d rubiformis by

compared to alternative modelling algorithms elith et al 2006 wisz et al 2008 phillips et al 2017 it uses maximum entropy to distinguish between environmental conditions where the focal taxon is present from environmental conditions at sites without confirmed presence records for the taxon elith et al 2011 despite its popularity the usefulness of maxent has been questioned when used to generate predictions for novel geographic regions transferred in space or time periods transferred in time different from those for which the data used to build the model were collected yates et al 2018 blasi et al 2021 to date studies assessing transferability have produced contrasting results randin et al 2006 bahn and mcgill 2013 capinha et al 2018 model transferability has typically been assessed by cross validation whereby a fraction of the data is withheld to calibrate the model i e training data and the remaining data is retained to validate the model i e the testing data wenger and olden 2012 however cross validation may not provide an estimate of model transferability as a selected test sample may not provide an unbiased estimate of the full data set and therefore may not reflect the heterogeneity that may exist in the underlying data in space or time see wenger and olden 2012 ideally a direct test of model transferability should use an independent dataset of species presence absences and environmental covariates fielding and bell 1997 west et al 2016 unfortunately very few studies to date have tested model transferability using independent datasets e g costa et al 2010 rebelo and jones 2010 which may have limited our understanding of how useful sdm s can be when transferred in space or time issues with model transferability may lead to misleading conclusions which may hinder our ability to address important ecological questions such as where could an invasive species establish or where should a conservation priority be translocated merow et al 2013 maxent can construct simple to highly complex models using a range of mathematic transformations to control the shape of the relationship between climate variables and species presence pseudo absences low et al 2021 however model complexity can affect how well models can be transferred in space and time warren et al 2014 model complexity may be affected by numerous parameters notably the feature classes and regularisation beta multiplier settings used to specify the maxent model elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 maxent allows users to specify combinations of different 1 feature classes hereafter fc that modify the shape and complexity of species environment functions e g linear hinge product or quadratic features see phillips et al 2006 and 2 regularisation multiplier values a form of l1 regularisation hereafter rm to balance model complexity with the model fit penalising unnecessarily complex models merow et al 2013 the combination of feature classes and regularisation multipliers used during model calibration is hereafter referred to as parameter configurations the default maxent parameter configuration uses all feature classes in model fitting except threshold features depending on the size of the sample training data and a regularisation multiplier of 1 phillips et al 2006 several studies have highlighted the importance of species specific tuning of feature classes and regularisation multipliers for optimising maxent model complexity shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 with default parameter configurations often producing maxent models that are overly complex maxent models that are overly complex may perform well in their calibration area but may perform poorly when transferred in space or time elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 low et al 2021 jiménez and soberón 2022 despite the potential implications surprisingly few studies have specified user defined parameter configurations e g sutton 2019 and as such little is known about how parameter configurations may influence model transferability moreno amat et al 2015 low et al 2021 in this study we performed a retrospective assessment of the transferability of sdm s built using maxent phillips et al 2006 we modelled the potential climatic suitability i e the climatic similarity relative to the climate space occupied in the model calibration region for an insect native to australia that has been introduced into south africa as a biological control agent the insect dasineura rubiformis kolesik diptera cecidomyiidae was introduced into south africa from australia in 2001 and found to be established in 2006 to assist in the management of the invasive australian tree acacia mearnsii de wild impson et al 2013 extensive field surveys have been performed in australia adair 2004 and long term post release monitoring has been performed in south africa to measure establishment rates of the insect following experimental releases of the insect impson et al 2021 as such the availability of independent testing data consisting of presence and absence records from a separate continent to the data used to generate the models makes this an ideal study system for assessing the transferability of maxent models 2 methods and materials 2 1 species occurrence records a total of 103 native range occurrence records for d rubiformis were obtained from adair 2004 a total of 78 invaded range records to evaluate model transferability were taken from impson et al unpublished the invaded range records comprise presence and absence records derived from extensive field surveys over many years following the experimental releases of d rubiformis as a biological control agent at field sites across south africa the distribution of gps records for d rubiformis in both the native and invaded range are provided in fig 1 spatial autocorrelation is an important factor that may affect model outputs filtering of species occurrence data may limit the inherent biases in the data and improve model quality veloz 2009 to avoid pseudo replication only one occurrence record per 2 5 min grid cell was used for model calibration species occurrence datasets were thinned using the spthin package aiello lammens et al 2015 and spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed using the ecospat package di cola et al 2017 eighty eight occurrence records were retained to calibrate native range models spatial thinning was also performed for the invaded range occurrences however there was no evidence for spatial autocorrelation as such no occurrence records were thinned for the invaded range dataset 2 2 environmental predictors climate data were obtained by downloading the standard set of 19 bioclimatic variables from the worldclim ver 2 1 database fick and hijmans 2017 data available at www worldclim org download html this dataset is representative of annual and seasonal means and variation of temperature and precipitation metrics averaged over the 1950 2000 time period current climate at a 2 5 min resolution these variables have been shown to effectively model the climatic suitability for non native insects e g trethowan et al 2011 given that little is known of the thermal biology of d rubiformis we constructed a set of uncorrelated climate variables to fit as covariates during model calibration capinha and anastacio 2011 to do so pearson s correlation coefficients were computed for all pairs of predictors whereby predictors which were highly correlated r 0 70 were excluded from the final predictor set capinha and anastacio 2011 the reduced set of environmental predictors consisted of eight climatic variables including bio1 annual mean temperature bio2 mean diurnal temperature range mean of monthly max temp min temp bio3 isothermality bio5 maximum temperature of the warmest month bio8 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio9 mean temperature of the driest quarter bio12 mean annual precipitation and bio19 precipitation of the coldest quarter see fick and hijmans 2017 for further details 2 3 model calibration maxent ver 3 4 3 was implemented in the dismo r package hijmans et al 2021 several authors have proposed that maxent models used to estimate climatic suitability for non native species should be calibrated with both native range and invaded range data to incorporate the additional environmental conditions potentially occupied in the invaded range e g beaumonth et al 2009 martin et al 2020 however the aim of our study was to assess how well native range maxent models were able to predict the establishment of d rubiformis in a spatially independent geographic region as such we estimated the climatic suitability for d rubiformis in australia by calibrating maxent models using native range data only the fitted models were then transferred over south africa and independent occurrence data from this region were used to assess model transferability given that maxent is a presence pseudo absence modelling algorithm model calibration requires a user defined geographic background to sample the climate of representative grid cells where the focal species is assumed to be absent i e background points or pseudo absences background definition can have a significant effect on model output vanderwal et al 2009 the background should ideally represent the geographic areas available to the focal species omitting areas where species absence is due to historical factors dispersal constraints and or biotic interactions sanin and anderson 2018 following webber et al 2011 we defined the model background using the koppen geiger climate classification system available at http koeppen geiger vu wien ac at only koppen geiger climate zones that contained at least one native range occurrence record for d rubiformis in australia were used as the background area from which background points were drawn for model calibration fig 1a the koppen geiger climate zones were intersected with the occurrence records using the raster r package hijmans 2022 we randomly sampled 10 000 points the default number used for maxent merow et al 2013 from within this background definition using the dismo r package hijmans et al 2021 maxent models were parameterised with default settings for multiple parameters including convergence 105 maximum number of iterations 500 and prevalence 0 5 the fade by clamping option was selected to prevent extrapolation well outside the range of climatic values in the model training area philips et al 2017 model predictions were obtained using the logistic output to create continuous climatic suitability raster layers scaled between 0 climatically unsuitable and 1 climatically suitable 2 4 native range within sample model evaluation model tuning experiments were applied to the native range maxent models to derive within sample evaluation metrics to guide the selection of optimal maxent parameter configurations feature classes and regularisation multipliers optimised parameter configurations would then be used to refit the maxent models before being projected into a novel geographic region and making projections of climatic suitability for d rubiformis model tuning was performed by building maxent models with varying 1 feature class combinations h hinge only l linear only lq linear and quadratic and lqh linear quadratic and hinge features and 2 regularisation multipliers 1 8 in total 32 maxent models were specified native range model performance and optimal parameter configurations were assessed using 4 fold spatial block cross validation using enmeval kass et al 2021 optimal parameter configurations were assessed using multiple metrics that reflect different aspects of model performance four metrics were calculated including 1 discriminatory ability auctest 2 overfitting aucdiff 3 omission rates or10 and 4 overall parsimony aicc the use of auc analyses for assessing the fit of maxent models has been criticised for a variety of reasons see lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 however auc metrics are arguably the most widely used metrics to evaluate maxent model performance and as such we believe it is important to include them in our evaluation and contrast the results obtained using auc versus other metrics we specified five final maxent models four models calibrated with fc and rm values that optimised model performance based on the metrics discussed below and a maxent model calibrated with default fc and rm values our intention was to compare maxent model predictions and performance depending on which metric was used to select optimal parameter configurations relative to the default maxent settings 1 auctest assesses the model s ability to discriminate between predicted presence at withheld portions of the data used to test the model versus pseudo absence points an auc of less than 0 8 is considered a poor model between 0 8 and 0 9 is a fair model between 0 9 and 0 995 a good model and 0 995 an excellent model fielding and bell 1997 thus higher auctest values indicate increased ability to discriminate between testingand background points 2 aucdiff is the difference between auc values calculated on training points only auctrain and auctest see 1 auctest above for details warren and seifert 2011 thus higher aucdiff values indicate whether the maxent model is overfit on the training data and thus may perform poorly when evaluated against testing points 3 or10 is the 10 training omission rate boria et al 2014 overfit models have omission rates higher than the theoretical expectation for the threshold applied shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 as such the or10 criterion selected models calibrated with maxent settings which best approximated the expected 0 10 omission rate models with omission rates increasingly higher than the expected value were considered to have a higher degree of overfit boria et al 2017 4 the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes aicc criterion simultaneously scores models according to their complexity and goodness of fit aicc was used as the primary evaluation metric as it is calculated using maxent models built using the entire species occurrence dataset i e all the occurrence points in the native range unlike auc and or10 and numerous other metrics frequently used for model evaluation which may be spatially biased due to the partitioning of the species occurrence dataset into training and evaluation sets sanin and anderson 2018 optimal parameter configurations were determined by selecting model configurations which produced the lowest value for aicc i e aicc 0 following kass et al 2021 2 5 invaded range independent sample model evaluation to evaluate the predictive performance and transferability of the native range maxent models when projected into the novel geographic region of south africa we evaluated whether maxent climatic suitability scores were correlated with d rubiformis presence absence in south africa to do so maxent scores were specified as a continuous fixed effect and whether d rubiformis was recorded or not present absent as a boolean response variable in a logistic general linear model glm using a logit link function maxent scores bounded between 0 not climatically suitable and 1 highly climatically suitable between the native range occupied by d rubiformis in australia and sites where it was released as a biological control agent in south africa were derived by projecting maxent suitability rasters from models calibrated using native range records only over south africa we extracted maxent suitability scores for each site where d rubiformis was surveyed in south africa using the raster r package hijmans 2022 the glm s were specified using the rms package in r harrell 2020 likelihood ratio tests lrt were performed to determine whether there was a statistical correlation between maxent scores and the probability of d rubiformis establishment a statistically significant positive correlation between maxent scores and d rubiformis presences would provide support that the sdm s were useful and predictive of insect establishment even when the insect was transferred in space additionally partial area under the received operating characteristic curve proc peterson et al 2008 was used to calculate auc ratios to quantify model predictive accuracy auc ratios are bounded between 0 and 2 with values equal to 1 representing random model performance values tending towards 2 indicating increasing greater model performance and values 1 indicating worse performance than random chance alone peterson et al 2008 auc ratios were calculated using the kuenm r package cobos et al 2019 with the potential error threshold set at 5 the percentage of data used in bootstrap testing set at 50 and 500 iterations performed 2 6 model extrapolation several authors have raised concerns over the use of correlative sdm s such as maxent when projected into new geographic regions or time periods due to issues with extrapolation into novel non analogous climate elith et al 2011 elith and leathwick 2009 yates et al 2018 to address these concerns multivariate environmental similarity surfaces hereafter mess elith et al 2010 were computed to assess whether maxent models were extrapolating or interpolating mess analyses measure the similarity of any given point to a set of reference points reference points were defined as only the species presence points used to calibrate models following kriticos et al 2014 interpolation extrapolation was assessed using mess maps using the dismo package in r hijmans et al 2021 negative mess values indicate geographic regions outside the range of climate variables used to calibrate the model i e extrapolation space or mess while mess values between 0 and 100 indicate geographic regions inside the range of climatic variables used to calibrate the model i e interpolation space or mess mess maps are used as a measure of prediction uncertainty or caution against inferences in extrapolation space elith et al 2010 the same logistic glm analysis detailed in section 2 5 was adopted to test whether the interpolation extrapolation state of each d rubiformis occurrence record in south africa was predictive of d rubiformis presence interpolation versus extrapolation was fit as a categorical predictor and whether d rubiformis was recorded or not present absent as a boolean response variable in a logistic glm using a logit link function all modelling and statistical analyses were conducted in r ver 4 0 3 r core team 2020 all values presented in text are presented as mean standard error unless otherwise stated a standardised odmap methods protocol overview data model assessment and prediction has been completed for this study and can be found in supplementary file s1 odmap standardises the reporting of sdm modelling studies to improve transparency and reproducibility zurell et al 2020 3 results 3 1 native range within sample model evaluation five candidate maxent models were specified using native range australia training data models projections are presented in fig s2 the five models differed in the parameter configurations used by maxent to build the models these models were specified with 1 default maxent parameter configurations and four optimised parameter configurations that maximised model performance based on 2 auctest 3 aucdiff 4 or10 and 5 aicc table s3 they all performed significantly better than random chance alone table s3 4 fig 2 however the model calibrated with default maxent settings performed worse than the models calibrated with tuned model settings while default maxent settings produced high discriminatory power when tested in the training area of australia models calibrated with tuned settings configurations typically led to higher discriminatory power auctest 0 75 less overfitting lower aucdiff better omission rates near 10 and more parsimonious models aicc table s3 4 nevertheless all five models had high predictive accuracy in distinguishing between recorded d rubiformis presences and pseudo absence points in its native range 3 2 invaded range independent sample model evaluation when evaluated on independent presence absence testing data in south africa the maxent models showed relatively high discriminatory power with all models having proc auc ratios significantly higher than random chance alone auc ratio 1 fig 3 however predictive performance varied depending on the model parameter configurations for example the default maxent model had the lowest predictive power auc ratio 1 47 0 11 while the models calibrated with tuned settings all had higher auc ratios auc ratio 1 60 for all glm s there was a positive statistically significant correlation between maxent climatic suitability scores and the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 indeed all models had β parameters corrected for a 0 01 unit increase in maxent climatic suitability scores β 1 indicating that the odds of d rubiformis being recorded at a site in south africa increased with higher maxent climatic suitability scores table 1 for example the odds of recording d rubiformis increased by a factor of 1 60 for each 0 01 unit increase in climatic similarity according to the maxent model with default settings while the odds increased by 1 02 to 1 07 for the models calibrated with optimised parameter configurations however inspecting the model prediction plots shows that the estimated relationship between maxent climatic suitability and d rubiformis establishment was different for the default model versus the models calibrated with tuned settings fig 4 the default model predicted higher probabilities of recording d rubiformis at lower maxent climatic suitability scores scores 0 50 than the models with optimised parameter configurations fig 4 the predicted climatic suitability for d rubiformis across south africa varied depending on the maxent parameter configurations used to calibrate the model fig 5 all maxent models predicted relatively high climatic suitability for d rubiformis in the south west of south africa and in the southern cape region however three out of the four maxent models calibrated with tuned model settings not including the aicc model differed from the default settings model by predicting climatic suitability for d rubiformis along the entire south and east coast of south africa the default model and to a lesser extent the aicc model showed evidence of overfitting to the training data with highly localised predictions of climatic suitability fig 5 3 3 model extrapolation despite the high performance of the maxent models when transferred in space the mess maps indicated that the maxent models were extrapolating climatic suitability scores for d rubiformis over the vast majority of south africa fig 6 a indeed 44 of the 78 field sites surveyed for d rubiformis in south africa occur in geographic regions where the maxent models were extrapolating dasineura rubiformis was recorded at 33 of 34 sites in interpolation 97 and 34 of 44 sites in extrapolation 77 fig 6b we found support that a site being in extrapolation interpolation was a statistically significant predictor of d rubiformis being recorded in south africa χ2 7 28 d f 1 p 0 007 the probability that d rubiformis was recorded increased by 20 for a site in interpolation versus extrapolation 4 discussion species distribution models are important tools to support and guide the development and implementation of environmental policies and management programs addison et al 2013 schuwirth et al 2019 the usefulness of sdm s depends on model performance which is typically measured by the model s ability to correctly predict where a species is established and its capacity to distinguish between sites where the species is established versus a site where the species is absent or assumed to be absent smith et al 2021 however several authors have called in question the usefulness of sdm s notably when models are transferred in space or time yates et al 2018 blasi et al 2021 poor transferability may lead to erroneous model predictions that may have serious negative consequences for the application of the model and resulting policies and management programmes here we report on the validation of maxent models for d rubiformis an insect native to australia that has been intentionally introduced as a biological control agent into south africa to reduce the invasiveness of its host plant a mearnsii impson et al 2013 the availability of independent presence absence testing data from south africa a separate continent to the data used to generate the models australia makes this an ideal study system for assessing the transferability of maxent models this study represents one of only a handful of studies to validate maxent using independent testing data costa et al 2010 rebelo and jones 2010 west et al 2016 smith et al 2021 our results indicated that maxent sdm s were able to provide robust estimates of climatic suitability for d rubiformis in south africa when maxent models calibrated with occurrence records for d rubiformis from australia were projected over south africa they had auc ratios between 1 47 1 70 indicative of high power to discriminate between sites where d rubiformis was recorded in south africa or not additionally we showed that the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa increased with higher maxent climatic suitability scores this result demonstrates the usefulness of the maxent sdm s and that at least for our case study maxent models can be transferred into novel geographic regions and provide valuable information to guide policy making and the development of management programmes the current study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that sdm model complexity affects model performance and transferability when being projected into novel geographic regions while the default maxent model had the high predictive power in the training area australia this model was overfit to the training data warren et al 2014 producing localised suitability scores when transferred over south africa this finding corroborates other studies showing that high predictive power in the model training area is not a guarantee of optimal transferability warren et al 2014 duque lazo et al 2016 models calibrated with optimised parameter configurations produced more consistent and less variable predictions when transferred over south africa in addition our results corroborate previous studies demonstrating that maxent model performance typically improved with regularisation multiplier values greater than 1 the default setting e g radosavljevic and anderson 2014 additionally our results demonstrated that maxent models calibrated with hinge features e g auctest and aucdiff optimised model transferability this result follows the tenet that overly complex models may be overfitted to features of the training data and thus may perform poorly when transferred into novel geographic regions warren et al 2014 low et al 2021 model tuning should be performed to estimate optimal parameter configurations when transferring maxent models in space and or time to maximise their usefulness an additional consideration when predicting into areas or time frames non analogous to those under which the model was calibrated i e extrapolation is the accuracy of those predictions elith et al 2010 mesgaran et al 2014 however the applied use of sdm s in developing environmental policy developing management programmes for invasive species and implementing conservation programmes often necessitate that models are transferred and predictions made even when models are extrapolating elith et al 2010 here we showed that d rubiformis was recorded at many sites 77 in south africa that were outside the range of climate space it occupies in its native range i e extrapolation which was significantly lower than the 97 of sites where the insect was recorded that were classified as being in interpolation the high proportion of sites that d rubiformis was recorded at where the maxent models were in extrapolation clearly demonstrates the importance of leveraging the models power to extrapolate predictions when being transferred although extrapolation from calibrated models is generally not advised applying these models to applications such as forecasting climate change effects and predicting climatic suitability for invasive species will often necessitate that researchers use extrapolation to make predictions from their models as such we echo the recommendations of qiao et al 2019 that environmental similarity between the model calibration area and the transfer region be quantified to assess the uncertainty associated with model transfer and extrapolation and make any interferences with this in mind a number of tools have been developed in recent years to perform these calculations such as mess elith et al 2010 and exdet mesgaran et al 2014 and which should be an integral component of any maxent study given that the d rubiformis maxent models showed high predictive accuracy when transferred in space over south africa and the statistically significant positive correlation between maxent scores and d rubiformis establishment we wish to highlight how these models could be used to guide management programmes or develop environmental policies we selected the auctest model in fig 4b for this illustration because it had the highest predictive performance in south africa fig 3 in fig 4b we can see that when maxent climatic suitability scores are 0 25 the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa was greater than 75 mass rearing and releasing weed biological control agents is a time consuming and costly endeavour hill et al 2021 as such we could develop a redistribution programme to perform experimental releases of the insects at field sites across south africa that maximise the chances of d rubiformis populations establishing and thus improving the level of control over the invasive weed to do so we could threshold the maxent climatic suitability predictions to indicate regions in south africa where the probability of d rubiformis establishment is greater than 75 i e where maxent scores 0 25 or less than 75 i e where maxent scores 0 25 we arbitrarily chose a threshold for the probability of establishment at 75 as this value represents a significantly better chance of the experimental releases of the insect to be successful and thus provides a reasonable indication of how to justify resource expenditure the resulting map given in fig 7 demonstrates that the south and east coast regions of south africa are climatically suitable for d rubiformis any experimental releases of d rubiformis in the suitable regions indicated on the map would be likely to result in viable populations establishing the redistribution programme would perform as many experimental releases within these suitable regions as possible this example demonstrates a simple statistically validated approach to optimising the redistribution of d rubiformis in south africa these maps provide valuable evidence to present to stakeholders policy makers and funding bodies to justify expenditure in developing environmental management programmes such as biological control programmes 5 conclusions using sdm s to make predictions into novel geographic locations or time periods is an important tool in ecology however this practise has been met with justifiable resilience and concerns over how well these models perform upon transfer in this study we presented a case study demonstrating that maxent sdm s were able to accurately predict the distribution of an australian insect when introduced into south africa our study is one of only a few studies to date validating maxent models using spatially independent data however the accuracy of the maxent models and their climatic suitability projections depended on the parameter configurations i e features classes and regularisation multipliers used to calibrate the models this study demonstrates that maxent models can be useful in predicting where a species may establish even when projected into a novel geographic area but that users need to be aware of how model parameter configurations and model extrapolation can influence model outputs and uncertainty demonstrating how maxent can be useful while communicating uncertainty in their predictions and outputs is essential for building confidence in the use of sdm s blasi et al 2021 we demonstrated how validating predictive models can be used to guide the implementation of a weed biological control programme by optimising the redistribution and experimental releases of d rubiformis in geographic areas that are climatically suitable and where the probability of the insect establishing populations

24346,species distribution models sdm s such as the popular maxent software are frequently used to guide conservation programmes predict the potential distribution of invasive species forecast the

studies to date have tested the transferability and thus usefulness of maxent models using fully independent data moreover numerous authors have raised concerns over how model complexity controlled

in south africa maxent s models were developed using native range records only australia and projected over south africa to identify the potential climatic suitability for the insect using a range of model parameter configurations model transferability was assessed using independent post release data from south africa our results demonstrated that maxent scores were positively correlated with

that modify the shape and complexity of species environment functions e g linear hinge product or quadratic features see phillips et al 2006 and 2 regularisation multiplier values a form of l1 regularisation hereafter rm to balance model complexity with the model fit penalising unnecessarily complex models merow et al 2013 the combination of feature classes and regularisation multipliers used during model calibration is hereafter referred to as parameter configurations the default maxent parameter configuration uses all feature classes in model fitting except threshold features depending on the size of the sample training data and a regularisation multiplier of 1 phillips et al 2006 several studies have highlighted the importance of species specific tuning of feature classes and regularisation multipliers for optimising maxent model complexity shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 with default parameter configurations often producing maxent models that are overly complex maxent models that are overly complex may perform well in their calibration area but may perform poorly when transferred in space or time elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 low et al 2021 jiménez and soberón 2022 despite the potential implications surprisingly few studies have specified user defined parameter configurations e g sutton 2019 and as such little is known about how parameter configurations may influence model transferability moreno amat et al 2015 low et al 2021 in this study we performed a retrospective assessment of the transferability of sdm s built using maxent phillips et al 2006 we modelled the potential climatic suitability i e the climatic similarity relative to the climate space occupied in the model calibration region for an insect native to australia that has been introduced into south africa as a biological control agent the insect dasineura rubiformis kolesik diptera cecidomyiidae was introduced into south africa from australia in 2001 and found to be established in 2006 to assist in the management of the invasive australian tree acacia mearnsii de wild impson et al 2013 extensive field surveys have been performed in australia adair 2004 and long term post release monitoring has been performed in south africa to measure establishment rates of the insect following experimental releases of the insect impson et al 2021 as such the availability of independent testing data consisting of presence and absence records from a separate continent to the data used to generate the models makes this an ideal study system for assessing the transferability of maxent models 2 methods and materials 2 1 species occurrence records a total of 103 native range occurrence records for d rubiformis were obtained from adair 2004 a total of 78 invaded range records to evaluate model transferability were taken from impson et al unpublished the invaded range records comprise presence and absence records derived from extensive field surveys over many years following the experimental releases of d rubiformis as a biological control agent at field sites across south africa the distribution of gps records for d rubiformis in both the native and invaded range are provided in fig 1 spatial autocorrelation is an important factor that may affect model outputs filtering of species occurrence data may limit the inherent biases in the data and improve model quality veloz 2009 to avoid pseudo replication only one occurrence record per 2 5 min grid cell was used for model calibration species occurrence datasets were thinned using the spthin package aiello lammens et al 2015 and spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed using the ecospat package di cola et al 2017 eighty eight occurrence records were retained to calibrate native range models spatial thinning was also performed for the invaded range occurrences however there was no evidence for spatial autocorrelation as such no occurrence records were thinned for the invaded range dataset 2 2 environmental predictors climate data were obtained by downloading the standard set of 19 bioclimatic variables from the worldclim ver 2 1 database fick and hijmans 2017 data available at www worldclim org download html this dataset is representative of annual and seasonal means and variation of temperature and precipitation metrics averaged over the 1950 2000 time period current climate at a 2 5 min resolution these variables have been shown to effectively model the climatic suitability for non native insects e g trethowan et al 2011 given that little is known of the thermal biology of d rubiformis we constructed a set of uncorrelated climate variables to fit as covariates during model calibration capinha and anastacio 2011 to do so pearson s correlation coefficients were computed for all pairs of predictors whereby predictors which were highly correlated r 0 70 were excluded from the final predictor set capinha and anastacio 2011 the reduced set of environmental predictors consisted of eight climatic variables including bio1 annual mean temperature bio2 mean diurnal temperature range mean of monthly max temp min temp bio3 isothermality bio5 maximum temperature of the warmest month bio8 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio9 mean temperature of the driest quarter bio12 mean annual precipitation and bio19 precipitation of the coldest quarter see fick and hijmans 2017 for further details 2 3 model calibration maxent ver 3 4 3 was implemented in the dismo r package hijmans et al 2021 several authors have proposed that maxent models used to estimate climatic suitability for non native species should be calibrated with both native range and invaded range data to incorporate the additional environmental conditions potentially occupied in the invaded range e g beaumonth et al 2009 martin et al 2020 however the aim of our study was to assess how well native range maxent models were able to predict the establishment of d rubiformis in a spatially independent geographic region as such we estimated the climatic suitability for d rubiformis in australia by calibrating maxent models using native range data only the fitted models were then transferred over south africa and independent occurrence data from this region were used to assess model transferability given that maxent is a presence pseudo absence modelling algorithm model calibration requires a user defined geographic background to sample the climate of representative grid cells where the focal species is assumed to be absent i e background points or pseudo absences background definition can have a significant effect on model output vanderwal et al 2009 the background should ideally represent the geographic areas available to the focal species omitting areas where species absence is due to historical factors dispersal constraints and or biotic interactions sanin and anderson 2018 following webber et al 2011 we defined the model background using the koppen geiger climate classification system available at http koeppen geiger vu wien ac at only koppen geiger climate zones that contained at least one native range occurrence record for d rubiformis in australia were used as the background area from which background points were drawn for model calibration fig 1a the koppen geiger climate zones were intersected with the occurrence records using the raster r package hijmans 2022 we randomly sampled 10 000 points the default number used for maxent merow et al 2013 from within this background definition using the dismo r package hijmans et al 2021 maxent models were parameterised with default settings for multiple parameters including convergence 105 maximum number of iterations 500 and prevalence 0 5 the fade by clamping option was selected to prevent extrapolation well outside the range of climatic values in the model training area philips et al 2017 model predictions were obtained using the logistic output to create continuous climatic suitability raster layers scaled between 0 climatically unsuitable and 1 climatically suitable 2 4 native range within sample model evaluation model tuning experiments were applied to the native range maxent models to derive within sample evaluation metrics to guide the selection of optimal maxent parameter configurations feature classes and regularisation multipliers optimised parameter configurations would then be used to refit the maxent models before being projected into a novel geographic region and making projections of climatic suitability for d rubiformis model tuning was performed by building maxent models with varying 1 feature class combinations h hinge only l linear only lq linear and quadratic and lqh linear quadratic and hinge features and 2 regularisation multipliers 1 8 in total 32 maxent models were specified native range model performance and optimal parameter configurations were assessed using 4 fold spatial block cross validation using enmeval kass et al 2021 optimal parameter configurations were assessed using multiple metrics that reflect different aspects of model performance four metrics were calculated including 1 discriminatory ability auctest 2 overfitting aucdiff 3 omission rates or10 and 4 overall parsimony aicc the use of auc analyses for assessing the fit of maxent models has been criticised for a variety of reasons see lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 however auc metrics are arguably the most widely used metrics to evaluate maxent model performance and as such we believe it is important to include them in our evaluation and contrast the results obtained using auc versus other metrics we specified five final maxent models four models calibrated with fc and rm values that optimised model performance based on the metrics discussed below and a maxent model calibrated with default fc and rm values our intention was to compare maxent model predictions and performance depending on which metric was used to select optimal parameter configurations relative to the default maxent settings 1 auctest assesses the model s ability to discriminate between predicted presence at withheld portions of the data used to test the model versus pseudo absence points an auc of less than 0 8 is considered a poor model between 0 8 and 0 9 is a fair model between 0 9 and 0 995 a good model and 0 995 an excellent model fielding and bell 1997 thus higher auctest values indicate increased ability to discriminate between testingand background points 2 aucdiff is the difference between auc values calculated on training points only auctrain and auctest see 1 auctest above for details warren and seifert 2011 thus higher aucdiff values indicate whether the maxent model is overfit on the training data and thus may perform poorly when evaluated against testing points 3 or10 is the 10 training omission rate boria et al 2014 overfit models have omission rates higher than the theoretical expectation for the threshold applied shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 as such the or10 criterion selected models calibrated with maxent settings which best approximated the expected 0 10 omission rate models with omission rates increasingly higher than the expected value were considered to have a higher degree of overfit boria et al 2017 4 the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes aicc criterion simultaneously scores models according to their complexity and goodness of fit aicc was used as the primary evaluation metric as it is calculated using maxent models built using the entire species occurrence dataset i e all the occurrence points in the native range unlike auc and or10 and numerous other metrics frequently used for model evaluation which may be spatially biased due to the partitioning of the species occurrence dataset into training and evaluation sets sanin and anderson 2018 optimal parameter configurations were determined by selecting model configurations which produced the lowest value for aicc i e aicc 0 following kass et al 2021 2 5 invaded range independent sample model evaluation to evaluate the predictive performance and transferability of the native range maxent models when projected into the novel geographic region of south africa we evaluated whether maxent climatic suitability scores were correlated with d rubiformis presence absence in south africa to do so maxent scores were specified as a continuous fixed effect and whether d rubiformis was recorded or not present absent as a boolean response variable in a logistic general linear model glm using a logit link function maxent scores bounded between 0 not climatically suitable and 1 highly climatically suitable between the native range occupied by d rubiformis in australia and sites where it was released as a biological control agent in south africa were derived by projecting maxent suitability rasters from models calibrated using native range records only over south africa we extracted maxent suitability scores for each site where d rubiformis was surveyed in south africa using the raster r package hijmans 2022 the glm s were specified using the rms package in r harrell 2020 likelihood ratio tests lrt were performed to determine whether there was a statistical correlation between maxent scores and the probability of d rubiformis establishment a statistically significant positive correlation between maxent scores and d rubiformis presences would provide support that the sdm s were useful and predictive of insect establishment even when the insect was transferred in space additionally partial area under the received operating characteristic curve proc peterson et al 2008 was used to calculate auc ratios to quantify model predictive accuracy auc ratios are bounded between 0 and 2 with values equal to 1 representing random model performance values tending towards 2 indicating increasing greater model performance and values 1 indicating worse performance than random chance alone peterson et al 2008 auc ratios were calculated using the kuenm r package cobos et al 2019 with the potential error threshold set at 5 the percentage of data used in bootstrap testing set at 50 and 500 iterations performed 2 6 model extrapolation several authors have raised concerns over the use of correlative sdm s such as maxent when projected into new geographic regions or time periods due to issues with extrapolation into novel non analogous climate elith et al 2011 elith and leathwick 2009 yates et al 2018 to address these concerns multivariate environmental similarity surfaces hereafter mess elith et al 2010 were computed to assess whether maxent models were extrapolating or interpolating mess analyses measure the similarity of any given point to a set of reference points reference points were defined as only the species presence points used to calibrate models following kriticos et al 2014 interpolation extrapolation was assessed using mess maps using the dismo package in r hijmans et al 2021 negative mess values indicate geographic regions outside the range of climate variables used to calibrate the model i e extrapolation space or mess while mess values between 0 and 100 indicate geographic regions inside the range of climatic variables used to calibrate the model i e interpolation space or mess mess maps are used as a measure of prediction uncertainty or caution against inferences in extrapolation space elith et al 2010 the same logistic glm analysis detailed in section 2 5 was adopted to test whether the interpolation extrapolation state of each d rubiformis occurrence record in south africa was predictive of d rubiformis presence interpolation versus extrapolation was fit as a categorical predictor and whether d rubiformis was recorded or not present absent as a boolean response variable in a logistic glm using a logit link function all modelling and statistical analyses were conducted in r ver 4 0 3 r core team 2020 all values presented in text are presented as mean standard error unless otherwise stated a standardised odmap methods protocol overview data model assessment and prediction has been completed for this study and can be found in supplementary file s1 odmap standardises the reporting of sdm modelling studies to improve transparency and reproducibility zurell et al 2020 3 results 3 1 native range within sample model evaluation five candidate maxent models were specified using native range australia training data models projections are presented in fig s2 the five models differed in the parameter configurations used by maxent to build the models these models were specified with 1 default maxent parameter configurations and four optimised parameter configurations that maximised model performance based on 2 auctest 3 aucdiff 4 or10 and 5 aicc table s3 they all performed significantly better than random chance alone table s3 4 fig 2 however the model calibrated with default maxent settings performed worse than the models calibrated with tuned model settings while default maxent settings produced high discriminatory power when tested in the training area of australia models calibrated with tuned settings configurations typically led to higher discriminatory power auctest 0 75 less overfitting lower aucdiff better omission rates near 10 and more parsimonious models aicc table s3 4 nevertheless all five models had high predictive accuracy in distinguishing between recorded d rubiformis presences and pseudo absence points in its native range 3 2 invaded range independent sample model evaluation when evaluated on independent presence absence testing data in south africa the maxent models showed relatively high discriminatory power with all models having proc auc ratios significantly higher than random chance alone auc ratio 1 fig 3 however predictive performance varied depending on the model parameter configurations for example the default maxent model had the lowest predictive power auc ratio 1 47 0 11 while the models calibrated with tuned settings all had higher auc ratios auc ratio 1 60 for all glm s there was a positive statistically significant correlation between maxent climatic suitability scores and the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 indeed all models had β parameters corrected for a 0 01 unit increase in maxent climatic suitability scores β 1 indicating that the odds of d rubiformis being recorded at a site in south africa increased with higher maxent climatic suitability scores table 1 for example the odds of recording d rubiformis increased by a factor of 1 60 for each 0 01 unit increase in climatic similarity according to the maxent model with default settings while the odds increased by 1 02 to 1 07 for the models calibrated with optimised parameter configurations however inspecting the model prediction plots shows that the estimated relationship between maxent climatic suitability and d rubiformis establishment was different for the default model versus the models calibrated with tuned settings fig 4 the default model predicted higher probabilities of recording d rubiformis at lower maxent climatic suitability scores scores 0 50 than the models with optimised parameter configurations fig 4 the predicted climatic suitability for d rubiformis across south africa varied depending on the maxent parameter configurations used to calibrate the model fig 5 all maxent models predicted relatively high climatic suitability for d rubiformis in the south west of south africa and in the southern cape region however three out of the four maxent models calibrated with tuned model settings not including the aicc model differed from the default settings model by predicting climatic suitability for d rubiformis along the entire south and east coast of south africa the default model and to a lesser extent the aicc model showed evidence of overfitting to the training data with highly localised predictions of climatic suitability fig 5 3 3 model extrapolation despite the high performance of the maxent models when transferred in space the mess maps indicated that the maxent models were extrapolating climatic suitability scores for d rubiformis over the vast majority of south africa fig 6 a indeed 44 of the 78 field sites surveyed for d rubiformis in south africa occur in geographic regions where the maxent models were extrapolating dasineura rubiformis was recorded at 33 of 34 sites in interpolation 97 and 34 of 44 sites in extrapolation 77 fig 6b we found support that a site being in extrapolation interpolation was a statistically significant predictor of d rubiformis being recorded in south africa χ2 7 28 d f 1 p 0 007 the probability that d rubiformis was recorded increased by 20 for a site in interpolation versus extrapolation 4 discussion species distribution models are important tools to support and guide the development and implementation of environmental policies and management programs addison et al 2013 schuwirth et al 2019 the usefulness of sdm s depends on model performance which is typically measured by the model s ability to correctly predict where a species is established and its capacity to distinguish between sites where the species is established versus a site where the species is absent or assumed to be absent smith et al 2021 however several authors have called in question the usefulness of sdm s notably when models are transferred in space or time yates et al 2018 blasi et al 2021 poor transferability may lead to erroneous model predictions that may have serious negative consequences for the application of the model and resulting policies and management programmes here we report on the validation of maxent models for d rubiformis an insect native to australia that has been intentionally introduced as a biological control agent into south africa to reduce the invasiveness of its host plant a mearnsii impson et al 2013 the availability of independent presence absence testing data from south africa a separate continent to the data used to generate the models australia makes this an ideal study system for assessing the transferability of maxent models this study represents one of only a handful of studies to validate maxent using independent testing data costa et al 2010 rebelo and jones 2010 west et al 2016 smith et al 2021 our results indicated that maxent sdm s were able to provide robust estimates of climatic suitability for d rubiformis in south africa when maxent models calibrated with occurrence records for d rubiformis from australia were projected over south africa they had auc ratios between 1 47 1 70 indicative of high power to discriminate between sites where d rubiformis was recorded in south africa or not additionally we showed that the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa increased with higher maxent climatic suitability scores this result demonstrates the usefulness of the maxent sdm s and that at least for our case study maxent models can be transferred into novel geographic regions and provide valuable information to guide policy making and the development of management programmes the current study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that sdm model complexity affects model performance and transferability when being projected into novel geographic regions while the default maxent model had the high predictive power in the training area australia this model was overfit to the training data warren et al 2014 producing localised suitability scores when transferred over south africa this finding corroborates other studies showing that high predictive power in the model training area is not a guarantee of optimal transferability warren et al 2014 duque lazo et al 2016 models calibrated with optimised parameter configurations produced more consistent and less variable predictions when transferred over south africa in addition our results corroborate previous studies demonstrating that maxent model performance typically improved with regularisation multiplier values greater than 1 the default setting e g radosavljevic and anderson 2014 additionally our results demonstrated that maxent models calibrated with hinge features e g auctest and aucdiff optimised model transferability this result follows the tenet that overly complex models may be overfitted to features of the training data and thus may perform poorly when transferred into novel geographic regions warren et al 2014 low et al 2021 model tuning should be performed to estimate optimal parameter configurations when transferring maxent models in space and or time to maximise their usefulness an additional consideration when predicting into areas or time frames non analogous to those under which the model was calibrated i e extrapolation is the accuracy of those predictions elith et al 2010 mesgaran et al 2014 however the applied use of sdm s in developing environmental policy developing management programmes for invasive species and implementing conservation programmes often necessitate that models are transferred and predictions made even when models are extrapolating elith et al 2010 here we showed that d rubiformis was recorded at many sites 77 in south africa that were outside the range of climate space it occupies in its native range i e extrapolation which was significantly lower than the 97 of sites where the insect was recorded that were classified as being in interpolation the high proportion of sites that d rubiformis was recorded at where the maxent models were in extrapolation clearly demonstrates the importance of leveraging the models power to extrapolate predictions when being transferred although extrapolation from calibrated models is generally not advised applying these models to applications such as forecasting climate change effects and predicting climatic suitability for invasive species will often necessitate that researchers use extrapolation to make predictions from their models as such we echo the recommendations of qiao et al 2019 that environmental similarity between the model calibration area and the transfer region be quantified to assess the uncertainty associated with model transfer and extrapolation and make any interferences with this in mind a number of tools have been developed in recent years to perform these calculations such as mess elith et al 2010 and exdet mesgaran et al 2014 and which should be an integral component of any maxent study given that the d rubiformis maxent models showed high predictive accuracy when transferred in space over south africa and the statistically significant positive correlation between maxent scores and d rubiformis establishment we wish to highlight how these models could be used to guide management programmes or develop environmental policies we selected the auctest model in fig 4b for this illustration because it had the highest predictive performance in south africa fig 3 in fig 4b we can see that when maxent climatic suitability scores are 0 25 the probability that d rubiformis was recorded at a field site in south africa was greater than 75 mass rearing and releasing weed biological control agents is a time consuming and costly endeavour hill et al 2021 as such we could develop a redistribution programme to perform experimental releases of the insects at field sites across south africa that maximise the chances of d rubiformis populations establishing and thus improving the level of control over the invasive weed to do so we could threshold the maxent climatic suitability predictions to indicate regions in south africa where the probability of d rubiformis establishment is greater than 75 i e where maxent scores 0 25 or less than 75 i e where maxent scores 0 25 we arbitrarily chose a threshold for the probability of establishment at 75 as this value represents a significantly better chance of the experimental releases of the insect to be successful and thus provides a reasonable indication of how to justify resource expenditure the resulting map given in fig 7 demonstrates that the south and east coast regions of south africa are climatically suitable for d rubiformis any experimental releases of d rubiformis in the suitable regions indicated on the map would be likely to result in viable populations establishing the redistribution programme would perform as many experimental releases within these suitable regions as possible this example demonstrates a simple statistically validated approach to optimising the redistribution of d rubiformis in south africa these maps provide valuable evidence to present to stakeholders policy makers and funding bodies to justify expenditure in developing environmental management programmes such as biological control programmes 5 conclusions using sdm s to make predictions into novel geographic locations or time periods is an important tool in ecology however this practise has been met with justifiable resilience and concerns over how well these models perform upon transfer in this study we presented a case study demonstrating that maxent sdm s were able to accurately predict the distribution of an australian insect when introduced into south africa our study is one of only a few studies to date validating maxent models using spatially independent data however the accuracy of the maxent models and their climatic suitability projections depended on the parameter configurations i e features classes and regularisation multipliers used to calibrate the models this study demonstrates that maxent models can be useful in predicting where a species may establish even when projected into a novel geographic area but that users need to be aware of how model parameter configurations and model extrapolation can influence model outputs and uncertainty demonstrating how maxent can be useful while communicating uncertainty in their predictions and outputs is essential for building confidence in the use of sdm s blasi et al 2021 we demonstrated how validating predictive models can be used to guide the implementation of a weed biological control programme by optimising the redistribution and experimental releases of d rubiformis in geographic areas that are climatically suitable and where the probability of the insect establishing populations

24347,there are significant social economic and environmental costs related to phytoplankton blooms particularly when they are dominated by cyanobacteria however the climatic physiographic and morphological drivers involved in bloom phenology create complex spatiotemporal patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition making monitoring and forecasting challenging this complexity also limits the ability of process based algorithms to model bloom phenology stochastic approaches and predictive modelling are valuable risk management tools for natural events this paper presents a novel model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton blooms based on environmental covariates namely the physiography and climate descriptors of lake watersheds the goal was to provide a tool to project future scenarios of bloom phenology in response to climate change and anthropogenic developments and to test the efficiency of mitigating approaches specifically we developed a non stationary regional model to estimate the probability of bloom occurrence in 580 lakes in quebec canada and to study the impact of physiographic or climate changes over our reference period and future horizons results show that the regional model is more precise and accurate than local models which are usually used in frequency analyses of extreme values simulations conducted for different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of lake brome indicate a 65 increase in bloom frequency on the horizon of years 2080 2100 the model also evaluates the effects of different environmental disturbances on bloom phenology such as agriculture or settlement increase in the watershed disturbance case studies were carried out on lakes with different trophic levels physiographic and climatic characteristics simulations indicate that bloom frequency in a highly urbanized meso eutrophic lake lake brome and a eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by agriculture missisquoi bay would be more responsive to changes in climate rather than land cover although physiographic disturbances would still generate considerable effects a meso eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by forest lake aylmer would neither respond to increases in agriculture nor settlement but would be most affected by increases in degree days another scenario focused on a highly forested oligo mesotrophic lake lake st jean bloom phenology in this lake was most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use overall these results suggest that lakes with a high level of eutrophication are the least responsive to the pressures resulting from land cover changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae biomass cyanobacteria habs conditional probability density modis spatiotemporal frequency analysis data availability spatiotemporal data of algal blooms phenology in 580 lakes along with 17 physiographic climatic and morphological descriptors of their watersheds original data mendeley data 1 introduction extreme natural events have increased in frequency intensity and duration since the 1950s and this trend is likely to continue in the next decades ipcc 2013 ouranos 2015 these events threaten human well being and affect the availability and quality of surface and underground water sources for example global warming was shown to increase the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms hab a trend that is likely to continue in coming decades ho et al 2019 bartosiewicz et al 2019 this trend is also linked to increasing phosphorus and nitrogen loads in lakes and rivers resulting from increased land use for agriculture and settlement in many regions these changes have been observed in different regions of the world in canada increases in hab events from 1980 to 2018 is available in a dedicated dataset the harmful algal events dataset haedat ho et al 2019 anderson et al 2000 hozumi et al 2020 more than ever public administrations and private sectors need to protect water sources by developing management strategies that minimize risks to public health as well as the economic impact of hab on fisheries and aquaculture the monitoring and treatment of water impacted by habs add to the cost of water management programs ho et al 2019 anderson et al 2000 hozumi et al 2020 climatic physiographic and morphological drivers of bloom phenology can create complex spatial patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition that are challenging to predict monitoring becomes particularly difficult when the biomass is dominated by buoyant cyanobacteria due to their highly variable spatial and temporal distribution hozumi et al 2020 these patterns are difficult to assess by traditional sampling methods which are limited in space and time and on the other hand prediction of bloom phenology requires increasingly complex models accounting for all relevant drivers finally the paucity of data hinders the development of accurate models current phytoplankton phenology models are either process based or statistics based process based approaches describe phytoplankton dynamics using a set of variables such as light temperature nutrients and grazing controlling growth and mortality among others bonnet and poulin bonnet poulin 2004 developed an ecological model describing the thermal and biogeochemical structure of a reservoir to study phytoplankton patterns the links between nutrient loading hydrological conditions and eutrophication were also explored using an ecological model garnier et al 2005 inter annual variability of algal blooms was further investigated using a biogeochemical model janssen et al 2004 while these models can be adaptable to changes in the system and potentially exported to other systems the underlying physicochemical processes must be well understood and accurately described mathematically this is not always the case especially for complex systems therefore process based models often only provide an approximation of natural phenomena hipel 1985 and generally require a high number of variables a major pitfall of this approach relates to the uncertainty of the model which is often not considered in predictions several statistics based models have also been used to define the relationships between phytoplanktonic biomass and environmental variables phytoplankton modeling mainly focussed on temporal trends in chlorophyll a chl a concentrations and their relationships to prevailing environmental conditions like water temperature and nutrient concentrations regression models using in situ data have been developed to define these relationships onderka 2007 liu et al 2013 laanemets et al 2006 hu et al 2009 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 as well as models based on satellite data meris matthews 2014 binding et al 2011 landsat et modis duan et al 2014 for example hu et al hu et al 2009 analysed the relationships between cyanobacteria and environmental variables using the poisson regression multivariate models such as principal component regression have also been used to identify the most important factors controling algal blooms wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 statistics based models of extreme values have the advantage of exploiting historical databases to adjust a probability density function for a given random variable that may or may not be linked to environmental variables for example wang et al wang et al 2011 used copulas to analyse the links between chl a concentration and temperature nutrients and dissolved oxygen on lake wulihu in china most studies focus on the regression analysis of chl a as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass to evaluate the impact of phosphorus nitrogen or temperature changes however the spatiotemporal complexity of blooms and the limited understanding of certain underlying physicochemical processes limit the ability of statistical models to explain and predict the phenomenon in this regard the application of conditional density estimations to model bloom phenology represents an asset for health risk management conditional density estimation typically consists of inferring a conditional probability density p y x based on a set of empirical observations x n y n n 1 n however this approach requires large databases also since frequency analysis a technique used to predict values corresponding to specific return periods or probabilities is often applied locally rousseau et al 2014 chebana ouarda 2021 oubennaceur et al 2021 the adjustment of a probability density function only relies on data obtained from one location e g on a lake or a river related to a meteorological station or a hydrological station large database composed of scalable and transferable ecosystem characteristics are necessary to develop reliable predictions accounting for global warming and other anthropological changes the objective of this study was to develop a regional model using a historical database of bloom phenology in the province of quebec canada to estimate the probability of blooms development based on each lakes physiographic and climatic characteristics earth observation satellite data were used to build the database this model aims at helping water administrators and policy makers identify priority actions and restoration strategies this work builds upon our previous research ratté fortin et al 2020 that led to the identification of potential links between bloom phenology and environmental variables in the model presented here the previously identified relationships ratté fortin et al 2020 are used to guide the selection of the key descriptors used different scenarios of environmental disturbances caused by changing agriculture or settlement on the watershed were tested for their effect on bloom phenology on four lakes in southern quebec 2 proposed approach 2 1 data the lakes studied are located in the province of quebec canada between 45 n and 52 n and 65 w and 80 w fig 1 a database of historical chl a concentrations of 250 m spatial resolution was generated from the modis sensor located on the terra platform of nasa s earth observation system image pre treatment including downscaling projection and atmospheric correction was achieved using a procedure developed by the canadian center for remote sensing trishchenko et al 2006 an estimation algorithm for chl a concentrations based on ensemble methods el alem et al 2019 was then applied to all extracted modis images and areas affected by haze or cloud cover were removed using a cloud mask ratte fortin et al 2018 specifically developed for inland waters lakes rivers estuaries overall chl a concentrations were extracted from 580 lakes of southern quebec between may and october of the years 2000 to 2016 for a total of 1572 images information about uncertainties on the estimation of phytoplankton biomass is available in appendix a of ratté fortin et al ratté fortin et al 2020 an operational biomass threshold of 10 µg chl a l 1 was chosen to define the onset of a bloom and to characterize its phenology in the studied lakes this threshold value corresponds to the lower chl a concentration range associated to the eutrophic lake class 8 25 µg l 1 and to the regulation established by the world health organization world health organization 2003 and the government of quebec ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2015 it is considered that when level 1 threshold is exceeded and biomass becomes dominated by cyanobacteria there is a risk of minor health effects irritation and allergies considering that some data corresponding to cloud masked images are missing phenology here refers to the annual phenology based on cloud free day data at less than 25 coverage when remotely sensed chl a exceeded 10 µg l 1 this provided the annual bloom frequency therefore for each year at study bloom frequency was established as the total number of days when the chl a concentration was above the threshold the boundaries and morphological descriptors of the watersheds area and slope were calculated from the canadian digital elevation model natural resources canada 2015 with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m climate data from north american regional reanalyses mesinger et al 2006 were used with a spatial resolution of approximately 32 km cumulative degree days were calculated by summing the number of degrees above 20 c for each day a value that is considered to be a threshold for cyanobacterial growth dupuis hann 2009 neuheimer taggart 2007 this climate proxy is generally considered valid for phytoplankton growth since the remote sensing approach used here is not specific to cyanobacterial biomass land use data 40 m spatial resolution and agricultural and ecumene data 25 m spatial resolution were provided by natural resources canada natural resources canada 2015 natural resources canada 2016 2 2 regional model our approach is based on the idea that bloom frequency x is a random variable that could be represented by a statistical distribution f x φ where φ are distribution parameters these parameters can be defined as functions of covariates such as temperature c or agricultural areas on the watershed km2 we first postulated that the spatiotemporal hazard of bloom occurrence carries the mark of environmental descriptors which vary in time and space the resulting regional frequency model is non stationary considering that the statistical properties of probability density are not constant in time and space non stationarity can be modelled by linking the statistical properties mean and variance of the probability density to environmental descriptors climate physiography etc that evolve in time and space the distributions tested were lognormal and gamma distributions e g wang et al 2012 ma wang 2018 probability density functions are respectively 1 f l n x μ σ 1 2 π σ 2 x e ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 x 0 2 f g x α β x α 1 e x β α β α x 0 β 0 α 0 the mean e x c and variance v a r x c of bloom frequency are defined as 3 e x c g c 4 v a r x c h c where g c and h c are functions considering stationarity constant case and potential non stationarity linear trend over time and space such that 5 g c 1 1 6 g c 2 a b c 7 h c 1 1 8 h c 2 c d c where p a b c d are the parameters to be defined we considered the non stationarity to be a function of environmental covariate c which represents environmental descriptors of the lakes and watersheds linked with bloom phenology ratté fortin et al ratté fortin et al 2020 characterized the potential links between bloom phenology beginning date frequency intensity and duration and a set of 25 environmental variables physiographic climatic and morphological descriptors known to play a role in bloom development ratté fortin et al 2020 from this study emerged four key descriptors which are degree days above 20 c 1 area of the forest cover 2 cropland area 3 and settlement area 4 in the lake watersheds with pearson correlation r 0 3 p 0 05 these descriptors were used to evaluate a spatiotemporal non stationarity in bloom frequency over the study area canonical correlations analysis cca was used on these selected factors to represent the environmental covariate c reflecting the physiographic and climatic characteristics of the lakes and their watershed 2 3 calibration and validation overall eight models were evaluated for bloom frequency modelling 2 distributions and 2 functional forms each for the mean and variance the best model was selected using the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic parameters were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation method e x c and v a r x c were expressed by functional forms constant case or linear case and the log likelihood function defined as follows 9 l n l p x i c i i 1 n l n f x i p c i z i y i μ c i σ c i the dataset consisted of 8696 observations collected from 580 lakes between 2000 and 2016 the dataset was split into subsamples each one corresponding to lake dataset each lake possesses an ensemble of annual values from 2000 to 2016 of blooms frequency and environmental descriptors of the lake and the watershed subsampling by lake was used to better assess evaluate how models make prediction on lakes that are not included in the calibration dataset two subsets were then formed a training subset which contained 70 of data randomly selected for each stratified dataset and a validation subset containing 30 of data the uncertainty values related to distribution parameter estimates were calculated using the parametric bootstrap procedure the detailed steps for calculating frequency distribution are 1 selecting the model and the functional forms 2 generating 5 000 random frequency observations from bootstraps 3 estimating a set of parameters for each of these synthetic series 4 randomly selecting a set from these 5 000 sets 5 and generating the bloom frequency of return period t using the selected set of parameters and the covariates fig 2 the return period is for example 2 years when calculating the 50th quantile and 20 years when calculating the 95th quantile this process was performed 5 000 times to obtain a distribution of bloom frequency quantile local models were adjusted to specific lakes to compare their performance with the regional model to do so the missisquoi bay of champlain lake and lakes brome aylmer and st jean were selected to analyze water bodies with different trophic levels and different physiographic and climatic characteristics the 8 models were adjusted for each lake database and the best model was selected using the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic table s1 in contrast to regional modelling the environmental covariables used in a local model may only vary over time we first compared typical local models used in frequency analysis where potential non stationarity is defined as a function of time rousseau et al 2014 jalbert et al 2017 2 4 key assumptions this model contains several key assumptions i identically distributed data are assumed to come from the same population and have the same probability of being collected ii independent we used the watershed as a geographical unit the watershed which can be considered as a system is an elementary surface that is hydrologically closed i e no flow enters from the outside and all excess precipitation evaporates or flows through a single section to the outlet the lake from this point of view we assumed that water quality on a specific lake is not explained by another even if it is in close proximity also long range dependence at extreme levels is weak coles et al 2001 so we assumed our data to be independent and identically distributed iii uncorrelated when data are independent then they are also uncorrelated however since we assumed independence we still evaluated correlation we used two tools available from arcgis pro the multi distance spatial cluster analysis tool and the spatial autocorrelation tool results showed that at a distance larger or equal to 10 792 meters the distribution of blooms comes from a random process based on this distance threshold the dataset was filtered before splitting into training and validation declustering iv non stationary a dataset is considered heterogeneous when it describes a phenomenon whose characteristics change over time or in space e g climatic variations physiographic variations changes in measuring equipment in this study we evaluated annual blooms frequency in the context of non stationary process with characteristics changing through space and time so variations in the observed process are modelled coles et al 2001 residuals of the regional model were centred and uniformly spread around the y 0 axis supplementary data sd2 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis fig 3 presents the distribution of lakes centroid over the study area for each lake bloom frequency was calculated annually between 2000 and 2016 fig 4 a and b depict the histogram of bloom frequency and the histogram of the covariate respectively the covariate is obtained from a cca on the environmental descriptors physiographic climatic and morphological descriptors the annual frequency presented an asymmetrical shape distribution fig 4c presents all available values of annual frequency and covariate thinner and less dispersed covariate values are observed as frequencies increase which could be attributed to the difference in data density 3 2 calibration and validation table 1 presents the log likelihood values and the aic and bic criteria obtained from the best regional model and the local models all log likelihood values and the aic and bic criteria from the 8 adjusted models are presented in supplementary data tables sd1 1 and sd1 2 models with a linear mean function and constant variance function correspond to models with the lowest criteria the log normal distribution shows better aic and bic than the gamma distribution fig 5 shows the scatter plots of simulated vs observed annual frequencies with the calibration a and validation b datasets the temporal dynamics following calibration is well represented in general showing average performance criteria for r and rmse of 0 73 and 5 52 respectively as expected the model applied to the validation data set presents a slightly lower fit than when using the training dataset larger differences between expected and simulated frequencies are observed for frequencies 25 days as shown on the corresponding quantile quantile plots fig 5c and fig 5d residuals of the regional model were also computed and showed centred and uniformly spread residuals around the y 0 axis for all c i results are presented in supplementary data sd2 3 3 model comparison the regional model was compared with local models using quantile estimations although it is difficult to quantify the accuracy of a model based on quantile estimations they provide insights on the model performance we compared the 50th annual quantile median of bloom frequency obtained for the regional and local models and compared the results with the mean bloom frequency observed annually for the four selected lakes we used the nonparametric bootstrap method to generate uncertainties around the 50th quantile estimation to capture the uncertainty on model inputs fig 6 compares results from local and regional models obtained on lake brome in 2000 on that year 23 bloom events were observed as shown with the blue lines while the black lines represent the median estimated by both models using 1000 iterations bootstrap for this specific example there is a marked improvement in the precision of the regional model estimate compared to the local model denoted by a smaller range between minimum and maximum value 1 day compared to 15 days for the local model and a smaller standard deviation 0 32 days compared to 2 52 days for the local model regional model also seems to present a higher accuracy when the 50th quantile estimates are compared with the observed mean value smaller bias of 0 47 day compared to 1 17 days for the local model table 2 summarizes the statistical comparison between the models for the four selected lakes overall the regional model remains more precise than local models it also shows slightly lower bias and rmse values than the local models assuming that the estimation accuracy is good these values are illustrative only as the sample size is small 3 4 regional model case studies to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the regional model four case studies are presented using four selected lakes table 3 plus one not included in the calibration dataset lake st charles i simulations of bloom frequency in future horizons of time were calculated using climatic scenarios provided by ouranos emission scenario rcp 4 5 representing a moderate scenario of greenhouse gas emission lake brome was selected for this analysis the degree days above 20 c were calculated using simulated temperatures up to 2100 ii scenarios of land cover disturbances increase in agriculture or settlement land cover were evaluated for the same four lakes selected for the model comparison and described in table 4 iii theoretical mitigation scenarios were presented for missisquoi bay watershed and iv the regional model were finally applied to predict the probability of bloom occurrence in lake st charles a lake that was not included in the calibration dataset because of its size and shape that is not large enough to be observable by the modis sensor the technical characteristics of the four case studies are summarized in table 4 case study 1 simulations of bloom frequency on lake brome for future horizons were calculated using a moderate climate scenario climate data were taken from an ensemble of 24 climate models that simulate temperature for the historical period 1950 2005 and for plausible futures 2006 2100 in response to the moderate greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp 4 5 fig 7 the other environmental descriptors were set constant over time for this specific example fig 8 shows the simulations of annual bloom frequency in lake brome up to 2100 with a clear increase over time for the reference period the lake shows on average 29 annual days with blooms which would increase to 40 days by 2050 2041 2060 and to 48 days by 2090 2081 2100 from this relationship we computed that an annual increase of 10 degree days is required to increment by one day the annual bloom frequency in lake brome case study 2 the effects of three scenarios of changes in land use cover or climate degree days on bloom frequency were tested with the regional model on the four selected lakes fig 9 the scenarios were chosen based on realistic changes at a global scale e g the total cropland area in canada increased by 4 between 2001 and 2016 canada aaa f 2017 according to the regional model the bloom frequency in lake st jean would be more affected by a 5 increase in agriculture or settlement land cover on its watershed rising by 2 2 and 2 8 respectively than in the other lakes below 0 6 bloom frequency in lake brome is the least affected by land cover changes on the other hand an increase of 5 degree days generated important rises in bloom frequency for the four lakes with lake aylmer most responding 3 1 followed by lake st jean missisquoi bay and finally lake brome case study 3 a theoretical mitigation scenario was also tested using the regional model where approximately 1800 ha were converted from cropland soybean crop to forest broadleaf on the missisquoi bay watershed i e cropland changing from 55 to 52 7 with no other change on settlement or degree days table 5 figure s2 presents the land cover change applied under this scenario results indicate that the annual bloom frequency would be reduced by 1 day case study 4 finally we tested the efficiency of the regional model to predict the probability of bloom occurrence in lake st charles a lake that was not included in the calibration dataset because of its size 3 6 km2 not large enough to be well observable by modis sensor this lake is an important drinking water reservoir for the population of quebec city and is closely monitored by the lake s watershed association association pour la protection de l environnement du lac saint charles et des marais du nord 2019 phytoplankton bloom frequency was obtained using shoreline daily observations at 8 specific stations around the lake between may and october from 2010 to 2016 excluding weekends it is only when a bloom was observed at the main station besides the lake outlet near the watershed association office at any given day that the other 7 stations were visited observations were based on the visual detection of green particles and their density in three classes after sampling the water in a transparent container and following the protocol from the quebec environment ministry ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques melcc et conseil régional de l environnement des laurentides cre laurentides 2008 the bloom frequency estimated by the model is compared to the frequency obtained from shoreline observations in fig 10 the two curves present a similar trend with the peaking year of 2012 but the correlation is not significant r 0 47 n 7 p 0 29 the modelled frequency is always larger than the frequency obtained from shoreline observations 19 versus 8 days and it varies less extensively over the 7 documented years cv of 12 as compared to 51 4 discussion the regional model developed in this study allows to estimate the predisposition of lakes in developing blooms based on their physiographic and climatic characteristics it also allows to consider not only the temporal dimension within the variability of the studied phenomenon but also its spatial dimension instead of being limited to observations over a given period on a given site to build a frequency model our approach allows to pool observations from several sites over various periods to build a more accurate and robust frequency model relying on a larger sample size to evaluate the performance of the developed regional model lake brome lake aylmer lake st jean and the missisquoi bay of champlain lake were selected to compare the bloom frequency statistics with results from a local model the regional model captured much more of the spatiotemporal variability in the estimated quantiles improved the precision in the probability of bloom occurrence smaller ranges and standard deviations and apparently improved the estimation accuracy when comparing median quantiles of bloom frequency generally smaller bias and rmse the regional model is thus more accurate and precise in predicting the predisposition of a lake to develop blooms than any local models this could be because it compensates for the lack of data on specific lakes by exploiting the response of lakes for which data are available at the regional scale therefore the regional model allows a more accurate description of a complex phenomenon compared to local models this regional model could also be adapted to any other natural events the regional model was then applied to the same four lakes in response to specific future scenarios simulations of bloom frequency on lake brome in future horizons using a climate projection of surface air temperature until 2100 showed a clear increase in frequency over time by about 18 days over the next 80 years increase in bloom frequency has been observed in many aquatic ecosystems around the globe with responses related to changes in land use precipitations or temperature ho et al 2019 bartosiewicz et al 2019 paerl huisman 2008 beaulieu et al 2013 visser et al 2016 chapra et al 2017 duan et al 2009 ho michalak 2020 weber et al 2020 for example winder et al winder et al 2012 showed that water temperature and light availability played a major role in the development of blooms liu et al liu et al 2013 and hu et al hu et al 2009 also have demonstrated the impact of climatic variables air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction on the development of blooms lake brome has been extensively studied given the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms in the last decades rashidan bird 2001 rolland et al 2005 blin 2009 between 2000 and 2016 the annual bloom frequency increased significantly from 23 to 30 days with maximal intensity reaching 219 μ g chla l 1 on average and with bloom extent often covering the entire surface of the lake using a biomass threshold of 10 μ g l 1 ratté fortin et al 2020 under this context mitigation scenarios could be tested with the regional model to reverse projected trends by targeting the most efficient approaches this is particularly relevant when elected officials disagree on the appropriateness of extending investments to mitigate upward trends climate and land cover change scenarios showed that bloom frequency in lake brome responded the least to rising agriculture or settlements or degree days above 20 c presently this watershed is highly dominated by settlement 19 of the area and moderately by agriculture 3 of the area as compared to the other lakes studied settlement 6 and agriculture 10 except for lake st jean table 2 it is unclear why the lake would not be responding to land cover changes but it may be related to its internal load of phosphorus or to its small watershed 187 km2 that may have reached its buffering capacity as demonstrated for other watersheds in the region goyette et al 2018 projections indicate that lake brome would be more responsive to changes in climate than to changes in land cover 1 3 in bloom frequency for a rise of 5 degree days but still less than the other lakes in the case of bay missisquoi a eutrophic water body with a watershed highly dominated by agriculture 55 settlement 6 trends are the same as for lake brome in terms of the limited effects by physiography and climate disturbances on bloom frequency however a reduction of cropland area on the watershed of this lake scenario 3 still showed a one day reduction in annual bloom frequency the change in watershed land cover implies a reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen loads to the lake the meso eutrophic lake aylmer with a watershed dominated by forest 85 cropland 10 neither responded to increases in agriculture or settlement land use collectively these results suggest that lakes that have already reached a high level of eutrophication might respond the least to rising pressures from land cover changes this could be linked to the influence of internal phosphorus loads markelov et al 2019 on the other hand lake st jean appears to be most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use unlike the other lakes this lake is in the oligo mesotrophic class and has a watershed largely dominated by forest a high sensitivity to changes in land use is expected for this lake presenting a much higher watershed lake area ratio approx 80 as compared to 13 20 for the other 3 lakes for which 5 changes on the watershed would generate significant inputs of nutrients and shifts in phytoplankton growth the lake is also located at higher latitude with a colder climate compared to the other lakes averaged air temperature of 2 8 c compared to 4 2 7 7 c for the other lakes this could potentially explain is larger sensitivity to warming conditions although this lake is less responding than lake aylmer further comparisons in the mixing regime of these lakes could help to better understand these patterns for example using thermal structure modelling in response to climate warming and transparency loss saloranta andersen 2007 bartosiewicz et al 2019 mixing regime and thermocline depth were shown to control primary production through a wide array of mechanisms affecting nutrients light and temperature e g butcher et al 2015 cantin et al 2011 results obtained from the regional model are systematically higher than shoreline based observations made on lake st charles this was expected since the model estimates the frequency of events on the entire lake surface with chl a exceeding 10 μ g l 1 while shoreline observations were only done at specific locations excluding the pelagic area also the sampling stations were visited only when the main station was presenting signs of a bloom likely underestimating the frequency of events moreover shoreline observations were only accounting for green particles visible to the eye following a protocol designed to recognize cyanobacteria ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques melcc et conseil régional de l environnement des laurentides cre laurentides 2008 while increasing eukaryotic biomass could have been overlooked therefore some sections of the lake could have exceeded the threshold without being noticed by anyone while the regional model based on a spatial analysis retrieved from satellite data on 580 lakes was applied on the lake s local conditions for a particular year overcoming sampling issues nevertheless a similar trend was observed between model estimations and in situ observations indicating the potential of the regional model to predict bloom events at a regional scale lake st charles is notably smaller than the lakes used to develop the model and it has a particularly low water residence time that can counteract phytoplanktonic growth association pour la protection de l environnement du lac saint charles et des marais du nord 2019 it is interesting to note that the frequency especially increased during the heatwave year of 2012 bartosiewicz et al 2019 we also note the limited variations in the frequency estimated by the model from 2013 to 2016 apparently linked to similar heating conditions on those years as synthesized by the degree days fig 10 especially since the lake s watershed physiography did not change a lot over this period we also wanted to verify if the model predicted a lower frequency for a year here 2004 that was not specifically flagged as a blooming year blooms started to be mediatized from october 2006 for that lake the regional model predicted 10 days of bloom conditions in 2004 but this could be overestimated as the model tends to overestimate frequencies under 10 days fig 5d although this lower frequency cannot be validated with actual measurements the predicted rise in frequency from 10 days in 2004 to 20 days in 2012 in response to 50 additional degree days 29 vs 78 degree days suggests that lake st charles may be more sensitive to warming than lake brome for example frequency rising by 1 3 for an increase of 5 degree days fig 9 a major obstacle in the validation of model results on any given lake is linked to differing criteria among users in defining a bloom cyanobacterial bloom vs threshold in chl a concentration bloom events vs days above a certain threshold and to spatial and temporal limitations in visual observations of a bloom often circumstantial and based on participative science to assess the accuracy of model predictions validation datasets collected over several years are needed using high frequency monitoring buoys placed in the pelagic area of lakes or high resolution satellite imagery e g ho and michalak ho michalak 2020 until more data are available to validate modelling efforts projections based on regional modelling remain an attractive tool that deserves attention 5 conclusions this paper presents a novel model to estimate conditional density of natural events based on environmental covariates we applied the model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton bloom frequency in lakes based on watershed physiography and climate properties it was developed from a large data set on phytoplankton bloom phenology on 580 eastern canadian lakes generated from satellite imagery this model allows to explicitly estimate i the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms based on environmental descriptors only ii the probability of bloom occurrence in a lake for which only data on the characteristics of its watershed are available and little or no data exist on the historical occurrence of blooms iii the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms for lakes that are not calibrated or not observable by satellite sensor because of their shape and size and iv the potential impact on lake ecosystems of climatic projections or anthropogenic variations in their watershed the model applied to four lakes of different trophic status suggests that climate would most impact lake aylmer with a watershed dominated by forest while the large lake st jean would rather be affected by land use changes results showed the potential increase in bloom frequency by 18 days over the next 80 years in lake brome located in an urbanized area and already highly impacted by blooms the model developed is a promising tool to project future changes in bloom phenology and test mitigating scenarios for specific lakes based on the response of lakes at the regional scale credit

24347,there are significant social economic and environmental costs related to phytoplankton blooms particularly when they are dominated by cyanobacteria however the climatic physiographic and morphological drivers involved in bloom phenology create complex spatiotemporal patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition making monitoring and forecasting challenging this complexity also limits the ability of process based algorithms to model bloom phenology stochastic approaches and predictive modelling are valuable risk management tools for natural events this paper presents a novel model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton blooms based on environmental covariates namely the physiography and climate descriptors of lake watersheds the goal was to provide a tool to project future scenarios of bloom phenology in response to climate change and anthropogenic developments and to test the efficiency of mitigating approaches specifically we developed a non stationary regional model to estimate the probability of bloom occurrence in 580 lakes in quebec canada and to study the impact of physiographic or climate changes over our reference period and future horizons results show that the regional model is more precise and accurate than local models which are usually used in frequency analyses of extreme values simulations conducted for different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of lake brome indicate a 65 increase in bloom frequency on the horizon of years 2080 2100 the model also evaluates the effects of different environmental disturbances on bloom phenology such as agriculture or settlement increase in the watershed disturbance case studies were carried out on lakes with different trophic levels physiographic and climatic characteristics simulations indicate that bloom frequency in a highly urbanized meso eutrophic lake lake brome and a eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by agriculture missisquoi bay would be more responsive to changes in climate rather than land cover although physiographic disturbances would still generate considerable effects a meso eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by forest lake aylmer would neither respond to increases in agriculture nor settlement but would be most affected by increases in degree days another scenario focused on a highly forested oligo mesotrophic lake lake st jean bloom phenology in this lake was most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use overall these results suggest that lakes with a high level of eutrophication are the least responsive to the pressures resulting from land cover changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae biomass cyanobacteria habs conditional probability density modis

original data mendeley data 1 introduction extreme natural events have increased in frequency intensity and duration since the 1950s and this trend is likely to continue in the next decades ipcc 2013 ouranos 2015 these events threaten human well being and affect the availability and quality of surface and underground water sources for example global warming was shown to increase the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms hab a trend that is likely to continue in coming decades ho et al 2019 bartosiewicz et al 2019 this trend is also linked to increasing phosphorus and nitrogen loads in lakes and rivers resulting from increased land use for agriculture and settlement in many regions these changes have been observed in different regions of the world in canada increases in hab

private sectors need to protect water sources by developing management strategies that minimize risks to public health as well as the economic impact of hab on fisheries and aquaculture the monitoring and treatment of water impacted by habs add to the cost of water management programs ho et al 2019 anderson et al 2000 hozumi et al 2020 climatic physiographic and morphological drivers of bloom phenology can create complex spatial patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition that are challenging to predict monitoring becomes particularly difficult when the biomass is dominated by buoyant cyanobacteria due to their highly variable spatial and temporal distribution hozumi et al 2020 these patterns are difficult to assess by traditional sampling methods which are limited in space and time and on the other hand prediction of bloom phenology requires increasingly complex models accounting for all relevant drivers finally the paucity of data hinders the development of accurate models current phytoplankton phenology models are either process based or statistics based process based approaches describe phytoplankton dynamics using a set of variables such as light temperature nutrients and grazing controlling growth and mortality among others bonnet and poulin bonnet poulin 2004 developed an ecological model describing the thermal and biogeochemical structure of a reservoir to study phytoplankton patterns the links between nutrient loading hydrological conditions and eutrophication were also explored using an ecological model garnier et al 2005 inter annual variability of algal blooms was further investigated using a biogeochemical model janssen et al 2004 while these models can be adaptable to changes in the system and potentially exported to other systems the underlying physicochemical processes must be well understood and accurately described mathematically this is not always the case especially for complex systems therefore process based models often only provide an approximation of natural phenomena hipel 1985 and generally require a high number of variables a major pitfall of this approach relates to the uncertainty of the model which is often not considered in predictions several statistics based models have also been used to define the relationships between phytoplanktonic biomass and environmental variables phytoplankton modeling mainly focussed on temporal trends in chlorophyll a chl a concentrations and their relationships to prevailing environmental conditions like water temperature and nutrient concentrations regression models using in situ data have been developed to define these relationships onderka 2007 liu et al 2013 laanemets et al 2006 hu et al 2009 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 as well as models based on satellite data meris matthews 2014 binding et al 2011 landsat et modis duan et al 2014 for example hu et al hu et al 2009 analysed the relationships between cyanobacteria and environmental variables using the poisson regression multivariate models such as principal component regression have also been used to identify the most important factors controling algal blooms wang et al 2007

be linked to environmental variables for example wang et al wang et al 2011 used copulas to analyse the links between chl a concentration and temperature nutrients and dissolved oxygen on lake wulihu in china most studies focus on the regression analysis of chl a as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass to evaluate the impact of phosphorus nitrogen or temperature changes however the spatiotemporal complexity of blooms and the limited understanding of certain underlying physicochemical processes limit the ability of statistical models to explain and predict the phenomenon in this regard the application of conditional density estimations to model bloom phenology represents an asset for health risk management conditional density estimation typically consists of inferring a conditional probability density p y x based on a set of empirical observations x n y n n 1 n however this approach requires large databases also since frequency analysis a technique used to predict values corresponding to specific return periods or probabilities is often applied locally rousseau et al 2014 chebana ouarda 2021 oubennaceur et al 2021 the adjustment of a probability density function only relies on data obtained from one location e g on a lake or a river related to a meteorological station or a hydrological station large database composed of scalable and transferable ecosystem characteristics are necessary to develop reliable predictions accounting for global warming and other anthropological changes the objective of this study was to develop a regional model using a historical database of bloom phenology in the province of quebec canada to estimate the probability of blooms development based on each lakes physiographic and climatic characteristics earth observation satellite data were used to build the database this model aims at helping water administrators and policy makers identify priority actions and restoration strategies this work builds upon our previous research ratté fortin et al 2020 that led to the identification of potential links between bloom phenology and environmental variables in the model presented here the previously identified relationships ratté fortin et al 2020 are used to guide the selection of the key descriptors used different scenarios of environmental disturbances caused by changing agriculture or settlement on the watershed were tested for their effect on bloom phenology on four lakes in southern quebec 2 proposed approach 2 1 data the lakes studied are located in the province of quebec canada between 45 n and 52 n and 65 w and 80 w fig 1 a database of historical chl a concentrations of 250 m spatial resolution was generated from the modis sensor located on the terra platform of nasa s earth observation system image pre treatment including downscaling projection and atmospheric correction was achieved using a procedure developed by the canadian center for remote sensing trishchenko et al 2006 an estimation algorithm for chl a concentrations based on ensemble methods el alem et al 2019 was then applied to all extracted modis images and areas affected by haze or cloud cover were removed using a cloud mask ratte fortin et al 2018 specifically developed for inland waters lakes rivers estuaries overall chl a concentrations were extracted from 580 lakes of southern quebec between may and october of the years 2000 to 2016 for a total of 1572 images information about uncertainties on the estimation of phytoplankton biomass is available in appendix a of ratté fortin et al ratté fortin et al 2020 an operational biomass threshold of 10 µg chl a l 1 was chosen to define the onset of a bloom and to characterize its phenology in the studied lakes this threshold value corresponds to the lower chl a concentration range associated to the eutrophic lake class 8 25 µg l 1 and to the regulation established by the world health organization world health organization 2003 and the government of quebec ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2015 it is considered that when level 1 threshold is exceeded and biomass becomes dominated by cyanobacteria there is a risk of minor health effects irritation and allergies considering that some data corresponding to cloud masked images are missing phenology here refers to the annual phenology based on cloud free day data at less than 25 coverage when remotely sensed chl a exceeded 10 µg l 1 this provided the annual bloom frequency therefore for each year at study bloom frequency was established as the total number of days when the chl a concentration was above the threshold the boundaries and morphological descriptors of the watersheds area and slope were calculated from the canadian digital elevation model natural resources canada 2015 with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m climate data from north american regional reanalyses mesinger et al 2006 were used with a spatial resolution of approximately 32 km cumulative degree days were calculated by summing the number of degrees above 20 c for each day a value that is considered to be a threshold for cyanobacterial growth dupuis hann 2009 neuheimer taggart 2007 this climate proxy is generally considered valid for phytoplankton growth since the remote sensing approach used here is not specific to cyanobacterial biomass land use data 40 m spatial resolution and agricultural and ecumene data 25 m spatial resolution were provided by natural resources canada natural resources canada 2015 natural resources canada 2016 2 2 regional model our approach is based on the idea that bloom frequency x is a random variable that could be represented by a statistical distribution f x φ where φ are distribution parameters these parameters can be defined as functions of covariates such as temperature c or agricultural areas on the watershed km2 we first postulated that the spatiotemporal hazard of bloom occurrence carries the mark of environmental descriptors which vary in time and space the resulting regional frequency model is non stationary considering that the statistical properties of probability density are not constant in time and space non stationarity can be modelled by linking the statistical properties mean and variance of the probability density to environmental descriptors climate physiography etc that evolve in time and space the distributions tested were lognormal and gamma distributions e g wang et al 2012 ma wang 2018 probability density functions are respectively 1 f l n x μ σ 1 2 π σ 2 x e ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 x 0 2 f g x α β x α 1 e x β α β α x 0 β 0 α 0 the mean e x c and variance v a r x c of bloom frequency are defined as 3 e x c g c 4 v a r x c h c where g c and h c are functions considering stationarity constant case and potential non stationarity linear trend over time and space such that 5 g c 1 1 6 g c 2 a b c 7 h c 1 1 8 h c 2 c d c where p a b c d are the parameters to be defined we considered the non stationarity to be a function of environmental covariate c which represents environmental descriptors of the lakes and watersheds linked with bloom phenology ratté fortin et al ratté fortin et al 2020 characterized the potential links between bloom phenology beginning date frequency intensity and duration and a set of 25 environmental variables physiographic climatic and morphological descriptors known to play a role in bloom development ratté fortin et al 2020 from this study emerged four key descriptors which are degree days above 20 c 1 area of the forest cover 2 cropland area 3 and settlement area 4 in the lake watersheds with pearson correlation r 0 3 p 0 05 these descriptors were used to evaluate a spatiotemporal non stationarity in bloom frequency over the study area canonical correlations analysis cca was used on these selected factors to represent the environmental covariate c reflecting the physiographic and climatic characteristics of the lakes and their watershed 2 3 calibration and validation overall eight models were evaluated for bloom frequency modelling 2 distributions and 2 functional forms each for the mean and variance the best model was selected using the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic parameters were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation method e x c and v a r x c were expressed by functional forms constant case or linear case and the log likelihood function defined as follows 9 l n l p x i c i i 1 n l n f x i p c i z i y i μ c i σ c i the dataset consisted of 8696 observations collected from 580 lakes between 2000 and 2016 the dataset was split into subsamples each one corresponding to lake dataset each lake possesses an ensemble of annual values from 2000 to 2016 of blooms frequency and environmental descriptors of the lake and the watershed subsampling by lake was used to better assess evaluate how models make prediction on lakes that are not included in the calibration dataset two subsets were then formed a training subset which contained 70 of data randomly selected for each stratified dataset and a validation subset containing 30 of data the uncertainty values related to distribution parameter estimates were calculated using the parametric bootstrap procedure the detailed steps for calculating frequency distribution are 1 selecting the model and the functional forms 2 generating 5 000 random frequency observations from bootstraps 3 estimating a set of parameters for each of these synthetic series 4 randomly selecting a set from these 5 000 sets 5 and generating the bloom frequency of return period t using the selected set of parameters and the covariates fig 2 the return period is for example 2 years when calculating the 50th quantile and 20 years when calculating the 95th quantile this process was performed 5 000 times to obtain a distribution of bloom frequency quantile local models were adjusted to specific lakes to compare their performance with the regional model to do so the missisquoi bay of champlain lake and lakes brome aylmer and st jean were selected to analyze water bodies with different trophic levels and different physiographic and climatic characteristics the 8 models were adjusted for each lake database and the best model was selected using the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic table s1 in contrast to regional modelling the environmental covariables used in a local model may only vary over time we first compared typical local models used in frequency analysis where potential non stationarity is defined as a function of time rousseau et al 2014 jalbert et al 2017 2 4 key assumptions this model contains several key assumptions i identically distributed data are assumed to come from the same population and have the same probability of being collected ii independent we used the watershed as a geographical unit the watershed which can be considered as a system is an elementary surface that is hydrologically closed i e no flow enters from the outside and all excess precipitation evaporates or flows through a single section to the outlet the lake from this point of view we assumed that water quality on a specific lake is not explained by another even if it is in close proximity also long range dependence at extreme levels is weak coles et al 2001 so we assumed our data to be independent and identically distributed iii uncorrelated when data are independent then they are also uncorrelated however since we assumed independence we still evaluated correlation we used two tools available from arcgis pro the multi distance spatial cluster analysis tool and the spatial autocorrelation tool results showed that at a distance larger or equal to 10 792 meters the distribution of blooms comes from a random process based on this distance threshold the dataset was filtered before splitting into training and validation declustering iv non stationary a dataset is considered heterogeneous when it describes a phenomenon whose characteristics change over time or in space e g climatic variations physiographic variations changes in measuring equipment in this study we evaluated annual blooms frequency in the context of non stationary process with characteristics changing through space and time so variations in the observed process are modelled coles et al 2001 residuals of the regional model were centred and uniformly spread around the y 0 axis supplementary data sd2 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis fig 3 presents the distribution of lakes centroid over the study area for each lake bloom frequency was calculated annually between 2000 and 2016 fig 4 a and b depict the histogram of bloom frequency and the histogram of the covariate respectively the covariate is obtained from a cca on the environmental descriptors physiographic climatic and morphological descriptors the annual frequency presented an asymmetrical shape distribution fig 4c presents all available values of annual frequency and covariate thinner and less dispersed covariate values are observed as frequencies increase which could be attributed to the difference in data density 3 2 calibration and validation table 1 presents the log likelihood values and the aic and bic criteria obtained from the best regional model and the local models all log likelihood values and the aic and bic criteria from the 8 adjusted models are presented in supplementary data tables sd1 1 and sd1 2 models with a linear mean function and constant variance function correspond to models with the lowest criteria the log normal distribution shows better aic and bic than the gamma distribution fig 5 shows the scatter plots of simulated vs observed annual frequencies with the calibration a and validation b datasets the temporal dynamics following calibration is well represented in general showing average performance criteria for r and rmse of 0 73 and 5 52 respectively as expected the model applied to the validation data set presents a slightly lower fit than when using the training dataset larger differences between expected and simulated frequencies are observed for frequencies 25 days as shown on the corresponding quantile quantile plots fig 5c and fig 5d residuals of the regional model were also computed and showed centred and uniformly spread residuals around the y 0 axis for all c i results are presented in supplementary data sd2 3 3 model comparison the regional model was compared with local models using quantile estimations although it is difficult to quantify the accuracy of a model based on quantile estimations they provide insights on the model performance we compared the 50th annual quantile median of bloom frequency obtained for the regional and local models and compared the results with the mean bloom frequency observed annually for the four selected lakes we used the nonparametric bootstrap method to generate uncertainties around the 50th quantile estimation to capture the uncertainty on model inputs fig 6 compares results from local and regional models obtained on lake brome in 2000 on that year 23 bloom events were observed as shown with the blue lines while the black lines represent the median estimated by both models using 1000 iterations bootstrap for this specific example there is a marked improvement in the precision of the regional model estimate compared to the local model denoted by a smaller range between minimum and maximum value 1 day compared to 15 days for the local model and a smaller standard deviation 0 32 days compared to 2 52 days for the local model regional model also seems to present a higher accuracy when the 50th quantile estimates are compared with the observed mean value smaller bias of 0 47 day compared to 1 17 days for the local model table 2 summarizes the statistical comparison between the models for the four selected lakes overall the regional model remains more precise than local models it also shows slightly lower bias and rmse values than the local models assuming that the estimation accuracy is good these values are illustrative only as the sample size is small 3 4 regional model case studies to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the regional model four case studies are presented using four selected lakes table 3 plus one not included in the calibration dataset lake st charles i simulations of bloom frequency in future horizons of time were calculated using climatic scenarios provided by ouranos emission scenario rcp 4 5 representing a moderate scenario of greenhouse gas emission lake brome was selected for this analysis the degree days above 20 c were calculated using simulated temperatures up to 2100 ii scenarios of land cover disturbances increase in agriculture or settlement land cover were evaluated for the same four lakes selected for the model comparison and described in table 4 iii theoretical mitigation scenarios were presented for missisquoi bay watershed and iv the regional model were finally applied to predict the probability of bloom occurrence in lake st charles a lake that was not included in the calibration dataset because of its size and shape that is not large enough to be observable by the modis sensor the technical characteristics of the four case studies are summarized in table 4 case study 1 simulations of bloom frequency on lake brome for future horizons were calculated using a moderate climate scenario climate data were taken from an ensemble of 24 climate models that simulate temperature for the historical period 1950 2005 and for plausible futures 2006 2100 in response to the moderate greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp 4 5 fig 7 the other environmental descriptors were set constant over time for this specific example fig 8 shows the simulations of annual bloom frequency in lake brome up to 2100 with a clear increase over time for the reference period the lake shows on average 29 annual days with blooms which would increase to 40 days by 2050 2041 2060 and to 48 days by 2090 2081 2100 from this relationship we computed that an annual increase of 10 degree days is required to increment by one day the annual bloom frequency in lake brome case study 2 the effects of three scenarios of changes in land use cover or climate degree days on bloom frequency were tested with the regional model on the four selected lakes fig 9 the scenarios were chosen based on realistic changes at a global scale e g the total cropland area in canada increased by 4 between 2001 and 2016 canada aaa f 2017 according to the regional model the bloom frequency in lake st jean would be more affected by a 5 increase in agriculture or settlement land cover on its watershed rising by 2 2 and 2 8 respectively than in the other lakes below 0 6 bloom frequency in lake brome is the least affected by land cover changes on the other hand an increase of 5 degree days generated important rises in bloom frequency for the four lakes with lake aylmer most responding 3 1 followed by lake st jean missisquoi bay and finally lake brome case study 3 a theoretical mitigation scenario was also tested using the regional model where approximately 1800 ha were converted from cropland soybean crop to forest broadleaf on the missisquoi bay watershed i e cropland changing from 55 to 52 7 with no other change on settlement or degree days table 5 figure s2 presents the land cover change applied under this scenario results indicate that the annual bloom frequency would be reduced by 1 day case study 4 finally we tested the efficiency of the regional model to predict the probability of bloom occurrence in lake st charles a lake that was not included in the calibration dataset because of its size 3 6 km2 not large enough to be well observable by modis sensor this lake is an important drinking water reservoir for the population of quebec city and is closely monitored by the lake s watershed association association pour la protection de l environnement du lac saint charles et des marais du nord 2019 phytoplankton bloom frequency was obtained using shoreline daily observations at 8 specific stations around the lake between may and october from 2010 to 2016 excluding weekends it is only when a bloom was observed at the main station besides the lake outlet near the watershed association office at any given day that the other 7 stations were visited observations were based on the visual detection of green particles and their density in three classes after sampling the water in a transparent container and following the protocol from the quebec environment ministry ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques melcc et conseil régional de l environnement des laurentides cre laurentides 2008 the bloom frequency estimated by the model is compared to the frequency obtained from shoreline observations in fig 10 the two curves present a similar trend with the peaking year of 2012 but the correlation is not significant r 0 47 n 7 p 0 29 the modelled frequency is always larger than the frequency obtained from shoreline observations 19 versus 8 days and it varies less extensively over the 7 documented years cv of 12 as compared to 51 4 discussion the regional model developed in this study allows to estimate the predisposition of lakes in developing blooms based on their physiographic and climatic characteristics it also allows to consider not only the temporal dimension within the variability of the studied phenomenon but also its spatial dimension instead of being limited to observations over a given period on a given site to build a frequency model our approach allows to pool observations from several sites over various periods to build a more accurate and robust frequency model relying on a larger sample size to evaluate the performance of the developed regional model lake brome lake aylmer lake st jean and the missisquoi bay of champlain lake were selected to compare the bloom frequency statistics with results from a local model the regional model captured much more of the spatiotemporal variability in the estimated quantiles improved the precision in the probability of bloom occurrence smaller ranges and standard deviations and apparently improved the estimation accuracy when comparing median quantiles of bloom frequency generally smaller bias and rmse the regional model is thus more accurate and precise in predicting the predisposition of a lake to develop blooms than any local models this could be because it compensates for the lack of data on specific lakes by exploiting the response of lakes for which data are available at the regional scale therefore the regional model allows a more accurate description of a complex phenomenon compared to local models this regional model could also be adapted to any other natural events the regional model was then applied to the same four lakes in response to specific future scenarios simulations of bloom frequency on lake brome in future horizons using a climate projection of surface air temperature until 2100 showed a clear increase in frequency over time by about 18 days over the next 80 years increase in bloom frequency has been observed in many aquatic ecosystems around the globe with responses related to changes in land use precipitations or temperature ho et al 2019 bartosiewicz et al 2019 paerl huisman 2008 beaulieu et al 2013 visser et al 2016 chapra et al 2017 duan et al 2009 ho michalak 2020 weber et al 2020 for example winder et al winder et al 2012 showed that water temperature and light availability played a major role in the development of blooms liu et al liu et al 2013 and hu et al hu et al 2009 also have demonstrated the impact of climatic variables air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction on the development of blooms lake brome has been extensively studied given the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms in the last decades rashidan bird 2001 rolland et al 2005 blin 2009 between 2000 and 2016 the annual bloom frequency increased significantly from 23 to 30 days with maximal intensity reaching 219 μ g chla l 1 on average and with bloom extent often covering the entire surface of the lake using a biomass threshold of 10 μ g l 1 ratté fortin et al 2020 under this context mitigation scenarios could be tested with the regional model to reverse projected trends by targeting the most efficient approaches this is particularly relevant when elected officials disagree on the appropriateness of extending investments to mitigate upward trends climate and land cover change scenarios showed that bloom frequency in lake brome responded the least to rising agriculture or settlements or degree days above 20 c presently this watershed is highly dominated by settlement 19 of the area and moderately by agriculture 3 of the area as compared to the other lakes studied settlement 6 and agriculture 10 except for lake st jean table 2 it is unclear why the lake would not be responding to land cover changes but it may be related to its internal load of phosphorus or to its small watershed 187 km2 that may have reached its buffering capacity as demonstrated for other watersheds in the region goyette et al 2018 projections indicate that lake brome would be more responsive to changes in climate than to changes in land cover 1 3 in bloom frequency for a rise of 5 degree days but still less than the other lakes in the case of bay missisquoi a eutrophic water body with a watershed highly dominated by agriculture 55 settlement 6 trends are the same as for lake brome in terms of the limited effects by physiography and climate disturbances on bloom frequency however a reduction of cropland area on the watershed of this lake scenario 3 still showed a one day reduction in annual bloom frequency the change in watershed land cover implies a reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen loads to the lake the meso eutrophic lake aylmer with a watershed dominated by forest 85 cropland 10 neither responded to increases in agriculture or settlement land use collectively these results suggest that lakes that have already reached a high level of eutrophication might respond the least to rising pressures from land cover changes this could be linked to the influence of internal phosphorus loads markelov et al 2019 on the other hand lake st jean appears to be most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use unlike the other lakes this lake is in the oligo mesotrophic class and has a watershed largely dominated by forest a high sensitivity to changes in land use is expected for this lake presenting a much higher watershed lake area ratio approx 80 as compared to 13 20 for the other 3 lakes for which 5 changes on the watershed would generate significant inputs of nutrients and shifts in phytoplankton growth the lake is also located at higher latitude with a colder climate compared to the other lakes averaged air temperature of 2 8 c compared to 4 2 7 7 c for the other lakes this could potentially explain is larger sensitivity to warming conditions although this lake is less responding than lake aylmer further comparisons in the mixing regime of these lakes could help to better understand these patterns for example using thermal structure modelling in response to climate warming and transparency loss saloranta andersen 2007 bartosiewicz et al 2019 mixing regime and thermocline depth were shown to control primary production through a wide array of mechanisms affecting nutrients light and temperature e g butcher et al 2015 cantin et al 2011 results obtained from the regional model are systematically higher than shoreline based observations made on lake st charles this was expected since the model estimates the frequency of events on the entire lake surface with chl a exceeding 10 μ g l 1 while shoreline observations were only done at specific locations excluding the pelagic area also the sampling stations were visited only when the main station was presenting signs of a bloom likely underestimating the frequency of events moreover shoreline observations were only accounting for green particles visible to the eye following a protocol designed to recognize cyanobacteria ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques melcc et conseil régional de l environnement des laurentides cre laurentides 2008 while increasing eukaryotic biomass could have been overlooked therefore some sections of the lake could have exceeded the threshold without being noticed by anyone while the regional model based on a spatial analysis retrieved from satellite data on 580 lakes was applied on the lake s local conditions for a particular year overcoming sampling issues nevertheless a similar trend was observed between model estimations and in situ observations indicating the potential of the regional model to predict bloom events at a regional scale lake st charles is notably smaller than the lakes used to develop the model and it has a particularly low water residence time that can counteract phytoplanktonic growth association pour la protection de l environnement du lac saint charles et des marais du nord 2019 it is interesting to note that the frequency especially increased during the heatwave year of 2012 bartosiewicz et al 2019 we also note the limited variations in the frequency estimated by the model from 2013 to 2016 apparently linked to similar heating conditions on those years as synthesized by the degree days fig 10 especially since the lake s watershed physiography did not change a lot over this period we also wanted to verify if the model predicted a lower frequency for a year here 2004 that was not specifically flagged as a blooming year blooms started to be mediatized from october 2006 for that lake the regional model predicted 10 days of bloom conditions in 2004 but this could be overestimated as the model tends to overestimate frequencies under 10 days fig 5d although this lower frequency cannot be validated with actual measurements the predicted rise in frequency from 10 days in 2004 to 20 days in 2012 in response to 50 additional degree days 29 vs 78 degree days suggests that lake st charles may be more sensitive to warming than lake brome for example frequency rising by 1 3 for an increase of 5 degree days fig 9 a major obstacle in the validation of model results on any given lake is linked to differing criteria among users in defining a bloom cyanobacterial bloom vs threshold in chl a concentration bloom events vs days above a certain threshold and to spatial and temporal limitations in visual observations of a bloom often circumstantial and based on participative science to assess the accuracy of model predictions validation datasets collected over several years are needed using high frequency monitoring buoys placed in the pelagic area of lakes or high resolution satellite imagery e g ho and michalak ho michalak 2020 until more data are available to validate modelling efforts projections based on regional modelling remain an attractive tool that deserves attention 5 conclusions this paper presents a novel model to estimate conditional density of natural events based on environmental covariates we applied the model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton bloom frequency in lakes based on watershed physiography and climate properties it was developed from a large data set on phytoplankton bloom phenology on 580 eastern canadian lakes generated from satellite imagery this model allows to explicitly estimate i the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms based on environmental descriptors only ii the probability of bloom occurrence in a lake for which only data on the characteristics of its watershed are available and little or no data exist on the historical occurrence of blooms iii the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms for lakes that are not calibrated or not observable by satellite sensor because of their shape and size and iv the potential impact on lake ecosystems of climatic projections or anthropogenic variations in their watershed the model applied to four lakes of different trophic status suggests that climate would most impact lake aylmer with a watershed dominated by forest while the large lake st jean would rather be affected by land use changes results showed the potential increase in bloom frequency by 18 days over the next 80 years in lake brome located in an urbanized area and already highly impacted by blooms the model developed is a promising tool to project future changes in bloom phenology and test mitigating scenarios for specific lakes based on the response of lakes at the regional scale credit

24348,afforestation of unproductive or currently non forested territories can increase carbon land sinks and thus contribute to mitigate climate change however investments on large scale afforestation could be risky because of the predicted effect of climate change on forest productivity of newly created plantations the aim of this study was to assess the carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of afforestation scenarios with different species picea mariana picea glauca pinus banksiana pinus resinosa and populus spp on open woodlands and abandoned farmlands in the province of quebec canada under different radiative forcing projections we modelled carbon dynamics in these lands under three representative concentration pathways projections rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over the 2021 2100 period the forest gap model picus was used to model tree growth of afforested species as a function of the representative concentration pathways 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 these data were then used as input in the carbon budget model canadian forest sector 3 to simulate the evolution of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes as a function of forest management and climate carbon transfer to harvested wood products and carbon fluxes associated with product life cycles and substitution effects on markets were also included in the analyses results showed that pinus species responded more strongly to variations in radiative forcing than for the other simulated species overall aboveground biomass was particularly altered by increased radiative forcing which in turn reduced harvesting yield and transfers to wood processing and products at the end of the simulation despite the expected impacts of radiative forcing on ecosystems afforestation scenarios on open woodlands with black spruce white spruce and jack pine can deliver carbon mitigation of 32 70 over the baseline scenario and 4 12 for red pine on abandoned farmlands and hence contribute to efforts to reduce ghg emissions especially over the long term although climate change is expected to impact the growth of newly planted areas as part of afforestation efforts the results of our study suggest that the choice of species to plant and the selected forest management strategy have a greater impact on carbon stocks than climate change itself this study provides a better understanding of the dynamics of afforestation under climate change and whether investments in plantation can contribute to ghg reduction targets keywords plantation climate change carbon sequestration open woodlands abandoned farmlands harvested wood products

introduction the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases ghg are known to significantly modify the climate system with consequences on ecosystems intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 for instance the global increase of mean temperature caused by ghg emissions over the last century has been accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts and precipitation events hoegh guldberg et al 2018 allen et al 2015 there also has been documented evidence of the impacts of climate change on forest productivity boisvenue and running 2006 notably through effects on the physiology and phenology of individual tree species and their capacity to grow and regenerate boulanger et al 2018 climate drivers i e temperature radiation and water are the main abiotic factors that drive primary production boisvenue and running 2006 a minor increase in temperature i e 1 c 2 c can lead to an increase in forest growth rate and thus forest productivity and carbon sequestration on the other hand a higher increase of temperature 2 c can lead to an overall growth decline due to a higher mortality and a lower capacity to regenerate boulanger et al 2018 d orangeville et al 2018 forest management and wood supply are dependent on forest productivity anticipated changes in aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease in wood availability and thus impact the forest sector brecka et al 2020 climate induced changes in the dynamics of natural disturbances can also alter the capacity of carbon sinks of forests kurz et al 2013 anderegg et al 2013 maintaining or increasing carbon sequestration and storage in forests as encouraged by the paris agreement can therefore be challenging under a changing climate in fact forest areas previously known as sinks can become carbon sources causing emissions that can thwart ghg reduction strategies in other sectors smith et al 2011 warren 2011 afforestation and reforestation are recognized as a climate change mitigation tool that enhances carbon sinks since it creates or re establishes forested areas forest management and the use of harvested wood products hwps can also increase carbon sequestration and storage especially when harvested biomass is transformed into long lived wood products and substitute ghg intensive materials or energy sources drever et al 2021 magnus et al 2021 ménard et al 2022 for example the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation has been estimated for non forested boreal areas such as open woodlands poorly regenerated burns and abandoned farmlands in canada drever et al 2021 ménard et al 2022 boucher et al 2012 dufour et al 2016 however there may be uncertainties to implement such a strategy because of the rapidly changing climate that drives ecosystem dynamics hobbs et al 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 and the effects of these variations on forest carbon sinks kurz et al 2013 valade et al 2017 the aim of this study was to estimate the carbon sequestration and the mitigation effect potentials of afforestation of unproductive non forested lands in the context of climate change boreal open woodlands and abandoned agricultural lands in quebec canada were used as case studies and a multi model approach was used to assess climate change mitigation potential of afforestation scenarios first the process based and climate sensitive picus model was used to produce yield curves according to a climate change gradient the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector v 3 cbm cfs3 was then used to model afforestation scenarios at a stand scale and to test a portfolio of forest management and species choices for plantation relative to a baseline reference scenario without afforestation carbon stored in harvested wood products was also taken into consideration using a modified version of the carbon budget model harvested wood products cbm hwp of the canadian forest service as well as the emission mitigation through product substitution on markets following the conceptual framework of smyth et al 2014 2 methods 2 1 study areas baseline scenarios and afforestation scenarios two types of land were used in this study as afforestation opportunities in quebec fig 1 i e boreal open woodlands and abandoned farmlands the two types of land qualify for afforestation under the additionality criterion of climate change mitigation activities richards and huebner 2012 open woodlands are lands that have been devoid of a productive forest stand for more than 50 years in quebec most of the open woodlands are located in the boreal black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain and are mostly the result of regeneration accidents following successive wildfires jasinski and payette 2005 open woodlands situated in this bioclimatic domain cover about 1 3 million ha of the continuous boreal forest in the province of québec according to the 4th quebec s decennial forest inventory there is presently no evidence of natural re densification of open woodlands and afforestation is the only known mechanism that can lead to a closed crown forest structure boucher et al 2012 jasinski and payette 2005 according to the provincial ecological classification open woodlands have less than 30 m3 of merchantable wood per hectare at 120 years of age ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs 2015 the baseline scenario describing vegetation on open woodlands is based on jasinski and payette 2005 in this study we assumed that the residual stand was composed of 100 black spruce non merchantable vegetation such as dwarf birch betula glandulosa ericoid shrubs and lichen ground cover jasinski and payette 2005 was not included in the initial carbon stocks of the site because of a lack of data the boreal black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain is characterized by a longitudinal climate contrast the western part is subject to a continental and drier climate while the climate of the eastern part is maritime with higher relative humidity and cooler summers couillard et al 2019 the mean annual temperature is 0 1 o c with a mean maximum temperature during the growing season of 10 8 oc and a mean annual precipitation of 989 mm abandoned farmlands are lands where agricultural activities have been abandoned and where the type of vegetation transits between agriculture and forestry benjamin et al 2005 in recent decades and on a global scale areas supporting extensive agriculture have been abandoned due to a shift towards intensive and industrial agriculture benayas et al 2007 tremblay and ouimet 2013 in the province of quebec there are 100 000 ha of abandoned farmlands mostly located in the lower st lawrence region tremblay and ouimet 2013 abandoned agricultural lands have been widely discussed as candidate areas for implementing nature based solutions such as afforestation in canada and in europe drever et al 2021 magnus et al 2021 forster et al 2021 we selected abandoned farmlands located in the balsam fir yellow birch bioclimatic domain due to their abundance in this area and to the availability of field data for parameterization of the models prior to their clearing for agricultural use farmlands of this bioclimatic domain were mostly forested lands bélanger and grenier 2002 the balsam fir yellow birch bioclimatic domain is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 2 8 o c with a mean maximum temperature during the growing season of 12 4 c and a mean annual of total precipitation of 1052 mm the baseline scenario for abandoned farmlands predicted the return of the natural forest succession 20 years after agricultural abandonment tremblay and ouimet 2013 with a linear annual carbon accumulation rate of 3 61 t c ha 1 yr 1 13 25 t co2 e ha 1 yr 1 between year 20 and year 80 ménard et al 2022 in this study the baseline scenario was considered neutral to climate change carbon stocks from total ecosystem for each baseline scenario are shown in appendix a for afforestation scenarios we tested three species for each type of land determined according to the most promising species for each bioclimatic domain species were selected based on their distribution along the bioclimatic gradient and on recommended silvicultural strategies of quebec larouche et al 2013 the chosen species were black spruce picea mariana mill b s p white spruce picea glauca moench voss and jack pine pinus banksiana lamb on open woodlands and white spruce picea glauca red pine pinus resinosa ait and hybrid poplar populus spp on abandoned farmlands black spruce white spruce and jack pine are softwood species commonly found across natural boreal landscapes of canada they are also routinely used in commercial forestry the average yield of black spruce is 4 1 m3 ha 1 year 1 prégent et al 1996 in comparison white spruce can yield 4 6 m3 ha 1 year 1 jack pine 5 2 m3 ha 1 year 1 and red pine 9 1 m3 ha 1 year 1 bolghari and bertrand 1984 hybrid poplar is a deciduous fast growing species it usually reaches maturity at 20 years with a merchantable volume of 160 m3 ha 1 pothier and savard 1998 boreal softwood species are used to produce both long lived sawn products and short lived pulp and paper the proportion of each product category varies according to the species and the harvested stem characteristics such as diameter at breast height taper and total height auty et al 2014 wood from hybrid poplar is mostly sent to pulp mills to produce pulp and paper ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs 2019 2 2 climate change projections we used three radiative forcing projections from the ipcc 2014 known as representative concentration pathways rcp van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these climate projections predict a temperature increase of about 1 7 o c to 6 3 o c throughout the province until 2100 while average precipitation is projected to increase by 7 23 boulanger et al 2017 we first modelled a climate baseline projection with historical data mckenney et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 based on the methodology of boulanger et al 2017 we used the historical climate corresponding to the period from 1981 to 2010 future climate projections came from the canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 using data downloaded from the world climate research program wrcp climate intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive boulanger et al 2017 mckenney et al 2013 and further downscaled at a 10 km resolution mckenney et al 2011 2 3 models the existing growth curves for natural and planted forests in quebec are not climate sensitive however climate change can influence the physiological parameters of tree species within a given ecosystem therefore the combination of picus a 3d gap model linked to a process based model and cbm cfs3 a forest carbon dynamics model allowing forest management analysis allowed for in depth analysis of interactions between species specific responses to variations of the climate and forest carbon accounting therefore adding a complex biological component to the results houghton et al 2001 2 4 picus calibration to model changes in the physiological response of tree species and demographic attributes of tree stands over time under different climate change projections we used picus version 1 5 lexer and hönninger 2001 a spatially explicit process based model that simulates the dynamics of individual trees on a 1 ha x 1 ha grid picus is a process based model for the simulation of the growth of individual trees in the model tree growth potential is calibrated from empirical height growth curves and height diameter relationships of open grown trees annual tree growth is then calculated as a fraction of potential growth and is constrained by available radiation as influenced by competition estimated by a 3d light model that considers direct and diffuse radiation within the canopy lexer and hönninger 2001 thermal heat sum above a threshold of 5 5 c growing degree days minimum winter temperatures soil moisture index estimated with a water balance model soil ph and soil available nitrogen also drive vegetation processes within the model taylor et al 2017 in picus climate projections influence vegetation growth through effects on temperature and precipitation which influences soil water availability picus uses fixed parameters related to species autecology as well as climate and soil sensitive dynamic parameters for tree growth it has been previously calibrated for species used in our study boulanger et al 2018 taylor et al 2017 soil conditions were assumed to be constant over all the simulation period only climate variables were altered stochasticity was not included in this study since the objective of the study was to compare specific afforestation and management scenarios the growth of each species was dynamically modelled during an 80 year period according to climate projections starting from bare ground and fixed soil properties of the simulated open woodlands and abandoned farmlands other environmental parameters that may evolve as a function of climate change such as co2 fertilization were not implemented in picus a complete description of the model parameterization and validation can be found in taylor et al 2017 initial soil conditions were taken from mansuy et al 2014 and were averaged for both types of simulated lands for open woodlands the soil was classified as ferro humic podzol and we used a mean concentration of soil nitrogen n of 49 4 g kg 1 a mean ph of 4 5 and a mean water holding capacity of 53 3 cm for abandoned farmlands the soil was classified as humo ferric podzol tremblay and ouimet 2013 and we used a mean concentration of soil n of 74 4 g kg 1 a mean ph of 5 1 and a mean water holding capacity of 65 8 cm we simulated changes in biophysical processes under different radiative forcing projections starting in 2021 using monthly variations in specific climatic parameters temperature precipitation radiation and vapor pressure deficit simulations in picus were then done on an annual basis over the 80 year period 2021 2101 period picus outputs for each simulated stand included the total stand volume over bark m3 based on pollanschütz volume functions since picus was parameterized for native species only trembling aspen was used as a proxy for hybrid poplar the trembling aspen curve simulated in picus gave a target volume of 185 99 m3 at 20 years which is comparable to the hybrid poplar yield curves at the same age in pothier and savard 1998 2 5 initialization of parameters in cbm cfs3 to estimate forest carbon dynamics under forest management practices cbm cfs3 an empirical yield data driven model which is the core component of the national forest carbon monitoring accounting and reporting system was used kurz et al 2009 cbm cfs3 tracks forest carbon stocks carbon transfers between pools and ghg emissions data of merchantable wood volume as a function of stand type and age is required to estimate the carbon dynamics in each carbon pool boudewyn et al 2007 merchantable volume is converted in biomass of individual tree components as a function of diameter at breast height and tree height lambert et al 2005 harvesting can be scheduled using a matrix describing the proportion of carbon transferred between forest pools and to the forest products sector kurz et al 2009 cbm cfs3 was used to simulate the evolution of carbon stocks of monospecific stands for 80 annual time steps corresponding to the 2021 2101 simulation period fig 2 in cbm cfs3 a decay rate associated with different pools of dead organic matter dom drives decomposition on an annual basis and the decay rate is only modified by a temperature dependent function kurz et al 2009 the decay rate was thus adjusted yearly based on climatic assumptions of each scenario for mean annual temperature over the simulation period 2021 2100 for each simulation stocks were tracked for the four main carbon pools aboveground biomass stem wood branches stumps and foliage of live trees belowground biomass fine and coarse roots of live trees aboveground dead organic matter dom standing dead trees downed woody debris litter and humus and belowground dom soil organic matter including dead roots each expressed in t c ha 1 initial soil carbon pools were calibrated for both types of land for open woodlands no field data was available for initial site conditions therefore a spin up simulation reproducing the historical disturbances leading to the creation of an open woodlands of 120 years old was done we reproduced the disturbance pattern of a regeneration failure in cbm cfs3 starting 200 years 200 annual time steps before afforestation with a regenerating black spruce stand we simulated a fire 70 years later i e 130 years before afforestation followed by another fire 10 years later i e 120 years before afforestation following these disturbances the site was allowed to grow up to the year of afforestation 2021 according to a low density growth curve of 100 of black spruce with site index si i e an indicator of site productivity represented by the average height of the dominant trees of a stand at a reference age laflèche et al 2013 of 9 m at age 50 pothier and savard 1998 this resulted in a soil carbon stock of 57 0 t c ha 1 in 2021 immediately prior to afforestation upon afforestation 10 of the initial soil organic matter stock was assumed to be lost to the atmosphere following site preparation prior to plantation preliminary results dufour et al unpublished data for abandoned farmlands soil carbon stocks were set to 100 t c ha 1 367 t co2 e ha 1 in cbm cfs3 based on field data tremblay and ouimet 2013 litter and woody debris pools were initially set to 0 t c ha 1 thibault et al 2021 no site preparation was simulated for plantation on abandoned farmlands we used the evolution of total stem volume m3 for each monospecific stand simulated by picus as the input for cbm cfs3 fig 2 cbm cfs3 converts volume tables into carbon increments for each biomass pool as a function of stand age fig 2 kurz et al 2009 2 6 forest management scenarios simulations in cbm cfs3 were done on a time horizon of 80 years starting in 2021 to cover the 21st century period we simulated two distinct forest management scenarios for each afforested species one including harvesting after afforestation and another without harvesting table 1 all scenarios were scheduled according to the recommended forest management practices larouche et al 2013 with age at maturity respective to each species in its bioclimatic domain table 1 following these guidelines clearcut harvest rotations varied between 20 years hybrid poplar on abandoned farmlands and 70 years black spruce white spruce and jack pine on open woodlands clearcutting refers to clearcut harvesting with protection of advance regeneration and soils which is the prescribed practice in the boreal forest of quebec 2 7 harvested wood products and substitution on markets for forest management scenarios that included harvesting table 1 we simulated carbon fluxes associated with harvested wood products hwps using a modified version of the carbon budget model harvested wood products cbm hwp model which was run using the abstract network simulation engine anse of the canadian forest service fig 2 smyth et al 2014 magnan 2013 cbm hwp allows to track carbon stocks and emissions from wood products co products and by products over their service life and in landfills smyth et al 2014 head et al 2021 after a clearcutting simulated in cbm cfs3 a portion of the aboveground biomass more specifically the merchantable biomass is removed from the ecosystem at the year of harvest in cbm hwp this biomass is assumed to be instantly manufactured into different wood products according to a user specified allocation appendix b the basket of wood products assumed to be sourced from each species is described in ménard et al 2022 see also appendix b carbon emissions associated with the degradation of harvested wood products during their life time was estimated using the half life value for each type of product suggested by the ipcc penman et al 2003 35 years for sawn wood 25 years for panels 2 years for pulp and paper and 0 for bioenergy i e bioenergy is assumed to cause an immediate release of carbon upon utilization dynamics of emissions in landfills were simulated according to parameters in smyth et al 2014 the substitution effect that wood products can have on markets by displacing ghg intensive products was simulated as an emission avoidance smyth et al 2014 displacement factors were used to calculate the substitution effect these factors are expressed as the amount of c emissions avoided in t of c per t of c contained in the wood products the displacement factors were 0 54 t of c avoided per t of c in wood product for sawn wood smyth et al 2014 0 45 for panels smyth et al 2014 and 0 47 for bioenergy smyth et al 2017 no substitution effect was considered for pulp and paper these are average values adapted to the quebec and canadian contexts assumptions are also similar to those made in other north american studies and aim to avoid any over estimation of climate benefits of wood products smyth et al 2014 dugan et al 2018 xu et al 2018 2 8 net carbon balance of afforestation activities to determine the emission mitigation potential of afforestation activities net emissions were calculated using the difference between total fluxes of the baseline scenarios and the alternative scenarios considering carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level and those associated with wood products and their substitution effect on markets when relevant carbon fluxes were converted into units of co2 equivalent considering that 1 tonne of c 44 12 tonnes of co2 equivalent the net carbon balance was compiled on a cumulative basis i e sum of annual fluxes over the 2021 2100 period cumulative fluxes were expressed in tonnes of co2 equivalent per hectare of afforested land t co2 e ha 1 a scenario was considered to cause a net mitigation when cumulative net carbon fluxes difference between baseline and afforestation scenarios were negative and to be a net source when net fluxes were positive 3 results 3 1 impacts of climate change on the forest carbon sequestration and storage in the ecosystem under a warmer climate total ecosystem carbon stocks decreased by 19 for black spruce 15 for white spruce and stayed stable for jack pine for the afforestation no harvesting on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 for abandoned farmlands climate warming caused total carbon stocks to decrease by 34 for white spruce 2 for red pine and 24 for hybrid poplar figs 4 and 6 for both type of lands the saturation of c sink i e when the annual carbon accumulation rate decreases arrived earlier as a function of radiative forcing on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 the annual carbon accumulation rate reached saturation at time step 66 rcp 8 5 and time step 75 rcp 2 6 and 4 5 for black spruce and at time step 66 rcp 8 5 and 73 rcp 2 6 and 4 5 for white spruce for jack pine it reached saturation at time steps 58 for the historical climate projection 47 for rcp 8 5 on abandoned farmlands figs 4 and 6 annual carbon accumulation rate reached saturation at time steps 46 historical and rcp 2 6 and 35 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for white spruce at time steps 45 historical and rcp 2 6 and 40 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for red pine and at time steps 25 historical rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 and time step 20 rcp 8 5 for hybrid poplar for both type of lands aboveground dom pools were stable for the first 20 years but decreased afterwards under rcp 8 5 for all three species relative to the historical climate projection according to our simulations aboveground biomass and aboveground dom were the carbon pools that were the most affected by increased climatic forcing while belowground dom pool appeared to be rather stable the growth of tree species used in plantations was subject to significant variability due to climate change with consequences for the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation for plantations on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 there was a gain in aboveground biomass under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 of 7 and 9 for black spruce for the first 46 years 11 and 12 for white spruce for the first 60 years and 13 and 17 for jack pine for the first 45 years relative to the historical climate projection however black spruce growth dropped after 50 years under all three rcp projections with all climate projections showing an increase in growth rates compared with the historical climate projection even under rcp 8 5 at time step 80 jack pine was rather positively impacted by the radiative forcing projections except when harvesting was included figs 3 and 5 for white spruce simulations under rcp projections 2 6 and 4 5 showed an increase in growth compared with the historical climate projection under rcp 8 5 a decrease was noticeable at time step 50 figs 3 and 5 for afforestation with white spruce and jack pine there was an increase of the belowground biomass and aboveground dom pools under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 figs 3 and 5 similarly to open woodlands results of afforestation on abandoned farmlands showed that there were species specific responses to climate projections white spruce and hybrid poplar decreased in growth over the entire simulation period relative to the historical climate projection figs 4 and 6 red pine growth increased and reached a maximum of carbon stock of 35 0 t c ha 1 at time step 31 rcp 2 6 of 28 2 t c ha 1 at time step 29 rcp 4 5 and of 23 5 t c ha 1 at time step 28 rcp 8 5 red pine plantations sequestered carbon until time step 50 for rcp 8 5 time step 64 for rcp 4 5 and was still sequestering at time step 80 for rcp 2 6 relative to historical climate projection figs 4 and 6 white spruce plantations had a different growth response depending on the type of land with carbon sequestration relative to historical climate projection being higher on afforested open woodlands than on abandoned farmlands figs 4 and 6 3 2 harvested wood products on both type of lands afforestation clearcutting scenarios transferred carbon stocks to hwps table 2 the total biomass harvested during clearcutting is taken from the aboveground biomass pool the total amount of harvested biomass was therefore correlated to the responses of forest growth to the different radiative forcing projections afforestation clearcutting with hybrid poplar illustrated the effect of multiple harvesting rotations and the accumulation of carbon in hwps see appendix c for open woodlands and appendix d for abandoned farmlands because of the small proportion of long lived wood products manufactured from hybrid poplar carbon stocks in wood products were ephemeral relative to the softwood species 3 3 carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of scenarios the total net cumulative carbon balance of afforestation scenarios was calculated by adding carbon storage from wood products and the emission avoidance caused by product substitution effect on markets to net cumulative carbon fluxes from forest ecosystems fig 7 mitigation potential of each scenario fig 7 is presented in t co2 e ha 1 while previous figures figs 3 6 were presented in t c ha 1 for open woodlands afforestation scenarios acted as a net cumulative carbon sink at the end of the simulation under all radiative forcing projections fig 7 black spruce scenarios acted as a cumulative carbon sink from time step 11 for the historical climate and time step 14 for rcp 8 5 white spruce and jack pine started to sequester carbon between time step 5 and 9 for all climate projections for those two species rcp 2 6 and 4 5 resulted in an increased mitigation potential for afforestation fig 7 clearcutting created a carbon debt in the ecosystem a part of the carbon was transferred to the wood products carbon stored in harvested wood products and the substitution effect did not fully offset this debt on the other hand the annual rate of carbon sequestration in the no harvesting scenarios reached saturation at the end of the simulation unlike clearcutting scenarios which allowed a comeback of growing forest regeneration although scenarios of afforestation no harvesting sequestered more carbon than afforestation clearcutting scenarios the scenarios with harvesting still showed net cumulative mitigation after 80 years afforestation scenarios on abandoned farmlands displayed a more variable carbon sequestration efficiency according to the gradient of radiative forcing and returned more quickly to emission under rcp 8 5 indeed afforestation no harvesting scenarios sequestered over a longer time horizon returning to emissions in the last years of the simulation under the historical climate projection white spruce started to sequester carbon between time step 5 and 8 depending on the rcp projections up until the end of the simulation for rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 afforestation scenarios sequestered less carbon than baseline scenarios red pine started to sequester carbon 4 to 5 years after afforestation and remained a carbon sink until time steps 77 80 depending on the climate projection hybrid poplar started to sequester carbon right from the start but mitigation benefits decreased near the end of the simulation period 4 discussion the combination of models on tree physiology ecosystem carbon accounting and wood processing and use made it possible to estimate the mitigation benefits of afforestation under a changing climate although climate change is expected to impact the growth of newly planted areas as part of afforestation efforts the results of our study suggest that the choice of species to plant and the selected forest management strategy have a greater impact on carbon stocks than climate change itself efforts to reduce ghg emissions and to increase carbon sinks such as afforestation of unproductive lands can help to reduce the gap between present and predicted future climate while ensuring a supply of renewable products for future generations the multi model approach presented in this study has demonstrated the importance of land and species selection in implementing nature based solutions and could be applied to other areas where afforestation has additional carbon sequestration potential 4 1 impacts of climate change on carbon storage changes in the abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation can impact aboveground biomass growth boulanger et al 2018 d orangeville et al 2018 in our study under a light or moderate increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 some species such as white spruce on open woodlands only jack pine and red pine showed an increase in yield compared to a historical climate belowground dom pool was shown to be the most stable pool under warmer climate even though the rate of dom decay was somewhat increased with increased temperature this could be due to the small amount of decomposing dead wood in newly afforested ecosystems which are young forests with no legacy of debris from previous stand rotations nevertheless our modelling suggests that dom inputs can decrease considerably with a warmer temperature as a result of decreased forest productivity 4 2 species specific responses to climate change under a changing climate several species could see their climate envelope move northwards boulanger et al 2018 and other species would not be able to acclimate to changing conditions especially at the limit of their current distribution indeed in the northern portions of our study area where open woodlands are located the growth of white spruce was increased by climate warming suggesting that temperature is a limiting factor for this species at those higher latitudes conversely white spruce planted on the more southerly abandoned farmlands showed a decrease in growth with increasing radiative forcing on the other hand jack pine appears better adapted to temperature change probably due to its higher tolerance to drought stress compared to other boreal species hébert et al 2006 the choice of the species used to afforest is thus very important and should consider both the regional context as well as specific functional traits such as drought tolerance thom et al 2021 royer tardif et al 2021 a combination of several environmental drivers can explain the impact of climate warming on forest productivity but several uncertainties in the scientific literature remain net primary production can decrease due to drought as water availability could become a limiting factor kurz et al 2013 flannigan et al 2009 increased temperatures could also increase the capacity of carbon assimilation by trees and may lead to an increase in autotrophic respiration which altogether can negatively impact aboveground biomass girardin et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 evidence in the literature suggests that other factors than temperature and precipitation can also play a role in tree growth for example warmer temperature can increase tree mortality risk as it increases stress mcdowell et al 2008 adams et al 2009 or increases risks from pests and pathogen infestations conversely trees can benefit from climate change as it can increase nutrient availability through a faster nitrogen mineralization rate which was not included in the model and increase the pace of the organic matter decomposition rate in the boreal zone melillo et al 2011 increases in co2 concentrations which was also not included in the model can have a fertilizing effect on forest growth and on increasing water use efficiency by plants huang et al 2007 sperlich et al 2020 however the interaction of this parameter with the other biophysical variables remains unclear girardin et al 2016 the impact of increased co2 concentrations on forest growth was not considered in our simulations which can add uncertainties to the predictions of reduced forest growth nevertheless as showed by our results with red and jack pines the increase in tree growth under light and moderate rcp 2 6 and 4 5 radiative forcing can be a positive ecosystem response to climate change as it can sequester carbon more rapidly in the ecosystem this can also help shorten rotations increase the availability of merchantable wood for harvest and increase the carbon transfer towards wood products even if afforestation clearcutting scenarios created a carbon loss in the ecosystem the consideration of carbon fluxes from wood products and markets allowed them to become a cumulative net sink the proportion of long lived wood products is critical in increasing the mitigation potential of afforestation if plantations can reach maturity i e if they can escape stand replacing natural disturbances long lived wood products can be a way to secure carbon storage out of the forest ecosystem valade et al 2017 moreover such products can displace non renewable materials with high ghg footprints leading to emission avoidance through substitution the wood manufacturing industry varies in its capacity to turn different species into long lived wood products as opposed to short lived products that degrade quickly and release their c content back to the atmosphere and usually have no or little substitution effect on markets careful consideration should be given to the choice of species to be planted ménard et al 2022 for example hybrid poplar allows for several clearcutting rotations over a 80 year period however under current industrial conditions the harvested wood from poplar only yields a very small proportion of long lived wood products compared to softwood species white spruce and pine that can generate more sawn wood products 4 3 carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of afforestation results of total net carbon balance and emission mitigation scenarios support the role of plantations established through afforestation in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation climate change mitigation and wood supply benefits have been shown in stands where regeneration failures occur after wildfires menard et al submitted reforestation on poorly regenerated burns showed a net carbon sequestration ranging between 297 6 t co2 e ha 1 and 517 4 t co2 e ha 1 after 80 years of simulation for afforestation no harvesting scenario depending on the choice of species and the time of planting after wildfire however wildfires pose a risk for plantations implemented in vulnerable areas such as northwestern quebec boulanger et al 2013 which can potentially reverse any carbon benefit cause a loss of financial investments and impede expected wood supplies the choice of sites is crucial and targeting less fire prone areas could help secure ecosystem carbon storage other strategies that can decrease risk of fire at the stand level could also be envisioned such as management of tree composition and density and ground cover cavard et al 2015 values other than wood yield and carbon accumulation should also be considered when implementing climate change mitigation strategies such as afforestation nabuurs et al 2017 first the temporality of emission sequestration of a given forest management scenario can greatly influence its climatic effect for example emissions that occur early over a given period cause an overall higher radiative forcing than emissions occurring later and cannot be simply compensated by later sequestration paradis et al 2019 in our case scenarios that would cause the most sequestration early in the simulation period should lead to a more beneficial climatic effect moreover the change in albedo caused by afforestation can also affect the global radiative forcing effect of a forest management practice for example converting open woodlands to close conifer stands could decrease surface albedo with consequences for the long wave radiation budget bernier et al 2011 how this effect compares and contrasts with the radiative forcing effect of carbon management along with the effect of any other climate feedback mechanism that may occur in forest ecosystems yli juuti et al 2021 would need to be carefully quantified in order to provide more complete estimates of the mitigation potential of afforestation finally solutions such as afforestation can deliver co benefits beside climate change mitigation plantations could fill a need for connectivity between forest ecosystems in fragmented landscapes such as those impacted by agriculture afforestation efforts could be designed with such objectives in mind moreover diverse planted forests that ensure multifunctionality resilience and productivity at the stand and landscape scales could be considered messier et al 2021 complexification of age structure and forest composition has been shown to increase the resilience of ecosystems and allow better adaptation to climate change as well as increase carbon storage in the ecosystem messier et al 2021 paquette and messier 2010 5 conclusion this study assessed the vulnerability of afforestation scenarios in quebec canada to estimate their ghg mitigation potential under a changing climate the growth of some species was shown to be climate sensitive which affected the mitigation benefit of the afforestation scenarios compared to the historical climate projection a slight to moderate increase in temperature rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 can increase the mitigation potential of certain species such as jack pine 6 11 and white spruce 3 4 in the boreal zone of the province and red pine 1 7 in its southeastern part it was shown that the most pessimistic radiative forcing projections rcp 8 5 may adversely decrease the capacity of new plantations for carbon sequestration and emission reduction by 19 for black spruce and 15 for white spruce on open woodlands and by 34 for white spruce 2 for red pine and 24 for hybrid poplar on abandoned farmlands however even with a drop in forest productivity afforestation on boreal open woodlands with common species remains a valid option for ghg mitigation under all radiative forcing projections for abandoned farmlands located under more temperate conditions plantation with species more adapted to an increase of temperature can also be beneficial assisted migration could be used to improve forest growth and maintain carbon sinks etterson et al 2020 some studies emphasize the importance of bringing species to their northernmost limits to compensate for the lag that climate change will cause in their environment as seeds from more southern regions may do well in more northern regions prud homme et al 2018 the use of species with genetic modifications or more adapted to a larger set of environmental conditions should also be considered closely monitoring the planted trees and measuring their evolution over time is crucial to ensure the success of plantations sebastian azcona et al 2020 modelling allows to draw general lines for the future of forests under changing climatic conditions uncertainties in modelling increase when considering a more distant future especially since climate trajectories can be different from those currently predicted nevertheless using a longer time horizon for simulations and projections could reveal further patterns of carbon recovery and accumulation in harvested wood products but also expose future risks to ecosystem productivity the projected drop in plantation productivity under a changing climate especially on abandoned farmlands emphasizes the need for better wood processing to secure carbon in long lived wood products as a way to manage risks funding this work was supported by université laval through a scholarship to i ménard and an establishment grant

24348,afforestation of unproductive or currently non forested territories can increase carbon land sinks and thus contribute to mitigate climate change however investments on large scale afforestation could be risky because of the predicted effect of climate change on forest productivity of newly created plantations the aim of this study was to assess the carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of afforestation scenarios with different species picea mariana picea glauca pinus banksiana pinus resinosa and populus spp on open woodlands and abandoned farmlands in the province of quebec canada under different radiative forcing projections we modelled carbon dynamics in these lands under three representative concentration pathways projections rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over the 2021 2100 period the forest gap model picus was used to model tree growth of afforested species as a function of the representative concentration pathways 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 these data were then used as input in the carbon budget model canadian forest sector 3 to simulate the evolution of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes as a function of forest management and climate carbon transfer to harvested wood products and carbon fluxes associated with product life cycles and substitution effects on markets were also included in the analyses results showed that pinus species responded more strongly to variations in radiative forcing than for the other simulated species overall aboveground biomass was particularly altered by increased radiative forcing which in turn reduced harvesting yield and transfers to wood processing and products at the end of the simulation despite the expected impacts of radiative forcing on ecosystems afforestation scenarios on open woodlands with black spruce white spruce and jack pine can deliver carbon mitigation of 32 70 over the baseline scenario and 4 12 for red pine on abandoned farmlands and hence contribute to efforts to reduce ghg emissions especially over the long term although climate change is expected to impact the growth of newly planted areas as part of afforestation efforts the results of our study suggest that the choice of species to plant and the selected forest management strategy have a greater impact on carbon stocks than climate change itself this study provides a better understanding of the dynamics of afforestation under climate change and whether investments in plantation can contribute to ghg reduction targets keywords plantation climate change carbon sequestration open woodlands abandoned farmlands harvested wood products

introduction the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases ghg are known to significantly modify the climate system with consequences on ecosystems intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 for instance the global increase of mean temperature caused by ghg emissions over the last century has been accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts and precipitation events hoegh guldberg et al 2018 allen et al 2015 there also has been documented evidence of the impacts of climate change on forest productivity boisvenue and running 2006 notably through effects on the physiology and phenology of individual tree species and their capacity to grow and regenerate boulanger et al 2018 climate drivers i e temperature radiation and water are the main abiotic factors that drive primary production boisvenue and running 2006 a minor increase in temperature i e 1 c 2 c can lead to an increase in forest growth rate and thus forest productivity and carbon sequestration on the other hand a higher increase of temperature 2 c can lead to an overall growth decline due to a higher mortality and a lower capacity to regenerate boulanger et al 2018 d orangeville et al 2018 forest management and wood supply are dependent on forest productivity anticipated changes in aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease in wood availability and thus impact the forest sector brecka et al 2020 climate induced changes in the dynamics of natural disturbances can also alter the capacity of carbon sinks of forests kurz et al 2013 anderegg et al 2013 maintaining or increasing carbon sequestration and storage in forests as encouraged by the paris agreement can therefore be challenging under a changing climate in fact forest areas previously known as sinks can become carbon sources causing emissions that can thwart ghg reduction strategies in other sectors smith et al 2011 warren 2011 afforestation and reforestation are recognized as a climate change mitigation tool that enhances carbon sinks since it creates or re establishes forested areas forest management and the use of harvested wood products hwps can also increase carbon sequestration and storage especially when harvested biomass is transformed into long lived wood products and substitute ghg intensive materials or energy sources drever et al 2021 magnus et al 2021 ménard et al 2022 for example the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation has been estimated for non forested boreal areas such as open woodlands poorly regenerated burns and abandoned farmlands in canada drever et al 2021 ménard et al 2022 boucher et al 2012 dufour et al 2016 however there may be uncertainties to implement such a strategy because of the rapidly changing climate that drives ecosystem dynamics hobbs et al 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 and the effects of these variations on forest carbon sinks kurz et al 2013 valade et al 2017 the aim of this study was to estimate the carbon sequestration and the mitigation effect potentials of afforestation of unproductive non forested lands in the context of climate change boreal open woodlands and abandoned agricultural lands in quebec canada were used as case studies and a multi model approach was used to assess climate change mitigation potential of afforestation scenarios first the process based and climate sensitive picus model was used to produce yield curves according to a climate change gradient the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector v 3 cbm cfs3 was then used to model afforestation scenarios at a stand scale and to test a portfolio of forest management and species choices for plantation relative to a baseline reference scenario without afforestation carbon stored in harvested wood products was also taken into consideration using a modified version of the carbon budget model harvested wood products cbm hwp of the canadian forest service as well as the emission mitigation through product substitution on markets following the conceptual framework of smyth et al 2014 2 methods 2 1 study areas baseline scenarios and afforestation scenarios two types of land were used in this study as afforestation opportunities in quebec fig 1 i e boreal open woodlands and abandoned farmlands the two types of land qualify for afforestation under the additionality criterion of climate change mitigation activities richards and huebner 2012 open woodlands are lands that have been devoid of a productive forest stand for more than 50 years in quebec most of the open woodlands are located in the boreal black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain and are mostly the result of regeneration accidents following successive wildfires jasinski and payette 2005 open woodlands situated in this bioclimatic domain cover about 1 3 million ha of the continuous boreal forest in the province of québec according to the 4th quebec s decennial forest inventory there is presently no evidence of natural re densification of open woodlands and afforestation is the only known mechanism that can lead to a closed crown forest structure boucher et al 2012 jasinski and payette 2005 according to the provincial ecological classification open woodlands have less than 30 m3 of merchantable wood per hectare at 120 years of age ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs 2015 the baseline scenario describing vegetation on open woodlands is based on jasinski and payette 2005 in this study we assumed that the residual stand was composed of 100 black spruce non merchantable vegetation such as dwarf birch betula glandulosa ericoid shrubs and lichen ground cover jasinski and payette 2005 was not included in the initial carbon stocks of the site because of a lack of data the boreal black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain is characterized by a longitudinal climate contrast the western part is subject to a continental and drier climate while the climate of the eastern part is maritime with higher relative humidity and cooler summers couillard et al 2019 the mean annual temperature is 0 1 o c with a mean maximum temperature during the growing season of 10 8 oc and a mean annual precipitation of 989 mm abandoned farmlands are lands where agricultural activities have been abandoned and where the type of vegetation transits between agriculture and forestry benjamin et al 2005 in recent decades and on a global scale areas supporting extensive agriculture have been abandoned due to a shift towards intensive and industrial agriculture benayas et al 2007 tremblay and ouimet 2013 in the province of quebec there are 100 000 ha of abandoned farmlands mostly located in the lower st lawrence region tremblay and ouimet 2013 abandoned agricultural lands have been widely discussed as candidate areas for implementing nature based solutions such as afforestation in canada and in europe drever et al 2021 magnus et al 2021 forster et al 2021 we selected abandoned farmlands located in the balsam fir yellow birch bioclimatic domain due to their abundance in this area and to the availability of field data for parameterization of the models prior to their clearing for agricultural use farmlands of this bioclimatic domain were mostly forested lands bélanger and grenier 2002 the balsam fir yellow birch bioclimatic domain is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 2 8 o c with a mean maximum temperature during the growing season of 12 4 c and a mean annual of total precipitation of 1052 mm the baseline scenario for abandoned farmlands predicted the return of the natural forest succession 20 years after agricultural abandonment tremblay and ouimet 2013 with a linear annual carbon accumulation rate of 3 61 t c ha 1 yr 1 13 25 t co2 e ha 1 yr 1 between year 20 and year 80 ménard et al 2022 in this study the baseline scenario was considered neutral to climate change carbon stocks from total ecosystem for each baseline scenario are shown in appendix a for afforestation scenarios we tested three species for each type of land determined according to the most promising species for each bioclimatic domain species were selected based on their distribution along the bioclimatic gradient and on recommended silvicultural strategies of quebec larouche et al 2013 the chosen species were black spruce picea mariana mill b s p white spruce picea glauca moench voss and jack pine pinus banksiana lamb on open woodlands and white spruce picea glauca red pine pinus resinosa ait and hybrid poplar populus spp on abandoned farmlands black spruce white spruce and jack pine are softwood species commonly found across natural boreal landscapes of canada they are also routinely used in commercial forestry the average yield of black spruce is 4 1 m3 ha 1 year 1 prégent et al 1996 in comparison white spruce can yield 4 6 m3 ha 1 year 1 jack pine 5 2 m3 ha 1 year 1 and red pine 9 1 m3 ha 1 year 1 bolghari and bertrand 1984 hybrid poplar is a deciduous fast growing species it usually reaches maturity at 20 years with a merchantable volume of 160 m3 ha 1 pothier and savard 1998 boreal softwood species are used to produce both long lived sawn products and short lived pulp and paper the proportion of each product category varies according to the species and the harvested stem characteristics such as diameter at breast height taper and total height auty et al 2014 wood from hybrid poplar is mostly sent to pulp mills to produce pulp and paper ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs 2019 2 2 climate change projections we used three radiative forcing projections from the ipcc 2014 known as representative concentration pathways rcp van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these climate projections predict a temperature increase of about 1 7 o c to 6 3 o c throughout the province until 2100 while average precipitation is projected to increase by 7 23 boulanger et al 2017 we first modelled a climate baseline projection with historical data mckenney et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 based on the methodology of boulanger et al 2017 we used the historical climate corresponding to the period from 1981 to 2010 future climate projections came from the canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 using data downloaded from the world climate research program wrcp climate intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive boulanger et al 2017 mckenney et al 2013 and further downscaled at a 10 km resolution mckenney et al 2011 2 3 models the existing growth curves for natural and planted forests in quebec are not climate sensitive however climate change can influence the physiological parameters of tree species within a given ecosystem therefore the combination of picus a 3d gap model linked to a process based model and cbm cfs3 a forest carbon dynamics model allowing forest management analysis allowed for in depth analysis of interactions between species specific responses to variations of the climate and forest carbon accounting therefore adding a complex biological component to the results houghton et al 2001 2 4 picus calibration to model changes in the physiological response of tree species and demographic attributes of tree stands over time under different climate change projections we used picus version 1 5 lexer and hönninger 2001 a spatially explicit process based model that simulates the dynamics of individual trees on a 1 ha x 1 ha grid picus is a process based model for the simulation of the growth of individual trees in the model tree growth potential is calibrated from empirical height growth curves and height diameter relationships of open grown trees annual tree growth is then calculated as a fraction of potential growth and is constrained by available radiation as influenced by competition estimated by a 3d light model that considers direct and diffuse radiation within the canopy lexer and hönninger 2001 thermal heat sum above a threshold of 5 5 c growing degree days minimum winter temperatures soil moisture index estimated with a water balance model soil ph and soil available nitrogen also drive vegetation processes within the model taylor et al 2017 in picus climate projections influence vegetation growth through effects on temperature and precipitation which influences soil water availability picus uses fixed parameters related to species autecology as well as climate and soil sensitive dynamic parameters for tree growth it has been previously calibrated for species used in our study boulanger et al 2018 taylor et al 2017 soil conditions were assumed to be constant over all the simulation period only climate variables were altered stochasticity was not included in this study since the objective of the study was to compare specific afforestation and management scenarios the growth of each species was dynamically modelled during an 80 year period according to climate projections starting from bare ground and fixed soil properties of the simulated open woodlands and abandoned farmlands other environmental parameters that may evolve as a function of climate change such as co2 fertilization were not implemented in picus a complete description of the model parameterization and validation can be found in taylor et al 2017 initial soil conditions were taken from mansuy et al 2014 and were averaged for both types of simulated lands for open woodlands the soil was classified as ferro humic podzol and we used a mean concentration of soil nitrogen n of 49 4 g kg 1 a mean ph of 4 5 and a mean water holding capacity of 53 3 cm for abandoned farmlands the soil was classified as humo ferric podzol tremblay and ouimet 2013 and we used a mean concentration of soil n of 74 4 g kg 1 a mean ph of 5 1 and a mean water holding capacity of 65 8 cm we simulated changes in biophysical processes under different radiative forcing projections starting in 2021 using monthly variations in specific climatic parameters temperature precipitation radiation and vapor pressure deficit simulations in picus were then done on an annual basis over the 80 year period 2021 2101 period picus outputs for each simulated stand included the total stand volume over bark m3 based on pollanschütz volume functions since picus was parameterized for native species only trembling aspen was used as a proxy for hybrid poplar the trembling aspen curve simulated in picus gave a target volume of 185 99 m3 at 20 years which is comparable to the hybrid poplar yield curves at the same age in pothier and savard 1998 2 5 initialization of parameters in cbm cfs3 to estimate forest carbon dynamics under forest management practices cbm cfs3 an empirical yield data driven model which is the core component of the national forest carbon monitoring accounting and reporting system was used kurz et al 2009 cbm cfs3 tracks forest carbon stocks carbon transfers between pools and ghg emissions data of merchantable wood volume as a function of stand type and age is required to estimate the carbon dynamics in each carbon pool boudewyn et al 2007 merchantable volume is converted in biomass of individual tree components as a function of diameter at breast height and tree height lambert et al 2005 harvesting can be scheduled using a matrix describing the proportion of carbon transferred between forest pools and to the forest products sector kurz et al 2009 cbm cfs3 was used to simulate the evolution of carbon stocks of monospecific stands for 80 annual time steps corresponding to the 2021 2101 simulation period fig 2 in cbm cfs3 a decay rate associated with different pools of dead organic matter dom drives decomposition on an annual basis and the decay rate is only modified by a temperature dependent function kurz et al 2009 the decay rate was thus adjusted yearly based on climatic assumptions of each scenario for mean annual temperature over the simulation period 2021 2100 for each simulation stocks were tracked for the four main carbon pools aboveground biomass stem wood branches stumps and foliage of live trees belowground biomass fine and coarse roots of live trees aboveground dead organic matter dom standing dead trees downed woody debris litter and humus and belowground dom soil organic matter including dead roots each expressed in t c ha 1 initial soil carbon pools were calibrated for both types of land for open woodlands no field data was available for initial site conditions therefore a spin up simulation reproducing the historical disturbances leading to the creation of an open woodlands of 120 years old was done we reproduced the disturbance pattern of a regeneration failure in cbm cfs3 starting 200 years 200 annual time steps before afforestation with a regenerating black spruce stand we simulated a fire 70 years later i e 130 years before afforestation followed by another fire 10 years later i e 120 years before afforestation following these disturbances the site was allowed to grow up to the year of afforestation 2021 according to a low density growth curve of 100 of black spruce with site index si i e an indicator of site productivity represented by the average height of the dominant trees of a stand at a reference age laflèche et al 2013 of 9 m at age 50 pothier and savard 1998 this resulted in a soil carbon stock of 57 0 t c ha 1 in 2021 immediately prior to afforestation upon afforestation 10 of the initial soil organic matter stock was assumed to be lost to the atmosphere following site preparation prior to plantation preliminary results dufour et al unpublished data for abandoned farmlands soil carbon stocks were set to 100 t c ha 1 367 t co2 e ha 1 in cbm cfs3 based on field data tremblay and ouimet 2013 litter and woody debris pools were initially set to 0 t c ha 1 thibault et al 2021 no site preparation was simulated for plantation on abandoned farmlands we used the evolution of total stem volume m3 for each monospecific stand simulated by picus as the input for cbm cfs3 fig 2 cbm cfs3 converts volume tables into carbon increments for each biomass pool as a function of stand age fig 2 kurz et al 2009 2 6 forest management scenarios simulations in cbm cfs3 were done on a time horizon of 80 years starting in 2021 to cover the 21st century period we simulated two distinct forest management scenarios for each afforested species one including harvesting after afforestation and another without harvesting table 1 all scenarios were scheduled according to the recommended forest management practices larouche et al 2013 with age at maturity respective to each species in its bioclimatic domain table 1 following these guidelines clearcut harvest rotations varied between 20 years hybrid poplar on abandoned farmlands and 70 years black spruce white spruce and jack pine on open woodlands clearcutting refers to clearcut harvesting with protection of advance regeneration and soils which is the prescribed practice in the boreal forest of quebec 2 7 harvested wood products and substitution on markets for forest management scenarios that included harvesting table 1 we simulated carbon fluxes associated with harvested wood products hwps using a modified version of the carbon budget model harvested wood products cbm hwp model which was run using the abstract network simulation engine anse of the canadian forest service fig 2 smyth et al 2014 magnan 2013 cbm hwp allows to track carbon stocks and emissions from wood products co products and by products over their service life and in landfills smyth et al 2014 head et al 2021 after a clearcutting simulated in cbm cfs3 a portion of the aboveground biomass more specifically the merchantable biomass is removed from the ecosystem at the year of harvest in cbm hwp this biomass is assumed to be instantly manufactured into different wood products according to a user specified allocation appendix b the basket of wood products assumed to be sourced from each species is described in ménard et al 2022 see also appendix b carbon emissions associated with the degradation of harvested wood products during their life time was estimated using the half life value for each type of product suggested by the ipcc penman et al 2003 35 years for sawn wood 25 years for panels 2 years for pulp and paper and 0 for bioenergy i e bioenergy is assumed to cause an immediate release of carbon upon utilization dynamics of emissions in landfills were simulated according to parameters in smyth et al 2014 the substitution effect that wood products can have on markets by displacing ghg intensive products was simulated as an emission avoidance smyth et al 2014 displacement factors were used to calculate the substitution effect these factors are expressed as the amount of c emissions avoided in t of c per t of c contained in the wood products the displacement factors were 0 54 t of c avoided per t of c in wood product for sawn wood smyth et al 2014 0 45 for panels smyth et al 2014 and 0 47 for bioenergy smyth et al 2017 no substitution effect was considered for pulp and paper these are average values adapted to the quebec and canadian contexts assumptions are also similar to those made in other north american studies and aim to avoid any over estimation of climate benefits of wood products smyth et al 2014 dugan et al 2018 xu et al 2018 2 8 net carbon balance of afforestation activities to determine the emission mitigation potential of afforestation activities net emissions were calculated using the difference between total fluxes of the baseline scenarios and the alternative scenarios considering carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level and those associated with wood products and their substitution effect on markets when relevant carbon fluxes were converted into units of co2 equivalent considering that 1 tonne of c 44 12 tonnes of co2 equivalent the net carbon balance was compiled on a cumulative basis i e sum of annual fluxes over the 2021 2100 period cumulative fluxes were expressed in tonnes of co2 equivalent per hectare of afforested land t co2 e ha 1 a scenario was considered to cause a net mitigation when cumulative net carbon fluxes difference between baseline and afforestation scenarios were negative and to be a net source when net fluxes were positive 3 results 3 1 impacts of climate change on the forest carbon sequestration and storage in the ecosystem under a warmer climate total ecosystem carbon stocks decreased by 19 for black spruce 15 for white spruce and stayed stable for jack pine for the afforestation no harvesting on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 for abandoned farmlands climate warming caused total carbon stocks to decrease by 34 for white spruce 2 for red pine and 24 for hybrid poplar figs 4 and 6 for both type of lands the saturation of c sink i e when the annual carbon accumulation rate decreases arrived earlier as a function of radiative forcing on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 the annual carbon accumulation rate reached saturation at time step 66 rcp 8 5 and time step 75 rcp 2 6 and 4 5 for black spruce and at time step 66 rcp 8 5 and 73 rcp 2 6 and 4 5 for white spruce for jack pine it reached saturation at time steps 58 for the historical climate projection 47 for rcp 8 5 on abandoned farmlands figs 4 and 6 annual carbon accumulation rate reached saturation at time steps 46 historical and rcp 2 6 and 35 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for white spruce at time steps 45 historical and rcp 2 6 and 40 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for red pine and at time steps 25 historical rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 and time step 20 rcp 8 5 for hybrid poplar for both type of lands aboveground dom pools were stable for the first 20 years but decreased afterwards under rcp 8 5 for all three species relative to the historical climate projection according to our simulations aboveground biomass and aboveground dom were the carbon pools that were the most affected by increased climatic forcing while belowground dom pool appeared to be rather stable the growth of tree species used in plantations was subject to significant variability due to climate change with consequences for the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation for plantations on open woodlands figs 3 and 5 there was a gain in aboveground biomass under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 of 7 and 9 for black spruce for the first 46 years 11 and 12 for white spruce for the first 60 years and 13 and 17 for jack pine for the first 45 years relative to the historical climate projection however black spruce growth dropped after 50 years under all three rcp projections with all climate projections showing an increase in growth rates compared with the historical climate projection even under rcp 8 5 at time step 80 jack pine was rather positively impacted by the radiative forcing projections except when harvesting was included figs 3 and 5 for white spruce simulations under rcp projections 2 6 and 4 5 showed an increase in growth compared with the historical climate projection under rcp 8 5 a decrease was noticeable at time step 50 figs 3 and 5 for afforestation with white spruce and jack pine there was an increase of the belowground biomass and aboveground dom pools under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 figs 3 and 5 similarly to open woodlands results of afforestation on abandoned farmlands showed that there were species specific responses to climate projections white spruce and hybrid poplar decreased in growth over the entire simulation period relative to the historical climate projection figs 4 and 6 red pine growth increased and reached a maximum of carbon stock of 35 0 t c ha 1 at time step 31 rcp 2 6 of 28 2 t c ha 1 at time step 29 rcp 4 5 and of 23 5 t c ha 1 at time step 28 rcp 8 5 red pine plantations sequestered carbon until time step 50 for rcp 8 5 time step 64 for rcp 4 5 and was still sequestering at time step 80 for rcp 2 6 relative to historical climate projection figs 4 and 6 white spruce plantations had a different growth response depending on the type of land with carbon sequestration relative to historical climate projection being higher on afforested open woodlands than on abandoned farmlands figs 4 and 6 3 2 harvested wood products on both type of lands afforestation clearcutting scenarios transferred carbon stocks to hwps table 2 the total biomass harvested during clearcutting is taken from the aboveground biomass pool the total amount of harvested biomass was therefore correlated to the responses of forest growth to the different radiative forcing projections afforestation clearcutting with hybrid poplar illustrated the effect of multiple harvesting rotations and the accumulation of carbon in hwps see appendix c for open woodlands and appendix d for abandoned farmlands because of the small proportion of long lived wood products manufactured from hybrid poplar carbon stocks in wood products were ephemeral relative to the softwood species 3 3 carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of scenarios the total net cumulative carbon balance of afforestation scenarios was calculated by adding carbon storage from wood products and the emission avoidance caused by product substitution effect on markets to net cumulative carbon fluxes from forest ecosystems fig 7 mitigation potential of each scenario fig 7 is presented in t co2 e ha 1 while previous figures figs 3 6 were presented in t c ha 1 for open woodlands afforestation scenarios acted as a net cumulative carbon sink at the end of the simulation under all radiative forcing projections fig 7 black spruce scenarios acted as a cumulative carbon sink from time step 11 for the historical climate and time step 14 for rcp 8 5 white spruce and jack pine started to sequester carbon between time step 5 and 9 for all climate projections for those two species rcp 2 6 and 4 5 resulted in an increased mitigation potential for afforestation fig 7 clearcutting created a carbon debt in the ecosystem a part of the carbon was transferred to the wood products carbon stored in harvested wood products and the substitution effect did not fully offset this debt on the other hand the annual rate of carbon sequestration in the no harvesting scenarios reached saturation at the end of the simulation unlike clearcutting scenarios which allowed a comeback of growing forest regeneration although scenarios of afforestation no harvesting sequestered more carbon than afforestation clearcutting scenarios the scenarios with harvesting still showed net cumulative mitigation after 80 years afforestation scenarios on abandoned farmlands displayed a more variable carbon sequestration efficiency according to the gradient of radiative forcing and returned more quickly to emission under rcp 8 5 indeed afforestation no harvesting scenarios sequestered over a longer time horizon returning to emissions in the last years of the simulation under the historical climate projection white spruce started to sequester carbon between time step 5 and 8 depending on the rcp projections up until the end of the simulation for rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 afforestation scenarios sequestered less carbon than baseline scenarios red pine started to sequester carbon 4 to 5 years after afforestation and remained a carbon sink until time steps 77 80 depending on the climate projection hybrid poplar started to sequester carbon right from the start but mitigation benefits decreased near the end of the simulation period 4 discussion the combination of models on tree physiology ecosystem carbon accounting and wood processing and use made it possible to estimate the mitigation benefits of afforestation under a changing climate although climate change is expected to impact the growth of newly planted areas as part of afforestation efforts the results of our study suggest that the choice of species to plant and the selected forest management strategy have a greater impact on carbon stocks than climate change itself efforts to reduce ghg emissions and to increase carbon sinks such as afforestation of unproductive lands can help to reduce the gap between present and predicted future climate while ensuring a supply of renewable products for future generations the multi model approach presented in this study has demonstrated the importance of land and species selection in implementing nature based solutions and could be applied to other areas where afforestation has additional carbon sequestration potential 4 1 impacts of climate change on carbon storage changes in the abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation can impact aboveground biomass growth boulanger et al 2018 d orangeville et al 2018 in our study under a light or moderate increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 some species such as white spruce on open woodlands only jack pine and red pine showed an increase in yield compared to a historical climate belowground dom pool was shown to be the most stable pool under warmer climate even though the rate of dom decay was somewhat increased with increased temperature this could be due to the small amount of decomposing dead wood in newly afforested ecosystems which are young forests with no legacy of debris from previous stand rotations nevertheless our modelling suggests that dom inputs can decrease considerably with a warmer temperature as a result of decreased forest productivity 4 2 species specific responses to climate change under a changing climate several species could see their climate envelope move northwards boulanger et al 2018 and other species would not be able to acclimate to changing conditions especially at the limit of their current distribution indeed in the northern portions of our study area where open woodlands are located the growth of white spruce was increased by climate warming suggesting that temperature is a limiting factor for this species at those higher latitudes conversely white spruce planted on the more southerly abandoned farmlands showed a decrease in growth with increasing radiative forcing on the other hand jack pine appears better adapted to temperature change probably due to its higher tolerance to drought stress compared to other boreal species hébert et al 2006 the choice of the species used to afforest is thus very important and should consider both the regional context as well as specific functional traits such as drought tolerance thom et al 2021 royer tardif et al 2021 a combination of several environmental drivers can explain the impact of climate warming on forest productivity but several uncertainties in the scientific literature remain net primary production can decrease due to drought as water availability could become a limiting factor kurz et al 2013 flannigan et al 2009 increased temperatures could also increase the capacity of carbon assimilation by trees and may lead to an increase in autotrophic respiration which altogether can negatively impact aboveground biomass girardin et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 evidence in the literature suggests that other factors than temperature and precipitation can also play a role in tree growth for example warmer temperature can increase tree mortality risk as it increases stress mcdowell et al 2008 adams et al 2009 or increases risks from pests and pathogen infestations conversely trees can benefit from climate change as it can increase nutrient availability through a faster nitrogen mineralization rate which was not included in the model and increase the pace of the organic matter decomposition rate in the boreal zone melillo et al 2011 increases in co2 concentrations which was also not included in the model can have a fertilizing effect on forest growth and on increasing water use efficiency by plants huang et al 2007 sperlich et al 2020 however the interaction of this parameter with the other biophysical variables remains unclear girardin et al 2016 the impact of increased co2 concentrations on forest growth was not considered in our simulations which can add uncertainties to the predictions of reduced forest growth nevertheless as showed by our results with red and jack pines the increase in tree growth under light and moderate rcp 2 6 and 4 5 radiative forcing can be a positive ecosystem response to climate change as it can sequester carbon more rapidly in the ecosystem this can also help shorten rotations increase the availability of merchantable wood for harvest and increase the carbon transfer towards wood products even if afforestation clearcutting scenarios created a carbon loss in the ecosystem the consideration of carbon fluxes from wood products and markets allowed them to become a cumulative net sink the proportion of long lived wood products is critical in increasing the mitigation potential of afforestation if plantations can reach maturity i e if they can escape stand replacing natural disturbances long lived wood products can be a way to secure carbon storage out of the forest ecosystem valade et al 2017 moreover such products can displace non renewable materials with high ghg footprints leading to emission avoidance through substitution the wood manufacturing industry varies in its capacity to turn different species into long lived wood products as opposed to short lived products that degrade quickly and release their c content back to the atmosphere and usually have no or little substitution effect on markets careful consideration should be given to the choice of species to be planted ménard et al 2022 for example hybrid poplar allows for several clearcutting rotations over a 80 year period however under current industrial conditions the harvested wood from poplar only yields a very small proportion of long lived wood products compared to softwood species white spruce and pine that can generate more sawn wood products 4 3 carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of afforestation results of total net carbon balance and emission mitigation scenarios support the role of plantations established through afforestation in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation climate change mitigation and wood supply benefits have been shown in stands where regeneration failures occur after wildfires menard et al submitted reforestation on poorly regenerated burns showed a net carbon sequestration ranging between 297 6 t co2 e ha 1 and 517 4 t co2 e ha 1 after 80 years of simulation for afforestation no harvesting scenario depending on the choice of species and the time of planting after wildfire however wildfires pose a risk for plantations implemented in vulnerable areas such as northwestern quebec boulanger et al 2013 which can potentially reverse any carbon benefit cause a loss of financial investments and impede expected wood supplies the choice of sites is crucial and targeting less fire prone areas could help secure ecosystem carbon storage other strategies that can decrease risk of fire at the stand level could also be envisioned such as management of tree composition and density and ground cover cavard et al 2015 values other than wood yield and carbon accumulation should also be considered when implementing climate change mitigation strategies such as afforestation nabuurs et al 2017 first the temporality of emission sequestration of a given forest management scenario can greatly influence its climatic effect for example emissions that occur early over a given period cause an overall higher radiative forcing than emissions occurring later and cannot be simply compensated by later sequestration paradis et al 2019 in our case scenarios that would cause the most sequestration early in the simulation period should lead to a more beneficial climatic effect moreover the change in albedo caused by afforestation can also affect the global radiative forcing effect of a forest management practice for example converting open woodlands to close conifer stands could decrease surface albedo with consequences for the long wave radiation budget bernier et al 2011 how this effect compares and contrasts with the radiative forcing effect of carbon management along with the effect of any other climate feedback mechanism that may occur in forest ecosystems yli juuti et al 2021 would need to be carefully quantified in order to provide more complete estimates of the mitigation potential of afforestation finally solutions such as afforestation can deliver co benefits beside climate change mitigation plantations could fill a need for connectivity between forest ecosystems in fragmented landscapes such as those impacted by agriculture afforestation efforts could be designed with such objectives in mind moreover diverse planted forests that ensure multifunctionality resilience and productivity at the stand and landscape scales could be considered messier et al 2021 complexification of age structure and forest composition has been shown to increase the resilience of ecosystems and allow better adaptation to climate change as well as increase carbon storage in the ecosystem messier et al 2021 paquette and messier 2010 5 conclusion this study assessed the vulnerability of afforestation scenarios in quebec canada to estimate their ghg mitigation potential under a changing climate the growth of some species was shown to be climate sensitive which affected the mitigation benefit of the afforestation scenarios compared to the historical climate projection a slight to moderate increase in temperature rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 can increase the mitigation potential of certain species such as jack pine 6 11 and white spruce 3 4 in the boreal zone of the province and red pine 1 7 in its southeastern part it was shown that the most pessimistic radiative forcing projections rcp 8 5 may adversely decrease the capacity of new plantations for carbon sequestration and emission reduction by 19 for black spruce and 15 for white spruce on open woodlands and by 34 for white spruce 2 for red pine and 24 for hybrid poplar on abandoned farmlands however even with a drop in forest productivity afforestation on boreal open woodlands with common species remains a valid option for ghg mitigation under all radiative forcing projections for abandoned farmlands located under more temperate conditions plantation with species more adapted to an increase of temperature can also be beneficial assisted migration could be used to improve forest growth and maintain carbon sinks etterson et al 2020 some studies emphasize the importance of bringing species to their northernmost limits to compensate for the lag that climate change will cause in their environment as seeds from more southern regions may do well in more northern regions prud homme et al 2018 the use of species with genetic modifications or more adapted to a larger set of environmental conditions should also be considered closely monitoring the planted trees and measuring their evolution over time is crucial to ensure the success of plantations sebastian azcona et al 2020 modelling allows to draw general lines for the future of forests under changing climatic conditions uncertainties in modelling increase when considering a more distant future especially since climate trajectories can be different from those currently predicted nevertheless using a longer time horizon for simulations and projections could reveal further patterns of carbon recovery and accumulation in harvested wood products but also expose future risks to ecosystem productivity the projected drop in plantation productivity under a changing climate especially on abandoned farmlands emphasizes the need for better wood processing to secure carbon in long lived wood products as a way to manage risks funding this work was supported by université laval through a scholarship to i ménard and an establishment grant

24349,previous research about crop growth simulation and yield prediction mainly focused on annual crops with very few such studies relating to perennial fruit tree crops in this study field experiments were conducted in different growth periods of lycium barbarum l in gansu province china to determine and improve the initial wofost model parameters with combination of the time series leaf area index lai obtained from sentinel 2 satellite and predict yields for l barbarum shrubs at a field scale for summer fruit sf and autumn fruit af the results showed that the performance of initial parameters established by previous research and partial measured data was relatively poor with a relative error re of 20 95 for annual yield the simulation after model parameter calibration significantly improved model prediction accuracy the predicted sf was 2588 kg ha and af was 601 kg ha with a re of 5 51 this study provided a strategy to improve modelled yield for fruit tree crops through utilization of remote sensed and field measured data in model parameter calibration which on the other hand provides useful information for regional development planning and crops marketing keywords lycium barbarum yield estimation assimilation sentinel 2 wofost model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lycium barbarum l chinese wolfberry has been widely used as traditional medicine in china its fruit leaf and root are rich in polysaccharides amino acids vitamins and trace elements and therefore is considered to have high medicinal and nutritional value amagase and farnsworth 2011 because of its strong adaptability to saline alkali lands it has become an important cash crop in northwest china in gansu province the cultivation of wolfberry in baiyin jiuquan wuwei zhangye and other regions has become an important local agricultural industry with the expansion of the wolfberry growing area the regional scale yield forecasting before harvest has become important for marketing and export planning bai et al 2019 in the meantime the growth simulation and yield estimation of wolfberry shrubs allow farmers to improve management decision making such as irrigation and fertilization many of crop models have been developed to quantify the process of crop growth and development using climate soil and management parameters based on crops physiological and ecological mechanisms de wit et al 2019 for example the wofost world food studies van diepen et al 1989 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 epic environmental policy integrated climate wang et al 2012 and apsim agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 models these models have their own advantages and characteristics such as the spatial analysis application in dssat and the carbon component in epic and they usually contain biological and environmental modules crop models are widely used in agricultural management and other related fields like water use evaluation bai et al 2021 climate change response ewert et al 2015 and crop failure assessment sun et al 2021 but the uncertainties of biological parameters and environmental variables in crop models often affect the accuracy of yield assessment bai et al 2019 de wit et al 2012 remote sensing data can reflect the actual crop growth information and provide an objective observation of crop conditions zhao et al 2013 it is therefore important to combine crop models and remote sensing data to reduce the uncertainties in crop models remote sensing technology has been widely used to derive information about vegetation across large areas such as aboveground biomass agb li et al 2019a leaf area index lai wang et al 2019 and chlorophyll content qian et al 2020 among them lai has often assimilated in crop models to adjust and optimize some important input parameters and variables to improve the simulation results of models traditionally crop monitoring relied on modis landsat and other medium resolution remote sensed imagery however high spatial and temporal resolution and radar satellite data including sentinel 2 gf 1 sentinel 1 and alos 2 are increasingly available and are used in crop research providing more timely and reliable input data for crop modeling jin et al 2018 therefore extensive efforts have been made to couple crop models with more and more remote sensing data based on the different assimilation methods assimilation methods integrate remote sensing data into crop growth models to optimize key input parameters such as canopy state variables closely related to crop growth process previous studies show that assimilation methods can improve the prediction accuracy of crop yields at both field and regional scale chen et al 2018 gilardelli et al 2019 remote sensing data and crop models can be assimilated in different strategies the main assimilation methods used in crop modeling include calibration methods forcing methods and updating methods generally calibration methods recalibrate and optimize input parameters of crop growth models by minimizing the difference between the remote sensed values and the model simulation values bai et al 2019 forcing methods directly replace the model simulation values with state variables such as agb and lai to improve the simulated results jongschaap and schouten 2005 updating methods focus on continuously updating crop model simulation data by using four dimensional variation 4dvar ensemble kalman filter enkf and other methods liu et al 2021 many studies relating to crop growth models and assimilation methods mainly focused on annual field crops for example zhou et al 2019 used wofost model and phenological information from modis to simulate the growth process of rice in dongting lake area zhuo et al 2020 demonstrated that the simulation effect of wofost model on regional scale winter wheat and predicted the wheat maturity dates in henan province only a few studies have focused on growth simulation and data assimilation of perennial tree crops bai et al 2019 assimilated lai obtained from landsat 8 data to recalibrate the initial dry matter weight tdwi of field scale jujube orchards in the wofost model lopez et al 2010 developed a peach tree growth model and realized the three dimensional description of tree growth elli et al 2019 used three models including apsim to simulate the growth gap of eucalyptus from different origins in brazil in order to reduce the uncertainty of yield estimation apparently there are few studies focus on the yield estimation of fruit tree based on crop models and more efforts need to be tried whether assimilated remote sensing data can help crop models to predict fruit tree yield with better effect the focus of this study was to use wofost model to predict the yield of wolfberry shrubs and correct the model parameters by using remote sensing assimilation method to improve the accuracy of wolfberry yield prediction the specific objectives of this study were 1 to calibrate and validate the parameters for chinese wolfberry simulation based on wofost model and recalibrate parameters by lai derived from sentinel 2 data 2 to explore whether time series lai data obtained from remote sensing data can improve prediction accuracy of wolfberry production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study was conducted in jingyuan county 36 9 37 15 n 104 13 105 15 e baiyin city in northwest china jingyuan is located in the upper reaches of the yellow river the climate is arid and semi arid with an average annual temperature of 10 5 c and an annual rainfall of 240 mm wang et al 2022 fig 1 shows the study area and distribution of the field samples wolfberry is one of the important economic crops in jingyuan and the planting area has continued to expand in recent years 2 2 field experiments in order to calibrate the crop parameters required by the wofost model field sampling and measurements were conducted for wolfberry plantations in two locations dongsheng and wuhe during the 2021 growing season fig 1 wolfberry sample plots were recorded by handheld beidou terminal in april and july 2021 fig 2 b and specific leaf area sla values were measured through experiments on july 20 and october 8 sla is the ratio of fresh leaf area to dry weight fig 2a showed a set of leaves for measurement during each sampling a total of 100 lesion free and insect free mature leaves from different plantations were evenly collected they were tiled onto papers for digitization after measuring the fresh weight adobe photoshop software was then used to calculate the leaf areas after the measurement of leaf areas all leaves were dried to constant weight to calculate sla of wolfberry at different growth stages in the field sampling four wolfberry sample plants with uniform growth were selected in each plantation to measure their height crown diameter ground diameter and planting density fig 2c at the same time the five point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 21 plantations in addition unshaded and uniformly growing plants were selected to measure crown diameter and take out all the leaves after drying the weight of leaves was measured to calculate lai using following equation 1 l a i e 4 π p 2 s l a w l a where la i e is the lai of experimental plant p is the crown diameter of experimental plant cm and w l a is the dry weight of all leaves on the plant g 2 3 climate soil and crop data the meteorological data were obtained from jingyuan climate station http data cma cn data detail datacode a 0012 0001 html and the data used were daily temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation in 2021 however there were missing data for some days in datasets it had been used in previous research that the meteorological data from internet weather data service portals to run a crop model lee et al 2015 in this study the dark sky internet climate data https darksky net details 36 5626 104 6837 si12 en was filled in missing station data in order to check the accuracy of internet data a total of 14 non defective station data and internet data in each mid month during the study period were selected to calculate the meteorological data through 24 hour average method table 1 shows the relative error re calculated for the dark sky data comparing the station data the mean absolute error mae for daily mean temperature and daily mean relative humidity were 0 7 and 4 3 due to its good accuracy the dark sky data were used to supplement the missing data the meteorological data required in the wofost model includes global solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature vapor pressure mean wind speed and precipitation actual vapor pressure can be obtained from relative humidity and saturated vapor pressure calculated through the goudriaan equation de wit et al 2020 the formulas are as follows 2 h r e a e s 100 3 e s 0 610588 17 32491 t t 238 102 where h r is the relative humidity e a and e s represent the actual vapor pressure kpa and the saturated vapor pressure kpa respectively t is the air

point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 21 plantations and soil texture mass moisture content ph organic matter salinity and other parameters were measured using 0 40 cm soil samples the soil bulk density data was obtained from harmonized world soil database version 1 21 hwsd the soil plant air water spaw model developed by washington state university was used to simulate smw smfcf and sm0 parameters saxton and rawls 2006 in addition soil electrical conductivity was calculated by soil salinity lin et al 2005 soil volumetric moisture content was calculated by mass moisture content and bulk density gong et al 1997 part of the crop parameters such as sla lai and tdwi need to be set according to field experiment data but it is hard to actually measure the dry weight of every fruit tree in this study tdwi was calculated from biomass and planting density of sample plants the agb model of chinese wolfberry established by wu et al 2014 was used to estimate agb and stem dry weight through plant height and crown diameter as shown in eqs 10 and 11 root shoot ratio rsr is the ratio of underground biomass to agb so the dry weight of underground part can be obtained through agb and rsr in this study the value of rsr was 0 92 an 2006 10 w d a p h 2 0 446 11 w d s p h 2 0 441 where w d a represents the dry weight of aboveground parts g and w d s represents

two polar orbiting satellites a and b carrying multispectral instrument msi sensor with high spatial resolution 10 60 m and high revisit time 10 days with one satellite and 5 days with two satellites available satellite data coving wolfberry sample plots during the main growth season in 2021 were acquired from the copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home and the severe cloud cover images on april 9 april 14 and may 14 were replaced by the data of same period in 2020 after processing through the sentinel application platform snap software 19 images of sentinel 2 level 2a data were selected to extract lai meng et al 2007 built a national scale crop lai estimating model in china after analyzing the relationship between observed lai and ndvi in four representative agricultural observation stations this model uses local crop planting structures to determine the weight of four zonal lai models to estimate lai in its study areas with an average re of 19 sentinel 2 data and ground sample points of wolfberry were used in this study to estimate time series of lai which was calibrated by field measured lai data see equations as follows 12 l a i r k p 1 l a i s y p

v i 2 6806 where p i is the weight of lai models obtained from four stations and k is a correction coefficient determined by measured data with reference to the divisions of crop planting structures meng et al 2007 and field experimental data the weight p i of four zonal lai model in this study area were determined to be 0 3 0 5 0 1 0 1 and the value of correction coefficient k was 0 28 2 5 the wofost model and calibration wofost model was developed to simulate the growth of crops with interaction of their environment de wit et al 2020 in this model crop growth is divided into three hierarchical modes with regard to the ecological diversity of agricultural systems potential growth limited growth and reduced growth potential growth mode represents the ceiling for a given crop when grown in a given area under specific weather conditions limited growth mode refers to the crop being restricted by water or nutrients during growing season reduced growth mode refers to crop failure due to factors such as pests diseases and heavy metal pollution it is usually used for evaluation of the potential and water limited crop production the input of the model includes weather data soil and crop parameters the output of the model includes crop biomass yield lai and water use efficiency etc through utilizing the calibration method of the wofost model e g de wit et al 2020 combining the physiological characteristics of wolfberry this study adopted a potential production pattern the low sensitivity parameters such as tbasem lower threshold temperature for emergence teffmx maximum effective temperature for emergence and rdmcr crop dependent maximum rooting depth were determined using the results obtained from previous studies on wolfberry li et al 2019b an 2006 liu 2003 the high sensitivity parameters including sla and tdwi were calibrated using the field experimental data the phenological parameters such as effective accumulated temperature were calculated using meteorological data remote sensing data and crop models can be coupled in different methods such as directly using remote sensing data to drive a crop model or reinitializing crop model to make the modeling results consistent with the observed results this study modified the model initial parameters and predicted results by calibration method this assimilation method belongs to the continuous strategy which can readjust model parameters and minimize the difference between remote sensed results and modeling results bai et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 2 6 accuracy evaluation coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the accordance between simulated values and measured values root mean square error rmse was used to measure the deviation between simulated values and measured values and to quantify the prediction accuracy furthermore re and mae were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of the model these were calculated by following equations 17 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 18 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 19 r e y i y i y i 100 20 m a e i 1 n y i y i n where y i is measured values y i is the mean of measured values y i is simulated values and n is the number of samples 2 7 research framework the core purpose of this study was to assimilate the lai data derived from sentinel 2 data with wofost model calibrate the model parameters for improving the wolfberry yield prediction accuracy and compare the forecasting performance before and after assimilation the research mainly included following key steps 1 simulation stages divided by wolfberry growing characteristics during the annual growth period wolfberry can blossom and fruit many times li et al 2019b generally wolfberry plants sprout in early april and the fruits ripen in july autumn shoots grow in august and the fruits ripen in september the fruits from october to november are mostly unharvested therefore growing stages were divided into summer fruit sf april july and autumn fruit af july september and simulation experiments were carried out for these two periods respectively 2 growth simulation and yield prediction using wofost model initial parameters of wofost model were set through values obtained from previous studies bai et al 2020 de wit et al 2020 2019 liu 2003 and field observations first simulation was then carried out using these initial parameters the time series of lai data were then used to calibrate and verify the initial parameters and the simulations about yield production were conducted by calibrated parameters 3 accuracy evaluation the yield data in 2021 obtained from the cooperative growers were used to compare the prediction performance and accuracy of the model before and after assimilation 3 results 3 1 time series of lai fig 3 shows the time series of lai data derived from sentinel 2 ndvi after being calibrated by field measured data lai had a minimum value of 0 003 on april 9 and a maximum value of 0 64 on september 1 in this study lai reached a peak value of 0 51 during the sf picking period july 28 a trough value of 0 41 on august 2 and a peak value again when af was picked in early september this pattern is consistent with the result obtained by wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 revealed that the lai of wolfberry reached its maximum during fruit picking and the plants after picking would enter short dormancy which caused the lai decrease it can be seen that the time series lai from remote sensing data could better reflect growth trend of plants which was beneficial to subsequent calibration of initial crop parameters 3 2 parameters of wofost model initial crop parameters and soil data were first input into the wofost model including measured value estimated or simulated value based on measured data default value from model and reference value obtained from previous studies the experimental results showed that the average value of soil electrical conductivity was 0 57 ds m and volumetric moisture content was 13 59 the estimated values for smw smfcf and sm0 were 0 06 0 14 and 0 44 respectively the measured values of plant height and crown diameter are shown in fig 4 a and the estimation results of plant dry weight are shown in fig 4b the observed average row spacing of wolfberry plants was 1 96 m and the average plant spacing was 1 56 m it can be calculated that the estimated tdwi was 4556 3 kg ha for sf and 4733 1 kg ha for af different from existing annual crops in wofost model chinese wolfberry is a kind of perennial shrub the recommended value of tdwi in wofost model is 0 5 300 kg ha direct use of estimated values will lead to distortion about simulation results on the other hand the af simulation was affected by the early growth stage which resulted in a much higher value of initial lai therefore tdwi in this study was redefined as 4 56 and 4 73 t ha in the simulation and the value of leaf area index at emergence laiem in af and sf simulations was set to 0 003 which meant the lai output in af was the growth of measured value 0 42 liu et al 2004 indicated that chinese wolfberry usually breaks from hibernation in late march and has a short term summer dormancy in july our field experiments found that the plants under study generally germinated after early april and new autumn shoots began to appear during the fruit ripening on mid july therefore march 1 to july 31 and july 15 to september 15 were designated as sf and af respectively according to the perennial fruit tree model established by bai et al 2020 previous research about wolfberry an 2006 li et al 2019b liu 2003 wang et al 2021 and field measured data the initial parameters were established in practice the wofost model used 1 day steps for calculation and the initial parameters were calibrated based on the time series lai data in different crop growth stages the sf and af parameters after calibration and verification are shown in table 2 4 discussion the comparisons between simulated lai from wofost model and observed lai from sentinel 2 data are presented as scatterplot in fig 5 the simulated values without assimilation are discrete and clearly deviating from the observed values with a mae of 0 08 for sf fig 5a and 0 05 for af fig 5b the ratio of simulated lai from calibrated parameters and observed data are close to 1 1 showing a mae of 0 01 and 0 02 respectively in addition the r2 of sf and af after assimilation are both greater than 0 97 and the rmse are also both lower than 0 02 the results indicate that the accuracy of calibrated parameters is significantly improved and the time series lai acquired by remote sensing data can be employed to optimize model but compared to zhao et al 2013 assimilating lai into maize model with enkf the simulation results of initial model in this study are not satisfactory next this study needs to achieve higher levels of model building quality and use more effective field experiment methods previous studies show that the average annual yields of dried wolfberry fruit in jingyuan were 2000 kg ha and 3138 kg ha for 2014 and 2019 respectively which af yield accounted for about 30 of total annual yield luo 2021 liu et al 2004 the average sf yield of plantations in full fruit period planted for more than three years was 2625 kg ha in 2021 and the highest yield was close to 3000 kg ha the af yield was 750 kg ha on average in 2021 these results show that as new seedlings planted during the transitional period from 2014 to 2016 entered into full fruit period local wolfberry yield tends to be stable with an average annual yield of more than 3000 kg ha in 2021 yield is the ultimate indicator of crop growth and simulation results reflect whether the calibration of model parameters is reasonable table 3 shows the values of estimated yield and actual yield in 2021 the simulation of af yield using initial parameters was poor with a re of 20 95 after assimilating the time series of lai the accuracy of sf and af simulations was significantly improved with a re of 5 51 for annual yield however the precision of af yield after calibration was still not good the growing season length in crop features is one of the mainly drivers of crop growth in potential mode eweys et al 2017 therefore the very short growing season of af results in low yield accuracy estimated by wofost model in addition bai et al 2020 demonstrated that integrating the age of perennial fruit tree into model improved yield estimation accuracy alternatively some studies used other kinds of models to calibrate the crop yield li et al 2014 integrated a hydrology model to ensure that the wofost model accurately simulated crop growing processes this study improved simulation results mainly through lai and actual yield data accordingly future studies should integrate more fruits tree specific parameters or couple other models to improve applicability of the wolfberry model previous studies have indicated that assimilating lai in the wofost model can improve the accuracy of yield prediction about jujube rice and wheat bai et al 2019 gilardelli et al 2019 chen et al 2018 in this study using the time series lai has also improved chinese wolfberry yield prediction however the assimilation accuracy in this study mainly relied on the spatial temporal resolution of remote sensing data for msi images with a resolution of 10 m mixed pixels are inevitably present in the inversion process therefore the corresponding pixel values were extracted through ground sample points to reduce errors that might be introduced into crop models in addition satellite images affected by cloud cover have been replaced by the same period data for 2020 which may also introduce uncertainty in the simulation as a result the combination of higher temporal resolution satellite data and sentinel 2 data are expected to improve lai retrieval accuracy and yield estimation capabilities crop models such as wofost are often used to simulate annual field crops but rarely used for perennial fruit trees also yield estimation for wolfberry has not been made profound research in order to predict yield of wolfberry a set of wolfberry parameters based on the wofost model is established in this study in this study the wofost model is carried out with a potential production simulation the effects of other factors such as pests diseases water or nutrients stress have not been considered these several limiting factors can occur in the field and influence the yield prediction accuracy jin et al 2018 moreover taking lai as the only state variable does not fully express the effect of environment on wolfberry biomass soil moisture content and photosynthetically active radiation from remote sensing data can also improve simulated accuracy for yield therefore how to use more variables to assimilate the model will be the next research work in future 5 conclusion in this study the wofost process based model was used to simulate the growth process of chinese wolfberry at a field scale and estimate its dried fruit yield in 2021 the model performance before and after assimilation was compared and analyzed the main results are as follows 1 the predicted annual yield of jingyuan lycium was 3189 kg ha and the actual yield was 3375 kg ha with a re of 1 41 and 19 87 for sf and af respectively 2 compared with initial parameters the simulation performance was improved after assimilation and lai in sf part showed the highest modeling accuracy r2 0 99 rmse 0 01 for 2021 as an important cash crop in northwest china chinese wolfberry is important for local agricultural sustainability and regional economic development this study provided an approach to improve fruit tree crop yield estimation at field scale and

24349,previous research about crop growth simulation and yield prediction mainly focused on annual crops with very few such studies relating to perennial fruit tree crops in this study field experiments were conducted in different growth periods of lycium barbarum l in gansu province china to determine and improve the initial wofost model parameters with combination of the time series leaf area index lai obtained from sentinel 2 satellite and predict yields for l barbarum shrubs at a field scale for summer fruit sf and autumn fruit af the results showed that the performance of initial parameters established by previous research and partial measured data was relatively poor with a relative error re of 20 95 for annual yield the simulation after model parameter calibration significantly improved model prediction accuracy the predicted sf was 2588 kg ha and af was 601 kg ha with a re of 5 51 this study provided a strategy to improve modelled yield for fruit tree crops through utilization of remote sensed and field measured data in model parameter calibration which on the other hand provides useful information for regional development planning and crops marketing keywords lycium barbarum yield estimation assimilation sentinel 2 wofost model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lycium barbarum l chinese wolfberry has been widely used as traditional medicine in china its fruit leaf and root are rich in polysaccharides amino acids vitamins and trace elements and therefore is considered to have high medicinal and nutritional value amagase and farnsworth 2011 because of its strong adaptability to saline alkali lands it has become an important cash crop in northwest china in gansu province the cultivation of wolfberry in baiyin jiuquan wuwei zhangye and other regions has become an important local agricultural industry with the expansion of the wolfberry growing area the regional scale yield forecasting before harvest has become important for marketing and export planning bai et al 2019 in the meantime the growth simulation and yield estimation of wolfberry shrubs allow farmers to improve management decision making such as irrigation and fertilization many of crop models have been developed to quantify the process of crop growth and development using climate soil and management parameters based on crops physiological and ecological mechanisms de wit et al 2019 for example the wofost world food studies van diepen et al 1989 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 epic environmental policy integrated climate wang et al 2012 and apsim agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 models these models have their own advantages and characteristics such as the spatial analysis application in dssat and the carbon component in epic and they usually contain biological and environmental modules crop models are widely used in agricultural management and other related fields like water use evaluation bai et al 2021 climate change response ewert et al 2015 and crop failure assessment sun et al 2021 but the uncertainties of biological parameters and environmental variables in crop models often affect the accuracy of yield assessment bai et al 2019 de wit et al 2012 remote sensing data can reflect the actual crop growth information and provide an objective observation of crop conditions zhao et al 2013 it is therefore important to combine crop models and remote sensing data to reduce the uncertainties in crop models remote sensing technology has been widely used to derive information about vegetation across large areas such as aboveground biomass agb li et al 2019a leaf area index lai wang et al 2019 and chlorophyll content qian et al 2020 among them lai has often assimilated in crop models to adjust and optimize some important input parameters and variables to improve the simulation results of models traditionally crop monitoring relied on modis landsat and other medium resolution remote sensed imagery however high spatial and temporal resolution and radar satellite data including sentinel 2 gf 1 sentinel 1 and alos 2 are increasingly available and are used in crop research providing more timely and reliable input data for crop modeling jin et al 2018 therefore extensive efforts have been made to couple crop models with more and more remote sensing data based on the different assimilation methods assimilation methods integrate remote sensing data into crop growth models to optimize key input parameters such as canopy state variables closely related to crop growth process previous studies show that assimilation methods can improve the prediction accuracy of crop yields at both field and regional scale chen et al 2018 gilardelli et al 2019 remote sensing data and crop models can be assimilated in different strategies the main assimilation methods used in crop modeling include calibration methods forcing methods and updating methods generally calibration methods recalibrate and optimize input parameters of crop growth models by minimizing the difference between the remote sensed values and the model simulation values bai et al 2019 forcing methods directly replace the model simulation values with state variables such as agb and lai to improve the simulated results jongschaap and schouten 2005 updating methods focus on continuously updating crop model simulation data by using four dimensional variation 4dvar ensemble kalman filter enkf and other methods liu et al 2021 many studies relating to crop growth models and assimilation methods mainly focused on annual field crops for example zhou et al 2019 used wofost model and phenological information from modis to simulate the growth process of rice in dongting lake area zhuo et al 2020 demonstrated that the simulation effect of wofost model on regional scale winter wheat and predicted the wheat maturity dates in henan province only a few studies have focused on growth simulation and data assimilation of perennial tree crops bai et al 2019 assimilated lai obtained from landsat 8 data to recalibrate the initial dry matter weight tdwi of field scale jujube orchards in the wofost model lopez et al 2010 developed a peach tree growth model and realized the three dimensional description of tree growth elli et al 2019 used three models including apsim to simulate the growth gap of eucalyptus from different origins in brazil in order to reduce the uncertainty of yield estimation apparently there are few studies focus on the yield estimation of fruit tree based on crop models and more efforts need to be tried whether assimilated remote sensing data can help crop models to predict fruit tree yield with better effect the focus of this study was to use wofost model to predict the yield of wolfberry shrubs and correct the model parameters by using remote sensing assimilation method to improve the accuracy of wolfberry yield prediction the specific objectives of this study were 1 to calibrate and validate the parameters for chinese wolfberry simulation based on wofost model and recalibrate parameters by lai derived from sentinel 2 data 2 to explore whether time series lai data obtained from remote sensing data can improve prediction accuracy of wolfberry production 2 materials and

digitization after measuring the fresh weight adobe photoshop software was then used to calculate the leaf areas after the measurement of leaf areas all leaves were dried to constant weight to calculate sla of wolfberry at different growth stages in the field sampling four wolfberry sample plants with uniform growth were selected in each plantation to measure their height crown diameter ground diameter and planting density fig 2c at the same time the five point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 21 plantations in addition unshaded and uniformly growing plants were selected to measure crown diameter and take out all the leaves after drying the weight of leaves was measured to calculate lai using following equation 1 l a i e 4 π p 2 s l a w l a where la i e is

and precipitation actual vapor pressure can be obtained from relative humidity and saturated vapor pressure calculated through the goudriaan equation de wit et al 2020 the formulas are as follows 2 h r e a e s 100 3 e s 0 610588 17 32491 t t 238 102 where h r is the relative humidity e a and e s represent the actual vapor pressure kpa and the saturated vapor pressure kpa respectively t is the air

point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 21 plantations and soil texture mass moisture content ph organic matter salinity and other parameters were measured using 0 40 cm soil samples the soil bulk density data was obtained from harmonized world soil database version 1 21 hwsd the soil plant air water spaw model developed by washington state university was used to simulate smw smfcf and sm0 parameters saxton and rawls 2006 in addition soil electrical conductivity was calculated by soil salinity lin et al 2005 soil volumetric moisture content was calculated by mass moisture content and bulk density gong et al 1997 part of the crop parameters such as sla lai and tdwi need to be set according to field experiment data but it is hard to actually measure the dry weight of every fruit tree in this study tdwi was calculated from biomass and planting density of sample plants the agb model of chinese wolfberry established by wu et al 2014 was used to estimate agb and stem dry weight through plant height and crown diameter as shown in eqs 10 and 11 root shoot ratio rsr is the ratio of underground biomass to agb so the dry weight of underground part can be

two polar orbiting satellites a and b carrying multispectral instrument msi sensor with high spatial resolution 10 60 m and high revisit time 10 days with one satellite and 5 days with two satellites available satellite data coving wolfberry sample plots during the main growth season in 2021 were acquired from the copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home and the severe cloud cover images on april 9 april 14 and may 14 were replaced by the data of same period in 2020 after processing through the sentinel application platform snap software 19 images of sentinel 2 level 2a data were selected to extract lai meng et al 2007 built a national scale crop lai estimating model in china after analyzing the relationship between observed lai and ndvi in four representative agricultural observation stations this model uses local crop planting structures to determine the weight of four zonal lai models to estimate lai in its study areas with an average re of 19 sentinel 2 data and ground sample points of wolfberry were used in this study to estimate time series of lai which was calibrated by field measured lai data see equations as follows 12 l a i r k p 1 l a i s y p

v i 2 6806 where p i is the weight of lai models obtained from four stations and k is a correction coefficient determined by measured data with reference to the divisions of crop planting structures meng et al 2007 and field experimental data the weight p i of four zonal lai model in this study area were determined to be 0 3 0 5 0 1 0 1 and the value of correction coefficient k was 0 28 2 5 the wofost model and calibration wofost model was developed to simulate the growth of crops with interaction of their environment de wit et al 2020 in this model crop growth is divided into three hierarchical modes with regard to the ecological diversity of agricultural systems potential growth limited growth and reduced growth potential growth mode represents the ceiling for a given crop when grown in a given area under specific weather conditions limited growth mode refers to the crop being restricted by water or nutrients during growing season reduced growth mode refers to crop failure due to factors such as pests diseases and heavy metal pollution it is usually used for evaluation of the potential and water limited crop production the input of the model includes weather data soil and crop parameters the output of the model includes crop biomass yield lai and water use efficiency etc through utilizing the calibration method of the wofost model e g de wit et al 2020 combining the physiological characteristics of wolfberry this study adopted a potential production pattern the low sensitivity parameters such as tbasem lower threshold temperature for emergence teffmx maximum effective temperature for emergence and rdmcr crop dependent maximum rooting depth were determined using the results obtained from previous studies on wolfberry li et al 2019b an 2006 liu 2003 the high sensitivity parameters including sla and tdwi were calibrated using the field experimental data the phenological parameters such as effective accumulated temperature were calculated using meteorological data remote sensing data and crop models can be coupled in different methods such as directly using remote sensing data to drive a crop model or reinitializing crop model to make the modeling results consistent with the observed results this study modified the model initial parameters and predicted results by calibration method this assimilation method belongs to the continuous strategy which can readjust model parameters and minimize the difference between remote sensed results and modeling results bai et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 2 6 accuracy evaluation coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the accordance between simulated values and measured values root mean square error rmse was used to measure the deviation between simulated values and measured values and to quantify the prediction accuracy furthermore re and mae were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of the model these were calculated by following equations 17 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 18 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 19 r e y i y i y i 100 20 m a e i 1 n y i y i n where y i is measured values y i is the mean of measured values y i is simulated values and n is the number of samples 2 7 research framework the core purpose of this study was to assimilate the lai data derived from sentinel 2 data with wofost model calibrate the model parameters for improving the wolfberry yield prediction accuracy and compare the forecasting performance before and after assimilation the research mainly included following key steps 1 simulation stages divided by wolfberry growing characteristics during the annual growth period wolfberry can blossom and fruit many times li et al 2019b generally wolfberry plants sprout in early april and the fruits ripen in july autumn shoots grow in august and the fruits ripen in september the fruits from october to november are mostly unharvested therefore growing stages were divided into summer fruit sf april july and autumn fruit af july september and simulation experiments were carried out for these two periods respectively 2 growth simulation and yield prediction using wofost model initial parameters of wofost model were set through values obtained from previous studies bai et al 2020 de wit et al 2020 2019 liu 2003 and field observations first simulation was then carried out using these initial parameters the time series of lai data were then used to calibrate and verify the initial parameters and the simulations about yield production were conducted by calibrated parameters 3 accuracy evaluation the yield data in 2021 obtained from the cooperative growers were used to compare the prediction performance and accuracy of the model before and after assimilation 3 results 3 1 time series of lai fig 3 shows the time series of lai data derived from sentinel 2 ndvi after being calibrated by field measured data lai had a minimum value of 0 003 on april 9 and a maximum value of 0 64 on september 1 in this study lai reached a peak value of 0 51 during the sf picking period july 28 a trough value of 0 41 on august 2 and a peak value again when af was picked in early september this pattern is consistent with the result obtained by wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 revealed that the lai of wolfberry reached its maximum during fruit picking and the plants after picking would enter short dormancy which caused the lai decrease it can be seen that the time series lai from remote sensing data could better reflect growth trend of plants which was beneficial to subsequent calibration of initial crop parameters 3 2 parameters of wofost model initial crop parameters and soil data were first input into the wofost model including measured value estimated or simulated value based on measured data default value from model and reference value obtained from previous studies the experimental results showed that the average value of soil electrical conductivity was 0 57 ds m and volumetric moisture content was 13 59 the estimated values for smw smfcf and sm0 were 0 06 0 14 and 0 44 respectively the measured values of plant height and crown diameter are shown in fig 4 a and the estimation results of plant dry weight are shown in fig 4b the observed average row spacing of wolfberry plants was 1 96 m and the average plant spacing was 1 56 m it can be calculated that the estimated tdwi was 4556 3 kg ha for sf and 4733 1 kg ha for af different from existing annual crops in wofost model chinese wolfberry is a kind of perennial shrub the recommended value of tdwi in wofost model is 0 5 300 kg ha direct use of estimated values will lead to distortion about simulation results on the other hand the af simulation was affected by the early growth stage which resulted in a much higher value of initial lai therefore tdwi in this study was redefined as 4 56 and 4 73 t ha in the simulation and the value of leaf area index at emergence laiem in af and sf simulations was set to 0 003 which meant the lai output in af was the growth of measured value 0 42 liu et al 2004 indicated that chinese wolfberry usually breaks from hibernation in late march and has a short term summer dormancy in july our field experiments found that the plants under study generally germinated after early april and new autumn shoots began to appear during the fruit ripening on mid july therefore march 1 to july 31 and july 15 to september 15 were designated as sf and af respectively according to the perennial fruit tree model established by bai et al 2020 previous research about wolfberry an 2006 li et al 2019b liu 2003 wang et al 2021 and field measured data the initial parameters were established in practice the wofost model used 1 day steps for calculation and the initial parameters were calibrated based on the time series lai data in different crop growth stages the sf and af parameters after calibration and verification are shown in table 2 4 discussion the comparisons between simulated lai from wofost model and observed lai from sentinel 2 data are presented as scatterplot in fig 5 the simulated values without assimilation are discrete and clearly deviating from the observed values with a mae of 0 08 for sf fig 5a and 0 05 for af fig 5b the ratio of simulated lai from calibrated parameters and observed data are close to 1 1 showing a mae of 0 01 and 0 02 respectively in addition the r2 of sf and af after assimilation are both greater than 0 97 and the rmse are also both lower than 0 02 the results indicate that the accuracy of calibrated parameters is significantly improved and the time series lai acquired by remote sensing data can be employed to optimize model but compared to zhao et al 2013 assimilating lai into maize model with enkf the simulation results of initial model in this study are not satisfactory next this study needs to achieve higher levels of model building quality and use more effective field experiment methods previous studies show that the average annual yields of dried wolfberry fruit in jingyuan were 2000 kg ha and 3138 kg ha for 2014 and 2019 respectively which af yield accounted for about 30 of total annual yield luo 2021 liu et al 2004 the average sf yield of plantations in full fruit period planted for more than three years was 2625 kg ha in 2021 and the highest yield was close to 3000 kg ha the af yield was 750 kg ha on average in 2021 these results show that as new seedlings planted during the transitional period from 2014 to 2016 entered into full fruit period local wolfberry yield tends to be stable with an average annual yield of more than 3000 kg ha in 2021 yield is the ultimate indicator of crop growth and simulation results reflect whether the calibration of model parameters is reasonable table 3 shows the values of estimated yield and actual yield in 2021 the simulation of af yield using initial parameters was poor with a re of 20 95 after assimilating the time series of lai the accuracy of sf and af simulations was significantly improved with a re of 5 51 for annual yield however the precision of af yield after calibration was still not good the growing season length in crop features is one of the mainly drivers of crop growth in potential mode eweys et al 2017 therefore the very short growing season of af results in low yield accuracy estimated by wofost model in addition bai et al 2020 demonstrated that integrating the age of perennial fruit tree into model improved yield estimation accuracy alternatively some studies used other kinds of models to calibrate the crop yield li et al 2014 integrated a hydrology model to ensure that the wofost model accurately simulated crop growing processes this study improved simulation results mainly through lai and actual yield data accordingly future studies should integrate more fruits tree specific parameters or couple other models to improve applicability of the wolfberry model previous studies have indicated that assimilating lai in the wofost model can improve the accuracy of yield prediction about jujube rice and wheat bai et al 2019 gilardelli et al 2019 chen et al 2018 in this study using the time series lai has also improved chinese wolfberry yield prediction however the assimilation accuracy in this study mainly relied on the spatial temporal resolution of remote sensing data for msi images with a resolution of 10 m mixed pixels are inevitably present in the inversion process therefore the corresponding pixel values were extracted through ground sample points to reduce errors that might be introduced into crop models in addition satellite images affected by cloud cover have been replaced by the same period data for 2020 which may also introduce uncertainty in the simulation as a result the combination of higher temporal resolution satellite data and sentinel 2 data are expected to improve lai retrieval accuracy and yield estimation capabilities crop models such as wofost are often used to simulate annual field crops but rarely used for perennial fruit trees also yield estimation for wolfberry has not been made profound research in order to predict yield of wolfberry a set of wolfberry parameters based on the wofost model is established in this study in this study the wofost model is carried out with a potential production simulation the effects of other factors such as pests diseases water or nutrients stress have not been considered these several limiting factors can occur in the field and influence the yield prediction accuracy jin et al 2018 moreover taking lai as the only state variable does not fully express the effect of environment on wolfberry biomass soil moisture content and photosynthetically active radiation from remote sensing data can also improve simulated accuracy for yield therefore how to use more variables to assimilate the model will be the next research work in future 5 conclusion in this study the wofost process based model was used to simulate the growth process of chinese wolfberry at a field scale and estimate its dried fruit yield in 2021 the model performance before and after assimilation was compared and analyzed the main results are as follows 1 the predicted annual yield of jingyuan lycium was 3189 kg ha and the actual yield was 3375 kg ha with a re of 1 41 and 19 87 for sf and af respectively 2 compared with initial parameters the simulation performance was improved after assimilation and lai in sf part showed the highest modeling accuracy r2 0 99 rmse 0 01 for 2021 as an important cash crop in northwest china
