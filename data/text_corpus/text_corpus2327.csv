11635,in recent times the contamination of groundwater in the extended part of chota nagpur plateau becomes a big concern the demand of high quality drinking and irrigation water has been significantly augmented consequently productivity and fertility of soils are being reduced in the recent years due to use of low quality irrigation water thus it is crucial to know the groundwater quality for the appropriate planning and management of groundwater resources to determine its use for drinking and irrigation purposes therefore the principal objectives of this study are i to evaluate the magnitude and spatial variations of groundwater quality using the groundwater quality index gwqi for drinking and ii to examine the irrigation suitability of groundwater using irrigation water quality index iwqi sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp magnesium hazard mh kelly s index ki permeability index pi have been applied for suitability of irrigation water result showed that in 2021 gwqi values vary from 51 75 to 171 18 and seven blocks of the purulia district among twenty blocks have poor drinking water quality while in 2022 it ranges from 70 27 to 178 45 and eight blocks stand poor water quality in terms of irrigation water quality purulia ii and hura blocks come under the doubtful or poor categories in pre and post monsoon seasons for both the years hydro chemical facies through piper ussl and durov s diagram showed medium to high salinity and low to medium sodium hazards in this region feldspar and biotite minerals of granite and gneiss accelerate the bicarbonate and chloride ions in groundwater non point sources are also responsible for water quality deterioration in this agricultural dominated region these research findings will help to policy makers and administrators for the management of groundwater resources and agricultural sustainability particularly in the dryland region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater suitability groundwater quality index gwqi drinking water quality irrigation water quality hydro chemical facies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is extremely crucial for the lives and associated functions of the earth todd and mays 2005 about 70 surface of the earth is covered by water with 97 as salt water and the remaining 3 as fresh water so maximum amount of water is not preferable for direct consumption because of its availability in the ocean as salt water bera and ghosh 2019 bera et al 2021 out of earth s 3 fresh water 68 7 is found in the form of glaciers and ice caps meanwhile 30 1 of freshwater resides below ground as groundwater while just 1 2 exists in the form of surface water biswas 2003 gleick et al 2011 groundwater is stored in subsurface geological formations and it occurs in the zone of saturation and it takes part in the global or basin hydrological cycle bera et al 2022 additionally groundwater has a significant role in human lives for its usage in drinking agriculture and industrial purposes exclusively in many countries carrard et al 2019 green 2016 globally the maximum amount of available groundwater has been used for drinking purposes 65 followed by irrigation 20 and industrial usage 15 salehi et al 2018 in india socio economic development of rural and urban areas is mostly depending on groundwater resources both quality and availability in terms of both irrigation and drinking purposes kundu and nag 2018 in recent decades the magnitude of pressure on groundwater resources is gradually increasing because of the population explosion and multi sectoral expansion bera and ghosh 2019 chakraborty et al 2022 therefore the limited freshwater resource needs more attention for sustainable usage specifically for drinking and irrigation purposes worldwide hashmi et al 2009 jain et al 2004 according to world health organization who 2017 polluted water consumption is mainly responsible for 80 of human disease which takes more than 3 4 million people life globally chaudhary and satheeshkumar 2018 in this connection assessment and management of groundwater quality are the only way to save lives as well as to enhance sustainable socio economic development status of groundwater quality is controlled by different physicochemical attributes present in water arumugam and elangovan 2009 these physicochemical attributes and freshwater storage in groundwater aquifers principally depend on geological structures including lineaments fractures and faults in arid and semi arid regions bera 2010 bera et al 2021b on the other hand both natural and anthropogenic sources are accountable for the degradation of groundwater quality in different parts of the world anthropogenic impacts such as inappropriate management of agricultural and domestic waste increase the organic inorganic pollutants in groundwater ram et al 2021 yousefi et al 2019 hence it is essential to monitor the groundwater quality for drinking agricultural and industrial uses adimalla 2019 adimalla et al 2020 in recent decades developing countries such as india and china face serious challenges because of their dependence on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural practices adimalla et al 2021 numerous studies have been conducted in various locations in india to examine groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation reasons magesh and chandrasekar 2013 in india the extended part of chota nagpur plateau region was chosen for this study because of agricultural dominance and issues related to drinking water quality previously several researchers chakraborty et al 2022 kundu and nag 2018 conducted water quality assessment studies in some pockets of the purulia district but there was no such scientific study on evaluation of both drinking and irrigation water quality the strength of this work focused that multiple groundwater parameters along with different statistical indices were used and huge dug well and tube well data were collected from the various pockets of this plateau fringe area consequently data were validated by the data of phe public health engineering department govt of west bengal purulia in this region groundwater related health hazards are very much prominent which have also been reflected in recent news bera 2018 similarly more water samples should be tested for the general conclusion of this diverse physiographic region and proper explanation regarding the increase or decrease of such elements in groundwater should be exposed through more applied researches so there is a big research gap in this context and the entire region has been hydro geochemically investigated to determine the quality of the groundwater health hazards should be alleviated considering the appropriate management policies by the administrators and policymakers this scientific study will definitely bring new research directions for scientists and scholars the main objectives of this study are i to assess the degree and spatial variations of groundwater quality using the groundwater quality index gwqi for drinking and ii to examine the irrigation suitability of groundwater considering the physicochemical parameters such as potential of hydrogen ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total

groundwater samples have been collected during the pre monsoon may 2022 and post monsoon november 2021 seasons from tube wells and dug wells which are tested for drinking and irrigation purposes acid washed polyethylene 1 l bottles have been used to collect the water samples from different portions after pumping the wells for 5 min to eliminate the stagnant water in the wells bottles were wrapped with elastic caps to prevent evaporation and geographical locations by garmin gps instrument along with habitation names are labeled on the bottle subsequently preservation procedures have been applied carefully till the accomplishment of computable chemical investigation immediately after sample collection field measurement methods of electrical conductivity ec and ph potential of hydrogen

through water quality index water quality index score demarcates the magnitude and status of the quality based on various parameters at a definite site or position brown et al 1970 sarkar et al 2021 principally the potential of drinking water quality is examined by these index procedures which are calculated from different water quality parameters of specified areas kawo and karuppannan 2018 based on some pre defined parameters horton 1965 first proposed water quality indexing method which was further developed by brown in this study these extensively used gwqi methods have been considered to analyze the status intensity and magnitude of water quality this gwqi has been previously applied in both groundwater ram et al 2021 and river water quality chakraborty et al 2022 kawo and karuppannan 2018 sarkar et al 2021 measurement related studies index values have been calculated using the following formula 2 w q i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where q i refers to the quality rating sub rating of ith water quality parameter n stands for the variables or parameters w i denotes the unit weight for the ith parameter unit weight wi of water quality parameters is inversely proportional to suggested standards for the corresponding parameters unit weights have been calculated using the formula 3 w i k s n where wi stands for unit weight for ith parameters sn refers to the

crop production and largely depends on groundwater in india mukherji 2007 more significantly this groundwater quality specifies the amount of mineral composition and the degree of its effects on both soil and plants adimalla et al 2020 in this study irrigation water quality has been evaluated through the sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp magnesium hazard mh kelly s index ki and permeability index pi table 2 2 5 1 sodium absorption ratio sar the relationship between soluble na with ca and mg describe as sodium adsorption ratio sar alrajhi et al 2015 sarkar et al 2021 this index has widely undistinguishable importance to measure the degree of sodium hazard in a certain area the harmfulness of crop fields is also dependent on the nature of salinity which arises from the quantity of sodium in soil or water mukhopadhyay et al 2022 so irrigation water quality by sar index determined the suitability of water in irrigation practice electrical conductivity is similarly interconnected with the sar and high positive sar influences the growing crops sar value of the study zone has been calculated using the following formula given by richards 1954 6 s a r n a 2 c a 2 m g 2 2 2 5 2 soluble sodium percentage ssp the quality of irrigation water depends on the intensity of sodium or soluble sodium percentage ssp haritash et al 2008 khan et al 2021 index value regulates the fitness of water usage for irrigation purposes shammi et al 2016 the presence of high magnitude of soluble sodium arises the salinity difficulties associated with sulfate and chloride ions sarkar et al 2021 soluble sodium percentage ssp has been calculated by the following formula given by todd todd and mays 2004 7 s s p n a 2 k c a 2 m g 2 k n a 2 100 2 5 3 magnesium hazard mh intensity of magnesium concentration in water is the most significant qualitative measurement and to evaluate the standard of irrigation water balamurugan et al 2020 sodium percentage of soil is mainly responsible for the high magnitude of magnesium concentration in water alkalinity of any region is gradually increasing due to the high concentration of magnesium bhat et al 2016 in this connection the productivity and yielding capacity of crops decrease over time for the alkaline nature of the soil magnesium hazard mh has been calculated by following the formula 8 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 2 5 4 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki specifies the sodium concentration in soil and surface water in contradiction to the magnesium absorption kelly 1940 according to the standard value of kelly s index

permeability index pi permeability of soil of any given region is determined by the salt concentration in irrigation water permeability index method is developed by doneen 1964 using certain criteria for quality measurement of irrigation water permeability is affected by the presence of cations and anions in irrigation water safiur rahman et al 2017 more specifically calcium magnesium and sodium chloride affect permeability adimalla et al 2021 el maghraby and bamousa 2021 the authors have calculated the permeability index pi using this formula 10 p i n a 2 h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a 2 3 result 3 1 hydrochemistry assessment of the groundwater the quality of water is measured by the nature and dissolved elements available in the water statistical analysis of dissolved elements in collected groundwater samples such as ph total dissolved solid tds electrical conductivity ec total hardness th fluoride f iron fe and other anions and cations are showed in table 3 in the post monsoon 2021 and pre monsoon season 2022 mean ph values of water samples are 6 99 and 6 92 respectively and it indicates that the groundwater is slightly acidic but maximum value of some samples is mostly alkaline type most of the samples stand within the permissible range 7 0 8 5 as per who 2011 guidelines in addition electrical conductivity ec shows the enrichment intensity of salt content in groundwater in this study mean value of ec 733 88 and 586 14 mg l in both years is less than 1500 μs cm indicating less salt enrichment in groundwater furthermore mean tds values 366 94 mg l and 293 07 mg l stand within acceptable limit according to who 2011 total hardness th depends on the occurrence of calcium and magnesium in groundwater and the who considered its permissible limit up to 500 mg l mean hardness values are 356 36 2021 and 363 91 2022 which indicate lower to moderate occurrence of calcium and magnesium while maximum hardness is found at 1298 6 mg l 2021 and 1438 2 mg l 2022 indicating the high concentration of hardness among the total samples calcium and sodium concentrations show the cation exchange among raw materials and those are dominant cations in groundwater like magnesium and potassium mean sodium concentrations are 63 47 mg l 2021 and 37 84 mg l 2022 which specify the high magnitude of na2 available in the water values of some samples come into the permissible limit in addition mean values of calcium concentration are 68 79 mg l 2021 and 73 76 mg l 2022 whereas magnesium concentration ranges from 37 54 mg l 2021 to 39 76 mg l 2022 simultaneously potassium concentration was a maximum of 78 67 mg l 2022 but in post monsoon seasons 2021 it was within the permissible limit chloride concentration was maximum 418 mg l in 2022 and maximum hco3 concentration of 465 mg l is found in 2021 additionally maximum so4 concentration was 154 mg l 2022 and the maximum fluoride f concentration is found at 2 09 mg l 2021 among total water samples in the year of 2021 cation concentration was in order of ca2 na2 mg2 k and anion was in order of hco3 co3 2 cl so4 fe f but in the year of 2022 cation concentration was in order of ca2 mg2 na2 k and anion was in order of hco3 cl co3 2 so4 fe f table 3 correlation matrix of different physicochemical parameters anion and cations are presented in fig 3 3 2 groundwater quality assessment for drinking purposes groundwater quality index gwqi of different parameters indicates the quality of water and suitability for drinking purposes this systematic study shows that index value varies from 51 75 to 171 18 during the post monsoon season of 2021 table 4 this year thirteen blocks of purulia district out of twenty blocks have good drinking water quality the result shows that purulia ii block has a maximum water quality index value of 171 18 which indicates poor water quality hura bundwan jhalda ii manbazar i purulia i purulia ii and santuri blocks are also classified as poor water quality fig 4 among all blocks kashipur block has the best water quality the water quality index in 2022 ranges from 70 27 to 178 45 and twelve blocks showed good water quality those blocks that fall into poor water quality categories in 2021 will also fall into poor water quality categories in 2022 raghunathpur ii block comes under poor water quality in the pre monsoon season of 2022 and it indicates that in the pre monsoon season quality of groundwater is lowering down previous research in some sections of the study area has investigated this fact and concluded that it occurs as a result of ion exchange in the aquifer zone chakraborty et al 2022 kundu and nag 2018 3 3 water quality assessment for irrigation purposes agriculture is the most important economic factor in the purulia district and most of the people are engaged in the agricultural sector several crops including rice wheat cereals pulses and oilseeds are grown in this area in this connection evaluating irrigation water is crucial and irrigation water quality has been evaluated using hydro chemical facies piper plot and durov s diagram and index calculative methods mukhopadhyay et al 2022 ravikumar et al 2015 groundwater chemistry has been calculated through the sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh kelly s index ki and permeability index pi table 5 3 3 1 sodium absorption ratio sar sar values in purulia district range from 4 78 to 21 68with an average value 9 012 2021 and 3 05 to 2 74 with an average value 5 246 2022 according to sar fourteen blocks in 2021 and nineteen blocks in 2022 have excellent and good water quality respectively however purulia ii block falls into the permissible category in 2021 while they fall into the excellent category in 2022 table 2 diagram illustrates that the sodium hazards of this region and the spatial distribution of sar are presented in fig 4 3 3 2 soluble sodium percentage ssp soluble sodium percentage has been analyzed and the result shows that it ranged from 16 22 to 72 28 with an average of 37 60 2021 and 15 55 to 71 42 with an average of 37 48 2022 in 2021 water samples of three blocks fall into the excellent ten blocks in good five blocks in permissible and two blocks come under the doubtful categories table 2 simultaneously in 2022 three blocks fall into the excellent eight blocks come under good and seven blocks fall into permissible and two blocks come under the doubtful water quality more precisely purulia ii and hura blocks come under the doubtful category in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of both years the spatial distribution of ssp has been shown in fig 5 3 3 3 permeability index pi the permeability index is ranged from 20 38 to 85 51 with an average value of 45 074 nineteen blocks of this region come under the good soil permeability except for purulia ii which falls into the moderate category but in 2022 each block under the study area falls into the good quality for soil permeability fig 6 3 3 4 magnesium hazard mh from the analysis of magnesium hazard values of all samples range from 3 27 to 75 75 with an average of 37 48 2021 and 10 49 to 56 22 with an average of 38 06 2022 table 2 in 2021 eighteen blocks of purulia district come under the suitable for irrigation whereas 19 blocks come under the suitable category in 2022 furthermore the result of the samples indicates that hura block is unsuitable for irrigation in both the years spatial distribution of mh shows in fig 5 3 3 5 kelly s index ki results of kelly s index reveal that the values range from 0 18 to 2 4 with an average of 0 676 in 2021 in comparison it fluctuates between 0 12 and 0 11 with an average of 0 37 in 2022 about eighteen blocks fall into the suitable for irrigation in 2021 and 2022 correspondingly table 4 however just similar to the magnesium hazard ki result of the water samples of the hura block in both years are also indicating unsuitable for irrigation fig 6 4 discussion the present study reveals that groundwater quality for drinking purpose during 2021 was slightly better compared with 2022 in terms of concentration of ph among all blocks did not exceed the standard range 6 5 8 5 prescribed by who 2011 occurrence of moderate ec and tds in both study years indicates medium salt concentration because of the industrial sewage magnitude of groundwater recharge in this particular region is mainly taken place through the seepage of irrigation canals and return flow from the canal as well as rivers and the rain water bera and das 2021 in post monsoon season electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids are higher which are affected by industrial irrigated seepage of monsoonal rainfall than in the pre monsoon season urban electronic and domestic wastes are mixed with water and it is a noteworthy concern in town areas in india verma et al 2018 this area also heavily depends on irrigation to fulfill agricultural demand and sewage from both domestic and industrial sources affects the water quality nearby purulia town high temperature and evaporation regulate the concentration of chemical elements in semi arid regions which affect plants and soil by increasing the soil salinity adimalla et al 2020 aouiti et al 2021 similarly high salinity harms plant growth which leads to nutritional problems in plants läuchli and epstein 1990 according to the us salinity diagram 1954 the majority of the area falls under the c2s1 c3s1 and c3s2 categories which denote medium to high salinity and low to medium sodium hazards respectively fig 7 the continuous use of this waters for farming increases the level of soil salinity and restricts the production of agricultural yields in this province the presence of wastewater from industrial hubs percolated through runoff and mixed with groundwater during monsoon months verma et al 2018 this phenomenon is ultimately deciding the quantity and magnitude of anions and cations in this study water quality parameters are not well adjusted in this region due to nearly non point sources of contaminants this region comes under the chota nagpur gneissic complex cgc and precambrian granitic rocks such as gneiss and pegmatite are dominant in this section bera and ghosh 2019 as a consequence the groundwater chemistry of entire region is influenced by weathering and interaction process of water with rocks mechanical weathering and deep chemical weathering are very much active in this vast tract which affects significantly water quality as an example the calcium concentration of water originates from several minerals such as amphiboles and feldspars fluorite and apatite adimalla et al 2020 in this study general hydrochemistry of water samples reveals that weathered materials as well as minerals mixed with the groundwater furthermore chemical deposition in water derives from different natural sources such as warm blooded animal waste and rock decomposition ortiz 2004 this study also relates these factors that influence the chemical properties of groundwater feldspar mica and biotite are influencing the magnitude of na and k concentration in water bucher et al 2017 the richness of those minerals in jhalda i and ii balarampur blocks is the foremost reason for na and k concentration in water samples fluoride concentration in this part of the chota nagpur plateau region depends on the weathering materials and rocks bera et al 2021 bera et al 2022 bera and ghosh 2019 hydro geochemistry results demonstrate that the weathering of rock and contributions from human and agricultural sources are principally influencing the composition of the groundwater in this region kundu and nag 2018 fluoride concentration in water samples of this region is crossed the permissible limit which similarly specifies this fact based on the piper plot piper s 1944 cations and anions in water samples show that maximum samples fall into field 5 which reveals the type of calcium magnesium bicarbonate and maximum water of this region is suitable for irrigation fig 8 furthermore durov plot or combined plots with two separate ternary diagrams with ph and tds have been plotted and it represents no dominant anions and cations in water samples from the applied irrigation water quality indices of collected water samples it is stated that the groundwater in the hura and purulia ii blocks is slightly unsuitable for irrigation and the majority of the purulia district said to be good or suitable for irrigation in this extended portion of the chota nagpur plateau groundwater quality and storage are controlled primarily by the fractures joints and weathered remnants of the rock structure bera et al 2021 this is the main reason for the spatial disparity in water quality components in this area 5 conclusion according to the water quality index purulia ii block has extremely bad water quality for both drinking and irrigation purposes in both the years 2021 and 2022 although the major parts of this district show medium to high salinity hazard which indicates the potential threat for groundwater irrigation in the present and future applying additional water quality indices larger part of the purulia district has good or suitable for the recent times but water quality of the hura and purulia ii blocks show that it may become hazardous in the future feldspar and biotite minerals of granite and gneiss accelerate the bicarbonate and chloride ions in groundwater through water rock interaction thus the quality of the groundwater is massively influenced by the lithology of the bedrocks domestic and industrial effluents at the vicinity of town areas hura and purulia ii blocks also significantly influence the standard of the water quality hydro chemical facies through piper ussl and durov diagram showed medium to high salinity and low to medium sodium hazards in this region urban and industrial sewage treatment should be done before discharges into rivers consequently the execution of appropriate actions is needed for salinity hazard prone zones additional multi annual and integrated support programmes for the improvement of bio fertilizers use in agricultural system and sustainable water use or integrated watershed management in dryland area should be encouraged this study highlighted that quality of ground water has been significantly deteriorated due to natural and anthropogenic sources large scale use of bio fertilizer training program should be arranged in every community blocks within the study area for the health of the surface water as well as ground water the mechanism of bio composting should be extended to the micro farmers for improvement of soil fertility as well as productivity use of green manures should be expanded for the health of the soil and groundwater excessive chemical fertilizers should be restricted for the health of the total environment however the results of this study will assist administrators and decision makers in making any policies regarding the management of groundwater resources and agricultural sustainability more research and development are highly essential for the improvement of sustainable groundwater development and management particularly for this semi arid environment declaration of

gradually increasing because of the population explosion and multi sectoral expansion bera and ghosh 2019 chakraborty et al 2022 therefore the limited freshwater resource needs more attention for sustainable usage specifically for drinking and irrigation purposes worldwide hashmi et al 2009 jain et al 2004 according to world health organization who 2017 polluted water consumption is mainly responsible for 80 of human disease which takes more than 3 4 million people life globally chaudhary and satheeshkumar 2018 in this connection assessment and management of groundwater quality are the only way to save lives as well as to enhance sustainable socio economic development status of groundwater quality is controlled by different physicochemical attributes present in water arumugam and elangovan 2009 these physicochemical attributes and freshwater storage in groundwater aquifers principally depend on geological structures including lineaments fractures and faults in arid and semi arid regions bera 2010 bera et al 2021b on the other hand both natural and anthropogenic sources are accountable for the degradation of groundwater quality in different parts of the world anthropogenic impacts such as inappropriate management of agricultural and domestic waste increase the organic inorganic pollutants in groundwater ram et al 2021 yousefi et al 2019 hence it is essential to monitor the groundwater quality for drinking agricultural and industrial uses adimalla 2019 adimalla et al 2020 in recent decades developing countries such as india and china face serious challenges because of their dependence on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural practices adimalla et al 2021 numerous studies have been conducted in various locations in india to examine groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation reasons magesh and chandrasekar 2013 in india the extended part of chota nagpur plateau region was chosen for this study because of agricultural dominance and issues related to drinking water quality previously several researchers chakraborty et al 2022 kundu and nag 2018 conducted water quality assessment studies in some pockets of the purulia district but there was no such scientific study on evaluation of both drinking and irrigation water quality the strength of this work focused that multiple groundwater parameters along with different statistical indices were used and huge dug well and tube well data were collected from the various pockets of this plateau fringe area consequently data were validated by the data of phe public health engineering department govt of west bengal purulia in this region groundwater related health hazards are very much prominent which have also been reflected in recent news bera 2018 similarly more water samples should be tested for the general conclusion of this diverse physiographic region and proper explanation regarding the increase or decrease of such elements in groundwater should be exposed through more applied researches so there is a big research gap in this context and the entire region has been hydro geochemically investigated to determine the quality of the groundwater health hazards should be alleviated considering the appropriate management policies by the administrators and policymakers this scientific study will definitely bring new research directions for scientists and scholars the main objectives of this study are i to assess the degree and spatial variations of groundwater quality using the groundwater quality index gwqi for drinking and ii to examine the irrigation suitability of groundwater considering the physicochemical parameters such as potential of hydrogen ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total

groundwater samples have been collected during the pre monsoon may 2022 and post monsoon november 2021 seasons from tube wells and dug wells which are tested for drinking and irrigation purposes acid washed polyethylene 1 l bottles have been used to collect the water samples from different portions after pumping the wells for 5 min to eliminate the stagnant water in the wells bottles were wrapped with elastic caps to prevent evaporation and geographical locations by garmin gps instrument along with habitation names are labeled on the bottle subsequently preservation procedures have been applied carefully till the accomplishment of computable chemical investigation immediately after sample collection field measurement methods of electrical conductivity ec and ph potential of hydrogen

through water quality index water quality index score demarcates the magnitude and status of the quality based on various parameters at a definite site or position brown et al 1970 sarkar et al 2021 principally the potential of drinking water quality is examined by these index procedures which are calculated from different water quality parameters of specified areas kawo and karuppannan 2018 based on some pre defined parameters horton 1965 first proposed water quality indexing method which was further developed by brown in this study these extensively used gwqi methods have been considered to analyze the status intensity and magnitude of water quality this gwqi has been previously applied in both groundwater ram et al 2021 and river water quality chakraborty et al 2022 kawo and karuppannan 2018 sarkar et al 2021 measurement related studies index values have been calculated using the following formula 2 w q i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where q i refers to the quality rating sub rating of ith water quality parameter n stands for the variables or parameters w i denotes the unit weight for the ith parameter unit weight wi of water quality parameters is inversely

crop production and largely depends on groundwater in india mukherji 2007 more significantly this groundwater quality specifies the amount of mineral composition and the degree of its effects on both soil and plants adimalla et al 2020 in this study irrigation water quality has been evaluated through the sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp magnesium hazard mh kelly s index ki and permeability index pi table 2 2 5 1 sodium absorption ratio sar the relationship between soluble na with ca and mg describe as sodium adsorption ratio sar alrajhi et al 2015 sarkar et al 2021 this index has widely undistinguishable importance to measure the degree of sodium hazard in a certain area the harmfulness of crop fields is also dependent on the nature of salinity which arises from the quantity of sodium in soil or water mukhopadhyay et al 2022 so irrigation water quality by sar index determined the suitability of water in irrigation practice electrical conductivity is similarly interconnected with the sar and high positive sar influences the growing crops sar value of the study zone has been calculated using the following formula given by richards 1954 6 s a r n a 2 c a 2 m g 2 2 2 5 2 soluble sodium percentage ssp the quality of irrigation water depends on the intensity of sodium or soluble sodium percentage ssp haritash et al 2008 khan et al 2021 index value regulates the fitness of water usage for irrigation purposes shammi et al 2016 the presence of high magnitude of soluble sodium arises the salinity difficulties associated with sulfate and chloride ions sarkar et al 2021 soluble sodium percentage ssp has been calculated by the following formula given by todd todd and mays 2004 7 s s p n a 2 k c a 2 m g 2 k n a 2 100 2 5 3 magnesium hazard mh intensity of magnesium concentration in water is the most significant qualitative measurement and to evaluate the standard of irrigation water balamurugan et al 2020 sodium percentage of soil is mainly responsible for the high magnitude of magnesium concentration in water alkalinity of any region is gradually increasing due to the high concentration of magnesium bhat et al 2016 in this connection the productivity and yielding capacity of crops decrease over time for the alkaline nature of the soil magnesium hazard mh has been calculated by following the formula 8 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 2 5 4 kelly s index ki kelly s index ki specifies the sodium concentration in soil and surface water in contradiction to the magnesium absorption kelly 1940 according to the standard value of kelly s index when the ki value is less than 1 it is acceptable while a value of ki is more than 1 is not suitable for irrigation purposes the equation of kelly s index is given as 9 k i n a 2 c a 2 m g 2 2 5 5 permeability index pi permeability of soil of any given region is determined by the salt concentration in irrigation water permeability index method is developed by doneen 1964 using certain criteria for quality measurement of irrigation water permeability is affected by the presence of cations and anions in irrigation water safiur rahman et al 2017 more specifically calcium magnesium and sodium chloride affect permeability adimalla et al 2021 el maghraby and bamousa 2021 the authors have calculated the permeability index pi using this formula 10 p i n a 2 h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a 2 3 result 3 1 hydrochemistry assessment of the groundwater the quality of water is measured by the nature and dissolved elements available in the water statistical analysis of dissolved elements in collected groundwater samples such as ph total dissolved solid tds electrical conductivity ec total hardness th fluoride f iron fe and other anions and cations are showed in table 3 in the post monsoon 2021 and pre monsoon season 2022 mean ph values of water samples are 6 99 and 6 92 respectively and it indicates that the groundwater is slightly acidic but maximum value of some samples is mostly alkaline type most of the samples stand within the permissible range 7 0 8 5 as per who 2011 guidelines in addition electrical conductivity ec shows the enrichment intensity of salt content in groundwater in this study mean value of ec 733 88 and 586 14 mg l in both years is less than 1500 μs cm indicating less salt enrichment in groundwater furthermore mean tds values 366 94 mg l and 293 07 mg l stand within acceptable limit according to who 2011 total hardness th depends on the occurrence of calcium and magnesium in groundwater and the who considered its permissible limit up to 500 mg l mean hardness values are 356 36 2021 and 363 91 2022 which indicate lower to moderate occurrence of calcium and magnesium while maximum hardness is found at 1298 6 mg l 2021 and 1438 2 mg l 2022 indicating the high concentration of hardness among the total samples calcium and sodium concentrations show the cation exchange among raw materials and those are dominant cations in groundwater like magnesium and potassium mean sodium concentrations are 63 47 mg l 2021 and 37 84 mg l 2022 which specify the high magnitude of na2 available in the water values of some samples come into the permissible limit in addition mean values of calcium concentration are 68 79 mg l 2021 and 73 76 mg l 2022 whereas magnesium concentration ranges from 37 54 mg l 2021 to 39 76 mg l 2022 simultaneously potassium concentration was a maximum of 78 67 mg l 2022 but in post monsoon seasons 2021 it was within the permissible limit chloride concentration was maximum 418 mg l in 2022 and maximum hco3 concentration of 465 mg l is found in 2021 additionally maximum so4 concentration was 154 mg l 2022 and the maximum fluoride f concentration is found at 2 09 mg l 2021 among total water samples in the year of 2021 cation concentration was in order of ca2 na2 mg2 k and anion was in order of hco3 co3 2 cl so4 fe f but in the year of 2022 cation concentration was in order of ca2 mg2 na2 k and anion was in order of hco3 cl co3 2 so4 fe f table 3 correlation matrix of different physicochemical parameters anion and cations are presented in fig 3 3 2 groundwater quality assessment for drinking purposes groundwater quality index gwqi of different parameters indicates the quality of water and suitability for drinking purposes this systematic study shows that index value varies from 51 75 to 171 18 during the post monsoon season of 2021 table 4 this year thirteen blocks of purulia district out of twenty blocks have good drinking water quality the result shows that purulia ii block has a maximum water quality index value of 171 18 which indicates poor water quality hura bundwan jhalda ii manbazar i purulia i purulia ii and santuri blocks are also classified as poor water quality fig 4 among all blocks kashipur block has the best water quality the water quality index in 2022 ranges from 70 27 to 178 45 and twelve blocks showed good water quality those blocks that fall into poor water quality categories in 2021 will also fall into poor water quality categories in 2022 raghunathpur ii block comes under poor water quality in the pre monsoon season of 2022 and it indicates that in the pre monsoon season quality of groundwater is lowering down previous research in some sections of the study area has investigated this fact and concluded that it occurs as a result of ion exchange in the aquifer zone chakraborty et al 2022 kundu and nag 2018 3 3 water quality assessment for irrigation purposes agriculture is the most important economic factor in the purulia district and most of the people are engaged in the agricultural sector several crops including rice wheat cereals pulses and oilseeds are grown in this area in this connection evaluating irrigation water is crucial and irrigation water quality has been evaluated using hydro chemical facies piper plot and durov s diagram and index calculative methods mukhopadhyay et al 2022 ravikumar et al 2015 groundwater chemistry has been calculated through the sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh kelly s index ki and permeability index pi table 5 3 3 1 sodium absorption ratio sar sar values in purulia district range from 4 78 to 21 68with an average value 9 012 2021 and 3 05 to 2 74 with an average value 5 246 2022 according to sar fourteen blocks in 2021 and nineteen blocks in 2022 have excellent and good water quality respectively however purulia ii block falls into the permissible category in 2021 while they fall into the excellent category in 2022 table 2 diagram illustrates that the sodium hazards of this region and the spatial distribution of sar are presented in fig 4 3 3 2 soluble sodium percentage ssp soluble sodium percentage has been analyzed and the result shows that it ranged from 16 22 to 72 28 with an average of 37 60 2021 and 15 55 to 71 42 with an average of 37 48 2022 in 2021 water samples of three blocks fall into the excellent ten blocks in good five blocks in permissible and two blocks come under the doubtful categories table 2 simultaneously in 2022 three blocks fall into the excellent eight blocks come under good and seven blocks fall into permissible and two blocks come under the doubtful water quality more precisely purulia ii and hura blocks come under the doubtful category in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of both years the spatial distribution of ssp has been shown in fig 5 3 3 3 permeability index pi the permeability index is ranged from 20 38 to 85 51 with an average value of 45 074 nineteen blocks of this region come under the good soil permeability except for purulia ii which falls into the moderate category but in 2022 each block under the study area falls into the good quality for soil permeability fig 6 3 3 4 magnesium hazard mh from the analysis of magnesium hazard values of all samples range from 3 27 to 75 75 with an average of 37 48 2021 and 10 49 to 56 22 with an average of 38 06 2022 table 2 in 2021 eighteen blocks of purulia district come under the suitable for irrigation whereas 19 blocks come under the suitable category in 2022 furthermore the result of the samples indicates that hura block is unsuitable for irrigation in both the years spatial distribution of mh shows in fig 5 3 3 5 kelly s index ki results of kelly s index reveal that the values range from 0 18 to 2 4 with an average of 0 676 in 2021 in comparison it fluctuates between 0 12 and 0 11 with an average of 0 37 in 2022 about eighteen blocks fall into the suitable for irrigation in 2021 and 2022 correspondingly table 4 however just similar to the magnesium hazard ki result of the water samples of the hura block in both years are also indicating unsuitable for irrigation fig 6 4 discussion the present study reveals that groundwater quality for drinking purpose during 2021 was slightly better compared with 2022 in terms of concentration of ph among all blocks did not exceed the standard range 6 5 8 5 prescribed by who 2011 occurrence of moderate ec and tds in both study years indicates medium salt concentration because of the industrial sewage magnitude of groundwater recharge in this particular region is mainly taken place through the seepage of irrigation canals and return flow from the canal as well as rivers and the rain water bera and das 2021 in post monsoon season electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids are higher which are affected by industrial irrigated seepage of monsoonal rainfall than in the pre monsoon season urban electronic and domestic wastes are mixed with water and it is a noteworthy concern in town areas in india verma et al 2018 this area also heavily depends on irrigation to fulfill agricultural demand and sewage from both domestic and industrial sources affects the water quality nearby purulia town high temperature and evaporation regulate the concentration of chemical elements in semi arid regions which affect plants and soil by increasing the soil salinity adimalla et al 2020 aouiti et al 2021 similarly high salinity harms plant growth which leads to nutritional problems in plants läuchli and epstein 1990 according to the us salinity diagram 1954 the majority of the area falls under the c2s1 c3s1 and c3s2 categories which denote medium to high salinity and low to medium sodium hazards respectively fig 7 the continuous use of this waters for farming increases the level of soil salinity and restricts the production of agricultural yields in this province the presence of wastewater from industrial hubs percolated through runoff and mixed with groundwater during monsoon months verma et al 2018 this phenomenon is ultimately deciding the quantity and magnitude of anions and cations in this study water quality parameters are not well adjusted in this region due to nearly non point sources of contaminants this region comes under the chota nagpur gneissic complex cgc and precambrian granitic rocks such as gneiss and pegmatite are dominant in this section bera and ghosh 2019 as a consequence the groundwater chemistry of entire region is influenced by weathering and interaction process of water with rocks mechanical weathering and deep chemical weathering are very much active in this vast tract which affects significantly water quality as an example the calcium concentration of water originates from several minerals such as amphiboles and feldspars fluorite and apatite adimalla et al 2020 in this study general hydrochemistry of water samples reveals that weathered materials as well as minerals mixed with the groundwater furthermore chemical deposition in water derives from different natural sources such as warm blooded animal waste and rock decomposition ortiz 2004 this study also relates these factors that influence the chemical properties of groundwater feldspar mica and biotite are influencing the magnitude of na and k concentration in water bucher et al 2017 the richness of those minerals in jhalda i and ii balarampur blocks is the foremost reason for na and k concentration in water samples fluoride concentration in this part of the chota nagpur plateau region depends on the weathering materials and rocks bera et al 2021 bera et al 2022 bera and ghosh 2019 hydro geochemistry results demonstrate that the weathering of rock and contributions from human and agricultural sources are principally influencing the composition of the groundwater in this region kundu and nag 2018 fluoride concentration in water samples of this region is crossed the permissible limit which similarly specifies this fact based on the piper plot piper s 1944 cations and anions in water samples show that maximum samples fall into field 5 which reveals the type of calcium magnesium bicarbonate and maximum water of this region is suitable for irrigation fig 8 furthermore durov plot or combined plots with two separate ternary diagrams with ph and tds have been plotted and it represents no dominant anions and cations in water samples from the applied irrigation water quality indices of collected water samples it is stated that the groundwater in the hura and purulia ii blocks is slightly unsuitable for irrigation and the majority of the purulia district said to be good or suitable for irrigation in this extended portion of the chota nagpur plateau groundwater quality and storage are controlled primarily by the fractures joints and weathered remnants of the rock structure bera et al 2021 this is the main reason for the spatial disparity in water quality components in this area 5 conclusion according to the water quality index purulia ii block has extremely bad water quality for both drinking and irrigation purposes in both the years 2021 and 2022 although the major parts of this district show medium to high salinity hazard which indicates the potential threat for groundwater irrigation in the present and future applying additional water quality indices larger part of the purulia district has good or suitable for the recent times but water quality of the hura and purulia ii blocks show that it may become hazardous in the future feldspar and biotite minerals of granite and gneiss accelerate the bicarbonate and chloride ions in groundwater through water rock interaction thus the quality of the groundwater is massively influenced by the lithology of the bedrocks domestic and industrial effluents at the vicinity of town areas hura and purulia ii blocks also significantly influence the standard of the water quality hydro chemical facies through piper ussl and durov diagram showed medium to high salinity and low to medium sodium hazards in this region urban and industrial sewage treatment should be done before discharges into rivers consequently the execution of appropriate actions is needed for salinity hazard prone zones additional multi annual and integrated support programmes for the improvement of bio fertilizers use in agricultural system and sustainable water use or integrated watershed management in dryland area should be encouraged this study highlighted that quality of ground water has been significantly deteriorated due to natural and anthropogenic sources large scale use of bio fertilizer training program should be arranged in every community blocks within the study area for the health of the surface water as well as ground water the mechanism of bio composting should be extended to the micro farmers for improvement of soil fertility as well as productivity use of green manures should be expanded for the health of the soil and groundwater excessive chemical fertilizers should be restricted for the health of the total environment however the results of this study will assist administrators and decision makers in making any policies regarding the management of groundwater resources and agricultural sustainability more research and development are highly essential for the improvement of sustainable groundwater development and management particularly for this semi arid environment declaration of

groundwater a censorious resource for the current and upcoming generations have facilitated significant socio economic growth enhanced food security and mollified drought in numerous farming regions of different climatic zones giordano and villholth 2007 gleeson et al 2012 the present groundwater statistics central water commission 2021 and scientific literature das and pal 2020 khezzani and bouchemal 2018 kumar and singh 2008 pandey et al 2013 indicate that the groundwater resources are declining due to overexploitation which has questioned its sustainability thus for the groundwater sustainability the component of groundwater recharge is of utmost importance for the terrains facing severe water crisis the district dangs in western india is an extension of rugged trappean highlands of the western ghats despite receiving high average annual rainfall 2000 mm it faces severe water scarcity due to its physiographic setup and uniformly dispensed less transmissible lithology

emphasized in detail by considering the compound influence of parameters such as landforms gc drainage characteristics dc and slope sc on groundwater recharge for each sub watershed 4 1 landforms the

identified through visual image interpretation of fcc of irs liss iii may 2019 the srtm dem google earth and ground truth verification is used to verify the demarcated geomorphic features fig 4 the flat top surfaces of the linear ridges and plateaus mark the planation surfaces the planation surfaces fall in flat to very gently sloping category which increase the duration of surface contact of water and facilitate groundwater recharge therefore it is characterized by moderate gwrpot the escarpments are near vertical or almost vertically sloping faces with negligible gwrpot however at the base where there is a break in slope i e steep slope is followed by gentler slope runoff from the vertically sloping faces accumulates at the base and hence increase the possibilities of groundwater recharge sarkar et al 2001 the basaltic flows of deccan traps in the region are horizontally disposed as plateaus these plateaus have been classified on the basis of drainage dissection as highly moderately and low dissected plateaus highly dissected plateau hdp regions indicate high runoff zones due to their less transmissible nature and high drainage density leading to fine drainage texture babar 2005 dongare et al 2022 hence these are the areas with poor groundwater accumulation on the other hand the low dissected plateau ldp with gentle slopes low to moderate drainage densities and coarse drainage texture increase the chances of infiltration and thereby groundwater recharge in between the moderately dissected plateau mdp with moderate drainage densities and drainage texture constitutes low to moderate groundwater recharge pediments are gently sloping surfaces with veneer of weathered and colluvial material ravindran and jeyaram 1997 these are usually the narrow strip of land at the foothills of the highly dissected plateau and adjacent to the pediplain area the groundwater accumulation in these geomorphic units is usually moderate but may enhance on account of high

groundwater repository these are significantly observed at the confluence of river khapri with ambica near village vati valley fills are mainly consisting of weathered products of the surrounding basaltic rocks gravels pebbles sand and silt sized particles deposited by the action of stream transport and gravity the possibility of groundwater accumulation in this landform is good to excellent due to inherent high primary porosity and permeability the aerial distribution of landforms of khapri watershed is represented by geomorphic map and pie diagram table 1 fig 3a 4 2 drainage characteristics the drainage characteristics significantly influences the hydrological processes and thereby gwrpot of the watershed dongare et al 2022 in the present study the drainage characteristics table 1 fig 3b such as mean bifurcation ratio infiltration number and elongation ratio are considered for determining the gwrpot due to their strong influence on infiltration phenomenon 4 2 1 mean bifurcation ratio rbm mean bifurcation ratio rbm is of prime importance in understanding the hydrological characteristics of the watershed high values of rbm indicate high drainage density and reflect high runoff and less transmissibility in the watershed the rbm of eleven sub watersheds of khapri is ranging from 3 3 sw 2 to 4 3 sw 10 table 1 indicating predominance of lithological control over structural rai et al 2017 the increase in rbm implies to increasing drainage density responsible for constituting high runoff compared to infiltration eze and efiong 2010 4 2 2 infiltration number i f the drainage characteristics such as drainage density stream frequency and drainage texture provide an idea about terrain dissection related drainage development runoff and infiltration processes the areas with high drainage density and stream frequency are highly dissected in nature reflect fine drainage texture and are not favourable for water infiltration smith 1950 tarboton et al 1992 on the other hand the relatively lower drainage density and stream frequency reflect coarse texture and are favourable for water infiltration instead of qualitative description of drainage texture the quantitative analysis of drainage density and stream frequency in the form of infiltration number if is considered as one of the geomorphic indicators the if indicates the infiltration potential of the watershed prabhakaran and jawahar raj 2018 it is product of stream frequency and drainage density the lower values of if indicate higher infiltration and vice versa bhatt and ahmed 2014 romshoo et al 2012 the sw 2 sw 3 sw 1 and sw 4 with low values of if indicate relatively higher infiltration potential leading to conditions favourable for groundwater recharge table 1 4 2 3 elongation ratio re shape factor such as elongation ratio re of the watershed governs the hydrograph and is influenced by area and length of the watershed meshram and sharma 2018 prasad and pani 2017 schumn 1956 the elongated nature of sub watershed favours longer flow durations and manifests flat peaks on hydrograph increasing the possibility of infiltration therefore it is considered as one of the governing geomorphic indicators of groundwater accumulation elongation ratio table 1 suggests that sub watersheds sw 1 sw 3 sw 4 sw 6 sw 9 and sw 11 are less elongated whereas sw 2 sw 5 and sw 10 are more elongated as per the classification given by venkatesan 2014 4 3 slope slope is one of the significant geomorphic indicators that remarkably governs runoff and infiltration capacity of the soils in watershed nassif and wilson 1975 in general the gentle slopes allow water to remain in contact with the surface for longer durations and percolate underground compared to the moderate and steep slopes however the effect of slope may be modified with respect to landforms and drainage characteristics slope is intimately associated with elevation which increases with an increase in elevation from west to east as well as from north to south in the study area according to deota and nikhil 1995 slope is the major controlling factor in the study area also dongare et al 2022 showed that about 36 area of khapri watershed possesses flat to gentle slopes whereas around 64 exhibits moderate to steep slopes the slope categories fig 3c and percent aerial coverage in individual sub watersheds are represented in table 1 5 sub watershed wise identification of groundwater recharge potential gwrpot and prioritization geomorphic indicators landforms drainage characteristics and slope significantly influence the groundwater accumulation and are useful to determine gwrpot based on the gwrpot and aerial coverage of landform the ranks are assigned in other words the landform which has an excellent gwrpot and has largest aerial coverage in the sub watershed is ranked 1 the consequent landform with same recharge potential and second largest aerial coverage is ranked 2 and so forth similarly the sub watershed with largest aerial coverage of landform characterized by very poor potential of groundwater recharge is ranked 11 while sub watershed representing second largest aerial coverage of landform with same potential is ranked 10 and so on ultimately the individual ranks for all sub watersheds were averaged to obtain the compound value gc table 2 in drainage characteristics the mean bifurcation ratio rbm infiltration number if and elongation ratios re are used for identification of gwrpot the mean bifurcation ratio rbm infiltration number if and elongation ratio re vary inversely with gwrpot therefore the sub watershed with lowest values of these parameters is ranked 1 similarly the sub watershed with higher values of these parameters indicates low infiltration potential and is ranked 11 the ranks of these parameters for individual sub watersheds are averaged to obtain the compound value dc table 2 the slope for khapri watershed ranges between 0 and 67 it is categorized into seven classes viz 0 3 flat 3 6 very gently sloping 6 10 gently sloping 10 18 moderately sloping 18 35 moderately steep sloping 35 45 steeply sloping and 45 very steep sloping dongare et al 2022 the flat to very gently sloping categories provide enough scope for runoff to infiltrate and enhance the groundwater recharge therefore the sub watershed with highest aerial coverage of flat sloping 0 3 category is ranked 1 the sub watershed with highest aerial coverage of very gently sloping 3 6 category is ranked 2 and so on the ranks of slope classes for individual sub watersheds have been then averaged to obtain compound value for slope sc table 2 finally for each sub watershed the geomorphic indicators g i gc dc sc are calculated as summation of compound values of landforms gc drainage characteristics dc and slope sc table 2 on the basis of g i the gwrpot is identified and categorized as very poor poor moderate good very good and excellent table 2 fig 3d the sub watershed with highest g i value is assigned first rank suggesting excellent gwrpot accordingly sw 6 falls in excellent category followed by sw 1 sw 8 sw 9 in very good category and sw 11 in good category these sub watersheds can be given priority starting from last to improve groundwater recharge the sw 5 with lowest g i value exhibits very poor gwrpot therefore can be considered at first priority for improving the groundwater recharge the sw 7 and sw 4 with moderate recharge potential followed by sw 3 sw 2 and sw 10 all having poor recharge potential can be considered at priority after sw 5 for improving the groundwater recharge table 2 fig 6 these results are validated with seasonal groundwater level fluctuation data 6 correlation of geomorphic indicators with groundwater fluctuation groundwater fluctuation in each sub watershed is studied through groundwater depth data collected in post november 2021 and pre monsoon may 2022 seasons from 33 dug wells it is used to validate the results of gwrpot obtained by assessing geomorphic indicators lowest total groundwater fluctuation is observed for sw 5 7 65 m while the highest is observed in case of sw 6 12 5 m lower groundwater fluctuations indicate low infiltration whereas higher groundwater fluctuations indicate relatively higher infiltration varni et al 2013 the scatter plot fig 5 shows positive correlation between g i and groundwater fluctuation r2 0 77 i e as the g i values increase fluctuation increases and vice versa thus around 77 variation in groundwater fluctuation can be explained by g i 7 discussion the study area despite high rainfall faces severe water scarcity on account of rugged topographic setup and uniformly dispensed less transmissible lithology of dvp dongare et al 2022 pancholi et al 2022 this issue persists due to lack of understanding on controls of geomorphic indicators over the occurrence of gwrpot in this study the geomorphic indicators are analyzed to highlight their control over the gwrpot at sub watershed level the sub watersheds exhibit unique assemblages of landforms drainage characteristics and slope with varying capacity of runoff infiltration the landforms such as alluvial plains ldp mdp pediplain pediment are good to moderate while hdp and planation surfaces are moderate to poor promoters of groundwater recharge gurav et al 2019 gurav and babar 2019 table 1 high values of rbm indicate high drainage density and reflect less transmissibility and high runoff bogale 2021 as also observed in the khapri watershed table 1 low values of i f indicate relatively higher infiltration potential umrikar 2017 arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2017 leading to conditions favourable for groundwater recharge in the khapri watershed table 1 the elongated nature of sub watersheds of khapri favour longer flow durations and thereby increase groundwater recharge table 1 which is also found true in case of other sub watersheds balasubramanian et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 thus these drainage characteristics of khapri watershed indicate an inverse relation with gwrpot in khapri watershed more than 63 percent area possesses steep to moderate slope categories while about 36 percent area is covered under flat to gently sloping categories dongare et al 2022 the flat to very gently sloping categories provide enough scope for infiltration in khapri watershed thereby enhancing the groundwater recharge as also found in watershed of other regions rajaveni et al 2017 sahu et al 2022 yeh et al 2009 the application of knowledge driven geostatistical approach on unique combinations of geomorphic indicators has resulted into identification of gwrpot and prioritization of the sub watersheds the high level of statistical correlation 77 obtained between seasonal groundwater level fluctuations and geomorphic indicators suggests their significant control on spatial distribution of gwrpot in khapri watershed a similar influence of geomorphology on gwrpot in other watersheds has also been highlighted by krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 rajaveni et al 2017 and saraf and choudhury 1998 the correlation obtained in present approach with only selected parameters landforms drainage characteristics and slope is in good agreement with ahp and mcda based studies using multiple parameters geology geomorphology slope lineament soil drainage landuse to identify gwrpot and sub watershed prioritization avinash et al 2011 avinash et al 2014 das et al 2022 das and pal 2019 javed et al 2009 kanth and hassan 2012 rekha et al 2011 upwanshi et al 2023 zghibi et al 2020 the exclusive use of geomorphic indicators for geostatistical analysis has reduced the redundancy induced by parameters providing similar inferences and thereby the time required for generating a database of multiple parameters the studies on stable isotopes will be useful to strengthen the results derived for gwrpot the sub watershed prioritization based on gwrpot has highlighted the need to improve the recharge activities in the study area it can be practically presumed that sub watersheds possessing very poor potential of natural groundwater recharge should be given first priority in watershed development plans to enhance the recharge through relevant groundwater augmenting structures 8 conclusion 1 the present study highlights the importance of geomorphic indicators in identification of gwrpot 2 this approach has reduced the redundancy of multiple parameters and thereby the time required for generating a database 3 moreover the results of the geospatial and geostatistical analyses are validated by ground truth verification as well as pre and post monsoon groundwater levels 4 as per the linear regression analysis around 77 variation in groundwater fluctuation can be explained by geomorphic indicators which credence the analysis undertaken 5 the sub watersheds characterized by very poor to moderate recharge potential sw 5 sw 10 sw 2 sw 3 sw 4 and sw 7 should be considered at priority in watershed development plans to enhance the recharge by equipping them with relevant groundwater augmenting structures 6 the present approach can be used with suitable modifications for other regions having similar topographic and geologic setup funding information this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

and ahmed 2014 romshoo et al 2012 the sw 2 sw 3 sw 1 and sw 4 with low values of if indicate relatively higher infiltration potential leading to conditions favourable for groundwater recharge table 1 4 2 3 elongation ratio re shape factor such as elongation ratio re of the watershed governs the hydrograph and is influenced by area and length of the watershed meshram and sharma 2018 prasad and pani 2017 schumn 1956 the elongated nature of sub watershed favours longer flow durations and manifests flat peaks on hydrograph increasing the possibility of infiltration therefore it is considered as one of the governing geomorphic indicators of groundwater accumulation elongation ratio table 1 suggests that sub watersheds sw 1 sw 3 sw 4 sw 6 sw 9 and sw 11 are less elongated whereas sw 2 sw 5 and sw 10 are more elongated as per the classification given by venkatesan 2014 4 3 slope slope is one of the significant geomorphic indicators that remarkably governs runoff and infiltration capacity of the soils in watershed nassif and wilson 1975 in general the gentle slopes allow water to remain in contact with the surface for longer durations and percolate underground compared to the moderate and steep slopes however the effect of slope may be modified with respect to landforms and drainage characteristics slope is intimately associated with elevation which increases with an increase in elevation from west to east as well as from north to south in the study area according to deota and nikhil 1995 slope is the major controlling factor in the study area also dongare et al 2022 showed that about 36 area of khapri watershed possesses flat to gentle slopes whereas around 64 exhibits moderate to steep slopes the slope categories fig 3c and percent aerial coverage in individual sub watersheds are represented in table 1 5 sub watershed wise identification of groundwater recharge potential gwrpot and prioritization geomorphic indicators landforms drainage characteristics and slope significantly influence the groundwater accumulation and are useful to determine gwrpot based on the gwrpot and aerial coverage of landform the ranks are assigned in other words the landform which has an excellent gwrpot and has largest aerial coverage in the sub watershed is ranked 1 the consequent landform with same recharge potential and second largest aerial coverage is ranked 2 and so forth similarly the sub watershed with largest aerial coverage of landform characterized by very poor potential of groundwater recharge is ranked 11 while sub watershed representing second largest aerial coverage of landform with same potential is ranked 10 and so on ultimately the individual ranks for all sub watersheds were averaged to obtain the compound value gc table 2 in drainage characteristics the mean bifurcation ratio rbm infiltration number if and elongation ratios re are used for identification of gwrpot the mean bifurcation ratio rbm infiltration number if and elongation ratio re vary inversely with gwrpot therefore the sub watershed with lowest values of these parameters is ranked 1 similarly the sub watershed with higher values of these parameters indicates low infiltration potential and is ranked 11 the ranks of these parameters for individual sub watersheds are averaged to obtain the compound value dc table 2 the slope for khapri watershed ranges between 0 and 67 it is categorized into seven classes viz 0 3 flat 3 6 very gently sloping 6 10 gently sloping 10 18 moderately sloping 18 35 moderately steep sloping 35 45 steeply sloping and 45 very steep sloping dongare et al 2022 the flat to very gently sloping categories provide enough scope for runoff to infiltrate and enhance the groundwater recharge therefore the sub watershed with highest aerial coverage of flat sloping 0 3 category is ranked 1 the sub watershed with highest aerial coverage of very gently sloping 3 6 category is ranked 2 and so on the ranks of slope classes for individual sub watersheds have been then averaged to obtain compound value for slope sc table 2 finally for each sub watershed the geomorphic indicators g i gc dc sc are calculated as summation of compound values of landforms gc drainage characteristics dc and slope sc table 2 on the basis of g i the gwrpot is identified and categorized as very poor poor moderate good very good and excellent table 2 fig 3d the sub watershed with highest g i value is assigned first rank suggesting excellent gwrpot accordingly sw 6 falls in excellent category followed by sw 1 sw 8 sw 9 in very good category and sw 11 in good category these sub watersheds can be given priority starting from last to improve groundwater recharge the sw 5 with lowest g i value exhibits very poor gwrpot therefore can be considered at first priority for improving the groundwater recharge the sw 7 and sw 4 with moderate recharge potential followed by sw 3 sw 2 and sw 10 all having poor recharge potential can be considered at priority after sw 5 for improving the groundwater recharge table 2 fig 6 these results are validated with seasonal groundwater level fluctuation data 6 correlation of geomorphic indicators with groundwater fluctuation groundwater fluctuation in each sub watershed is studied through groundwater depth data collected in post november 2021 and pre monsoon may 2022 seasons from 33 dug wells it is used to validate the results of gwrpot obtained by assessing geomorphic indicators lowest total groundwater fluctuation is observed for sw 5 7 65 m while the highest is observed in case of sw 6 12 5 m lower groundwater fluctuations indicate low infiltration whereas higher groundwater fluctuations indicate relatively higher infiltration varni et al 2013 the scatter plot fig 5 shows positive correlation between g i and groundwater fluctuation r2 0 77 i e as the g i values increase fluctuation increases and vice versa thus around 77 variation in groundwater fluctuation can be explained by g i 7 discussion the study area despite high rainfall faces severe water scarcity on account of rugged topographic setup and uniformly dispensed less transmissible lithology of dvp dongare et al 2022 pancholi et al 2022 this issue persists due to lack of understanding on controls of geomorphic indicators over the occurrence of gwrpot in this study the geomorphic indicators are analyzed to highlight their control over the gwrpot at sub watershed level the sub watersheds exhibit unique assemblages of landforms drainage characteristics and slope with varying capacity of runoff infiltration the landforms such as alluvial plains ldp mdp pediplain pediment are good to moderate while hdp and planation surfaces are moderate to poor promoters of groundwater recharge gurav et al 2019 gurav and babar 2019 table 1 high values of rbm indicate high drainage density and reflect less transmissibility and high runoff bogale 2021 as also observed in the khapri watershed table 1 low values of i f indicate relatively higher infiltration potential umrikar 2017 arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2017 leading to conditions favourable for groundwater recharge in the khapri watershed table 1 the elongated nature of sub watersheds of khapri favour longer flow durations and thereby increase groundwater recharge table 1 which is also found true in case of other sub watersheds balasubramanian et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 thus these drainage characteristics of khapri watershed indicate an inverse relation with gwrpot in khapri watershed more than 63 percent area possesses steep to moderate slope categories while about 36 percent area is covered under flat to gently sloping categories dongare et al 2022 the flat to very gently sloping categories provide enough scope for infiltration in khapri watershed thereby enhancing the groundwater recharge as also found in watershed of other regions rajaveni et al 2017 sahu et al 2022 yeh et al 2009 the application of knowledge driven geostatistical approach on unique combinations of geomorphic indicators has resulted into identification of gwrpot and prioritization of the sub watersheds the high level of statistical correlation 77 obtained between seasonal groundwater level fluctuations and geomorphic indicators suggests their significant control on spatial distribution of gwrpot in khapri watershed a similar influence of geomorphology on gwrpot in other watersheds has also been highlighted by krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 rajaveni et al 2017 and saraf and choudhury 1998 the correlation obtained in present approach with only selected parameters landforms drainage characteristics and slope is in good agreement with ahp and mcda based studies using multiple parameters geology geomorphology slope lineament soil drainage landuse to identify gwrpot and sub watershed prioritization avinash et al 2011 avinash et al 2014 das et al 2022 das and pal 2019 javed et al 2009 kanth and hassan 2012 rekha et al 2011 upwanshi et al 2023 zghibi et al 2020 the exclusive use of geomorphic indicators for geostatistical analysis has reduced the redundancy induced by parameters providing similar inferences and thereby the time required for generating a database of multiple parameters the studies on stable isotopes will be useful to strengthen the results derived for gwrpot the sub watershed prioritization based on gwrpot has highlighted the need to improve the recharge activities in the study area it can be practically presumed that sub watersheds possessing very poor potential of natural groundwater recharge should be given first priority in watershed development plans to enhance the recharge through relevant groundwater augmenting structures 8 conclusion 1 the present study highlights the importance of geomorphic indicators in identification of gwrpot 2 this approach has reduced the redundancy of multiple parameters and thereby the time required for generating a database 3 moreover the results of the geospatial and geostatistical analyses are validated by ground truth verification as well as pre and post monsoon groundwater levels 4 as per the linear regression analysis around 77 variation in groundwater fluctuation can be explained by geomorphic indicators which credence the analysis undertaken 5 the sub watersheds characterized by very poor to moderate recharge potential sw 5 sw 10 sw 2 sw 3 sw 4 and sw 7 should be considered at priority in watershed development plans to enhance the recharge by equipping them with relevant groundwater augmenting structures 6 the present approach can be used with suitable modifications for other regions having similar topographic and geologic setup funding information this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

11637,spatio temporal studies of groundwater recharge establish a groundwork for comprehending the effects of climate and land use change on groundwater resources particularly in areas where groundwater is a primary source of water such as the internal drainage basin idb tanzania therefore quantification of groundwater recharge for years the 2050s and 2080s was executed using the swat in bahi manyoni catchment bmc in idb shared socioeconomic pathways ssps climate scenarios particularly ssp245 as medium emission and ssp585 as high emission scenario were used monthly calibration and validation of the swat model were performed by using streamflow data from a gauged sub catchment within bmc obtained nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for the calibration period from 1971 to 1982 was 0 79 and for the validation period from 1983 to 1990 was 0 69 later performed another validation using actual evapotranspiration in an ungauged bmc achieved nse of 0 59 the findings from calibrated model depicted under the impact of climate change alone it was estimated that there will be a slight increase in overall annual average groundwater recharge of 3 05 mm y under ssp245 and to 5 12 mm y under ssp585 in year 2050s whereas under collective impact of climate and lulc change an increase of 2 31 mm y under ssp245 and of 3 98 mm y under ssp585 in year 2080s from a baseline of 4 5 mm y in 1980s this indicates the impact of lulc alone to be trivial in the steep slope areas the catchment with 15 reduced rainfall will experience lower recharge of up to 24 whereas gentle slope areas with a 25 increase in rainfall will experience a recharge of up to 123 compared to the baseline period established groundwater recharge zones give imperative information to idb managers in relation to water management plans to optimize future groundwater recharge graphical abstract image 1 keywords bahi manyoni catchment bmc groundwater recharge internal drainage basin idb shared socioeconomic pathways ssps soil and water assessment tool swat tanzania data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role in supporting the water demands of livelihoods and ecosystems across the globe however due to growing water needs brought by population growth escalating industrialization and agricultural intensification this source of water has been overused and ill managed leading to its rapid depletion in various regions bouwer 2000 tularam and krishna 2009 ponce 2011 wang et al 2018 jia et al 2020 for the last 50 years the global groundwater extraction rate has increased by approximately six fold and still is increasing at an annual rate of between 1 and 2 konikow 2011 gun 2012 fao 2016 the battle to meet the growing water demands is inevitable and groundwater extraction will be further intensified excessive groundwater extraction causes irreversible land subsidence which possess a serious problem for groundwater recharge rafiei et al 2022 tang et al 2022 the problem is further intensified by the impact of climate change making groundwater resources exceedingly vulnerable paivada et al 2020 busico et al 2021 for instance sandstrom 1995 found that a 15 reduction in annual rainfall could reduce about 40 50 in annual groundwater recharge the problem of reduced groundwater recharge could be worsened in climate disadvantaged areas such as arid and semi arid regions studies conducted by rwebugisa 2008 and seddon 2019 found little to no groundwater recharge when annual rainfall is below 400 mm furthermore numerous studies have concurred on degree of collective impact of both climate and land use and land cover lulc changes being higher than individual changes on groundwater recharge bucton et al 2022 hachemaoui et al 2022 mengistu et al 2022 this brings concern to the groundwater recharge and consequently sustainability of groundwater resources getting an upper hand on groundwater resources management for future sustainability joint forces from local to international levels towards contribution to sustainable development goals 6 sdg6 agenda 2030 as well as a shared global vision for groundwater governance 2030 is expected hence a thorough evaluation of overall hydrological processes including groundwater recharge is required busico et al 2021 since groundwater recharge rates are dependent on local geomorphology climate and land cover delineation of high and low recharge zones is necessary for sustainable groundwater exploitation even more so in regions where groundwater recharge is limited such as regions with limited rainfall amounts including arid and semi arid rapid population growth and extensive agriculture there are several hydrological models that are useful for groundwater recharge estimations the categorization of these hydrological models varies from empirical i e little consideration of physical features to physically based where relevant meaningful physical hydrological processes are represented jajarmizadeh 2012 devi et al 2015 among the pertinent and widely applied physically based hydrological models are hec hms mike she and swat sahu et al 2023 mike she is limited to smaller catchments and requires a license to use on the other hand swat and hec hms are in the public domain devi et al 2015 sahu et al 2023 many studies employ these open access models chunn et al 2019 wei liu et al 2019 yifru et al 2020a 2020b sanjay shekar and vinay 2021 dekongmen et al 2022 fanta and sime 2022 aqnouy et al 2023 which increases their popularity and advancements both swat and hec hms models outperform one another when applied in different catchments indicating their matching competency aqnouy et al 2023 fanta and sime 2022 sanjay shekar and vinay 2021 however unlike hec hms which is only semi distributed and incorporates crucial hydrologic information in lumped form the swat model operates on the units of the same land use soil types and slope referred to as hydrological response unit hru making the swat model more desirable for catchment representation limitations of the swat model are mostly related to the accuracy of the applied climate data and the period used for validation marin et al 2020 overcoming these limitations involves using numerous data rich weather and rainfall stations and longer calibration and validation periods several studies in tanzania have applied the swat model to assess various aspects of hydrological processes in rufiji wami ruvu and pangani basins twisa et al 2020 said et al 2021 mazengo et al 2022 however well known studies on groundwater recharge in central tanzania including those conducted by shindo 1991 rwebugisa 2008 and seddon 2019 used water quality analysis thornthwaite s method and mike she and were limited to the makutupora basin another study in central tanzania by mussa et al 2021 focused on groundwater recharge in the singida aquifer using the soil water balance method beyond these aforementioned studies limited studies have been conducted in other central parts of tanzania particularly in the bmc area to investigate groundwater recharge using the swat model bmc is one of the ungauged catchments in idb categorized as water scarce based on the falkenmark water stress indicator since water availability is less than 1000 m 3 cap year mow 2019 the water scarcity in bmc resulted in its strong reliance on groundwater resources mussa et al 2020 since the catchment is now experiencing rapid immigration owing to tanzania s new capital city dodoma and other expanding cities within the catchment including singida kondoa and manyoni increased groundwater resource utilization is expected limited knowledge of the hydrological processes such as recharge in the catchment poses threat to the sustainability of future groundwater resources therefore this work intends to estimate groundwater recharge in ungauged bmc under changing climate and lulc scenarios using the swat model in this study the concept of ungauged catchment refers to catchments with no streamflow records the obtained information on the delineated high and low groundwater recharge zones from this study provides imperative information to idb managers for sustainable groundwater management in the catchment 2 materials and methods details on a description of the study area data acquisition and analysis swat model structure model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis as well as prediction of future groundwater recharge under medium and high emission scenarios were elaborated in the subsections below fig 1 shows the methodological approach that was applied to this study 2 1 description of the study area the bmc is situated in the central part of tanzania covering a total area of 24 716 4 k m 2 the catchment has two major rivers which are bubu and mponde both pouring their water into lake sulunga also known as bahi swamp as indicated in fig 2 the mean elevation of the bmc is 1235 m a s l with the maximum being 3402 m a s l and the minimum being 809 m a s l the climate is semi arid with a unimodal rainfall pattern received rainfall amount in bmc is between 510 and 720 mm y with an average temperature ranging from 16 c to 27 c the wet season begins in december and ends in may while the dry season is from june to november the seasons are further subdivided into heavy rains from december to february as djf light rains from march to may as mam dry with cool temperatures from june to august as jja and dry with warm temperatures from september to november as son hersi et al 2023 dominant geological units in bmc are alluvial and eluvial deposits in the northeast wembere formation in the northwest patches of older and young igneous outcrops in the central northern and southern parts as well as large patches of mbuga soil which is black clay soil prevailing in seasonal swamps urt 2020 these geological units in the area have low permeability which limits percolation furthermore low permeable basement rocks formed mainly by granite and basaltic rocks are stretched out nearly throughout the catchment based on measurements of vertical electrical sounding ves taken at several locations in the bmc catchment it was found that the depth of the bedrock varied significantly idbwo 2014a 2014b 2015 2019 the shallowest bedrock was found in the northeast part of the catchment at maji ya shamba street and kichangani both in kondoa district at depths between 2 5 m and 19 m idbwo 2015 the deepest bedrock was found in mbwasa village in bahi district in the southwest at depths of 60 m 136 m idbwo 2014b this suggests that the direction of groundwater flow is likely from the northern to the southern part of the catchment furthermore fig 3 shows resistivities of various layers in boreholes drilled at bmc which can provide a highlight on types of aquifers in the study area based on nabighian 1988 for the relationship between resistivity values of various in situ earth materials and water permeability it can then be inferred that the majority of the boreholes in fig 3 were drilled in unconfined aquifers with only a few in semi confined aquifers bh4 bh6 bh10 in manyoni bh6 in kondoa and bh2 in bahi and confined aquifers bh4 bh8 in kondoa district therefore there is a higher chance of groundwater percolating to greater depths for unconfined areas there are also numerous faults in the southern part and a few in the north of the catchment which may favour deep aquifer recharge once the water has managed to percolate in these cracks some small groundwater reservoirs have been formed urt 2015 however it should be noted that the focus of the study is on total recharge through the vadose zone before partitioning between shallow and deep aquifers 2 2 data acquisition the swat model is data intensive at the minimum the input data required for the model to estimate groundwater recharge include digital elevation model dem land use and cover lulc map soil type map and daily climatic and streamflow data table 1 dem are available at https earthexplorer usgs gov soil map at https www fao org soils portal data hub soil maps and databases and gcm data for future climatic scenarios at https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 these data are presented in fig 4 suitable global climatic models gcms for bmc for rainfall were inm cm4 8 and inm cm5 0 and for temperature were awi cm 1 1 mr and mri esm2 0 as obtained by hersi et al 2023 the selected gcms under ssps climate scenarios in particular ssp245 as medium emission and ssp585 as high emission scenario data rich period for observed climate data was between 1971 and 2000 streamflow data used for calibration were from the only gauged river in the bubu river sub catchment brsc with long records from dec 1956 to jan 1991 thus an overlap period of streamflow and weather stations was used in the swat model 2 3 data analysis several analyses were performed on the collected data sliding window correlation swc was conducted to evaluate dynamic functional connectivity between rainfall i e independent and streamflow i e dependent data before being used for calibration and validation of the swat model hypsometric analysis was conducted to understand the effect of geomorphic evolution on hydrological response mainly on the surface and sub surface runoff in bmc using strm dem 30 m resolution 2 4 groundwater recharge modelling swat model was selected for estimating groundwater recharge in bmc the model setting calibration and validation sensitivity analysis and groundwater simulations are elaborated in the following sub sections 2 4 1 swat model structure the swat model for this study area was built in arcswat 2012 dem srtm 30 m resolution assisted in delineating the catchment area and generating a slope map the selected area was further divided into hydrogeological response units hrus with the aid of the lulc map and soil map hrus are unique sub sections of the model with similar local soil lulc and slope for which detailed water nutrient and sediment mass balance calculations are performed within the catchment bailey et al 2016 tigabu et al 2020 each hru undergoes swat calculations and the results are integrated based on a percentage of each hru in a catchment bailey et al 2016 hydrogeological process simulated in swat is based on water balance eq 1 wu et al 2015 1 s w t s w o t 1 t

soil profile on day i mm h2o and q g w is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o penman monteith method was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration 2 4 2 swat model calibration validation and sensitivity analysis to address the limitation of the swat model mentioned earlier longer calibration and validation periods using streamflow data at multiple stations are usually performed unfortunately the streamflow data are not widely available in many semi arid regions thus making model calibration challenging mengistu et al 2019 busico et al 2021 to overcome this many studies either use remotely sensed evapotranspiration data and or use calibrated parameters from a nearby gauged catchment ha et al 2018 parajuli et al 2018 mengistu et al 2019 alemayehu et al 2022 bennour et al 2022 therefore calibration at bmc was performed using monthly streamflow data for the gauged bubu river sub catchment brsc located on the north east of bmc fig 1 dual validation was performed first on the brsc using streamflow data and then validation on ungauged bmc using actual evapotranspiration aet generated from the only temperature station available near the ungauged bmc catchment fig 4a based on the data abundancy in the study area a warm up period from 1971 to 1972 2 years calibration period from 1973 to 1982 10 years and validation period from 1983 to 1990 8 years were used swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup with aid model calibration sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi2 was applied for sensitivity analyses to determine the most parameters affecting the streamflow simulation abbaspour 2012 twenty one 21 calibration parameters with the parameters boundaries values were selected table 3 as suggested by abbaspour 2012 for the initial iteration higher t statistic and lower p value were used to determine the parameter sensitivity and significance of parameter sensitivity wang et al 2020 sensitive hydrologic related parameters were then selected and their values modified the selected parameters values assist in deciding initial ranges which narrows down through an iterative procedure until the best performing model is obtained chunn et al 2019 to assess the model performance nash sutcliff efficiency nse coefficient of determination r 2 percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr were used until the desirable output is reached according to moriasi et al 2007 nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and if pbias 25 for streamflow data is considered satisfactory table 2 moriasi et al 2007 following the streamflow calibration optimum parameters were then applied to the ungauged bmc and validated again using aet generated from a 9635001 weather station fig 4a aet was generated using modified turc pike eq 2 with potential evapotranspiration pet by hargraves samani eq 3 turc pike captures the evapotranspiration across a wide range of climates conditions from humid to arid milly and dunne 2011 whereas hargreaves samani is useful in data scarce regions and its evapotranspiration performance estimates are high in the regions of aridity lópez urrea et al 2006 moeletsi et al 2013 obtained mean

groundwater recharge was estimated for the baseline period i e 1971 2000 and predicted for the future periods i e 2040 2069 as 2050s and 2070 2099 as 2080s the estimation was first under the impact of climate change scenarios and later under the collective impact of climate and lulc change the swat model simulation takes into account the shallow and deep aquifer systems at individual hrus for this study recharge estimation accounts for total groundwater recharge as a result of percolation from soil profile through the vadose zone before being partitioned to shallow or deep aquifer recharge the recharge is obtained from eq 4 4 w r c h r g i 1 e 1 δ g w w s e e p e 1 δ g w w r c h r g i 1 5 w r c h r g i w r c h r g s h w d e e p where w r c h r g i is the amount of recharge entering the aquifers on day i mm δ g w is the delay time or drainage time of the overlying geologic formations days w s e e p is the total amount of water exiting the bottom of the soil profile on day i mm and w r c h r g i 1 is the amount of recharge entering the aquifers on the day before day i mm w r c h r g s h is amount of recharge to shallow aquifer on a day i mm w d e e p is amount of recharge to deep aquifer on a day i mm neitsch et al 2005 since the swat model is not built to integrate geology and hydrogeology information of the particular area its ability to accurately estimate deep aquifer recharge is limited thus the establishment of other coupling models which can simulate deep aquifer recharge could be employed in future 3 results 3 1 data assessment results from sliding window correlation and hypsometric analyses are presented in the subsections below 3 1 1 sliding window correlation swc a 5 year and 10 year window between rainfall and streamflow from 1970 to 1990 was used the result of swc of the 10 year window ranged from 0 79 to 0 91 whereas the 5 year window ranged from 0 67 to 0 96 the correlation of the 5 year window was slightly lower than the 10 year window counterpart especially from 1978 to 1981 because of a few missing rainfall data from january 1979 to april 1979 the effect of missing data is usually more noticeable in the shorter window than longer fig 5 otherwise a correlation of 0 6 and above is categorized as a moderate to strong correlation depending on various fields of study akoglu 2018 this suggests that there is no substantial lulc change that has an impact on streamflow as well as groundwater recharge for the period from 1970 to 1990 3 1 2 hypsometric analysis the hypsometric integral hi classifies the geomorphic evolution on the watershed into either young stage i e h i 0 6 matured stage i e 0 35 h i 0 6 and old stages i e h i 0 35 duan et al 2022 the obtained hi from the elevation relief ratio was 0 44 table 4 with a concave hypsometric curve h curve fig 6 signifying that bmc exhibits maturity age of geomorphic development i e no significant change in topography in a short period is expected that might influence groundwater recharge furthermore the obtained cv of 4 for the bmc indicates the majority of the area is a gentle slope with a very low level of variation across the catchment elevations table 5 favouring infiltration and less surface runoff however some very small areas in the northern part of bmc have steep slopes which may favour surface and sub surface runoff 3 2 swat application for ungauged bmc swat model setup divided the bmc catchment into 257 basins and 999 hrus dominant land use in 1985 as presented in fig 4d was open woodland followed by shrubland whereas disturbed areas in terms of farming and settlements were less than 10 of the total area this suggests a majority of the land cover is unpaved and mostly still intact indicating its impact on reducing groundwater recharge is minimal the slope of bmc was categorized into gentle 0 10 and steep 10 by using gis about 87 of the area is in gentle slopes dominantly from the central to southern part while only 13 is in steep slopes found at the northern part of the catchment furthermore the swat2012 database suggests that the catchment is characterized by various loam based soil types with slight differences in their available water capacity awc and hydraulic conductivity ks fig 7 based on studies done by rusdi et al 2015 brown 2016 and othman et al 2021 as indicated by table 6 suggest the study area has moderately low to moderate hydraulic conductivity ks and available water capacity awc 3 3 swat calibration validation and sensitivity analysis a total number of 500 model runs were performed for determining parameter sensitivity the cut off point of p value 0 05 was used to identify sensitive parameters since a p value 0 05 carries a probability of 95 of being correct that the selected parameter has some impact on the calibrated value abbaspour 2012 from a t stat distribution table available in most statistics textbooks the critical point considered for determining parameter sensitivity of large sample size at the significance of 0 05 was the t stat value 1 96 the higher the t stat the higher the sensitivity of the parameter in question meaning the parameter in question results in a significant difference between the observed and simulated streamflow means based on the above criteria the most sensitive parameters detected were about 7 out of 21 parameters for streamflow simulation in brsc the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 8 and table 8 from fig 8 cn2 sol awc sol z and ov n influence surface runoff generation gwqmn and alpha bnk influence sub surface movement of water and esco influences evapotranspiration process which impacts both surface and sub surface water movement from figs 4d 7 the dominant land use is open woodland with low canopy cover and limited interception making rainfall available for surface runoff in soils of low permeability the dominant soil type is loam based with low permeability which favours surface runoff generation this explains why the above parameters were sensitive post identification of sensitive parameters calibration of swat was performed with a total of 2500 runs divided into multiple iterations based on moriasi et al 2007 overall obtained statistical indices including pbias rsr and nse indicated that both streamflow calibration and validation for brsc performed quite well with performance ratings of very good and good respectively whereas ungauged validation performance rating is categorized as satisfactory tables 2 and 7 on the hydrograph of monthly simulated streamflow for both calibration and validation swat has managed to capture the patterns however some of the peaks were not fully captured fig 9 the model underestimated the streamflow as seen by the scatter plot of the observed and simulated monthly streamflow in fig 10 where the majority of the values were below the line of 1 1 underestimation of the streamflow could be attributed to inadequate rainfall stations with missing data that are sparsely distributed throughout the basin following the streamflow calibration of gauged sub catchment validation using total monthly aet for the ungauged bmc was performed on one of its subbasins i e subbasin 223 using data from 1973 to 2000 the obtained statistical indices for the model validation on ungauged bmc are also presented in table 7 which suggests that the model performed well and is ready for further analysis however it should be noted that the differences in statistical indices during the validation period in gauged and ungauged could be attributed to the use of weather generator data i e solar radiation humidity and wind speed in swat and empirical equations in hargreaves samani and turc pike methods for aet estimation graphically the estimated aet by turc pike and simulated aet by the swat model are presented in fig 11 the list of best fitted parameters for both gauged brsc and ungauged bmc is presented in table 8 the water balance of the calibrated model estimated evapotranspiration et to account for 87 streamflow 12 and percolation 1 of the total received rainfall 3 4 spatial groundwater recharge estimation spatial groundwater recharge distribution for ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios were analysed for the years 2050s and 2080s under the impact of climate change alone overall annual groundwater recharge was predicted to have a slight increase of a 1 30 mm y and 3 05 mm y under ssp245 and to 4 24 mm y and 5 12 mm y under ssp585 in 2050s and 2080s respectively from 4 5 mm y in 1980s baseline period whereas under the collective impact of both climate and lulc change an increase of 0 61 mm y and 2 31 mm y under ssp245 and 3 62 mm y and 3 98 mm y under ssp585 in the 2050s and 2080s respectively was predicted these findings indicate a relatively higher increase in annual recharge at ssp585 i e higher emission compared to ssp245 i e medium emission also it was predicted that the catchment to experience slightly more annual groundwater recharge under the impact of climate change alone than under the impact of both climate and lulc change spatial mapping of future recharge under the impact of climate change alone is presented in fig 12 whereas under both climate change and lulc change is presented in fig 1 the figures indicate areas where the average annual future groundwater recharge has either decreased i e 0 mm y or increased i e 0 mm y from the average annual baseline groundwater recharge table 9 and table 10 have elucidated the results based on the cardinal locations administrative districts percentage area of district coverage distribution of sub basin in the individual district estimated baseline average annual groundwater recharge i e 1970 to 2000 and future predicted change in groundwater recharge under medium and high emission scenarios based on the percentage area covered in the bmc bahi dc kondoa tc hanang dc and chemba dc are well represented the northern part of the catchment i e higher elevation was predicted to experience reduced average annual recharge under ssp245 and a slight increase under ssp585 while on central and southern of the catchment i e lower elevation to have a slight increase in average annual recharge in ssp245 and substantial increase in ssp585 overall the findings indicate an increase in groundwater recharge over time from the 2050s 2080s with higher recharge areas concentrated at the centre and southern part of the catchment where the topography is flat 3 5 seasonal groundwater recharge estimation collective impact of both climate and lulc change in seasonal groundwater distribution is presented in table 11 this study depicted in a hydrological year that most of the groundwater recharge occurs during wet seasons i e djf and mam regarding relative change it was predicted for jja and son to experience a slight decrease in percentage recharge whereas it is expected a significant decrease in percentage recharge for mam in the 2050s and 2080s for both ssp245 and ssp585 on the contrary the scenarios predicted more groundwater recharge will be received in djf from 7 up to 30 compared to the baseline period over the century 4 discussion in an ungauged bmc tanzania this study examines impact of climate change and the collective impact of both climate change and lulc under medium and high emission scenarios on groundwater recharge for the periods of the 2050s and 2080s evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity between rainfall and streamflow data was performed to understand data behaviour before use fig 5 the findings suggest that there is no substantial lulc change that had an impact on streamflow for the period from 1970 to 1990 however this does not rule out the possibility that there might be gentle change especially from the mid to the end of the 1980s the change could be from one lulc type to another with a similar impact on drainage property indicating its effect on groundwater recharge to be minimal therefore the lulc map of 1985 could be used to cover the period of both calibration and validation furthermore the obtained hi of 0 44 with concave h curve and cv of 4 showed that bmc exhibits maturity age of geomorphic development meaning a majority of the area is a gentle slope which mostly favours infiltration and less surface runoff based on the theory of landform evolution by william m davis between 1850 and 1934 decrees maturity stage will hold unless an uplift interrupts the topography and the landform rejuvenates to a younger stage of high erosion and abrupt topographical change chorley et al 1973 this means the hydrological drainage properties of bmc might be the same at the end of the year 2100 and beyond otherwise changes in drainage properties as a result of the possible topography change are only expected in small patches at the northern part of the catchments with a steep slope which may favour surface and sub surface runoff and inhibit groundwater recharge the calibration and validation hydrographs show that the swat model was successful in capturing the peaks and overall pattern as shown in fig 9 however scatter plots fig 10 suggest an underestimation of the simulated streamflow meaning that the observed streamflow was slightly higher than the simulated streamflow degree of deviation of simulated streamflow from observed streamflow could be explained by pbias moriasi et al 2007 golmohammadi et al 2014 pulighe et al 2020 table 7 presents the pbias obtained during calibration and dual validation in this study none exceeded 5 7 based on the criteria adopted from the study of moriasi et al 2007 pbias of 10 indicate there is no substantial difference between the average mean of simulated streamflow to that of observed streamflow therefore underestimation of peak streamflow by swat model is tolerable along with the rest of the statistical indices in table 7 this study is confident that the model performed well unfortunately underestimation of peak streamflow by swat model is not uncommon several scholars associated underestimation of major peak flow events by swat model with poorly distributed rainfall gauging stations pulighe et al 2020 tan and yang 2020 alejo et al 2021 dos santos et al 2022 nevertheless underestimation of peaks may affect the results of groundwater recharge amounts findings in tables 9 and 10 agree well with the ves measurement in fig 3 areas of manyoni and bahi which were estimated on baseline period by swat model to have high groundwater recharge are the ones with aquiferous layers with low resistivities i e high water content however hanang and some parts of kondoa were also found to have aquiferous layers with low resistivities despite the developed swat model predicting low recharge this suggests that the developed model was unable to reproduce the actual field scenarios in these areas therefore caution should be exercised when making interpretations and decisions using the currently developed model in these areas the failure could be due to poor representation of rainfall datasets used in this study from the study by hersi et al 2023 for instance the rainfall station at mt hanang was not available for use as input data therefore the surrounding stations including 9 434 001 80 km 9 435 037 30 km 9 435 003 46 km and 9 435 025 66 km were used instead for the swat model hersi et al 2023 since the actual rainfall amount at mt hanang was not used as an input in swat may have led to the underestimation of recharge in the region findings on predicted future groundwater recharge showed that there is a relative increase in recharge amounts from medium to higher emission scenarios for both 2050s and 2080s especially from central to southern parts of the catchment figs 12 and 13 the findings are consistent with the study of hersi et al 2023 where an increase in rainfall amounts in southern parts was predicted for bmc for both medium and high emission scenarios the intensification of rainfall amounts at the higher emission favours groundwater recharge goni et al 2021 this implies that considering the constancy of other influencing factors it is expected that for the higher emission scenario there will be more groundwater recharge compared to the medium emission scenario further comparison with ipcc 2021 report which predicted the southern eastern africa seaf region to receive up to 40 of the average annual rainfall under a high emission scenario this indicates a promising future potential increase in groundwater recharge and storage albeit the potential for future increase in rainfall amounts an overall increase in groundwater recharge in bmc is still small tables 8 and 9 itigi dc followed by manyoni dc and dodoma cc were predicted to have the highest increase of about two folds from the baseline period however none exceeded 13 23 mm y table 10 thus the overall groundwater recharge can be interpreted as low in the catchment a similar study done by rwebugisa 2008 at makutupora basin in dodoma region in the 2000s obtained groundwater recharge between 5 mm y to 12 mm y only which is 1 2 of annual rainfall whereas a study done by shindo 1991 obtained recharge of between 10 and 15 of the received annual rainfall the findings of shindo 1991 are significantly higher than those of rwebugisa 2008 this might be due to the el nino rainfall incident in 1989 when the dodoma region received a total of 917 mm y of rainfall compared to an average rainfall of 550 mm y rwebugisa 2008 mbigi and xiao 2021 other studies by taylor et al 2013 and seddon 2019 obtain no recharge at rainfall less than 100 mm month which is usually the case in most semi arid regions in tanzania furthermore integrated water resources management plan iwrmp of idb reports that groundwater accessed via mineral springs for instance in lukali village in dodoma region experiences an increase in temperature during the rainy seasons which is also high temperature season djf urt 2015 hydrogeological geophysical survey of some of the boreholes drilled such as bh8 in kondoa district have revealed shallow aquiferous layer that is immediately followed by semi impermeable layer at the depth of 2 48 m idbwo 2015 this implies that there could be several areas where water that has already percolated to shallow aquifers could be impacted by an increase in temperature demonstrating the sensitivity of groundwater recharge quantities to climate variability conversely based on the aquifer geometry in fig 3 areas with unconfined aquifers and impermeable bedrocks located at the greater depths might facilitate groundwater to percolate to depths where the impacts of climate variability are less pronounced moreover this study analysed and compared the impact of climate change alone and then the collective impact of climate and lulc change it was found that compared to baseline period for instance rainfall increase by 25 i e average annual rainfall 548 mm y under the impact of climate change alone can increase the average annual recharge by 130 at dodoma cc whereas under collective impact of climate and lulc change the same increase in rainfall amount can increase recharge by 123 figs 12 and 13 and tables 8 and 9 this indicates that groundwater recharge rates are more highly influenced by climate change than by lulc change several studies have obtained similar results where lulc change has a minimum impact on groundwater recharge in less urbanized regions adhikari et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 siddik et al 2022 the impact of lulc on groundwater recharge is trivial in bmc as the majority of land cover is less urbanized although the impact of lulc on groundwater recharge is minimum the impact of climate change on the other hand is significant and therefore these findings highlight the need for climate change adaptation strategies to take full advantage of the expected increase in recharge amounts particularly on the southern part of the catchment furthermore the findings related to the predicted groundwater recharge against elevation revealed that there is a decrease in average annual recharge amounts at higher altitudes i e in the north of bmc with an increase towards lower altitudes in the south direction table 10 and fig 13 as earlier indicated in section 2 1 the southern part has numerous fractures which favours more groundwater recharge hence geological features in the southern part may govern the movement of water to the deeper aquifer the study by hersi et al 2023 predicted the northern part of the catchment would experience the highest reduction in rainfall by 15 under ssp245 while the south eastern part will experience the highest increase by 25 in rainfall under ssp585 by the 2080s in this study these changes in rainfall were related to changes in groundwater recharge as follows reduced groundwater recharge in the northern is attributed to reduced rainfall and a steep slope of 10 due to the presence of mt hanang under the collective impact of both climate and lulc change a reduction of 15 in rainfall amounts in hanang dc may reduce groundwater recharge by up to 24 on steep slopes whereas a 25 increase in rainfall amounts in dodoma cc can increase recharge by up to 123 on gentle slopes i e the slope of 0 10 despite several studies including those by yifru et al 2020a dekongmen et al 2022 and umugwaneza et al 2022 that have validated the important function of gentle slopes in the groundwater recharging process slopes are not the only contributing factor to groundwater recharge soil properties and types could also play a significant role in recharge processes due to their permeability hydraulic conductivity ks and available water capacity awc which may either support or inhibit percolation tang et al 2020 chiang et al 2021 higher ks indicate rapid water movement through the soil whereas awc indicated the ability of soil to retain water peters 2013 othman et al 2021 therefore soils with higher ks and lower awc allows fast movement of water through the soil layers resulting in rapid groundwater recharge tang et al 2020 since a majority of soil types available at bmc fall under the category of moderately low to moderate low hydraulic conductivity ks and lower water retention awc as indicated in fig 7 and table 6 they create a more or less uniform influence on recharge throughout the catchment therefore this study has established the dominance of slope and rainfall in influencing groundwater recharge in bmc making areas of flat topography prime for continued groundwater recharge seasonally it was predicted in this study that the highest groundwater recharge amounts are in djf season followed by mam son and lowest in jja season for both baseline and future periods this hydrological year s tendency is a result of the catchment being unimodal experiencing strong rainfall in djf and no rain in jja rwebugisa 2008 hersi et al 2023 this indicates the sensitivity and high dependency of groundwater recharge on climate variables moeck et al 2020 considering groundwater is a main water source across various sectors in bmc close attention should be paid during groundwater extraction in low recharge seasons such as jja and son excessive groundwater extraction beyond its recharge potential results in to collapse of pore spaces that lead to land subsidence which later impedes future recharge when higher rainfall amounts are attained rafiei et al 2022 tang et al 2022 however it remains unknown to what extent the future local groundwater recharge received in bmc will cover the future groundwater demand therefore quantifying future groundwater demands as well as optimizing high recharge seasons on flat topography especially djf by investing in artificial groundwater recharge should be the way forward 5 conclusion this study aimed to simulate future groundwater recharge for the ungauged bahi manyoni catchment under the influence of changing climate and lulc the applied swat model managed to capture the hydrological processes of the bmc however with a slight underestimation of simulated peak flow which was associated with unrecorded heavy rainfalls due to sparsely located rainfall stations on the catchment the findings from this study depicted the impact of lulc to be trivial due to less urbanization whereas the impact of climate change scenarios to be significant in groundwater recharge both the medium i e ssp245 and high i e ssp585 emission climate scenarios were predicted to cause a relative increase in recharge amounts for both 2050s and 2080s it was predicted in year 2080s under the impact of both climate and lulc change the central and southern parts of the bmc would experience an increase of at least two fold but unfortunately this increase would be of not more than 13 23 mm y thus the overall predicted groundwater recharge remains low in the catchment furthermore this study delineated low recharge zones to be on the northern part of the catchment and high recharge zone to be on the southwest of the catchment due to their differences in elevation and climate it was found in this study that a 15 rainfall reduction on steep slopes i e hanang dc can lower groundwater recharge by up to 24 whereas a 25 rainfall increase on gentle slopes i e dodoma cc can increase recharge by 123 making areas with flat topography ideal for high groundwater recharge influence of soil hydraulic conductivity and available water capacity on the other hand may have a slight impact on recharge due to their similarities throughout the catchment leaving topography and climate to be dominating factors for groundwater recharge from the seasonality analysis it was predicted that groundwater recharges follow the hydrological year i e maximum recharge being experienced on djf and nearly no recharge during jja these findings provide key information for groundwater recharge however the developed model had challenges depicting the actual scenarios in areas of hanang and kondoa perhaps due to the poor representation of rainfall datasets used in this study the developed model classifies some areas in hanang and kondoa as areas with low groundwater recharge but these areas have high groundwater recharge therefore it is recommended to exercise caution when making interpretations and decisions using the currently developed model in these areas 6 recommendations the following are recommendations emanating from this study i swat modelling showed a slight underestimation of peak flows which was tied to unrepresentative rainfall distribution in the catchment therefore future studies should improve rainfall representation in the catchment ii this study was based on estimating groundwater recharge before being partitioned to shallow or deep aquifer recharge therefore this calls for further studies on analysing amount of recharge that will contribute to shallow aquifer and the amount that will be in deep aquifer by coupling swat with other models such as modflow iii the study area was predicted to have overall low groundwater recharge therefore it is recommended that idb water board to take advantage of areas of higher recharge potential as well as be keen on issuing water extraction permits in future in areas of lower recharge potential

11637,spatio temporal studies of groundwater recharge establish a groundwork for comprehending the effects of climate and land use change on groundwater resources particularly in areas where groundwater is a primary source of water such as the internal drainage basin idb tanzania therefore quantification of groundwater recharge for years the 2050s and 2080s was executed using the swat in bahi manyoni catchment bmc in idb shared socioeconomic pathways ssps climate scenarios particularly ssp245 as medium emission and ssp585 as high emission scenario were used monthly calibration and validation of the swat model were performed by using streamflow data from a gauged sub catchment within bmc obtained nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for the calibration period from 1971 to 1982 was 0 79 and for the validation period from 1983 to 1990 was 0 69 later performed another validation using actual evapotranspiration in an ungauged bmc achieved nse of 0 59 the findings from calibrated model depicted under the impact of climate change alone it was estimated that there will be a slight increase in overall annual average groundwater recharge of 3 05 mm y under ssp245 and to 5 12 mm y under ssp585 in year 2050s whereas under collective impact of climate and lulc change an increase of 2 31 mm y under ssp245 and of 3 98 mm y under ssp585 in year 2080s from a baseline of 4 5 mm y in 1980s this indicates the impact of lulc alone to be trivial in the steep slope areas the catchment with 15 reduced rainfall will experience lower recharge of up to 24 whereas gentle slope areas with a 25 increase in rainfall will experience a recharge of up to 123 compared to the baseline period established groundwater recharge zones give imperative information to idb managers in relation to water

ssps soil and water assessment tool swat tanzania data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role in supporting the water demands of livelihoods and ecosystems across the globe however due to growing water needs brought by population growth escalating industrialization and agricultural intensification this source of water has been overused and ill managed leading to its rapid depletion in various regions bouwer 2000 tularam and krishna 2009 ponce 2011 wang et al 2018 jia et al 2020 for the last 50 years the global groundwater extraction rate has increased by approximately six fold and still is increasing at an annual rate of between 1 and 2 konikow 2011 gun 2012 fao 2016 the battle to meet the growing water demands is inevitable and groundwater extraction will be further intensified excessive groundwater extraction causes irreversible land subsidence which possess a serious problem for groundwater recharge rafiei et al 2022 tang et al 2022 the problem is further intensified by the impact of climate change making groundwater resources exceedingly vulnerable paivada et al 2020 busico et al 2021 for instance sandstrom 1995 found that a 15 reduction in annual rainfall could reduce about 40 50 in annual groundwater recharge the problem of reduced groundwater recharge could be worsened in climate disadvantaged areas such as arid and semi arid regions studies conducted by rwebugisa 2008 and seddon 2019 found little to no groundwater recharge when annual rainfall is below 400 mm furthermore numerous studies have concurred on degree of collective impact of both climate and land use and land cover lulc changes being higher than individual changes on groundwater recharge bucton et al 2022 hachemaoui et al 2022 mengistu et al 2022 this brings concern to the groundwater recharge and consequently sustainability of groundwater resources getting an upper hand on groundwater resources management for future sustainability joint forces from local to international levels towards contribution to sustainable development goals 6 sdg6 agenda 2030 as well as a shared global vision for groundwater governance 2030 is expected hence a thorough evaluation of overall hydrological processes including groundwater recharge is required busico et al 2021 since groundwater recharge rates are dependent on local geomorphology climate and land cover delineation of high and low recharge zones is necessary for sustainable groundwater exploitation even more so in regions where groundwater recharge is limited such as regions with limited rainfall amounts including arid and semi arid rapid population growth and extensive agriculture there are several hydrological models that are useful for groundwater recharge estimations the categorization of these hydrological models varies from empirical i e little consideration of physical features to physically based where relevant meaningful physical hydrological processes are represented jajarmizadeh 2012 devi et al 2015 among the pertinent and widely applied physically based hydrological models are hec hms mike she and swat sahu et al 2023 mike she is limited to smaller catchments and requires a license to use on the other hand swat and hec hms are in the public domain devi et al 2015 sahu et al 2023 many studies employ these open access models chunn et al 2019 wei liu et al 2019 yifru et al 2020a 2020b sanjay shekar and vinay 2021 dekongmen et al 2022 fanta and sime 2022 aqnouy et al 2023 which increases their popularity and advancements both swat and hec hms models outperform one another when applied in different catchments indicating their matching competency aqnouy et al 2023 fanta and sime 2022 sanjay shekar and vinay 2021 however unlike hec hms which is only semi distributed and incorporates crucial hydrologic information in lumped form the swat model operates on the units of the same land use soil types and slope referred to as hydrological response unit hru making the swat model more desirable for catchment representation limitations of the swat model are mostly related to the accuracy of the applied climate data and the period used for validation marin et al 2020 overcoming these limitations involves using numerous data rich weather and rainfall stations and longer calibration and validation periods several studies in tanzania have applied the swat model to assess various aspects of hydrological processes in rufiji wami ruvu and pangani basins twisa et al 2020 said et al 2021 mazengo et al 2022 however well known studies on groundwater recharge in central tanzania including those conducted by shindo 1991 rwebugisa 2008 and seddon 2019 used water quality analysis thornthwaite s method and mike she and were limited to the makutupora basin another study in central tanzania by mussa et al 2021 focused on groundwater recharge in the singida aquifer using the soil water balance method beyond these aforementioned studies limited studies have been conducted in other central parts of tanzania particularly in the bmc area to investigate groundwater recharge using the swat model bmc is one of the ungauged catchments in idb categorized as water scarce based on the falkenmark water stress indicator since water availability is less than 1000 m 3 cap year mow 2019 the water scarcity in bmc resulted in its strong reliance on groundwater resources mussa et al 2020 since the catchment is now experiencing rapid immigration owing to tanzania s new capital city dodoma and other expanding cities within the catchment including singida kondoa and manyoni increased groundwater resource utilization is expected limited knowledge of the hydrological processes such as recharge in the catchment poses threat to the sustainability of future groundwater resources therefore this work intends to estimate groundwater recharge in ungauged bmc under changing climate and lulc scenarios using the swat model in this study the concept of ungauged catchment refers to catchments with no streamflow records the obtained information on the delineated high and low groundwater recharge zones from this study provides imperative information to idb managers for sustainable groundwater management in the catchment 2 materials and methods details on a description of the study area data acquisition and analysis swat model structure model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis as well as prediction of future groundwater recharge under medium and high emission scenarios were elaborated in the subsections below fig 1 shows the methodological approach that was applied to this study 2 1 description of the study area the bmc is situated in the central part of tanzania covering a total area of 24 716 4 k m 2 the catchment has two major rivers which are bubu and mponde both pouring their water into lake sulunga also known as bahi swamp as indicated in fig 2 the mean elevation of the bmc is 1235 m a s l with the maximum being 3402 m a s l and the minimum being 809 m a s l the climate is semi arid with a unimodal rainfall pattern received rainfall amount in bmc is between 510 and 720 mm y with an average temperature ranging from 16 c to 27 c the wet season begins in december and ends in may while the dry season is from june to november the seasons are further subdivided into heavy rains from december to february as djf light rains from march to may as mam dry with cool temperatures from june to august as jja and dry with warm temperatures from september to november as son hersi et al 2023 dominant geological units in bmc are alluvial and eluvial deposits in the northeast wembere formation in the northwest patches of older and young igneous outcrops in the central northern and southern parts as well as large patches of mbuga soil which is black clay soil prevailing in seasonal swamps urt 2020 these geological units in the area have low permeability which limits percolation furthermore low permeable basement rocks formed mainly by granite and basaltic rocks are stretched out nearly throughout the catchment based on measurements of vertical electrical sounding ves taken at several locations in the bmc catchment it was found that the depth of the bedrock varied significantly idbwo 2014a 2014b 2015 2019 the shallowest bedrock was found in the northeast part of the catchment at maji ya shamba street and kichangani both in kondoa district at depths between 2 5 m and 19 m idbwo 2015 the deepest bedrock was found in mbwasa village in bahi district in the southwest at depths of 60 m 136 m idbwo 2014b this suggests that the direction of groundwater flow is likely from the northern to the southern part of the catchment furthermore fig 3 shows resistivities of various layers in boreholes drilled at bmc which can provide a highlight on types of aquifers in the study area based on nabighian 1988 for the relationship between resistivity values of various in situ earth materials and water permeability it can then be inferred that the majority of the boreholes in fig 3 were drilled in unconfined aquifers with only a few in semi confined aquifers bh4 bh6 bh10 in manyoni bh6 in kondoa and bh2 in bahi and confined aquifers bh4 bh8 in kondoa district therefore there is a higher chance of groundwater percolating to greater depths for unconfined areas there are also numerous faults in the southern part and a few in the north of the catchment which may favour deep aquifer recharge once the water has managed to percolate in these cracks some small groundwater reservoirs have been formed urt 2015 however it should be noted that the focus of the study is on total recharge through the vadose zone before partitioning between shallow and deep aquifers 2 2 data acquisition the swat model is data intensive at the minimum the input data required for the model to estimate groundwater recharge include digital elevation model dem land use and cover lulc map soil type map and daily climatic and streamflow data table 1 dem are available at https earthexplorer usgs gov soil map at https www fao org soils portal data hub soil maps and databases and gcm data for future climatic scenarios at https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 these data are presented in fig 4 suitable global climatic models gcms for bmc for rainfall were inm cm4 8 and inm cm5 0 and for temperature were awi cm 1 1 mr and mri esm2 0 as obtained by hersi et al 2023 the selected gcms under ssps climate scenarios in particular ssp245 as medium emission and ssp585 as high emission scenario data rich period for observed climate data was between 1971 and 2000 streamflow data used for calibration were from the only gauged river in the bubu river sub catchment brsc with long records from dec 1956 to jan 1991 thus an overlap period of streamflow and weather stations was used in the swat model 2 3 data analysis several analyses were performed on the collected data sliding window correlation swc was conducted to evaluate dynamic functional connectivity between rainfall i e independent and streamflow i e dependent data before being used for calibration and validation of the swat model hypsometric analysis was conducted to understand the effect of geomorphic evolution on hydrological response mainly on the surface and sub surface runoff in bmc using strm dem 30 m resolution 2 4 groundwater recharge modelling swat model was selected for estimating groundwater recharge in bmc the model setting calibration and validation sensitivity analysis and groundwater simulations are elaborated in the following sub sections 2 4 1 swat model structure the swat model for this study area was built in arcswat 2012 dem srtm 30 m resolution assisted in delineating the catchment area and generating a slope map the selected area was further divided into hydrogeological response units hrus with the aid of the lulc map and soil map hrus are unique sub sections of the model with similar local soil lulc and slope for which detailed water nutrient and sediment mass balance calculations are performed within the catchment bailey et al 2016 tigabu et al 2020 each hru undergoes swat calculations and the results are integrated based on a percentage of each hru in a catchment bailey et al 2016 hydrogeological process simulated in swat is based on water balance eq 1 wu et al 2015 1 s w t s w o t 1 t

and sensitivity analysis to address the limitation of the swat model mentioned earlier longer calibration and validation periods using streamflow data at multiple stations are usually performed unfortunately the streamflow data are not widely available in many semi arid regions thus making model calibration challenging mengistu et al 2019 busico et al 2021 to overcome this many studies either use remotely sensed evapotranspiration data and or use calibrated parameters from a nearby gauged catchment ha et al 2018 parajuli et al 2018 mengistu et al 2019 alemayehu et al 2022 bennour et al 2022 therefore calibration at bmc was performed using monthly streamflow data for the gauged bubu river sub catchment brsc located on the north east of bmc fig 1 dual validation was performed first on the brsc using streamflow data and then validation on ungauged bmc using actual evapotranspiration aet generated from the only temperature station available near the ungauged bmc catchment fig 4a based on the data abundancy in the study area a warm up period from 1971 to 1972 2 years calibration period from 1973 to 1982 10 years and validation period from 1983 to 1990 8 years were used swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup with aid model calibration sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi2 was applied for sensitivity analyses to determine the most parameters affecting the streamflow simulation abbaspour 2012 twenty one 21 calibration parameters with the parameters boundaries values were selected table 3 as suggested by abbaspour 2012 for the initial iteration higher t statistic and lower p value were used to determine the parameter sensitivity and significance of parameter sensitivity wang et al 2020 sensitive hydrologic related parameters were then selected and their values modified the selected parameters values assist in deciding initial ranges which narrows down through an iterative procedure until the best performing model is obtained chunn

groundwater recharge was estimated for the baseline period i e 1971 2000 and predicted for the future periods i e 2040 2069 as 2050s and 2070 2099 as 2080s the estimation was first under the impact of climate change scenarios and later under the collective impact of climate and lulc change the swat model simulation takes into account the shallow and deep aquifer systems at individual hrus for this study recharge estimation accounts for total groundwater recharge as a result of percolation from soil profile through the vadose zone before being partitioned to shallow or deep aquifer recharge the recharge is obtained from eq 4 4 w r c h r g i 1 e 1 δ g w w s e e p e 1 δ g w w r c h r g i 1 5 w r c h r g i w r c h r g s h w d e e p where w r c h r g i is the amount of recharge entering the aquifers on day i mm δ g w is the delay time or drainage time of the overlying geologic formations days w s e e p is the total amount of water exiting the bottom of the soil profile on day i mm and w r c h r g i 1 is the amount of recharge entering the aquifers on the day before day i mm w r c h r g s h is amount of recharge to shallow aquifer on a day i mm w d e e p is amount of recharge to deep aquifer on a day i mm neitsch et al 2005 since the swat model is not built to integrate geology and hydrogeology information of the particular area its ability to accurately estimate deep aquifer recharge is limited thus the establishment of other coupling models which can simulate deep aquifer recharge could be employed in future 3 results 3 1 data assessment results from sliding window correlation and hypsometric analyses are presented in the subsections below 3 1 1 sliding window correlation swc a 5 year and 10 year window between rainfall and streamflow from 1970 to 1990 was used the result of swc of the 10 year window ranged from 0 79 to 0 91 whereas the 5 year window ranged from 0 67 to 0 96 the correlation of the 5 year window was slightly lower than the 10 year window counterpart especially from 1978 to 1981 because of a few missing rainfall data from january 1979 to april 1979 the effect of missing data is usually more noticeable in the shorter window than longer fig 5 otherwise a correlation of 0 6 and above is categorized as a moderate to strong correlation depending on various fields of study akoglu 2018 this suggests that there is no substantial lulc change that has an impact on streamflow as well as groundwater recharge for the period from 1970 to 1990 3 1 2 hypsometric analysis the hypsometric integral hi classifies the geomorphic evolution on the watershed into either young stage i e h i 0 6 matured stage i e 0 35 h i 0 6 and old stages i e h i 0 35 duan et al 2022 the obtained hi from the elevation relief ratio was 0 44 table 4 with a concave hypsometric curve h curve fig 6 signifying that bmc exhibits maturity age of geomorphic development i e no significant change in topography in a short period is expected that might influence groundwater recharge furthermore the obtained cv of 4 for the bmc indicates the majority of the area is a gentle slope with a very low level of variation across the catchment elevations table 5 favouring infiltration and less surface runoff however some very small areas in the northern part of bmc have steep slopes which may favour surface and sub surface runoff 3 2 swat application for ungauged bmc swat model setup divided the bmc catchment into 257 basins and 999 hrus dominant land use in 1985 as presented in fig 4d was open woodland followed by shrubland whereas disturbed areas in terms of farming and settlements were less than 10 of the total area this suggests a majority of the land cover is unpaved and mostly still intact indicating its impact on reducing groundwater recharge is minimal the slope of bmc was categorized into gentle 0 10 and steep 10 by using gis about 87 of the area is in gentle slopes dominantly from the central to southern part while only 13 is in steep slopes found at the northern part of the catchment furthermore the swat2012 database suggests that the catchment is characterized by various loam based soil types with slight differences in their available water capacity awc and hydraulic conductivity ks fig 7 based on studies done by rusdi et al 2015 brown 2016 and othman et al 2021 as indicated by table 6 suggest the study area has moderately low to moderate hydraulic conductivity ks and available water capacity awc 3 3 swat calibration validation and sensitivity analysis a total number of 500 model runs were performed for determining parameter sensitivity the cut off point of p value 0 05 was used to identify sensitive parameters since a p value 0 05 carries a probability of 95 of being correct that the selected parameter has some impact on the calibrated value abbaspour 2012 from a t stat distribution table available in most statistics textbooks the critical point considered for determining parameter sensitivity of large sample size at the significance of 0 05 was the t stat value 1 96 the higher the t stat the higher the sensitivity of the parameter in question meaning the parameter in question results in a significant difference between the observed and simulated streamflow means based on the above criteria the most sensitive parameters detected were about 7 out of 21 parameters for streamflow simulation in brsc the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 8 and table 8 from fig 8 cn2 sol awc sol z and ov n influence surface runoff generation gwqmn and alpha bnk influence sub surface movement of water and esco influences evapotranspiration process which impacts both surface and sub surface water movement from figs 4d 7 the dominant land use is open woodland with low canopy cover and limited interception making rainfall available for surface runoff in soils of low permeability the dominant soil type is loam based with low permeability which favours surface runoff generation this explains why the above parameters were sensitive post identification of sensitive parameters calibration of swat was performed with a total of 2500 runs divided into multiple iterations based on moriasi et al 2007 overall obtained statistical indices including pbias rsr and nse indicated that both streamflow calibration and validation for brsc performed quite well with performance ratings of very good and good respectively whereas ungauged validation performance rating is categorized as satisfactory tables 2 and 7 on the hydrograph of monthly simulated streamflow for both calibration and validation swat has managed to capture the patterns however some of the peaks were not fully captured fig 9 the model underestimated the streamflow as seen by the scatter plot of the observed and simulated monthly streamflow in fig 10 where the majority of the values were below the line of 1 1 underestimation of the streamflow could be attributed to inadequate rainfall stations with missing data that are sparsely distributed throughout the basin following the streamflow calibration of gauged sub catchment validation using total monthly aet for the ungauged bmc was performed on one of its subbasins i e subbasin 223 using data from 1973 to 2000 the obtained statistical indices for the model validation on ungauged bmc are also presented in table 7 which suggests that the model performed well and is ready for further analysis however it should be noted that the differences in statistical indices during the validation period in gauged and ungauged could be attributed to the use of weather generator data i e solar radiation humidity and wind speed in swat and empirical equations in hargreaves samani and turc pike methods for aet estimation graphically the estimated aet by turc pike and simulated aet by the swat model are presented in fig 11 the list of best fitted parameters for both gauged brsc and ungauged bmc is presented in table 8 the water balance of the calibrated model estimated evapotranspiration et to account for 87 streamflow 12 and percolation 1 of the total received rainfall 3 4 spatial groundwater recharge estimation spatial groundwater recharge distribution for ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios were analysed for the years 2050s and 2080s under the impact of climate change alone overall annual groundwater recharge was predicted to have a slight increase of a 1 30 mm y and 3 05 mm y under ssp245 and to 4 24 mm y and 5 12 mm y under ssp585 in 2050s and 2080s respectively from 4 5 mm y in 1980s baseline period whereas under the collective impact of both climate and lulc change an increase of 0 61 mm y and 2 31 mm y under ssp245 and 3 62 mm y and 3 98 mm y under ssp585 in the 2050s and 2080s respectively was predicted these findings indicate a relatively higher increase in annual recharge at ssp585 i e higher emission compared to ssp245 i e medium emission also it was predicted that the catchment to experience slightly more annual groundwater recharge under the impact of climate change alone than under the impact of both climate and lulc change spatial mapping of future recharge under the impact of climate change alone is presented in fig 12 whereas under both climate change and lulc change is presented in fig 1 the figures indicate areas where the average annual future groundwater recharge has either decreased i e 0 mm y or increased i e 0 mm y from the average annual baseline groundwater recharge table 9 and table 10 have elucidated the results based on the cardinal locations administrative districts percentage area of district coverage distribution of sub basin in the individual district estimated baseline average annual groundwater recharge i e 1970 to 2000 and future predicted change in groundwater recharge under medium and high emission scenarios based on the percentage area covered in the bmc bahi dc kondoa tc hanang dc and chemba dc are well represented the northern part of the catchment i e higher elevation was predicted to experience reduced average annual recharge under ssp245 and a slight increase under ssp585 while on central and southern of the catchment i e lower elevation to have a slight increase in average annual recharge in ssp245 and substantial increase in ssp585 overall the findings indicate an increase in groundwater recharge over time from the 2050s 2080s with higher recharge areas concentrated at the centre and southern part of the catchment where the topography is flat 3 5 seasonal groundwater recharge estimation collective impact of both climate and lulc change in seasonal groundwater distribution is presented in table 11 this study depicted in a hydrological year that most of the groundwater recharge occurs during wet seasons i e djf and mam regarding relative change it was predicted for jja and son to experience a slight decrease in percentage recharge whereas it is expected a significant decrease in percentage recharge for mam in the 2050s and 2080s for both ssp245 and ssp585 on the contrary the scenarios predicted more groundwater recharge will be received in djf from 7 up to 30 compared to the baseline period over the century 4 discussion in an ungauged bmc tanzania this study examines impact of climate change and the collective impact of both climate change and lulc under medium and high emission scenarios on groundwater recharge for the periods of the 2050s and 2080s evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity between rainfall and streamflow data was performed to understand data behaviour before use fig 5 the findings suggest that there is no substantial lulc change that had an impact on streamflow for the period from 1970 to 1990 however this does not rule out the possibility that there might be gentle change especially from the mid to the end of the 1980s the change could be from one lulc type to another with a similar impact on drainage property indicating its effect on groundwater recharge to be minimal therefore the lulc map of 1985 could be used to cover the period of both calibration and validation furthermore the obtained hi of 0 44 with concave h curve and cv of 4 showed that bmc exhibits maturity age of geomorphic development meaning a majority of the area is a gentle slope which mostly favours infiltration and less surface runoff based on the theory of landform evolution by william m davis between 1850 and 1934 decrees maturity stage will hold unless an uplift interrupts the topography and the landform rejuvenates to a younger stage of high erosion and abrupt topographical change chorley et al 1973 this means the hydrological drainage properties of bmc might be the same at the end of the year 2100 and beyond otherwise changes in drainage properties as a result of the possible topography change are only expected in small patches at the northern part of the catchments with a steep slope which may favour surface and sub surface runoff and inhibit groundwater recharge the calibration and validation hydrographs show that the swat model was successful in capturing the peaks and overall pattern as shown in fig 9 however scatter plots fig 10 suggest an underestimation of the simulated streamflow meaning that the observed streamflow was slightly higher than the simulated streamflow degree of deviation of simulated streamflow from observed streamflow could be explained by pbias moriasi et al 2007 golmohammadi et al 2014 pulighe et al 2020 table 7 presents the pbias obtained during calibration and dual validation in this study none exceeded 5 7 based on the criteria adopted from the study of moriasi et al 2007 pbias of 10 indicate there is no substantial difference between the average mean of simulated streamflow to that of observed streamflow therefore underestimation of peak streamflow by swat model is tolerable along with the rest of the statistical indices in table 7 this study is confident that the model performed well unfortunately underestimation of peak streamflow by swat model is not uncommon several scholars associated underestimation of major peak flow events by swat model with poorly distributed rainfall gauging stations pulighe et al 2020 tan and yang 2020 alejo et al 2021 dos santos et al 2022 nevertheless underestimation of peaks may affect the results of groundwater recharge amounts findings in tables 9 and 10 agree well with the ves measurement in fig 3 areas of manyoni and bahi which were estimated on baseline period by swat model to have high groundwater recharge are the ones with aquiferous layers with low resistivities i e high water content however hanang and some parts of kondoa were also found to have aquiferous layers with low resistivities despite the developed swat model predicting low recharge this suggests that the developed model was unable to reproduce the actual field scenarios in these areas therefore caution should be exercised when making interpretations and decisions using the currently developed model in these areas the failure could be due to poor representation of rainfall datasets used in this study from the study by hersi et al 2023 for instance the rainfall station at mt hanang was not available for use as input data therefore the surrounding stations including 9 434 001 80 km 9 435 037 30 km 9 435 003 46 km and 9 435 025 66 km were used instead for the swat model hersi et al 2023 since the actual rainfall amount at mt hanang was not used as an input in swat may have led to the underestimation of recharge in the region findings on predicted future groundwater recharge showed that there is a relative increase in recharge amounts from medium to higher emission scenarios for both 2050s and 2080s especially from central to southern parts of the catchment figs 12 and 13 the findings are consistent with the study of hersi et al 2023 where an increase in rainfall amounts in southern parts was predicted for bmc for both medium and high emission scenarios the intensification of rainfall amounts at the higher emission favours groundwater recharge goni et al 2021 this implies that considering the constancy of other influencing factors it is expected that for the higher emission scenario there will be more groundwater recharge compared to the medium emission scenario further comparison with ipcc 2021 report which predicted the southern eastern africa seaf region to receive up to 40 of the average annual rainfall under a high emission scenario this indicates a promising future potential increase in groundwater recharge and storage albeit the potential for future increase in rainfall amounts an overall increase in groundwater recharge in bmc is still small tables 8 and 9 itigi dc followed by manyoni dc and dodoma cc were predicted to have the highest increase of about two folds from the baseline period however none exceeded 13 23 mm y table 10 thus the overall groundwater recharge can be interpreted as low in the catchment a similar study done by rwebugisa 2008 at makutupora basin in dodoma region in the 2000s obtained groundwater recharge between 5 mm y to 12 mm y only which is 1 2 of annual rainfall whereas a study done by shindo 1991 obtained recharge of between 10 and 15 of the received annual rainfall the findings of shindo 1991 are significantly higher than those of rwebugisa 2008 this might be due to the el nino rainfall incident in 1989 when the dodoma region received a total of 917 mm y of rainfall compared to an average rainfall of 550 mm y rwebugisa 2008 mbigi and xiao 2021 other studies by taylor et al 2013 and seddon 2019 obtain no recharge at rainfall less than 100 mm month which is usually the case in most semi arid regions in tanzania furthermore integrated water resources management plan iwrmp of idb reports that groundwater accessed via mineral springs for instance in lukali village in dodoma region experiences an increase in temperature during the rainy seasons which is also high temperature season djf urt 2015 hydrogeological geophysical survey of some of the boreholes drilled such as bh8 in kondoa district have revealed shallow aquiferous layer that is immediately followed by semi impermeable layer at the depth of 2 48 m idbwo 2015 this implies that there could be several areas where water that has already percolated to shallow aquifers could be impacted by an increase in temperature demonstrating the sensitivity of groundwater recharge quantities to climate variability conversely based on the aquifer geometry in fig 3 areas with unconfined aquifers and impermeable bedrocks located at the greater depths might facilitate groundwater to percolate to depths where the impacts of climate variability are less pronounced moreover this study analysed and compared the impact of climate change alone and then the collective impact of climate and lulc change it was found that compared to baseline period for instance rainfall increase by 25 i e average annual rainfall 548 mm y under the impact of climate change alone can increase the average annual recharge by 130 at dodoma cc whereas under collective impact of climate and lulc change the same increase in rainfall amount can increase recharge by 123 figs 12 and 13 and tables 8 and 9 this indicates that groundwater recharge rates are more highly influenced by climate change than by lulc change several studies have obtained similar results where lulc change has a minimum impact on groundwater recharge in less urbanized regions adhikari et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 siddik et al 2022 the impact of lulc on groundwater recharge is trivial in bmc as the majority of land cover is less urbanized although the impact of lulc on groundwater recharge is minimum the impact of climate change on the other hand is significant and therefore these findings highlight the need for climate change adaptation strategies to take full advantage of the expected increase in recharge amounts particularly on the southern part of the catchment furthermore the findings related to the predicted groundwater recharge against elevation revealed that there is a decrease in average annual recharge amounts at higher altitudes i e in the north of bmc with an increase towards lower altitudes in the south direction table 10 and fig 13 as earlier indicated in section 2 1 the southern part has numerous fractures which favours more groundwater recharge hence geological features in the southern part may govern the movement of water to the deeper aquifer the study by hersi et al 2023 predicted the northern part of the catchment would experience the highest reduction in rainfall by 15 under ssp245 while the south eastern part will experience the highest increase by 25 in rainfall under ssp585 by the 2080s in this study these changes in rainfall were related to changes in groundwater recharge as follows reduced groundwater recharge in the northern is attributed to reduced rainfall and a steep slope of 10 due to the presence of mt hanang under the collective impact of both climate and lulc change a reduction of 15 in rainfall amounts in hanang dc may reduce groundwater recharge by up to 24 on steep slopes whereas a 25 increase in rainfall amounts in dodoma cc can increase recharge by up to 123 on gentle slopes i e the slope of 0 10 despite several studies including those by yifru et al 2020a dekongmen et al 2022 and umugwaneza et al 2022 that have validated the important function of gentle slopes in the groundwater recharging process slopes are not the only contributing factor to groundwater recharge soil properties and types could also play a significant role in recharge processes due to their permeability hydraulic conductivity ks and available water capacity awc which may either support or inhibit percolation tang et al 2020 chiang et al 2021 higher ks indicate rapid water movement through the soil whereas awc indicated the ability of soil to retain water peters 2013 othman et al 2021 therefore soils with higher ks and lower awc allows fast movement of water through the soil layers resulting in rapid groundwater recharge tang et al 2020 since a majority of soil types available at bmc fall under the category of moderately low to moderate low hydraulic conductivity ks and lower water retention awc as indicated in fig 7 and table 6 they create a more or less uniform influence on recharge throughout the catchment therefore this study has established the dominance of slope and rainfall in influencing groundwater recharge in bmc making areas of flat topography prime for continued groundwater recharge seasonally it was predicted in this study that the highest groundwater recharge amounts are in djf season followed by mam son and lowest in jja season for both baseline and future periods this hydrological year s tendency is a result of the catchment being unimodal experiencing strong rainfall in djf and no rain in jja rwebugisa 2008 hersi et al 2023 this indicates the sensitivity and high dependency of groundwater recharge on climate variables moeck et al 2020 considering groundwater is a main water source across various sectors in bmc close attention should be paid during groundwater extraction in low recharge seasons such as jja and son excessive groundwater extraction beyond its recharge potential results in to collapse of pore spaces that lead to land subsidence which later impedes future recharge when higher rainfall amounts are attained rafiei et al 2022 tang et al 2022 however it remains unknown to what extent the future local groundwater recharge received in bmc will cover the future groundwater demand therefore quantifying future groundwater demands as well as optimizing high recharge seasons on flat topography especially djf by investing in artificial groundwater recharge should be the way forward 5 conclusion this study aimed to simulate future groundwater recharge for the ungauged bahi manyoni catchment under the influence of changing climate and lulc the applied swat model managed to capture the hydrological processes of the bmc however with a slight underestimation of simulated peak flow which was associated with unrecorded heavy rainfalls due to sparsely located rainfall stations on the catchment the findings from this study depicted the impact of lulc to be trivial due to less urbanization whereas the impact of climate change scenarios to be significant in groundwater recharge both the medium i e ssp245 and high i e ssp585 emission climate scenarios were predicted to cause a relative increase in recharge amounts for both 2050s and 2080s it was predicted in year 2080s under the impact of both climate and lulc change the central and southern parts of the bmc would experience an increase of at least two fold but unfortunately this increase would be of not more than 13 23 mm y thus the overall predicted groundwater recharge remains low in the catchment furthermore this study delineated low recharge zones to be on the northern part of the catchment and high recharge zone to be on the southwest of the catchment due to their differences in elevation and climate it was found in this study that a 15 rainfall reduction on steep slopes i e hanang dc can lower groundwater recharge by up to 24 whereas a 25 rainfall increase on gentle slopes i e dodoma cc can increase recharge by 123 making areas with flat topography ideal for high groundwater recharge influence of soil hydraulic conductivity and available water capacity on the other hand may have a slight impact on recharge due to their similarities throughout the catchment leaving topography and climate to be dominating factors for groundwater recharge from the seasonality analysis it was predicted that groundwater recharges follow the hydrological year i e maximum recharge being experienced on djf and nearly no recharge during jja these findings provide key information for groundwater recharge however the developed model had challenges depicting the actual scenarios in areas of hanang and kondoa perhaps due to the poor representation of rainfall datasets used in this study the developed model classifies some areas in hanang and kondoa as areas with low groundwater recharge but these areas have high groundwater recharge therefore it is recommended to exercise caution when making interpretations and decisions using the currently developed model in these areas 6 recommendations the following are recommendations emanating from this study i swat modelling showed a slight underestimation of peak flows which was tied to unrepresentative rainfall distribution in the catchment therefore future studies should improve rainfall representation in the catchment ii this study was based on estimating groundwater recharge before being partitioned to shallow or deep aquifer recharge therefore this calls for further studies on analysing amount of recharge that will contribute to shallow aquifer and the amount that will be in deep aquifer by coupling swat with other models such as modflow iii the study area was predicted to have overall low groundwater recharge therefore it is recommended that idb water board to take advantage of areas of higher recharge potential as well as be keen on issuing water extraction permits in future in areas of lower recharge potential

11638,the study appraises the geogenic and anthropogenic contamination of groundwater around tanneries located in chromepet southern india thirty six groundwater samples were examined for major anions cations and trace metals concentration the concentration of chromium cr iron fe and lead pb in the study area ranges from 0 04 to 0 51 mg l 0 001 1 07 mg l and 0 001 0 09 mg l respectively 97 of the samples exceeded the acceptable range for cr whereas lead and iron exceeded 89 and 8 of the samples respectively the high concentrations of chromium iron and lead in the groundwater are due to the influence of tannery effluents the majority of the samples in the study area suggested silicate weathering the piper plot reveals that 50 of the water samples have na cl type water which is possibly due to anthropogenic sources the chadha plot revealed that silicate weathering and ion exchange govern the bulk of groundwater chemistry in freshwater aquifers owing to carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution durov plot highlights that the bulk of the samples has no dominating anion or cation types indicating simple dissolution or mixing saturation index si reveals that 50 of the samples were supersaturated due to calcite and dolomite precipitation principal component analysis pca 1 suggested secondary salt discharge from geogenic and anthropogenic processes due to tanning

in varying proportions the groundwater exists under unconfined conditions and can be found in both the shallow weathered zone and the deeper fractured zone the water table level in an open well ranges from 5 to 10 m whereas it extends down to 100 m in bore wells the wells in the study area yield up to 7 l s with a transmissivity of 6 87 m2 day and storativity between 2 9 10 4 and 4 5 10 3 cgwb 2008 a detailed study of the aquifer properties and the management plan of the study area is carried out by cgwb 2017 the weathered rocks are linked with several types of soils in the region including clay red sandy or red loamy red sandy brown clay and alluvial soil about 152 big and small scale tanneries are present in and around chennai city in different places such as pallavaram pammal nagalkeny and chromepet and these industries discharge an effluent of 3000 m3 day 1 chrome tanning wet blue tanning and vegetable tanning are the major tanning processes undertaken in this region undio 2001 chrome and vegetable tanning is common in the study area where chrome tanneries utilize chromium salt and vegetable tanneries use vegetables chemicals like crhno3 enzymes naso4 lime nh4cl and h2so4 are used in chrome tanning procedures clri 2008 and are followed by splitting shaving re chroming and re tanning the pallavaram common etp effluent treatment plant has been in operation since february 1995 the tannery effluents were channelled to a common etp where they are processed and discharged into open sewers and ponds that connect to the adyar river however even the treated effluent contains a small amount of chromium and high salinity 3 methodology 3 1 sample collection and analytical methods thirty six samples of groundwater were collected from the study area and the locations were shown in fig 1 groundwater samples were taken in 1 l hdpe bottles pre washed with hno3 and distilled water the groundwater level in the study area was determined using a water level indicator at multiple locations groundwater levels below 1 m were sampled from open wells whereas for bore wells the water was pumped for 5 min for sample collection bottles were rinsed thrice with respective well water while sampling and samples were sent to the laboratory at a controlled temperature of 4 c a thermometer and portable water quality metres were used to determine the physical parameters the alkalinity kit was used to determine the alkalinity in the field an ion chromatograph metrohm was used to analyse the major ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 the systronics uv vis 118 spectrophotometer was used to estimate the concentration of so4 2 the american public health association apha 2004 standard procedures were used for the analysis of physico chemical parameters the hco3 and cl levels were cross checked using the auto titration method trace element and chromium concentrations were determined using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer gf aas chromium standard code 1 19779 and hc412246 the accuracy of all the analytical techniques is verified by procedural blanks and standards at regular intervals to confirm the accuracy of the ion chemistry the ion balance error ibe was considered and it was around 5 for each sample the percentage of ibe is expressed as follows i b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 the spatial variation map was created by the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique provided in the arcgis 10 1 software hydrochemical facies plots were prepared based on the ionic parameters using rockworks 16 1 software the multivariate statistics were performed using the spss version 17 0 the saturation index was calculated in aquachem ver 4 using the phreeqc 2 16 interface parkhurst and appelo 1999 4 results and discussions 4 1 geochemistry of groundwater the descriptive statistics of the analysed water samples are shown in table 1 the ph of the groundwater in the region ranges from 6 2 to 7 7 suggesting slightly acidic alkaline to neutral conditions the electrical conductivity ec in the study area ranges from 736 to 3098 μs cm with an average of 1924 μs cm high ec values are noticed in sampling locations 10 14 15 18 29 and 36 fig s1a the concentration of total dissolved solids tds ranged between 471 and 1983 mg l with an average of 1231 mg l around 83 of the samples were classified as brackish water with tds varying from 1000 to 10000 mg l the tds in the groundwater samples were contributed by the major ions derived from geogenic and anthropogenic sources sodium is the most abundant ion in the groundwater ranging from 56 to 418 mg l with an average of 203 mg l high concentrations of sodium are observed in well locations 10 14 28 and 36 which were close to the tannery region fig s1b the use of na cl in the treatment of hides and their seepage into the groundwater may have increased the concentration of sodium calcium levels vary from 43 to 178 mg l with a mean of 109 mg l probably derived from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals potassium concentrations range from 1 to 42 mg l with a mean value of 9 mg l mostly derived from mixed sources the chloride content varied between 66 and 775 mg l with a mean value of 276 mg l in general high chloride concentrations in freshwater are caused by natural factors such as atmospheric precipitation salt deposit weathering dissolution of halites and evaporates as well as anthropogenic sources such as leachates from landfills waste dumps irrigation return flow septic tanks and industrial wastes the high chloride concentration was observed in the tannery zone because of the effect of tannery effluent fig s1c sulphate levels range from 82 to 195 mg l with an average of 146 mg l sulphate content in groundwater is often high due to mineral dissolution from the parent rock and it rises owing to the decomposition of minerals such as calcite gypsum and dolomite which were found in the study area fig s1d the hco3 value varies from 171 to 671 mg l with a mean of 413 mg l mineral precipitation and ion exchange activities have caused an increase in hco3 in some areas generally the high concentrations of bicarbonate over other anions indicate weathering of primary silicate minerals and carbonates which tend to enrich bicarbonate the abundance of cations in the groundwater samples shows the following order na ca mg k whereas for anions it shows hco3 cl so4 it is observed that the geochemistry of the groundwater is governed by hco3 na ca2 which is probably through the freshwater recharge and the source of na cl might be contributed from the effluents the general characteristics of the groundwater systems were determined using piper s 1953 diagram approximately 80 of the samples are strong acids so4 2 cl and weak acids co3 hco3 demonstrating the dominance of so4 2 cl strong acids and co3 hco3 weak acids type groundwater throughout the area primarily in shallow aquifers fig 2 a the figures indicated that alkali elements like k and na exceeded the alkaline earth elements like mg2 and ca2 in 63 9 of the samples table s1 in the study area approximately 50 of the samples fall under the na cl zone showing the effect of anthropogenic influence on the groundwater systems probably from the tannery effluents around 36 of the samples fall under the mixed water type zone cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 and hco3 na ca2 which shows the effect of human induced activities reverse ion exchange ion exchange and rock water interactions the gibbs 1970 diagram has been frequently utilised to resolve the various relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological properties the diagram considers three processes based on the ratios such as na k na ca2 k and cl cl hco3 vs tds highlighting the evaporation precipitation and rock water interaction dominance the majority of the groundwater samples are clustered into the rock water interaction and evaporation zone supporting the semi arid climate and the mineral weathering mechanisms influence the groundwater chemistry in the study area fig 2b the evaporation process was expected because the bulk of the samples was collected from the shallow aquifers according to the tds versus th bivariate plot the majority of the groundwater samples are hard brackish water due to mineral dissolution and ion exchange activities fig 2c 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis has been used to investigate the link between the hydrochemical characteristics and the source of groundwater contamination the correlation matrix of the region s groundwater is shown in table s2 a strong positive correlation is observed between ec and ca2 r 0 574 mg2 r 0 548 na r 0 768 hco3 r 0 544 cl r 0 807 and so4 2 r 0 573 indicating that the alkaline and alkali earth elements contribute a major share of the dissolved ions in the groundwater a positive correlation has been found for cl versus ca2 r 0 605 na r 0 609 and k r 0 543 suggesting the solubility and effect of secondary salt and tannery effluent kanagaraj and elango 2016 a similar positive correlation was seen for so4 2 versus na r 0 734 and cl 0 542 also indicating the effluent effect na is also having a good correlation with cl 0 609 indicating their common origin ca2 mg and k are having good correlations suggesting their geogenic origin due to the dissolution of dolomite calcite feldspars and clay minerals the principal component analysis pca highlights five factors with a total variance of 72 which are represented in table s3 factor 1 grouped the ions such as ca2 mg2 na so4 2 and cl with a variance of 20 the major processes involved in the contribution of na and ca2 in the groundwater are probably through the application of salt in the treatment of hides and partly from the geogenic sources involving ion exchange reactions the positive loading in factor 1 for the majority of the ions and trace elements except mn zn pb and ni suggests secondary salt dissolution and leaching kanagaraj and elango 2016 factor 2 corresponds to k cu zn and ni with 19 of the variance suggesting trace element contamination from anthropogenic sources such as the skin hides treatment whereas factor 3 highlights the association of na so4 2 and cr with 13 4 variance which specifies the impact of tannery effluents since cr2 so4 3 are widely used in the tanning process fig 3 the hydrochemical processes of the groundwater samples are described by the factor scores based on the factor score the spatial disparity may be utilised to determine the represented factor zone the factor 1 score ranges from 1 9 to 3 3 and the higher zone s spatial variations suggest the industrial belt fig s2a the score for factor 2 varied from 2 2 to 1 9 the factor 2 score spatial representation was directed towards the east which is dominated by the hydrogeochemical weathering processes fig s2b the factor score of 3 ranged between 1 1 and 4 5 with a positive value reported in the region s east fig s2c one of the most commonly used multivariate statistical methods is principal component analysis pca as shown in fig s3a principal component analysis pca of hydrogeochemical data indicates a link between various geochemical properties of groundwater in component 1 the presence of ions such as ec mg2 ca2 na k cl so4 2 and cr positive suggests secondary salt discharge from hydrogeochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents kanagaraj and elango 2016 ion concentrations in component 2 such as mg2 ca2 and na reflect silicate weathering further the hierarchical cluster analyses hca indicate that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by three groups of clusters fig s3b cluster i specify the sampling locations having similar hydrogeochemical weathering which is distributed all over the study area and cluster ii is highlighting the western part of the study area in a more distributed way indicating mixed sources cluster iii is more concentrated around the tanneries and effluent treatment plant indicating the seepage of effluents into the groundwater multivariate statistical results indicated most of the groundwater is controlled by hydrogeochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents 4 3 hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 silicate weathering processes carbonate dissolution silicate weathering and evaporate dissolution are some of the most important hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to silicate minerals in the groundwater many researchers have estimated silicate weathering using ratio plots of tc vs na k tc vs ca2 mg2 hco3 na mg2 na versus ca2 na subramani et al 2010 the majority of the samples in the study area are close to the na k 0 6 tz line suggesting silicate weathering fig s4a furthermore the ca2 mg2 to total cation ratio is computed and the bulk of samples fall under the 1 1 line fig s4b both plots indicate silicate weathering owing to the participation of sodium potassium and ion exchange processes the comparison of mg2 na hco3 na and ca2 na also supports the silicate weathering process the plots demonstrate that the bulk of the samples falls under the evaporate dissolution zones and silicate weathering with no carbonate dissolution figs s4c and d since the region is covered with charnockites and gneisses silicate weathering is the dominant process and affects the bulk of the groundwater chemistry moreover the na cl molar ratio is greater than one indicating silicate weathering mayback 1987 in the study area 64 of the samples have a ratio higher than one indicating sodium release due to silicate weathering the moderate positive correlation table s2 between hco3 and ca2 mg2 na and k implies a similar source most likely the weathering of feldspar minerals 4 3 2 ion exchange processes one of the most significant geochemical processes in groundwater is ion exchange various ionic ratios and indices such as ca2 mg2 hco3 versus cl the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and 2 chadha plot and ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 were calculated and indicate the presence of ion exchange processes the following equations were used to calculate the cai 1 and cai 2 values and are expressed in meq l c a i 1 c l n a k c l c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 the cai considers two processes reverse ion exchange and ion exchange a negative value for cai indicates ion exchange whereas a positive value implies a reverse ion exchange process schoeller 1965 the region is influenced by ion exchange for the majority of groundwater samples due to carbonate precipitation with reverse ion exchange activity detected in a few samples fig 4 a the cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 values range between 0 2 and 1 3 mmol and account for 58 of the samples with values larger than 0 5 suggesting a reverse ion exchange mechanism fig 4b similarly the plot ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 specify that 55 of the groundwater samples are controlled by ion exchange processes since the high concentration of so4 2 hco3 during silicate weathering and a few of the samples indicate reverse ion exchange processes contributed by carbonate weathering fig 4c further the plot na cl versus cl clearly supports the ion exchange process due to the presence of weathered clay layers and silicate weathering according to chadha s plot chadha 1999 38 of samples are classified as field 3 saline water and field 2 reverse ion exchange waters fig 4d overall the plot revealed that silicate weathering and ion exchange govern the bulk of groundwater chemistry in freshwater aquifers owing to carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution 4 3 3 mineral dissolution and precipitation processes to assess the mineral dissolution and precipitation processes in the study area the durov plot ca2 mg2 vs hco3 ca2 versus hco3 and saturation index si were used the durov 1948 plot illustrates that the bulk of the samples has no dominating anion or cation types indicating simple dissolution or mixing moreover few samples have considerable na cl concentration owing to the tannery effluents since they are located in the tannery region fig 5 a a bivariate plot ca2 mg2 against hco3 can be used to distinguish three processes such as mineral dissolution precipitation and ion exchange the bulk of the samples in the study area exceeded the 1 1 equal line due to dolomite dissolution but a few samples reduce the ca2 effect of carbonate precipitation ion exchange and gypsum dissolution fig 5b the ca2 vs hco3 scatter plot reveals that the bulk of the samples falls beneath the 1 1 equal line of calcite dissolution fig 5c the saturation index si is calculated to resolve the presence of minerals in the groundwater that is in equilibrium with others according to appelo and postma 1996 si iap ks is used to compute the si of a mineral where iap stands for ion activity product and ks stands for mineral solubility product the si values of dolomite calcite and aragonite across the study area except for three samples with positive values indicate that the area is oversaturated fig 6 a the si of aragonite ranges from 0 69 to 0 39 where 33 of the samples showing an over saturated state for calcite the si value ranges from 0 54 to 0 53 with 75 of the samples being over saturated for dolomite the si value ranges from 1 3 to 1 06 with 56 of the samples being over saturated whereas the anhydrite 2 03 to 1 51 gypsum 1 81 to 1 29 and halite 7 01 to 5 47 show an under saturated state fig 6b the scatter graphs si dolomite si calcite and tds were compared using three processes based on values such as 0 5 0 under saturated 0 0 5 over saturated and 0 5 super saturated the plot of tds versus si calcite shows that the bulk of the samples falls into an over saturated zone due to precipitation and few samples lie under the saturated zone due to the dissolution of minerals fig 6c si dolomite versus tds reveals that the samples in the region are under saturated due to mineral dissolution with certain groundwater samples being over saturated due to precipitation processes further the plot of si calcite si dolomite versus so4 2 indicates that the majority of the samples have been over saturated fig 6d the ratio plot of calcium to magnesium shows that about 66 of the groundwater samples fall between 1 and 2 indicating the dissolution of calcite which also plays a remarkable role in the occurrence of high calcium concentrations in the groundwater however only a few samples had values higher than 2 indicating silicate mineral disintegration 4 4 trace elements trace element concentrations in groundwater are mostly the result of industrial effluents and natural weathering table 1 shows the analytical data for the trace elements minimum maximum and mean values along with the bis 2012 and who 2022 permissible limits for drinking water the trace element concentrations were determined in the following order based on the observations in the region cr fe zn mn pb cu the chromium content ranged from 0 04 to 0 51 mg l with a mean of 0 20 mg l in the study area according to the bis 2012 limits 97 of samples exceeded the permissible limits 0 05 of chromium in general high chromium levels in groundwater have been linked to serious health concerns like lung and stomach cancer heart problems and kidney malfunction nasr et al 2012 because of high chromium concentrations the groundwater in the region s centre and north is unsafe to drink fig s5a earlier investigations detected the presence of chromium in the groundwater from 2004 to 2016 and were compared to the present research table s4 according to sridhar et al 2013 the estimated chromium content in 2007 had a maximum value of 2 7 mg l a higher chromium content of 0 9 mg l was noticed in 2008 and was reported by brindha and elango 2012 the bulk of the groundwater samples in the study area have high chromium content due to the seepage of tannery effluents into the groundwater moreover it was observed that the chromium concentration levels fluctuated during the previous eight years the concentration of iron in the groundwater varies from 0 001 to 1 07 mg l with a mean of 0 10 mg l iron content in samples 21 and 35 were found to be above the permissible limit of bis 2012 and who 2022 the zonation map shows that the northern part has a higher concentration of iron fig s5b which is due to the effect of effluents and natural sources the concentration of lead in the groundwater samples ranges from 0 001 to 0 09 mg l with a mean of 0 03 mg l the spatial pattern of lead in the region s centre and northern parts shows a high concentration around the tannery region due to the widespread use of sulphate the concentration of copper in the groundwater samples ranges from 0 001 to 0 03 mg l with a mean of 0 01 mg l the spatial pattern of copper in the region s southern parts indicating geogenic and anthropogenic sources fig s5c manganese is a necessary element but it is often associated with fe complexes manganese concentrations in groundwater are low owing to geochemical contribution the concentration of manganese in the region lies between 0 001 and 1 4 mg l fig s5d the sources of trace elements in the groundwater are leather processing and colouring dying units 4 5 tannery effluents and their impact on water quality the ccme wqi and the british columbia ministry of environment were both revised and only trace elements were examined the world health organization s who 2004 permissible limit range was used instead of the canadian standards of the ccme to get a global perspective of the situation the equations for calculating the water quality index are explained elsewhere ccme 2001 the ccmewqi is frequently classified into five categories based on its values outstanding 95 100 good 80 94 fair 60 79 marginal 45 59 and bad 0 44 the ccmewqi has been utilised to evaluate the groundwater quality in the study area around 61 of samples fall into the fair 60 79 group while 33 fall into the marginal 45 59 category fig 7 from the ccmewqi it is apparent that the majority of the groundwater is impacted by geochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents the concentrations of the following ions na cl and so4 2 were found to be above the permissible limit in a few places including sample no 10 14 15 29 and 36 moreover other samples have a high concentration of na k which might be due to effluent mixing and ion exchange processes fig 8 a comparision study on the concentration of na cl and cr in the groundwater from 2004 to 2016 indicates that the high concentrations were dominant during 2004 2005 2007 and 2012 fig 9 according to bis 2012 97 of the sampling wells are above the permissible limit of chromium and their spatial distribution shows that groundwater from the area s centre south and north is unfit for drinking because of the discharge of partially treated water in open drains it is apparent that the quality of groundwater has not improved despite the operation of the cetp hence it is necessary to improve the performance of the functioning of cetp to reduce the salinization in the effluents furthermore the quality of the discharged effluent from the cetp needs to be periodically assessed tannery effluents disposed into the open drains have a significant impact on groundwater quality 5 conclusion the groundwater quality near the tanneries around chromepet southern india was studied using hydrogeochemical and multivariate statistical methods about 83 of the wells fall under the brackish water category considering the concentration of ec and tds it was found that 50 of the groundwater samples are dominated by nacl which is probably derived from effluents from the tannery the durov plot revealed that the majority of samples had no leading anion or cation types indicating a simple dissolution or mixing a remarkable concentration of calcium is found in 66 of the groundwater samples caused by calcite dissolution inferred from the ca2 mg2 ratios the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is influenced by evaporation ion exchange and silicate weathering as a result of carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution in the freshwater aquifers a significant correlation of cl and ca2 mg2 na and k shows that the salinity increase is due to the discharge of secondary salt from the tannery effluents and other geochemical processes ccme wqi indicates that around 61 of the samples fall under the fair 60 79 group while 33 fall in the marginal 45 59 category the majority of the groundwater in this region is influenced by geochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents it is expected that tannery effluent and hydrogeochemical processes have a substantial impact on the water quality in the region as a result it is critical to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities while also generating rainwater recharge to encourage dilution and therefore improve the groundwater quality chromium contamination in the groundwater is a serious issue and creates a health hazard to the community that depends on groundwater for their daily use policymakers should take viable actions to reduce the contamination in a phased manner to ensure public health and environmental degradation the present study has certain limitations such as the sample size which was restricted to 36 due to the analytical and logistics cost involved a comparison of data with the world and the indian scenario was not performed due to scrutinizing the conditions similar to the study

11638,the study appraises the geogenic and anthropogenic contamination of groundwater around tanneries located in chromepet southern india thirty six groundwater samples were examined for major anions cations and trace metals concentration the concentration of chromium cr iron fe and lead pb in the study area ranges from 0 04 to 0 51 mg l 0 001 1 07 mg l and 0 001 0 09 mg l respectively 97 of the samples exceeded the acceptable range for cr whereas lead and iron exceeded 89 and 8 of the samples respectively the high concentrations of chromium iron and lead in the groundwater are due to the influence of tannery effluents the majority of the samples in the study area suggested silicate weathering the piper plot reveals that 50 of the water samples have na cl type water which is possibly due to anthropogenic sources the chadha plot revealed that silicate weathering and ion exchange govern the bulk of groundwater chemistry in freshwater aquifers owing to carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution durov plot highlights that the bulk of the samples has no dominating anion or cation types indicating simple dissolution or mixing saturation index si reveals that 50 of the samples were supersaturated due to calcite and dolomite precipitation principal component analysis pca 1 suggested secondary salt discharge from geogenic and anthropogenic processes due to tanning

activity sedimentation precipitation geothermal condition chemicals and effluents mining landfill and agricultural practices influence the hydrochemistry of the groundwater sajil kumar 2014 india largely relies on its groundwater resources for developmental activities and the nation s aquifer is under an over exploitation state which results in groundwater contamination related to metals nutrients and man made chemicals brindha and elango 2012 the abundance of no3 and hco3 in groundwater is primarily due to fertilizers and inorganic nitrogenous compounds followed by silicate erosion

elango 2016 magesh et al 2020 pandit et al 2022 heavy metals like as pb cd and cr are non biodegradable toxic chemicals found in natural mineral deposits and industrial wastes moreover several studies also reported the presence of metals in natural edible products such as cereals milk fish fruits vegetables etc the tanning industry in india is the fourth biggest exporter of leather goods with the majority of the industries located in the country s south roy 2012 there are over 900 tanneries in the state of tamil nadu distributed in five districts north arcot ambur vaniyambedi and ranipet erode

used in tanning and other industries such as wood preservation metallurgy electroplating and fertilisers anthropogenic pathways include the diverse type of chromium salts being utilised in various manufacturing productions and procedures jun et al 2009 whereas natural pathways like weathering of ultramafic rocks increase the chromium concentrations to a large extent basu and johnson 2012 the chromium content in the effluents ranged between 2000 and 5000 mg l in contrast to the suggested acceptable maximum of 2 mg l as reported by chandra et al 1997 several studies from various countries have reported on the environmental impact of tannery effluents belay 2010 kilic et al 2011 hasnat et al 2013 the mixing of tannery effluent with groundwater at chromepet chennai belt southern india increased the concentration of chromium above the permissible limit of the world health organization kumar and patel 2011 ramesh and thirumangai 2014 brindha and elango 2012 kanagaraj and elango 2019 however these studies are not focussed on the hydrogeochemistry statistical analysis of major ions trace elements association wqi and comparision with previous studies the present study aims to assess the various hydrogeochemical processes including trace elements and their statistical significance regulating the groundwater quality around tannery industries located in chromepet southern india the present study was conducted to investigate the current scenario in terms of the impact of tannery industries on groundwater quality and to compare the findings with previous studies 2 study area

in chrome tanning procedures clri 2008 and are followed by splitting shaving re chroming and re tanning the pallavaram common etp effluent treatment plant has been in operation since february 1995 the tannery effluents were channelled to a common etp where they are processed and discharged into open sewers and ponds that connect to the adyar river however even the treated effluent contains a small amount of chromium and high salinity 3 methodology 3 1 sample collection and analytical methods thirty six samples of groundwater were collected from the study area and the locations were shown in fig

slightly acidic alkaline to neutral conditions the electrical conductivity ec in the study area ranges from 736 to 3098 μs cm with an average of 1924 μs cm high ec values are noticed in sampling locations 10 14 15 18 29 and 36 fig s1a the concentration of total dissolved solids tds ranged between 471 and 1983 mg l with an average of 1231 mg l around 83 of the samples were classified as brackish water with tds varying from 1000 to 10000 mg l the tds in the groundwater samples were contributed by the major ions derived from geogenic and anthropogenic sources sodium is the most abundant ion in the groundwater ranging from 56 to 418 mg l with an average of 203 mg l high concentrations of sodium are observed in well locations 10 14 28 and 36 which were close to the tannery region fig s1b the use of na cl in the treatment of hides and their seepage into the groundwater may have increased the concentration of sodium calcium levels vary from 43 to 178 mg l with a mean of 109 mg l probably derived from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals potassium concentrations range from 1 to 42 mg l with a mean value of 9 mg l mostly derived from mixed sources the chloride content varied between 66 and 775 mg l with a mean value of 276 mg l in general high chloride concentrations in freshwater are caused by natural factors such as atmospheric precipitation salt deposit weathering dissolution of halites and evaporates as well as anthropogenic sources such as leachates from landfills waste dumps irrigation return flow septic tanks and industrial wastes the high chloride concentration was observed in the tannery zone because of the effect of tannery effluent fig s1c sulphate levels range from 82 to 195 mg l with an average of 146 mg l sulphate content in groundwater is often high due to mineral dissolution from the parent rock and it rises owing to the decomposition of minerals such as calcite gypsum and dolomite which were found in the study area fig s1d the hco3 value varies from 171 to 671 mg l with a mean of 413 mg l mineral precipitation and ion exchange activities have caused an increase in hco3 in some areas generally the high concentrations of bicarbonate over other anions indicate weathering of primary silicate minerals and carbonates which tend to enrich bicarbonate the abundance of cations in the groundwater samples shows the following order na ca mg k whereas for anions it shows hco3 cl so4 it is observed that the geochemistry of the groundwater is governed by hco3 na ca2 which is probably through the freshwater recharge and the source of na cl might be contributed from the effluents the general characteristics of the groundwater systems were determined using piper s 1953 diagram approximately 80 of the samples are strong acids so4 2 cl and weak acids co3 hco3 demonstrating the dominance of so4 2 cl strong acids and co3 hco3 weak acids type groundwater throughout the area primarily in shallow aquifers fig 2 a the figures indicated that alkali elements like k and na exceeded the alkaline earth elements like mg2 and ca2 in 63 9 of the samples table s1 in the study area approximately 50 of the samples fall under the na cl zone showing the effect of anthropogenic influence on the groundwater systems probably from the tannery effluents around 36 of the samples fall under the mixed water type zone cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 and hco3 na ca2 which shows the effect of human induced activities reverse ion exchange ion exchange and rock water interactions the gibbs 1970 diagram has been frequently utilised to resolve the various relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological properties the diagram considers three processes based on the ratios such as na k na ca2 k and cl cl hco3 vs tds highlighting the evaporation precipitation and rock water interaction dominance the majority of the groundwater samples are clustered into the rock water interaction and evaporation zone supporting the semi arid climate and the mineral weathering mechanisms influence the groundwater chemistry in the study area fig 2b the evaporation process was expected because the bulk of the samples was collected from the shallow aquifers according to the tds versus th bivariate plot the majority of the groundwater samples are hard brackish water due to mineral dissolution and ion exchange activities fig 2c 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis has been used to investigate the link between the hydrochemical characteristics and the source of groundwater contamination the correlation matrix of the region s groundwater is shown in table s2 a strong positive correlation is observed between ec and ca2 r 0 574 mg2 r 0 548 na r 0 768 hco3 r 0 544 cl r 0 807 and so4 2 r 0 573 indicating that the alkaline and alkali earth elements contribute a major share of the dissolved ions in the groundwater a positive correlation has been found for cl versus ca2 r 0 605 na r 0 609 and k r 0 543 suggesting the solubility and effect of secondary salt and tannery effluent kanagaraj and elango 2016 a similar positive correlation was seen for so4 2 versus na r 0 734 and cl 0 542 also indicating the effluent effect na is also having a good correlation with cl 0 609 indicating their common origin ca2 mg and k are having good correlations suggesting their geogenic origin due to the dissolution of dolomite calcite feldspars and clay minerals the principal component analysis pca highlights five factors with a total variance of 72 which are represented in table s3 factor 1 grouped the ions such as ca2 mg2 na so4 2 and cl with a variance of 20 the major processes involved in the contribution of na and ca2 in the groundwater are probably through the application of salt in the treatment of hides and partly from the geogenic sources involving ion exchange reactions the positive loading in factor 1 for the majority of the ions and trace elements except mn zn pb and ni suggests secondary salt dissolution and leaching kanagaraj and elango 2016 factor 2 corresponds to k cu zn and ni with 19 of the variance suggesting trace element contamination from anthropogenic sources such as the skin hides treatment whereas factor 3 highlights the association of na so4 2 and cr with 13 4 variance which specifies the impact of tannery effluents since cr2 so4 3 are widely used in the tanning process fig 3 the hydrochemical processes of the groundwater samples are described by the factor scores based on the factor score the spatial disparity may be utilised to determine the represented factor zone the factor 1 score ranges from 1 9 to 3 3 and the higher zone s spatial variations suggest the industrial belt fig s2a the score for factor 2 varied from 2 2 to 1 9 the factor 2 score spatial representation was directed towards the east which is dominated by the hydrogeochemical weathering processes fig s2b the factor score of 3 ranged between 1 1 and 4 5 with a positive value reported in the region s east fig s2c one of the most commonly used multivariate statistical methods is principal component analysis pca as shown in fig s3a principal component analysis pca of hydrogeochemical data indicates a link between various geochemical properties of groundwater in component 1 the presence of ions such as ec mg2 ca2 na k cl so4 2 and cr positive suggests secondary salt discharge from hydrogeochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents kanagaraj and elango 2016 ion concentrations in component 2 such as mg2 ca2 and na reflect silicate weathering further the hierarchical cluster analyses hca indicate that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by three groups of clusters fig s3b cluster i specify the sampling locations having similar hydrogeochemical weathering which is distributed all over the study area and cluster ii is highlighting the western part of the study area in a more distributed way indicating mixed sources cluster iii is more concentrated around the tanneries and effluent treatment plant indicating the seepage of effluents into the groundwater multivariate statistical results indicated most of the groundwater is controlled by hydrogeochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents 4 3 hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 silicate weathering processes carbonate dissolution silicate weathering and evaporate dissolution are some of the most important hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to silicate minerals in the groundwater many researchers have estimated silicate weathering using ratio plots of tc vs na k tc vs ca2 mg2 hco3 na mg2 na versus ca2 na subramani et al 2010 the majority of the samples in the study area are close to the na k 0 6 tz line suggesting silicate weathering fig s4a furthermore the ca2 mg2 to total cation ratio is computed and the bulk of samples fall under the 1 1 line fig s4b both plots indicate silicate weathering owing to the participation of sodium potassium and ion exchange processes the comparison of mg2 na hco3 na and ca2 na also supports the silicate weathering process the plots demonstrate that the bulk of the samples falls under the evaporate dissolution zones and silicate weathering with no carbonate dissolution figs s4c and d since the region is covered with charnockites and gneisses silicate weathering is the dominant process and affects the bulk of the groundwater chemistry moreover the na cl molar ratio is greater than one indicating silicate weathering mayback 1987 in the study area 64 of the samples have a ratio higher than one indicating sodium release due to silicate weathering the moderate positive correlation table s2 between hco3 and ca2 mg2 na and k implies a similar source most likely the weathering of feldspar minerals 4 3 2 ion exchange processes one of the most significant geochemical processes in groundwater is ion exchange various ionic ratios and indices such as ca2 mg2 hco3 versus cl the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and 2 chadha plot and ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 were calculated and indicate the presence of ion exchange processes the following equations were used to calculate the cai 1 and cai 2 values and are expressed in meq l c a i 1 c l n a k c l c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 the cai considers two processes reverse ion exchange and ion exchange a negative value for cai indicates ion exchange whereas a positive value implies a reverse ion exchange process schoeller 1965 the region is influenced by ion exchange for the majority of groundwater samples due to carbonate precipitation with reverse ion exchange activity detected in a few samples fig 4 a the cl versus ca2 mg2 hco3 values range between 0 2 and 1 3 mmol and account for 58 of the samples with values larger than 0 5 suggesting a reverse ion exchange mechanism fig 4b similarly the plot ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 specify that 55 of the groundwater samples are controlled by ion exchange processes since the high concentration of so4 2 hco3 during silicate weathering and a few of the samples indicate reverse ion exchange processes contributed by carbonate weathering fig 4c further the plot na cl versus cl clearly supports the ion exchange process due to the presence of weathered clay layers and silicate weathering according to chadha s plot chadha 1999 38 of samples are classified as field 3 saline water and field 2 reverse ion exchange waters fig 4d overall the plot revealed that silicate weathering and ion exchange govern the bulk of groundwater chemistry in freshwater aquifers owing to carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution 4 3 3 mineral dissolution and precipitation processes to assess the mineral dissolution and precipitation processes in the study area the durov plot ca2 mg2 vs hco3 ca2 versus hco3 and saturation index si were used the durov 1948 plot illustrates that the bulk of the samples has no dominating anion or cation types indicating simple dissolution or mixing moreover few samples have considerable na cl concentration owing to the tannery effluents since they are located in the tannery region fig 5 a a bivariate plot ca2 mg2 against hco3 can be used to distinguish three processes such as mineral dissolution precipitation and ion exchange the bulk of the samples in the study area exceeded the 1 1 equal line due to dolomite dissolution but a few samples reduce the ca2 effect of carbonate precipitation ion exchange and gypsum dissolution fig 5b the ca2 vs hco3 scatter plot reveals that the bulk of the samples falls beneath the 1 1 equal line of calcite dissolution fig 5c the saturation index si is calculated to resolve the presence of minerals in the groundwater that is in equilibrium with others according to appelo and postma 1996 si iap ks is used to compute the si of a mineral where iap stands for ion activity product and ks stands for mineral solubility product the si values of dolomite calcite and aragonite across the study area except for three samples with positive values indicate that the area is oversaturated fig 6 a the si of aragonite ranges from 0 69 to 0 39 where 33 of the samples showing an over saturated state for calcite the si value ranges from 0 54 to 0 53 with 75 of the samples being over saturated for dolomite the si value ranges from 1 3 to 1 06 with 56 of the samples being over saturated whereas the anhydrite 2 03 to 1 51 gypsum 1 81 to 1 29 and halite 7 01 to 5 47 show an under saturated state fig 6b the scatter graphs si dolomite si calcite and tds were compared using three processes based on values such as 0 5 0 under saturated 0 0 5 over saturated and 0 5 super saturated the plot of tds versus si calcite shows that the bulk of the samples falls into an over saturated zone due to precipitation and few samples lie under the saturated zone due to the dissolution of minerals fig 6c si dolomite versus tds reveals that the samples in the region are under saturated due to mineral dissolution with certain groundwater samples being over saturated due to precipitation processes further the plot of si calcite si dolomite versus so4 2 indicates that the majority of the samples have been over saturated fig 6d the ratio plot of calcium to magnesium shows that about 66 of the groundwater samples fall between 1 and 2 indicating the dissolution of calcite which also plays a remarkable role in the occurrence of high calcium concentrations in the groundwater however only a few samples had values higher than 2 indicating silicate mineral disintegration 4 4 trace elements trace element concentrations in groundwater are mostly the result of industrial effluents and natural weathering table 1 shows the analytical data for the trace elements minimum maximum and mean values along with the bis 2012 and who 2022 permissible limits for drinking water the trace element concentrations were determined in the following order based on the observations in the region cr fe zn mn pb cu the chromium content ranged from 0 04 to 0 51 mg l with a mean of 0 20 mg l in the study area according to the bis 2012 limits 97 of samples exceeded the permissible limits 0 05 of chromium in general high chromium levels in groundwater have been linked to serious health concerns like lung and stomach cancer heart problems and kidney malfunction nasr et al 2012 because of high chromium concentrations the groundwater in the region s centre and north is unsafe to drink fig s5a earlier investigations detected the presence of chromium in the groundwater from 2004 to 2016 and were compared to the present research table s4 according to sridhar et al 2013 the estimated chromium content in 2007 had a maximum value of 2 7 mg l a higher chromium content of 0 9 mg l was noticed in 2008 and was reported by brindha and elango 2012 the bulk of the groundwater samples in the study area have high chromium content due to the seepage of tannery effluents into the groundwater moreover it was observed that the chromium concentration levels fluctuated during the previous eight years the concentration of iron in the groundwater varies from 0 001 to 1 07 mg l with a mean of 0 10 mg l iron content in samples 21 and 35 were found to be above the permissible limit of bis 2012 and who 2022 the zonation map shows that the northern part has a higher concentration of iron fig s5b which is due to the effect of effluents and natural sources the concentration of lead in the groundwater samples ranges from 0 001 to 0 09 mg l with a mean of 0 03 mg l the spatial pattern of lead in the region s centre and northern parts shows a high concentration around the tannery region due to the widespread use of sulphate the concentration of copper in the groundwater samples ranges from 0 001 to 0 03 mg l with a mean of 0 01 mg l the spatial pattern of copper in the region s southern parts indicating geogenic and anthropogenic sources fig s5c manganese is a necessary element but it is often associated with fe complexes manganese concentrations in groundwater are low owing to geochemical contribution the concentration of manganese in the region lies between 0 001 and 1 4 mg l fig s5d the sources of trace elements in the groundwater are leather processing and colouring dying units 4 5 tannery effluents and their impact on water quality the ccme wqi and the british columbia ministry of environment were both revised and only trace elements were examined the world health organization s who 2004 permissible limit range was used instead of the canadian standards of the ccme to get a global perspective of the situation the equations for calculating the water quality index are explained elsewhere ccme 2001 the ccmewqi is frequently classified into five categories based on its values outstanding 95 100 good 80 94 fair 60 79 marginal 45 59 and bad 0 44 the ccmewqi has been utilised to evaluate the groundwater quality in the study area around 61 of samples fall into the fair 60 79 group while 33 fall into the marginal 45 59 category fig 7 from the ccmewqi it is apparent that the majority of the groundwater is impacted by geochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents the concentrations of the following ions na cl and so4 2 were found to be above the permissible limit in a few places including sample no 10 14 15 29 and 36 moreover other samples have a high concentration of na k which might be due to effluent mixing and ion exchange processes fig 8 a comparision study on the concentration of na cl and cr in the groundwater from 2004 to 2016 indicates that the high concentrations were dominant during 2004 2005 2007 and 2012 fig 9 according to bis 2012 97 of the sampling wells are above the permissible limit of chromium and their spatial distribution shows that groundwater from the area s centre south and north is unfit for drinking because of the discharge of partially treated water in open drains it is apparent that the quality of groundwater has not improved despite the operation of the cetp hence it is necessary to improve the performance of the functioning of cetp to reduce the salinization in the effluents furthermore the quality of the discharged effluent from the cetp needs to be periodically assessed tannery effluents disposed into the open drains have a significant impact on groundwater quality 5 conclusion the groundwater quality near the tanneries around chromepet southern india was studied using hydrogeochemical and multivariate statistical methods about 83 of the wells fall under the brackish water category considering the concentration of ec and tds it was found that 50 of the groundwater samples are dominated by nacl which is probably derived from effluents from the tannery the durov plot revealed that the majority of samples had no leading anion or cation types indicating a simple dissolution or mixing a remarkable concentration of calcium is found in 66 of the groundwater samples caused by calcite dissolution inferred from the ca2 mg2 ratios the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is influenced by evaporation ion exchange and silicate weathering as a result of carbonate precipitation and mineral dissolution in the freshwater aquifers a significant correlation of cl and ca2 mg2 na and k shows that the salinity increase is due to the discharge of secondary salt from the tannery effluents and other geochemical processes ccme wqi indicates that around 61 of the samples fall under the fair 60 79 group while 33 fall in the marginal 45 59 category the majority of the groundwater in this region is influenced by geochemical weathering processes and tannery effluents it is expected that tannery effluent and hydrogeochemical processes have a substantial impact on the water quality in the region as a result it is critical to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities while also generating rainwater recharge to encourage dilution and therefore improve the groundwater quality chromium contamination in the groundwater is a serious issue and creates a health hazard to the community that depends on groundwater for their daily use policymakers should take viable actions to reduce the contamination in a phased manner to ensure public health and environmental degradation the present study has certain limitations such as the sample size which was restricted to 36 due to the analytical and logistics cost involved a comparison of data with the world and the indian scenario was not performed due to scrutinizing the conditions similar to the study

11639,glyphosate gly also known as n phosphomethyl glycine and its commercially formulated contemporaries are the most widely used class of herbicides in the world due to the hydrophilic nature of this contaminant it has been detected in surface water effluents groundwater and agri food items especially those that are in proximity to active agricultural zones although glyphosate was regarded to be less toxic to human and aquatic health its metabolite such as aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa is reported to be highly deleterious to the aquatic ecosystem and human health when exposed to it hence this necessitates the development of sensitive and selective instrumental techniques to screen detect and quantify this contaminant including their removal strategies from the environment in view of this the ecotoxicological impact of gly and its metabolites ampa on human and aquatic health and the various advanced instrumental techniques utilized for offsite e g chromatographic in tandem with mass spectrometry techniques gc ms hplc ms uplc ms ms and onsite spectroscopic techniques electrochemical techniques and biosensors analysis of this contaminant are comprehensively discussed furthermore various treatment approaches such as adsorption biological treatments and advanced oxidative processes utilized for the degradation and mineralization of gly and its metabolites in environmental samples are well described finally various challenges relating to glyphosate degradation were identified and suggestions were provided on possible ways of optimizing the recognized methods reported in published literature graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate ampa degradation ecotoxicology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glyphosate gly is primarily a class of anionic highly effective and non selective herbicides used for eradicating weeds it is used in agriculture forestry and horticulture for controlling invasive species being a post emergent herbicide its mechanism of action involves the inhibition and disruption of biosynthetic pathways of essential building blocks such as phenylalanine amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine which are pivotal for plants growth masotti et al 2021 valle et al 2019 pyruvylshikimic acid complex also known as 3 enolpyruvylshikimicvacid 5 phosphate synthase epsps is essential for the biosynthesis of these essential building blocks and it has been reported for inhibiting the action of this complex in the presence of gly gonçalves et al 2019 sihtmäe et al 2013 since animal systems do not operate with this pathway it can be hypothesized that animals are potentially free from gly adverse effect however other types of gly especially those functionalized with the surfactant components roundup surfactants have been reported to be severely toxic to aquatic and human health sanders et al 1979 thanomsit et al 2020a b webster et al 2014 although gly is less toxic when compared to other commercially formulated surfactants e g polyethoxylated amine however the formulated surfactants to a large extent are reported to be precursors to dna and tissue damages endocrine disruption hormonal imbalance and carcinogenesis in amphibians fisheries mammals and humans inclusive gonçalves et al 2019 modesto and martinez 2010 zomer et al 2013 terrestrial animals are exposed to gly through direct application or consumption of contaminated food products although the introduction of gly into the aquatic environment is not common different possible pathways of discharge into the aquatic environment have been reported dean et al 2006 rzymski et al 2013 thanomsit et al 2020a b direct application of gly into aquatic waterbodies for the elimination of aquatic weeds in ditches water bodies margins including leaching and surface runoffs are potential sources of contamination of the aquatic ecosystem although gly is commonly known for its plant specific mode of action glys and its commercially formulated subsidiaries has been reported by several studies to cause deleterious impacts on freshwater biota both target and non target aquatic organisms such as bacteria algae fisheries and amphibians córdova et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2019 van bruggen et al 2018 in fact gly metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid commonly abbreviated as ampa is highly soluble in water and dissolves quickly between 7 and 12 days giesy et al 2000 gonçalves et al 2019 hence there is need for quick and fast detection techniques for monitoring of the levels of gly and its metabolite in the environment several advanced techniques have been developed over the years for the detection of gly from environmental samples these techniques are often used based on cost analytical performance and simplicity considering the chemical properties of gly coupled with low molecular weight its high polarity and hydrophilicity necessitates the application of several conventional hyphenated techniques such as chromatographic mass spectrometry e g lc ms hplc ms uplc ms ms and gc ms li et al 2017 valle et al 2019 wan et al 2022 ion chromatographic ic techniques qiu et al 2013 sato et al 2001 zhu et al 1999 capillary electrophoresis ce chang and liao 2002 although these methods offer high sensitivity and selectivity at relatively low levels they are expensive sometimes complex to operate and not suitable for field work this necessitated the development of cost effective fast simple and field friendly alternatives for the detection and quantification of gly in environmental samples typical examples of these instruments reported in literature includes fluorescence spectroscopy lee et al 2013 peng et al 2022a b optical spectroscopic techniques chang et al 2016a lee et al 2013 scandurra et al 2022a b valle et al 2019 biosensors congur 2021 electrochemical techniques scandurra et al 2022a b zambrano intriago et al 2021 surface enhanced raman spectrometry abbreviated as sers emonds alt et al 2022 scandurra et al 2022a b butmee et al 2022 huang et al 2020 apparently there have been efforts geared toward the detection and quantification of gly and its metabolites in various environmental compartments however its removal is equally important due to the adverse effects it can potentially cause to the flora and fauna community various decontamination strategies either involve the degradation and mineralization of gly into less harmful metabolites or complete elimination from soil surface water and wastewater using physical and chemical methods e g adsorption by utilization of biochar jia et al 2020 activated carbon salman and al saad 2012 and resins xiao and meng 2020 utilization of bacteria degrading agents acosta cortés et al 2019 balthazor and hallas 1986 feng et al 2020a b singh et al 2019a b zhang et al 2019a photooxidative methods which involves the utilization of photocatalytic degradation onasanya et al 2021 oladoye et al 2021 lv

zhang et al 2012 and electrochemical oxidative approaches tran et al 2017 the advantages and limitations of various treatment technologies concisely discussed in table 8 section 4 the keyword glyphosate appeared in about 13 190 scopus indexed published papers online stressing the various types of research relating to gly as shown in fig 1 however only about 591 literature review publications were available on scopus regarding this contaminant at the time of writing this paper 6 7 hence it is crucial to make an up to date compilation of this scattered but available information and to compare and contrast different research outputs aimed towards better understanding of gly in the environment including efficient and effective ways of their elimination also we have comprehensively discussed on the ecotoxicological impacts of gly circulation in environmental samples various advanced hyphenated techniques utilized for their detection and quantification and finally the treatment technologies applied for the mineralization and elimination of gly including the possible degradation products in environmental samples based on available information in literature using more than 250 published papers to the best of our knowledge 2 ecotoxicological impacts of glyphosates 2 1 aquatic animals the aquatic ecology is a crucial part of our planet fig 2 illustrates how the accumulation of gly in water bodies has impacted the quality of life for all plants and animals that survive there especially fish thanomsit et al 2020a b gly and its primary metabolites have frequently been found in water bodies as a result of the widespread usage of herbicides based on gly bacci and campo 2022 both gly and its metabolites are water soluble and can linger for a number of weeks in aquatic environments gandhi et al 2021 according to a report the presence of gly in aquatic environments can cause the death of aquatic species including birds fish and herpetofauna bastos gonçalves et al 2020 tsui and chu 2003 conducted one of the first studies to assess the presence of gly in aquatic environments the team investigated how this substance can affect crustaceans ceriodaphnia dubia and acartia tonsa as well as other organisms like bacteria algae and protozoans the findings indicated a tonsa amongst others had the lowest lc50 of 1 77 mg l lethal concentration i e the concentration of gly in air that will kill 50 of the test subjects making it the most sensible recent research by maraes et al moraes et al 2020 discovered that zebra fish exposed to gly and roundup transorb had up to three times higher levels of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily c abcc protein activity and gene expression than controls which indicates that a detoxifying system is being activated however the brain of zebrafish danio rerio when exposed to roundup transorb was found not to enhance the activity of abcc proteins or the expression of the genes abcc1 and abcc4 which were activated on exposure to pure gly other impacts of gly are further outlined in table 1 2 2 human health some notable properties of gly include quick soil sorption biodegradation and non acute toxicity to creatures other than its intended target however it has been noted that gly raises the risk of leaky gut syndrome cardiovascular issue digestive disruption hormonal and immunological dysfunctions autism and cancer meftaul et al 2020 for example the findings of von ehrenstein and colleagues von ehrenstein et al 2019 revealed that the prenatal exposure of pregnancy to gly increases the risk of autism disorder in offspring compared to pregnancy women who have not been previously exposed similarly in a review article published by peillex and others peillex and pelletier 2020 the research team came to the conclusion that gly has cytotoxic and genotoxic effects that are dosage dependent increases oxidative stress disrupts the estrogen system impairs various cerebral processes and is purportedly associated to the development of some human cancers recently spinaci and coworkers spinaci et al 2022 detailed the effects of roudup a gly based product on mammalian sperm in order to examine the effects of pure gly and its commercial formulation roudup the study measured the acrosome integrity motility mitochondrial activity viability and formation of reactive oxygen species in stallion spermatozoa after an hour of incubation at 37 c they found that gly had no adverse effects on the sperm quality markers at any of the observed concentrations however starting at 360 g ml its commercial formulation roudup substantially p 0 05 reduced progressive and total motility acrosome integrity vitality mitochondrial activity and the percentage of living spermatozoa with intact mitochondria not releasing reactive oxygen species gly equivalent dose the table below further summarized gly impact on human and aquatic health table 1 2 3 plants numerous studies have examined how gly affects plants bastos gonçalves et al 2020 eceiza et al 2022 jelonek et al 2020 according to research gly binds to and then inactivates an enzyme that is needed for the shikimate pathway preventing the production of vital amino acids heldt and piechulla 2011 the same metabolic cycle yields a variety of phenolic chemicals that are crucial for plant immunity gly makes crops more vulnerable to attack by soil borne diseases by interfering with the manufacture of such defensive chemicals in plant martinez et al 2018 therefore it may be claimed that regular crop exposure to gly may make plants more susceptible to diseases in many crops disease development has been connected to excessive gly spraying for example it was discovered that gly sprays were the primary cause of diseases like fusarium head blight in agronomic crops fernandez et al 2009 there are instances of greater gly burndown applications prior to planting being associated with greater pathogen colonization in wheat and barley roots fernandez et al 2009 martinez et al 2018 in addition the effects of sublethal gly concentrations on perennial plants might sometimes take a year to manifest and last for two or more years santos et al 2007 gly may potentially and or unintentionally increase the risk of infections in plants by decreasing their general growth and vigor modifying the soil microbiota which impacts the availability of nutrients needed for disease resistance and altering their physiological efficiency hammerschmidt 2018 hence it is crucial to develop various advanced techniques for screening and detecting this contaminant and metabolites in plants and other environmental compartments 3 detection of glyphosate 3 1 sensing techniques the sensing technique is a method that allows various types of sensors to detect and determine analytes from a sample campos et al 2010 the most utilized sensing techniques are those that employ the use of electrochemical sensors optical sensors and mechanical sensors of all these sensors the most explored and exploited for gly sensing and detection is electrochemical sensors 3 1 1 electrochemical sensors electrochemical sensors have been found and explored to be effective analytical sensors table 2 used in the laboratory and on site monitoring and analysis of gly detection systems in multiple matrices such as food environmental fluids water biological fluids agricultural products and soil samples zambrano intriago et al 2021 most electrochemical sensors developed and used for gly sensing are those developed from metal and modified electrodes biosensors and electronic tongues 3 1 1 1 metal and modified electrodes many metals and modified electrodes have been successfully developed for gly sensing with high sensitivity and selectivity modified electrodes have been found to show more stability sensitivity and insusceptibility to potential interferences that can result in a signal error zambrano intriago et al 2021 for instance nanomaterials have been significantly used as electrochemical sensors for gly sensing due to their large surface to volume ratio which translates to better conductivity characteristics they possess escarpa et al 2015 also modified electrodes such as glassy carbon electrodes gce have been widely explored for gly sensing aguirre et al 2019 a study has reported the use of pencil graphite electrodes pregnant with multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and copper oxide nanoparticle combined with ionic liquids to develop an electrochemical sensor with a higher surface area better mechanical stability and higher electrical conductivity which guarantee gly sensing gholivand et al 2018 due to the high selectivity of the sensor when metal ions are present zambrano intriago et al 2021 that allows for gly cu2 complexation gly and its structural analogs such as glufosinate ampa and tridemorph pesticide can be detected in soil and water samples further accuracy can be guaranteed by using chromatographic methods unlike nanoparticles organometallic compounds have been explored for use as electrochemical sensors for gly detection because of their structural properties that influence their synthesis and electrical properties research reported that in modifying electrodes for better use as an electrochemical sensor for gly sensing the use of an organometallic compound known as copper phthalocyanine cupc has been explored on the surface of modified gce the cupc modified with mwcnts and deposited on the gce surface was observed to have a strong adsorption capacity and high specific surface area that allows for rapid gly detection in this system gly is detected when it adsorbs to the metacenter in the cupc sensor thereby forming gly cu2 ion complex as result of the enhanced sensitivity and selectivity at ultra levels and the presence of highly concentrated metal ions in the cupc organometallic compound its use as a sensor for gly is a promising method of gly detection zambrano intriago et al 2021 a search for a more selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for gly sensing resulted in the exploration and application of conductive polymers cpol synthetic materials to develop the gly sensor a highly conductive polymerized modified electrode from the polymerization of pyrrole together with composite copper electrodes electrochemically deposited on activated carbon fiber was developed to voltammetrically detect gly shrivastava et al 2021 this was observed to be effective in gly sensing in soil and apple pulp samples cpol was observed to afford the within trapped copper metal more physical robustness that allows the detection and determination of gly based on gly interaction with the copper metal ion another widely explored cpol is the electropolymerized pyroll py which is a highly conductive electrochemical sensor for gly detection jain et al 2017 zhang and coworkers 2017 reported a study where gold modified electrodes with the molecularly imprinted polymer of poly pyrrole mippy were used to develop an electrochemical sensor for the indirect electropolymerization of gly with the mippy using cyclic voltammetry obtaining a detection limit of 0 67 μg l 1 zhang et al 2017 noori and coworkers also reported the first direct electrochemical sensing of gly in water without pretreatment where screen printed gold working electrodes were used to detect gly by amperometric measurements to a detection limit of 2 μm noori et al 2018 in a different study completely solid state gold nanoelectrode arrays were easily made and employed for pretreatment free direct measurement of gly at nanomolar levels thermal de wetting of a thin gold layer onto graphene paper produced the gold nanoelectrode array the capacity of the method is not influenced by interferents according to the interference investigation of aminomethyl phosphonic acid ampa in the determination of gly that was also reported scandurra et al 2022a b reduced graphene oxide rgo has been the material of choice in making electrochemical sensors for gly sensing due to its ease of fabrication and ability to be produced on the kilogram scale rowley neale et al 2018 rgo is obtained from the electrochemical thermal and chemical reduction of graphite oxide setznagl and cesarino reported a study where a highly conductive electrochemical sensor was developed from a rgo mixed with copper nanoparticles cunps and electrodeposited on a gce surface this sensor was reported to be highly effective in gly sensing due to the availability of cunps and formation of a number of complexes of cu2 gly the electrochemical sensor was used for gly detection systems in water samples that have not been pretreated setznagl and cesarino 2022 3 1 1 2 biosensors biosensors are a distinct group of chemical sensors that are developed to cope as an analytical interdisciplinary technique gründler 2017 for sensing gly in food lu and gunasekaran 2019 and monitoring of environmental interferents bagheri et al 2019 biosensors recognize analytes from samples through catalytic signals from biochemical reactions immunological reactions and catalysis inhibition reactions quite several biosensors are available however the use of a biosensor depends on the nature of the substrate matrices and recognition element there are cell biosensors organism based biosensors enzyme based biosensors and antibody biosensors of all these only enzymatic biosensors and antibody sensors have reported results for the detection of gly ajiboye et al 2022 escarpa et al 2015 however of these two biosensors the enzymatic biosensors or enzyme based biosensor is widely used to develop electrochemical sensors for gly sensing an enzymatic biosensor is selective for gly sensing and has indirect direct catalytic properties the working principle of the enzymatic biosensor is based on their optimal capacity for trapping adsorption micro encapsulation crosslinking and covalent bonding processes sassolas et al 2012 however the limitation to using enzyme based electrochemical sensors is that enzymes have a limited shelf life borgmann et al 2011 which may be disadvantageous for long testing periods urease peroxidase and tyrosine are used as enzymes in the development of biosensors for the electrochemical detection of gly peroxidases are the most extensively researched and utilized enzyme for gly detection heme containing glycoproteins are known as peroxidases po also known as hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductases as its primary substrate h2o2 po catalyzes the oxidation of both organic and inorganic substances kalsoom et al 2015 pos have been widely explored because of their wide ph range high activity temperature fast regeneration and ability to bind covalently with nanoparticles bilal and iqbal 2019 unlike other organic compounds gly remains uncatalyzed but rather serve as an excellent inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of po hence this attribute is explored for gly sensing po is amenable for the detection of gly due to similarity of wide ph range since the gly molecule has both positive and negative charges at ph 4 this ph makes it possible to detect gly because it interacts well with the amino acid residues of the biocatalyst initial studies have proposed how to determine gly at this ph with a setup consisting of the immobilization of horseradish peroxidase hrp on ge mwcnts electrodes using electrophoretic deposition cahuantzi muñoz et al 2019 a research group developed a biosensor of a gold electrode surface and it was found to give a good performance for gly sensing and other gly structural analogs aminomethyl phosphonic acid ampa sensing in water and corn samples an improvement to this biosensor system was reported in another study of hrp dhamu et al 2021 roman and his group proposed the development of another hrp based biosensor this biosensor was made of an n type monocrystalline electrode whose surface was electrodeposited with a polyaniline film pan and an immobilized hrp enzyme pan was used because of its efficiency in binding to biomolecules which causes the biocatalytic properties of enzymes to favor charge transfer between the enzyme and the gly containing substrate in this biosensor the mechanism of detection is due to gly s ability to block hrp s activity in the oxidation of hydroquinones hqs when h2o2 is present thereby resulting in a decrease in the electric current signals which signifies the incomplete action of the hrp roman et al 2020 atemoya peroxidase has been extracted from the extraction of atemoya and has also been observed and reported to be an efficient enzyme based biosensor and as an electrochemical sensor for gly detection the extracted po was then combined with a mixture of mwcnts graphite powder with mineral oil in a plastic syringe that was attached to an electrode made of copper wire the enzyme system was reported to show application for gly sensing in real samples such as agricultural formulations milk orange and juice square wave voltammetry swv was used to observe the detection performance as the gly is capable of having an inhibitory effect on the oxidation of hqs when h2o2 is present in the system this enzymatic biosensor showed stability for a long time of about 8 weeks giving a high linear range of response from 100 to 4500 μm of gly sensing oliveira et al 2018 the use of antibody biosensors for gly sensing has also been studied for gly sensing though scanty information about its use for gly sensing is available dithiobis succinimidyl propanoate dps has been tested as a crosslinker group for polyclonal antibodies mounted on a gold surface for use in gly sensing by the mechanism of interactions that occur between antibody and antigen containing gly as shown in fig 3 dhamu and prasad 2020 3 1 1 3 electronic tongues electronic tongues are simple tools that are used for detection and analysis of an aqueous sample martínez gil et al 2013 they are recommended because of their low cost and relatively fast technology electronic tongues are cylinders made up of stainless steel that contain non selective electrodes noble metals au pt rh ir and ag and non noble metals ni co and cu make up these non selective electrodes the electronic tongues consist of at least one noble metal and one non noble metal in their setup electronic tongues function as an electrochemical sensor for gly detection systems when enabled with voltametric transduction campos et al 2012 the detection of gly by electronic tongues is highly selective and reproducible it was reported that a voltametric electronic tongue vet was accurate in determining and detecting gly in the presence of potential interferents like humic acids and calcium ions this vet consisted of co cu and pt metallic electrodes contained in a cylinder made of methacrylate the vet produced a signal pattern when gly is detected in an aqueous sample and the electric signals were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry dpv bataller et al 2012 this vet is low cost fast and simple in design and operation in the study by martnez gil and coworkers 2013 dpv was also employed with the use of a vet that contain two electrodes noble metals ir rh pt and au make up the first electrode whereas ag cu co and ni non noble metals make up the second electrode the objective of this vet system was to create and validate a mathematical model to assess gly and to differentiate between the presence of typical contaminants in natural water bodies that may cause interferences such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers and humic compounds martínez gil et al 2013 despite that these studies presented electronic tongues as a reliable method of predicting and detecting gly in aqueous systems or natural water bodies the sensitivity of electronic tongues to determine gly at low concentration levels is still in doubt for instance electronic tongues were observed to be non sensitive except when evaluation of gly was done at high concentrations of gly 16 905 169 050 μm bataller et al 2012 and 8452 5 84 525 μm martínez gil et al 2013 this implies that the vet could not detect gly in samples with low concentrations of gly hence electronic tongue is not a sensitive technique per se the main challenge of using electronic tongues as electrochemical sensors for gly detection is choosing the right equipment and mathematical model based on qualitative and quantitative metabolite analysis zambrano intriago et al 2021 as intriguing as electrochemical sensors for gly sensing are and as successful as they have been in the previous decade their use remains unclear conflicts arise as to the reproducibility and reliability of the method without regulated complex environments in real time detection this conflict is however attributed to the variations that exist in the production of these sensors and the complex reactions that are formed between gly and other compounds present in the sensors although provided with proof of concepts of its operation it is still necessary to show that the manufacturing is cost effective sensitive and repeatable for field detections to provide final validation 3 2 colorimetric method colorimetric methods have been reported to be a selective and ultrasensitive technique for the detection of gly residue in aqueous solutions table 3 colorimetry is believed to be a much simpler and cost effective technique to employ in the detection of gly colorimetric methods for the detection of gly involve the transformation of gly into a colored compound that can easily be detected under a beam of light jane sharma and coworkers 2012 reported a study in which the gly amino group was transformed into a derivative of dithiocarbamate which resulted in a reaction of copper i perchlorate that caused the formation of a yellowish green colored complex under the rays of light at a maximum absorbance of 392 nm sharma et al 2012 a cysteamine modified gold nanoparticle was used in a colorimetric technique for the on site detection of gly in plant tissues guan et al 2020 tu et al 2019 it was briefly observed that stabilized gold nanoparticles with cysteamine without aggregation are effective in the detection of gly zheng et al 2013 the system changes color from red to blue or purple when gly is present which aggregates to the gold nanoparticles however limitations exist with this technique due to the long testing time complex synthetic procedures and high detection limits associated with its use because of these limitations to the colorimetric method the need to develop a new colorimetric detection system for the rapid onsite detection and analysis of gly is required guan et al 2021 the use of gold nanoparticles aunps as an anti aggregation mechanism is presented as a novel colorimetric method for gly detection due to electrostatic interactions a specific concentration of pb2 can trigger the aggregation of aunps and a change in the color of the solution from red to gray however the chelation between gly and pb2 in the presence of gly can seriously impede the aforementioned process the colorimetric detection system for gly displays outstanding sensitivity because of its anti aggregation mechanism zhou et al 2017 a novel chemosensor called r g chemosensor nrg developed by the functionalization of amidogen has been successfully employed for gly detection in an aqueous solution the r g chemosensor was created by adding a picolyl group to the amidogen of a rhodamine based probe to create a cu2 ion trap the colorimetric method made use of the cu2 indicator displacement strategy which enables the easy naked eye detection of gly this is due to the discovery that gly binds to cu2 more strongly than previously thought as a result there is a rapid displacement of gly for cu2 from the rhodamine probe changing its hue from colorless to yellowish green fig 4 even at a low detection limit of 4 1 nm the chemosensor was found to be successful in the selective detection of gly in ambient samples guan et al 2020 also the copper doped polyvinyl alcohol nanofiber cd pva has been observed to be an advantageous sensor in the colorimetric detection of gly and its structural analogs de almeida et al 2015 the pva was optically changed to a different color using dithiocarbamic acid it was noted that the optical color changer of the cd pva nanofiber switches from blue to yellow when gly is detected the cd pva sensor is not very sensitive for lengthy periods of detection time 20 days despite the approach having strong color change stability at a quick response time about 1 3 s another drawback is that the chemosensor is susceptible to ions and compounds present in environmental waters hence a pre treatment is always required a l valle et al 2019 however liu and his team created a colorimetric sensor strip that can identify other organophosphorus substances including chlorpyrifos dimethoate and dichlorvos in addition to gly liu et al 2015 fast analysis and simple readout were two excellent benefits of this colorimetric sensor strip by examining the colorimetric property of 2 mercapto 5 nitrobenzimidazole capped silver nanoparticles mnbz ag nps aggregated with mg2 ions another colorimetric sensor sensitive to gly detection has been particularly designed rawat et al 2016 when gly is found a yellowish tint changes to an orange red hue according to reports this is because the mnbz ag nps mg2 ion and gly interacted to produce an inter particle complex which reduced the distance between the particles in the nanoparticle s structure wan et al 2022 3 3 spectroscopic method the most reported spectroscopic techniques for the detection of gly are fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy these are discussed in details in this section 3 3 1 fluorescence spectroscopy fs or fluorometry fs is a simple less expensive and reliable spectroscopic method based on the principle of emission which does not involve tedious analysis employed for the on site detection of gly a l valle et al 2019 fs is a convenient and rapid method for detecting gly that involves using fluorescent nanomaterials or fluorescence sensors guan et al 2021 to date fs has become increasingly popular in the detection of gly because of its low cost and ease of preparation peng et al 2022a b the major challenge of fs in the detection of gly is that gly structures lack fluorophore or chromophore groups this is overcome by the use of intermediates in the detection for example tyrosinase hong et al 2020 and anti glyphosate antibodies guan et al 2020 are utilized as intermediaries for gly fluorescence detection intermediates such as coumarin cu2 derivatives have also been reported to be used as gly fluorescence sensors and have been investigated to show promising detection of gly in crops with a response time of more than 5 min wang et al 2020b however the limitation observed in the cu2 based gly detection method is that the sensor shows poor stability which makes it susceptible to the complex environment wan et al 2022 moreover recent studies have corrected this deviation of fluorescence sensors to environmental influences by incorporating high stability fluorescent sources and materials into the sensor to detect gly for instance it has been claimed that gly may be detected using fluorescence magnetic nanoparticles fmps linked with particular dna probes fs fmps dna based on the competitive interaction between fmps and conjugated gly this method was an improvement to the previous study by the group where free gly was detected using gold conjugated nanoparticles coupled with dna lee et al 2013 the fluorescence intensity quantification of gly is then done using uv photometric analysis and laser scanning microscopy unfortunately other possible interactions between gly analogs and other environmental interferences that might occur are not adequately explored and accounted for which poses a challenge to the method also metal organic frameworks mofs fluorescence property has been investigated for the detection of gly mofs allows for the incorporation of small reference molecules into their unique cavities spaces making them a reliable ratio fluorescence sensor material w m liao et al 2018 for instance a study found reduced sensitivity to environmental interferences in the detection of gly with an iron based metal organic framework nh2 mil 88 fe ratio fluorescence sensor the sensor framework allows the embedding of small molecule rhb to correct deviations from the equipment and environment interferences cu2 has also been added as an intermediate to the ratio fluorescence sensor framework for a linear range enlargement the resultant nh2 mil 88 fe rhb cu2 ratio fluorescence sensor was observed to show fast gly detection with high stability fig 5 it was reported that the presence of gly directly influenced the fluorescence signals as the fluorescence signal is turned on when gly chelates with cu2 via hydrogen bonding during nh2 mil 88 fe rhb cu2 interaction with gly the ratio fluorescence sensor demonstrated satisfactory accuracy with sensitivity for the on site gly detection in agricultural formulations such as soybean cucumber wheat and tea wan et al 2022 another fluorescence sensor made up of carbonaceous fluorescent nanomaterials known as carbon quantum dots cqds has also been employed in the detection of gly cqds are small sized quantum dots with a large surface area and unique photoluminescence properties cqds are popular because of their environmental friendliness and low cytotoxicity miao et al 2017 cqds act as donor fluorophores to the gly structures which solve the problem of the lack of fluorophores in gly structures an immunosensor developed with cqds labeled antibodies has been specifically used to recognize the distribution of gly in plant tissues the principle is based on the existence of a linear association between the cqds fluorescence intensity and their logarithmic gly concentration the major challenge of using cqd fluorescence sensors is that excess cqds may be present in the system however by adding magnetic nanoparticles like fe3o4 to the system the challenge is eliminated wang et al 2016 also a sulfate loaded iron and nitrogen co doped cqds so4 2 cqds have been investigated to visualize the distribution concentration and metabolism of gly in the stem leaves roots and cultivated soil of crops so4 2 cqds possess a unique acidic ph response which allows the generation of ethanoic acid ch3cooh and thiocholine from the hydrolysis of acetylcholine ach by acetylcholinesterase ache the presence of gly is detected by the production of ch3cooh which decreased the ph of the system thereby turning on the gly response to fluorescence peng et al 2022a b 3 3 2 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy method nmr nmr spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that explores the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to give detailed information on the molecular structure of the atomic nuclei however very few studies are available for the study of the nmr spectroscopy method for gly detection a study has reported that 31p and 1h nmr have been explored to detect the presence of gly in biological fluids samples such as urine plasma blood and liver valle et al 2019 however the major limitation of using the method of nmr spectroscopy is that several signals can overlap in the quantification analysis of the samples being that the administered samples are therapeutic agents a l valle et al 2019 3 4 chromatographic methods the quantitation of herbicide residues in fruits vegetables often comprise of flow steps such as extraction the interferents removal herbicide residue determination and identity confirmation using different techniques tadeo et al 1996 initially spectrophotometric and or colorimetric methods have been employed in the determination of herbicides however the previously mentioned methods do not optimally produce results with desired sensitivity when compared with chromatographic methods the distinction between the hydrolysis products of herbicides from the parent compounds cannot also be handled by mere colorimetric and spectrophotometric techniques tadeo et al 2000 in sample analysis the choice or amenability of high performance liquid chromatography hplc is determined by the physico chemical properties of the analytes such as hydrogen bonding hydroxyl functionalities and thermal decomposability the primary degradation product or metabolite of gly ampa has been detected in surface and groundwater samples in regions like south america castro berman et al 2018 ronco et al 2016 efsa 2015 united states ramirez et al 2014a australia okada et al 2020 and europe di guardo and finizio 2018 therefore both ampa and gly are analyzed or determined in food and water samples yusà et al 2021 a better sensitivity is usually recorded when hplc is coupled with specific detectors like nitrogen phosphorous detector npd electron capture detector ecd and mass spectrometric detector ms unlike poor selectivity particularly with uv detection sequel to the inherent toxicity associated with gly gly residues in food products it is germane that food items suspected to contain gly be analyzed using sophisticated techniques and following sequential approaches 3 4 1 glyphosate extraction and clean up the extraction of gly from foods and water samples is a function of herbicide physico chemical characteristics and the matrices of the sample characteristically gly consists of three major ionizable acidic and amino functionalities groups pka4 pka1 10 98 5 95 2 29 0 78 zhu et al 1999 ampa on the other hand has acidic sites and an alkaline functionality pkas 5 6 10 2 and 0 9 guo et al 2016 in other words gly an ampa are amphoteric existing as zwitterion at ph less than 10 owing to amino nitrogen protonation yusà et al 2021 these aforementioned properties determine the procedures and reagents required for effective gly and ampa extraction and clean up in food samples extraction generally consists of sample homogenization with a suitable organic solvent and ph adjusted water or water by using sonicator or blender most commonly ethyl acetate acetonitrile and methanol are used for herbicides extraction from food items in the recent times supercritical fluid extraction sfe was employed for the herbicide residue extraction dean et al 1996 tadeo et al 1996 there are other applicable extraction methods such as soxhlet extraction classical method quechers microextraction nasiri et al 2020 microextraction can be categorized into stir bar sorptive extraction sbse solid phase microextraction spme and liquid phase microextraction lpme sbse makes use of magnetic stir bar instead of solvent as the extractant to achieve enhanced extraction efficiency spme on the other hand uses ad sorbent and capillary column to extract herbicides from samples though spme is also a solventless extraction technique it suffers limitation of short lifetime and fragility of the sorbent fibres kadivar and aliakbar 2019 lpme technique is a miniaturized form of liquid liquid extraction lle involving analyte transfer into microlitre volume of organic solvent liang et al 2022 however the technique is limited in terms of solvent selection and poor reproducibility farajzadeh et al 2018 when spme and sbse are compared sbse is more efficient in the extraction of targeted analytes with improved reproducibility however the demerits may have to do with the difficulty in removing the magnetic stir bar for rinsing after it has been used wang et al 2020a of all quechers is widely used for multiple residue or multiclass herbicide residues in vegetables fruits or water although it is characterized with easy and fast analytical steps the batch samples speed of pre treatment is affected by low centrifugation speed and enrichment factors samsidar et al 2018 3 4 2 liquid chromatographic analysis liquid chromatographic technique is efficient and fast for quantitation of organic contaminants in food items that are apparently difficult to identify due to non volatility thermal lability and non amenability to gas chromatographic gc analysis tandem lc ms ms has made it feasible for quantifying herbicide or pesticide residue in vegetables grains and fruits liang et al 2022 for gly analysis different hplc techniques have been developed these include liquid chromatography fluorescence detector lc fld hogendoorn et al 1999 ultra high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry uplc ms ms guo et al 2018 tittlemier et al 2017 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms granby et al 2003 y liao et al 2018 santilio et al 2019 liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry lc esi ms kruve et al 2011 and so on previous studies have reported the limit of detection lod for gly by hplc techniques to be 0 3 μg kg when coupled with mass spectrometric technique zoller et al 2018 in spite of this low detection limit studies are still being conducted for the development of highly sensitive accurate and precise liquid chromatographic method s for detection of gly at parts per trillion ppt level although there is an enhancement in lod for gly quantification by hplc tandem mass spectrometer santilio et al 2019 zoller et al 2018 table 4 shows the various liquid chromatographic methods of detection of gly and ampa with their limits of quantification loq 3 4 3 gas chromatographic gc analysis the usage of gc in organic sample analysis is dated back to 1950s but now widely applied in various fields involving chemical analysis including water and soil treatment and others an inert carrier gas ar n2 h or he is used to push a gasified sample through gas chromatographic column whereby separation takes place and the different composition of sample material is determined gc technique is amenable for the determination of samples that are non polar easily gasified and volatile at injector temperature without decomposition liang et al 2022 it is therefore extensively applied in herbicide residue analysis as a result of its high sensitivity and selectivity linked to the detectors that can be hyphenated interfaced with this method tadeo et al 2000 packed columns are often of choice in herbicide residues quantitation in food for several years for instance fluoro propylsilicones qf 1 methyl phenyl silicones ov 17 and methyl silicones se 30 ov 1 and dc 200 are some of the columns employed as stationary phases for herbicide residue analysis recently open tubular cross linked fused silica column of characteristic low polarity like hp 1 hp 5 db 1 and db 5 are applied the replacement of packed columns by fused silica capillary columns are ascribed to enhanced selectivity sensitivity and high resolution characteristic of the capillary columns tadeo et al 2000 kataoka et al developed a sensitive selective and fast gas chromatographic method for synchronized quantitation of gly ampa and glufosinate gluf in food and environmental samples kataoka et al 1996a the samples were derivatized using isopropyl chloroformate isopcf the recoveries obtained for gly ampa and gluf introduced into different food and environmental samples were 91 106 the loq of gluf gly and ampa were 2 0 1 2 and 0 8 ng ml for gly ampa and gluf respectively while that of carrot and soil were 20 12 and 8 ng g kataoka et al 1996a zhang and others developed a reliable and sensitive technique for ampa and gly detection in different environmental systems like soil and water zhang et al 2019b it was reported that the linearities of ampa and gly 10 1000 ng ml were r2 0 9991 and r2 0 9998 respectively in addition loq of 0 81 and 0 37 ng ml were recorded for ampa and gly respectively validating the applicability of the method developed in ampa and gly detection in different environmental media inherently gc amenability in ampa and gly quantitation have some limitations such as non suitability for polar compounds non suitability for thermally unstable compounds and the requirement for derivatization masiá et al 2016 table 5 shows the various gas chromatographic methods for detection of gly and ampa with their limits of quantification loq 4 treatment strategies for degradation and removal of glyphosate in environmental samples due to the broad overuse and accumulation of gly in the ecosystem adverse impacts on plant animals and health outcomes have been recorded including weakened plant systems alteration of terrestrial and marine animal metabolism and alteration of the human body systems van bruggen et al 2018 this compound may damage the aquatic system via factory effluents or textile chemicals baylis 2000 environmental concerns over gly have prompted the development of eco friendly ways to breakdown it for rehabilitation and restoration of gly contaminated areas three major products of gly metabolism ampa acetyl glyphosate and sarcosine are further degraded through separate biochemical activities moreover gly mostly breaks down into ampa because it cannot be broken down inside of cells it causes secondary environmental contamination gly has been shown in many studies to increase microorganism metabolism singh et al 2020 numerous conventional and novel strategies have been investigated for the breakdown of gly in fact large scale gly degradation has been achieved by the use of chemical and biological methods in addition to improved oxidation mechanisms espinoza montero et al 2020 rossi et al 2021 the relevant concepts methods and alternatives for the degradation of gly are discussed in this section below 4 1 degradation kinetics and thermodynamics for a more thorough comprehension of the processes at play during degradation and removal of gly several factors and variables are considered crucial these include a number of equations governing the process modeling removal parameters and isotherm and thermodynamic analysis several thermodynamics models for describing the processes that occur during glys removal or degradation have been reported the common ones used to describe the equilibrium of adsorption are the langmuir and freundlich isotherms pereira et al 2021 according to the langmuir isotherm adsorption of gly is taking place mostly in monolayers and this finding shows that the active sites on the adsorbent have energy levels that are equal to one another samuel et al 2017 dissanayake herath et al 2019 the freundlich isotherm predicts that an adsorbent system s energy loss would decrease in a manner that is proportional to the logarithm of the number of molecules that have been absorbed by the system mayakaduwa et al 2015 nourouzi et al 2012 the langmuir s model isotherm is described by the equation jiang et al 2018 1 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e the freundlich s model isotherm is described thus dissanayake herath et al 2019 2 q e k f c e 1 n where q e stands for equilibrium adsorption capacity in mg g q m represents the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g k l is the langmuir coefficient k f mgn 2 ln is the freundlich coefficient 1 n represents adsorption intensity and c e represents the equilibrium concentration mg l to provide further insight into the viability of the processes during adsorption and degradation of gly several kinetic models showing the rate of adsorption have been reported including the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso kinetic models and other comprehensive models such as the elovich s model pereira et al 2021 according to the pfo model only one parameter impacts the adsorption rate in the pso model the rate of adsorption is determined by two parameters in the model jiang et al 2018 elovich s model suggests that the adsorption sites each have their own unique energy which means that neither the interaction nor the desorption among entities really have much effect on the rate of the adsorption procedure however very little research has been done on the application of the elovich s model to gly adsorption since it is often employed in the setting of heterogeneous surface systems khenifi et al 2010 the equations governing the various kinetic models are represented in table 6 q 1 and q 2 are the adsorption capacity k 1 represent the pso constant and k 2 represents the pso constants a is the starting speed b is the desorption constant and t represents time 4 2 treatment and degradation alternatives 4 2 1 adsorption adsorption is a surface phenomenon in which particles become attracted to the top layer of a material layer in most cases it involves the molecules atoms or even ions of a dissolved state of a liquid solid or gas that are connected to the surface this concept has been employed in industrial biochemical and purification processes including wastewater treatment and other bioremediation activities because of its low cost lack of toxicity and great efficiency feng et al 2020a b numerous studies on adsorption as a method for removing gly from the environment have been conducted for decades they have explored the potential of different materials as adsorbent medium including biochar bc adsorption membranes resins clay compounds activated carbon etc to extract gly from the environment agboola et al 2022 p hadi et al 2015 d m jia et al 2017 mayakaduwa et al 2016 fig 6 provides a visual illustration of the various adsorption mechanisms that have been used for gly removal this includes molecular interactions among the entities in the system or diffusion via various sizes and volumes of pores furthermore electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent system and gly molecules or the formation of complexes including iron based complexes that enable gly removal from the aqueous system are viable methods for adsorptive remediation of gly from the aqueous system a typical example involves the utilization of zr based metal organic framework zr mofs for the adsorption of gly from aqueous solution zr mofs are known to adsorb and hydrolyze herbicides and chemical warfare agents such as vx moon et al 2015 denchy et al 2021 mendonca et al 2020 in the study by tao and coworkers they employed defects in mofs to selectively adsorbed gly from an aqueous solution in the presence of different pollutants like sulfamethoxazole sulpanilamide acephate methyl parathion and sulfamethazine tao et al 2022 hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions and phosphate zr bonding contributed to the adsorption of gly on this mofs it was determined that adsorption of gly to these mofs is spontaneous and proceed via chemical mechanism as shown in fig 7 tao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the huio 66s had the highest adsorption capacity in a multivariate system at the reporting time the adsorption performance of these mofs was not affected by competing ions and humic acids in another study zr mofs nu 1000 and uio 67 act as lewis acids with an affinity for the phosphate groups of the gly pankajakshan et al 2018 pankajakshan et al posited that the reduction in sizes increases the efficiency of adsorption the adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo second order model with solvent water in excess theoretical studies also showed strong binding between the zr phosphate with uio 67 and nu 1000 having 17 37 kj mol 1 and 37 63 kj mol 1 respectively biochar and activated carbon two typical adsorbents with a porous structure and high removal effectiveness has been found useful for different environmental applications agboola et al 2022 including the removal of gly for example the efficacy of waste newspaper activated carbon wnac in removing gly from water was investigated by nourouzi et al 2012 the adsorption of gly by wnac was modeled using the langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson adsorption isotherms the adsorption process was best suited by the langmuir adsorption isotherm model wnac is reported to have an optimal performance at ph of 2 5 in which it adsorbed 48 4 mg g gly in another similar study herath wickramasinghe 2015 examined the ability of a steam activated biochar produced from rice husk to extract gly from aqueous system biochar was made by slowly pyrolyzing risk husk at 700 c with steam activation batch adsorption and isotherm studies were used to investigate ph reaction time and gly dosage pfo pso and elovich model were used to evaluate adsorption kinetics also langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were utilized to compute biochar equilibrium sorption values the highest gly sorption was recorded at ph 4 and declined with increasing ph freundlich model best suited equilibrium isotherm data suggesting physisorption on heterogeneous and amorphous biochar surfaces furthermore mayakaduwa et al 2015 removed aqueous gly using bioenergy waste woody biochar the adsorption experiments yielded equilibrium isotherms and kinetics gly adsorption was ph dependent peaking at 5 6 at this ph the protonated amino moiety of gly may interact with biochar through electron donor acceptor interactions freundlich and temkin models best fit isotherm data showing gly multilayer sorption isotherm modeling indicated that biochar may adsorb 44 mg g of gly after 1 h equilibrium was attained with the adsorption chemical adsorption in which the sorbate and adsorbent either share electrons or the sorbate transfers electrons to the adsorbent controls the limits of the reaction rate better adsorption performance can be obtained by the surface modification or functionalization of the biochars used during the adsorption process for instance d jia et al 2020 reported the highest adsorption performance of any reported adsorbent for gly removal in the literature nano cufe2o4 modified biochar was used to remove aqueous gly hydrolysis at 500 c and coprecipitation created cufe2o4 biochar adsorbent freundlich and langmuir illustrate physisorption and chemisorption from equilibrium isotherm data the pso kinetic model explains adsorption kinetics indicating chemical adsorption may dominate cufe2o4 biochar adsorbs 269 4 mg g of gly in 4 h at ph 4 and ambient temperature also resin s porous structure and surface chemistry favor gly adsorption in aqueous systems in demonstrating the potential of resin for gly removal d m jia et al 2017 produced a composite resin by crosslinking polystyrene with nano sized iron oxides a pso model was shown to be the best fit for the adsorption kinetics of gly and it was demonstrated that low ph values are favorable for adsorption in addition gly was effectively removed from the resin composites by naoh solution indicating its desorptive property to allow for repeated use of the adsorbent in a similar investigation chen et al 2013 investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of gly removal using resin d301 the adsorption capability of resin d301 was high with a maximum capacity of 833 3 mgg 1 at 318 15 k the langmuir model showed that the adsorption of gly onto resin d301 is a monolayer adsorption also the experimental parameters showed that the sorption mechanism is exothermic and dominated by an intricate mechanism which is neither purely physical nor purely chemical gly adsorption on resin d301 is also consistent with the pso kinetic model with an apparent activation energy of 83 11 kj mol 1 the effectiveness of fe3 preloaded d151 resin in eliminating gly from aqueous system was investigated xiao and meng 2020 as a result of the research iron loaded resin has become the first gly adsorbent shown to be salt resistant gly adsorption was best at a ph of 3 35 resin adsorption was shown to be facilitated by a process involving ligand exchange between gly and water the highest adsorption capacity of gly achieved by the iron loaded resin was 481 85 mg g in the presence of 16 nacl which is much higher than the adsorption capabilities of any previously reported adsorbents irrespective of the efficacy and relevance of the adsorbents in removing gly from the aqueous environment there are still several challenges and limitations which should be addressed first it has been reported in the literature that the adsorbents require an acidic condition for the maximum removal of gly from the aqueous environment pereira et al 2021 this can impact the ph of water during treatment and the release to the environment might be detrimental to mankind also the disposal of the residue from the adsorption process is still a major challenge moreover there are no specific adsorbents which solely select gly from the aqueous environment the presence of other ions or entities with gly at high concentration can lower the efficacy of adsorbents as there is likelihood of competition among the ions and adsorbent feng et al 2020a b therefore adsorption cannot be selected as the major means for the removal of gly it could serve as a secondary means after the concentration of the competing ions and pollutants have reduced the development of novel and high performing polymeric adsorbents with low cost and highly porous structure with great compatibility with gly could pave the way for the widespread use of adsorption for the removal of gly 4 2 2 biological methods 4 2 2 1 bacterial degradation of glyphosates biological degradation of organic molecules is widely recognized as an effective and environmentally benign way for detoxifying water of organic contaminants to put it simply the metabolism of microorganisms in the biodegradation process causes the breakdown of gly into smaller molecules these processes include enzyme reactions which often produce harmless chemicals feng et al 2020a b these breakdown proceedings can be achieved using bacteria fungi actinomycete and algae there have been several reports of bacterial actinomycete and fungal degradation of gly however bacteria are by far the most commonly studied microorganism this is because many bacteria have the carbon phosphorus c p hydrolytic enzymes required for gly bioremediation hove jensen et al 2014 due to the fact that gly may be degraded by many different types of bacteria biodegradation of this herbicide is theoretically possible bacteria may then utilize the byproducts of this breakdown to get the essential nutrients for their own development and survival carbon nitrogen and phosphorus singh et al 2020 to fully take use of bacteria s potential for gly degradation researchers must first identify the numerous microbial degradation routes of gly in order to maximize the process and enhance environmental cleanup according to the model presented in fig 8 zhan et al 2018 gly degrading bacteria utilize two primary degradation routes which include c p lyase catalysis gly oxidoreductase and a third and minor route acetylation which generate respective intermediate products such as sarcosine ampa and acetylglyphosate in the one of the pathways c p lyase catalyzes the direct breaking of the c p link resulting in the metabolization of gly to sarcosine and phosphate firdous et al 2020 phosphate is further broken down by other designated microbes furthermore the enzyme sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine into glycine and formaldehyde after it has been consumed by microorganisms as a growth nutrients feng et al 2020a b according to borggaard gimsing 2008 microorganisms continue the breakdown of glycine while formaldehyde passes through a controlled route of carbon transfers that results in the production of co2 and nh4 afterwards the finished products are benign to the surrounding ecosystem this whole process of conversion of gly to sarcosine is highly dependent on the supply of phosphorus in another pathway the enzyme glyphosate oxidoreductase gox decomposing glyphosate into two metabolites through c n cleavage hove jensen et al 2014 glyoxylate which is oxidized in its entirety in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to create carbon dioxide and ampa which is digested by c p lyase into methylamine as well as phosphate the latter metabolite is used in the tetrahydrofolate thfa cycle where it is decomposed into formaldehyde and ammonia ampa is transformed to phosphonoformaldehyde and subsequently phosphonatase converts it to formaldehyde and phosphate which are then injected into the thfa pathway a v sviridov et al 2014 most research has shown that gly can be broken down into phosphorus through the two pathways mentioned above few studies however have shown the use of gly as a carbon or nitrogen resource a obojska et al 1999 pipket and amrheint 1988 also ampa has a slower rate of biodegradation when compared to sarcosine therefore future research should concentrate on improving the ability of microbes to degrade ampa and or finding novel microbes that are capable of concurrently and efficiently degrading gly and ampa another pathway for gly breakdown was discovered in achromobacter sp kg16 this process employed gly as a major source of phosphorus through acetylation phenomenon to synthesize acetylglyphosate a v sviridov et al 2014 there is still a lack of understanding regarding the biological function of this route in addition achromobacter sp kg16 is unable to use acetylglyphosate as an adequate source of phosphorus which contributes to the organism s substandard rate of development feng et al 2020a b the utilization of diverse bacteria for the microbial breakdown of gly has been documented by a number of studies for instance ochrobactrum intermedium sq20 achromobacter sp pseudomonas sp and comamonas odontotermitis p2 have all been used in a variety of conditions to study the breakdown of gly and its metabolites in contaminated niches via enrichment approach ermakova et al 2017 firdous et al 2018 2020 manogaran et al 2017 also gly may be used as a food source by some bacteria including pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp alcaligenes sp and geobacillus caldoxylosilyticus lerbs et al 1990 obojska et al 2002 moore et al 1983 pipke and amrhein 1988 more examples of bacteria utilized for gly breakdown are reported in table 7 furthermore the bacteria and their respective pathways for gly breakdown have been investigated and reported in the literature for example pseudomonas sp pg2982 uses c p lyase to decompose gly producing sarcosine that is then reduced by enzymes to formaldehyde and glycine kishore and jacob 1987 in the same line protein synthesis in arthrobacter sp glp 1 was facilitated by glycine which promoted the synthesis of serine and threonine as well as the peptide backbone isotope labeling has been used to provide a significant assessment of the fate of gly metabolites pipke and amrhein 1988 molecular and biochemical studies using escherichia coli have shown that the concentration of inorganic phosphorus influences the c p lyase and ultimately the whole metabolism of gly in the presence of the bacteria hove jensen et al 2010 santos beneit 2015 ochrobactrum anthropi gpk 3 pseudomonas sp lbr and bacillus cereus cb4 are bacterial isolates that may break down gly into ampa very effectively according to a few studies alexey v sviridov et al 2012 fan et al 2012 jacob et al 1988 also sequence analysis of genes for c p lyase and gly oxidoreductase in comamonas odontotermitis p2 further confirmed that these two processes operated in parallel inside the organism duke 2011 in order to evaluate the efficacy of microbes in degrading gly it is required to optimize the culture parameters these factors include the temperature of the culture the starting ph the concentration of the gly the inoculation biomass and the incubation the typical culture media are at temperature range of 25 and 37 c a ph between 6 and 7 5 and an aerobic medium depending on the kind of microbe being cultivated feng et al 2020a b zhan et al 2018 in spite of the potential shown by bacteria for the degradation of gly and other remediation activities there is still room for development so far pure cultures have been used to grow the bacteria and test the degradation of gly the use of mixed culture could be explored to improve the efficiency of the bacteria for gly removal also most studies have been done on a laboratory scale there is encouraging evidence that biological treatment can be utilized to effectively remediate wastewater and the ecosystem containing gly the data necessary to implement this method on a large scale is presently scarce determining the precise paths of gly biodegradation will need more research into the structures of the metabolites and biochemical changes in gly biodegradation as well as procedures for specialty chemicals or isolation of these metabolites and enzymes feng et al 2020a b furthermore studying the kinetics of microbial degradation is significant since it might provide valuable information for the development of processes finally biological treatment in conjunction with some other treatment methods is necessary for efficient degradation of not just gly but also its metabolites 4 2 2 2 fungal degradation of glyphosates the potential of various fungi for the degradation of gly and the provision of a source of carbon nitrogen or phosphorus have been explored in the literature with the major fungal genera reported including aspergillus fusarium penicillium and trichoderma castrejón godínez et al 2021 fu et al 2017 reported the degradation of gly using aspergillus oryzae a f02 interestingly glycine and sarcosine were not present in the fermentation liquid of a oryzae a f02 although ampa was present the breakdown process showed that gly led to the formation of ampa and that ampa ultimately led to the formation of methylamine in the end new substances were created through further methylamine degradation it was determined that the pace at which gly is degraded by a oryzae a f02 is largely dependent on the extent to which gly is degraded to ampa in another study carranza et al 2019 evaluate two non toxigenic aspergillus oryzae strains in vitro gly degradation a oryzae am1 and am2 absorbed phosphate and nitrogen from gly with 1 and1 5 mm gly degradation percentages were over 50 after 15 days furthermore am1 removed 57 of 10 mm gly also a oryzae am1 s gly tolerance permanence and competitiveness with native mycota were investigated a oryzae count remained stable during incubation and was unaffected by gly concentrations this strain was able to remove gly in vitro and in gly contaminated soil microcosms swe et al 2020 investigated the capability of fungi recovered from gly contaminated soil 10 different fungus strain were tested for tolerance level and laccase activity results showed that trichoderma harzianum and aspergillus aiger showed laccase activity and rapidly removed gly from mineral salt liquid media and in water under laboratory test kulikova et al 2020 assessed the impact of gly decomposition using fungi after 14 days only 5 7 of the introduced herbicide was detected when gly was applied at the approved levels 5 10 mg kg the data show that gly was mostly broken down by c p bond breaking and the formation of phosphates and they also imply that the nitrogen fixation process may have been inhibited njoku et al 2020 reported the gly degradation capabilities of selected fungi species in the contaminated soil because of the occurrence of ampa the investigation verified that the gly degradation mechanism was through glyphosate oxidoreductase gox with the exception of aspergillus fumigatus fjat 31052 the studies on the potential of fungi for gly removal are further reported in table 7 based on the studies the gly degradation potential of the various fungal genera is ranked thus fusarium penicillium trichoderma aspergillus even with the research reported so far the use of fungi as gly degraders is still in the preliminary phase hence there is still room for improvement in the understanding of the respective metabolic processes involved in gly degradation and extend the application of other fungal strains the use of transcriptomic approaches is touted as a viable method to consider njoku et al 2020 4 2 2 3 algae degradation of glyphosates the algal potential for glyphosate removal is still in the preliminary stage based on the literature search the only algae species capable of degrading gly is oscillatoria limnetica salman and abdul adel 2015 investigated the use of oscillatoria limnetica in bioremediation of gly under laboratory conditions variation in the gly breakdown efficiency of this species was recorded as it was exposed to varying amounts 5 20 mg l of gly ranging from 38 to 85 due to the paucity of research on algae s potential for gly breakdown there is still opportunity for growth and advancement of research based on these assessments this is corroborated by the favorable characteristics of algae which include 1 selectivity to pollutants 2 algae s fast cell cycle 3 perceived cost effectiveness 4 intense exposure in a short period few hours 5 the reaction of toxicants can be evaluated quickly and 6 feasibility of predicting the features of succeeding generations castrejón godínez et al 2021 in all to address the environmental problems impacted by the use of gly there need to develop novel study such as algae species with a high capability for gly breakdown which can aid in restoring a healthy ecosystem 4 2 3 advanced oxidation processes for glyphosates treatment advanced oxidation processes aops are a potential way for removing gly from aqueous environment they operate at or around atmospheric conditions to produce sufficiently powerful oxidizing agents causing breakdown of organic and inorganic compounds which might be inimical to the ecosystem espinoza montero et al 2020 the hydroxyl radical is particularly important in aops because of its relatively high standard potential in acidic conditions this radical is capable of oxidizing and breaking down organic materials until it is completely converted into carbon dioxide water and the related inorganic salt wang and xu 2011 for instance the hydroxyl radical breaks down gly resulting in the formation of either intermediates like ampa and sarcosine or final breakdown products like co2 no3 nh4 po4 3 etc reaction 3 these processes compile a wide variety of methods that rely on the generation of strong oxidants to break down and eliminate gly from aqueous media including photodegradation the fenton procedures oxidative degradation with uv light and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photoelectrocatalytic methods andreozzi et al 1999 wang and xu 2011 the potential routes of gly oxidation under various aops are summarized in fig 9 3 c3h8no5p oh co2 h2o no3 nh4 po4 3 prominent methods of gly removal based on aop are discussed and compared extensively in the subsections below 4 2 3 1 photolysis assisted methods a common method of gly removal from water is the ultraviolet based uv based treatment in which photolysis of water produces hydroxyl radicals which attack the gly molecules present in the water system a similar method to this includes the use of catalyst to facilitate the process of gly removal namely photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysts like titanium dioxide tio2 are frequently employed to get rid of gly because they are stable harmless to living species and are not too expensive feng et al 2020a b combining hydrogen peroxide with uv light manassero et al 2010 lowered the gly levels in water it was reported that the gly conversion accelerated at ph 3 7 furthermore a degradation route was proposed in which oxidant species can cleave the c p link to generate phosphate and subsequently glycine with the final products being formic acid ammonium nitrate formaldehyde and phosphate ions without ampa and sarcosine as intermediate products assalin et al 2010 confirmed the presence of a tio2 photocatalysis efficiently removed gly and its breakdown mediators 92 of total organic carbon was removed from an acid gly solution ph 10 after being treated for 30 min at an initial concentration of 0 25 mmoll 1 and of 6 0 g l 1 of tio2 s chen liu 2007 were able to degrade 92 of gly after 3 5 h of irradiation 4 2 3 2 electrochemical oxidation methods electrochemical oxidation provides enough anodic energy that causes organic materials to be degraded to complete mineralization or even less complicated biodegradable compounds this process can either occur in two scenarios including direct or indirect anodic oxidation processes for the treatment of organic contaminants the direct anodic oxidation process is a relatively inefficient way to decontaminate pollutants while indirect anodic oxidation process brings about partial or full detoxification espinoza montero et al 2020 when compared to other aops electrochemical oxidation is a relatively clean technology for degrading gly effectively it has remarkable energy efficiency without the use of harmful chemicals very few studies have explored the potential of electrochemical oxidation in degrading gly lan et al 2013 reported the electrochemically aided mno2 oxidation electro mno2 ability to remove gly using ruo2 tio2 coated titanium mesh significantly improved gly elimination also the vast majority of free mn2 ions were transformed to mno2 which further improved gly removal during the electro mno2 procedure gly removal was unaffected by the solution s ph glycine sarcosine and phosphate were among the first important reactive products discovered in the routes leading to gly breakdown finally nitrogen contained species were oxidized to no3 n acetic acid and nh3 n whereas glycolic acid and oxamic acid were formed from glycine in another investigation neto de andrade 2009 examined the electrochemical oxidation of the gly on iro2 and ruo2 electrodes it was found that low ph levels encourage gly oxidation also gly was completely removed from the electrolyzed solution and a nearly complete mineralization phosphate ion release 91 of the studied oxide materials while this method has many potential advantages it also has several problems including the expensive cost of electrodes corrosion the likelihood of poor effluent conductivity electrode fouling and the creation of compounds that affect water ecosystems or human health espinoza montero et al 2020 4 2 3 3 fenton methods the fenton method has been studied as a potential method for purifying water and sewage the iron fe2 ion functions as a catalyst in this process converting the hydroxyl oh radicals in hydrogen peroxide deng and zhao 2015 a few hybrid systems depending on the photo fenton system and the electro fenton system have already been created to increase the degrading efficiency of the process to increase the production of oh from the photodegradation of h2o2 and the uv induced conversion of fe3 to fe2 the photo fenton reaction incorporates ultraviolet uv or visible light irradiation into the traditional fenton system in a similar line electro fenton technology allows for the electrochemical generation of h2o2 fe2 or both wang and xu 2011 numerous reports have shown the efficacy of this strategy for gly breakdown and elimination for instance under laboratory condition de souza et al 2013 evaluated the efficacy of the photo fenton method in degrading gly in water and wastewater treatment using h2o2 oxalate and equimolar concentration of fe2 and fe3 after 60 min of the photo fenton process the concentration of gly had dropped to below detection with the ultimate breakdown product being 0 385 mmoll 1 phosphate ion also it was found that a reduction in gly content reduced effluent toxicity by 54 to remove gly from wastewater activated carbon fiber cathode was designed and used in an electro fenton ef reactor lan et al 2016 results showed that all traces of gly had been removed furthermore total organic carbon toc removal was 50 4 and chemical organic demand cod removal was 72 0 fast fe2 ion retrieval and regeneration at the cathode as well as very efficient hydroxyl radical production are likely major contributors to the process s remarkable efficiency so far the fenton method has not gotten a wide attention and application due to the fact that an acidic environment for the method to be effective table 8 however real water cannot be maintained at acidic ph which is inimical to the natural ecosystem also there is need to utilize more fe2 and fe3 ions for higher degradation efficiency of the system the recycling and reuse of the iron ions pose a major challenge concerning the adoption of this method 4 2 3 4 ozonation oxidation method ozone oxidation is one of the most efficient aops for treating wastewater containing gly in the shortest amount of time at the lowest possible concentration the chemistry of ozonation involves the breakdown of ozone in solution through the influence of hydroxyl ion to form oh radicals h2o2 is added to the reaction system to stimulate the breakdown of ozone and aid production of oh radicals hoigné 1998 also the ozonation efficiency can be enhanced by the increasing the ph of the system which stimulates steady generation of oh radicals assalin et al 2010 ozonation for gly removal can occur by either direct oxidation by ozone or indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals which then attack and decompose gly andreozzi et al 1999 the oxidation process via ozonation has resulted in the complete breakdown of gly which has been confirmed by various studies assalin et al 2010 using o3 and h2o2 together gly removal was achieved at a high efficiency 99 and ampa with a high percentage 85 in a very short amount of time jönsson et al 2013 even with the superior performance of this method it still faces certain limitations including high cost requirements solubility challenge for ozone in water waste management issue and unstable nature of ozone finally several studies are reporting the combination of two or more methods as hybrid systems to increase the degradation efficiency of glyphosates espinoza montero et al 2020 utilizing aops with adsorption together xing et al 2018 claimed that a complete glyphosate degradation could be accomplished for gly effluent by employing a catalytic wet oxidation process with modified activated carbon as the catalyst these hybrid processes are beneficial because they decompose gly and several of its intermediate products even though the afore mentioned methods have shown promise in treating wastewater containing gly in laboratory settings bringing them to an industrial scale would need more research the cost of these technologies is still a bottleneck to reduce the financial investment in this method it is recommended that it could be used after an initial step or route that reduces gly concentration 4 2 4 comparison of various advanced oxidation processes the right selection of the aop for gly treatment depends majorly on several factors such as the concentration of gly present in the medium of interest energy demand reaction set up environmental impact cost requirements availability of other resources among others in terms of cost requirement the expenses incurred in demonstrating each aop varies widely for instance the cost implication for ozonation oxidation method is high due to the advanced instrumentation requirement for the oxidation of ozone in water also the cost of heterogenous catalysts like titanium dioxide required for the photolysis and photochemical oxidation mechanisms could be higher feng et al 2020a b for energy demand the electrochemical oxidation method requires high electric current for anodic energy to convert gly to less toxic or biodegradable forms however fenton method may be executed using iron and other reagent in a laboratory environment to treat gly effectively furthermore the impact of these methods on the environment varies significantly too while electrochemical oxidation method has far less significant environmental impact because of the absence of toxic by products after the reaction process ozonation method could pose a threat on the ecosystem due to the generation of toxic by products in the same line the use of tio2 during photolysis could lead to the production of nanoparticles which could be inimical to the environment therefore the choice of the appropriate aop must rely on a meticulous consideration of the prevailing factors discussed above table 8 provides a summary of the details advantages disadvantages and comparison of the several methods for gly treatment 5 conclusions and perspectives due to effectiveness in controlling weed growth glyphosate has become one of the most widespread herbicides in the world the dangers of glyphosate accumulation and widespread exposure to individuals and the environment have however been shown in a significant number of studies this has prompted a plethora of investigations aimed at identifying and eliminating glyphosate from the global terrestrial and marine ecosystems this review contains an extensive discussion on the ecotoxicological effects of glyphosate on terrestrial marine and human organisms also several sensing and detecting techniques for detecting and quantifying glyphosates were also examined at length in the same line the methods for degrading and eliminating glyphosates from the environment were also compared and contrasted with the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment strategy being emphasized the toxicity of glyphosate on ecological systems is very high alterations in biochemical and metabolic processes induction of oxidative stress suppression of the immune system damage to the liver and kidneys in fish induction of genetic toxicity modifications to dna and impairments to mitochondria increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in humans decreased physiological efficiency massive disruption of the soil microbiota exposing plants to certain pathogens are just some of the negative effects of this herbicide on plant aquatic and human life these problems have prompted the use of detecting techniques for estimating the concentrations of herbicides in the natural environment electrochemical sensors colorimetric approaches spectroscopic methods and chromatographic procedures are all examined as viable means of glyphosate detection when comparing several methods for detecting parent and intermediate molecules chromatography is often considered to be among the most sensitive and selective adsorption biological methods using bacteria algae and fungi and advanced oxidation processes like photocatalytic oxidation electrochemical oxidation ozone oxidation fenton methods and hybrid process have all been proposed as treatment strategies for degrading and removing glyphosates to enable a sustainable ecosystem the most effective strategy for glyphosate breakdown and removal is a hybrid procedure that combines advanced oxidation processes with a biological approach however there are still significant limits and challenges to overcome in the identification and removal of glyphosates for environmental cleanup for example most sensing and treatment technologies are currently only being tested on a small scale in the lab therefore it is necessary to create a framework and procedures for taking the testing to an industrial level to address environmental issues and fulfill bioremediation needs on a worldwide scale it is necessary to assess and analyze the direct cost societal cost and energy cost implications of scaling up these technologies finally a substantial amount of study into glyphosate s oxidation processes and biodegradation pathways is still necessary better sensing and detection methods will also be required for precise determination of intermediate products enzymes and metabolites when these are achieved the promise of a sustainable ecosystem can be realized declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11639,glyphosate gly also known as n phosphomethyl glycine and its commercially formulated contemporaries are the most widely used class of herbicides in the world due to the hydrophilic nature of this contaminant it has been detected in surface water effluents groundwater and agri food items especially those that are in proximity to active agricultural zones although glyphosate was regarded to be less toxic to human and aquatic health its metabolite such as aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa is reported to be highly deleterious to the aquatic ecosystem and human health when exposed to it hence this necessitates the development of sensitive and selective instrumental techniques to screen detect and quantify this contaminant including their removal strategies from the environment in view of this the ecotoxicological impact of gly and its metabolites ampa on human and aquatic health and the various advanced instrumental techniques utilized for offsite e g chromatographic in tandem with mass spectrometry techniques gc ms hplc ms uplc ms ms and onsite spectroscopic techniques electrochemical techniques and biosensors analysis of this contaminant are comprehensively discussed furthermore various treatment approaches such as adsorption biological treatments and advanced oxidative processes utilized for the degradation and mineralization of gly and its metabolites in environmental samples are well described finally various challenges relating to glyphosate degradation were identified and suggestions were provided on possible ways of optimizing the recognized methods reported in published literature graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate ampa degradation ecotoxicology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glyphosate gly is primarily a class of anionic highly effective and non selective herbicides used for eradicating weeds it is used in agriculture forestry and horticulture for controlling invasive species being a post emergent herbicide its mechanism of action involves the inhibition and disruption of biosynthetic pathways of essential building blocks such as phenylalanine amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine which are pivotal for plants growth masotti et al 2021 valle et al 2019 pyruvylshikimic acid complex also known as 3 enolpyruvylshikimicvacid 5 phosphate synthase epsps is essential for the biosynthesis of these essential building blocks and it has been reported for inhibiting the action of this complex in the presence of gly gonçalves et al 2019 sihtmäe et al 2013 since animal systems do not operate with this pathway it can be hypothesized that animals are potentially free from gly adverse effect however other types of gly especially those functionalized with the surfactant components roundup surfactants have been reported to be severely toxic to aquatic and human health sanders et al 1979 thanomsit et al 2020a b webster et al 2014 although gly is less toxic when compared to other commercially formulated surfactants e g polyethoxylated amine however the formulated surfactants to a large extent are reported to be precursors to dna and tissue damages endocrine disruption hormonal imbalance and carcinogenesis in amphibians fisheries mammals and humans inclusive gonçalves et al 2019 modesto and martinez 2010 zomer et al 2013 terrestrial animals are exposed to gly through direct application or consumption of contaminated food products although the introduction of gly into the aquatic environment is not common different possible pathways of discharge into the aquatic environment have been reported dean et al 2006 rzymski et al 2013 thanomsit et al 2020a b direct application of gly into aquatic waterbodies for the elimination of aquatic weeds in ditches water bodies margins including leaching and surface runoffs are potential sources of contamination of the aquatic ecosystem although gly is commonly known for its plant specific mode of action glys and its commercially formulated subsidiaries has been reported by several studies to cause deleterious impacts on freshwater biota both target and non target aquatic organisms such as bacteria algae fisheries and amphibians córdova et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2019 van bruggen et al 2018 in fact gly metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid commonly abbreviated as ampa is highly soluble in water and dissolves quickly between 7 and 12 days giesy et al 2000 gonçalves et al 2019 hence there is need for quick and fast detection techniques for monitoring of the levels of gly and its metabolite in the environment several advanced techniques have been developed over the years for the detection of gly from environmental samples these techniques are often used based on cost analytical performance and simplicity considering the chemical properties of gly coupled with low molecular weight its high polarity and hydrophilicity necessitates the application of several conventional hyphenated techniques such as chromatographic mass spectrometry e g lc ms hplc ms uplc ms ms and gc ms li et al 2017 valle et al 2019 wan et al 2022 ion chromatographic ic techniques qiu et al 2013 sato et al 2001 zhu et al 1999 capillary electrophoresis ce chang and liao 2002 although these methods offer high sensitivity and selectivity at relatively low levels they are expensive sometimes complex to operate and not suitable for field work this necessitated the development of cost effective fast simple and field friendly alternatives for the detection and quantification of gly in environmental samples typical examples of these instruments reported in literature includes fluorescence spectroscopy lee et al 2013 peng et al 2022a b optical spectroscopic techniques chang et al 2016a lee et al 2013 scandurra et al 2022a b valle et al 2019 biosensors congur 2021 electrochemical techniques scandurra et al 2022a b zambrano intriago et al 2021 surface enhanced raman spectrometry abbreviated as sers emonds alt et al 2022 scandurra et al 2022a b butmee et al 2022 huang et al 2020 apparently there have been efforts geared toward the detection and quantification of gly and its metabolites in various environmental compartments however its removal is equally important due to the adverse effects it can potentially cause to the flora and fauna community various decontamination strategies either involve the degradation and mineralization of gly into less harmful metabolites or complete elimination from soil surface water and wastewater using physical and chemical methods e g

and hallas 1986 feng et al 2020a b singh et al 2019a b zhang et al 2019a photooxidative methods which involves the utilization of photocatalytic degradation onasanya et al 2021 oladoye et al 2021 lv et al 2020 yang et al 2018 uv assisted oxidation lópez et al 2018 vidal et al 2015 fenton electro fenton photo fenton de souza et al 2013 oturan and oturan 2018 pariente et al 2008 tran et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 and electrochemical oxidative approaches tran et al 2017 the advantages and limitations of various treatment technologies concisely discussed in table 8 section 4 the keyword glyphosate appeared in about 13 190 scopus indexed published papers online stressing the various types of research relating to gly as shown in fig 1 however only about 591 literature review publications were available on scopus regarding this contaminant at the time of writing this paper 6 7 hence it is crucial to make an up to date compilation of this scattered but available information and to compare and contrast different research outputs aimed towards better understanding of gly in the environment including efficient and effective ways of their elimination also we have comprehensively discussed on the ecotoxicological impacts of gly circulation in environmental samples various advanced hyphenated techniques utilized for their detection and quantification and finally the treatment technologies applied for the mineralization and elimination of gly including the possible degradation products in environmental samples based on available information in literature using more than 250 published papers to the best of our knowledge 2 ecotoxicological impacts of glyphosates 2 1 aquatic animals the aquatic ecology is a crucial part of our planet fig 2 illustrates how the accumulation of gly in water bodies has impacted the quality of life for all plants and animals that survive there especially fish thanomsit et al 2020a b gly and its primary metabolites have frequently been found in water bodies as a result of the widespread usage of herbicides based on gly bacci and campo 2022 both gly and its metabolites are water soluble and can linger for a number of weeks in aquatic environments gandhi et al 2021 according to a report the presence of gly in aquatic environments can cause the death of aquatic species including birds fish and herpetofauna bastos gonçalves et al 2020 tsui and chu 2003 conducted one of the first studies to assess the presence of gly in aquatic environments the team investigated how this substance can affect crustaceans ceriodaphnia dubia and acartia tonsa as well as other organisms like bacteria algae and protozoans the findings indicated a tonsa amongst others had the lowest lc50 of 1 77 mg l lethal concentration i e the concentration of gly in air that will kill 50 of the test subjects making it the most sensible recent research by maraes et al moraes et al 2020 discovered that zebra fish exposed to gly and roundup transorb had up to three times higher levels of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily c abcc protein activity and gene expression than controls which indicates that a detoxifying system is being activated however the brain of zebrafish danio rerio when exposed to roundup transorb was found not to enhance the activity of abcc proteins or the expression of the genes abcc1 and abcc4 which were activated on exposure to pure gly other impacts of gly are further outlined in table 1 2 2 human health some notable properties of gly include quick soil sorption biodegradation and non acute toxicity to creatures other than its intended target however it has been noted that gly raises the risk of leaky gut syndrome cardiovascular issue digestive disruption hormonal and immunological dysfunctions autism and cancer meftaul et al 2020 for example the findings of von ehrenstein and colleagues von ehrenstein et al 2019 revealed that the prenatal exposure of pregnancy to gly increases the risk of autism disorder in offspring compared to pregnancy women who have not been previously exposed similarly in a review article published by peillex and others peillex and pelletier 2020 the research team came to the conclusion that gly has cytotoxic and genotoxic effects that are dosage dependent increases oxidative stress disrupts the estrogen system impairs various cerebral processes and is purportedly associated to the development of some human cancers recently spinaci and coworkers spinaci et al 2022 detailed the effects of roudup a gly based product on mammalian sperm in order to examine the effects of pure gly and its commercial formulation roudup the study measured the acrosome integrity motility mitochondrial activity viability and formation of reactive oxygen species in stallion spermatozoa after an hour of incubation at 37 c they found that gly had no adverse effects on the sperm quality markers at any of the observed concentrations however starting at 360 g ml its commercial formulation roudup substantially p 0 05 reduced progressive and total motility acrosome integrity vitality mitochondrial activity and the percentage of living spermatozoa with intact mitochondria not releasing reactive oxygen species gly equivalent dose the table below further summarized gly impact on human and aquatic health table 1 2 3 plants numerous studies have examined how gly affects plants bastos gonçalves et al 2020 eceiza et al 2022 jelonek et al 2020 according to research gly binds to and then inactivates an enzyme that is needed for the shikimate pathway preventing the production of vital amino acids heldt and piechulla 2011 the same metabolic cycle yields a variety of phenolic chemicals that are crucial for plant immunity gly makes crops more vulnerable to attack by soil borne diseases by interfering with the manufacture of such defensive chemicals in plant martinez et al 2018 therefore it may be claimed that regular crop exposure to gly may make plants more susceptible to diseases in many crops disease development has been connected to excessive gly spraying for example it was discovered that gly sprays were the primary cause of diseases like fusarium head blight in agronomic crops fernandez et al 2009 there are instances of greater gly burndown applications prior to planting being associated with greater pathogen colonization in wheat and barley roots fernandez et al 2009 martinez et al 2018 in addition the effects of sublethal gly concentrations on perennial plants might sometimes take a year to manifest and last for two or more years santos et al 2007 gly may potentially and or unintentionally increase the risk of infections in plants by decreasing their general growth and vigor modifying the soil microbiota which impacts the availability of nutrients needed for disease resistance and altering their physiological efficiency hammerschmidt 2018 hence it is crucial to develop various advanced techniques for screening and detecting this contaminant and metabolites in plants and other environmental compartments 3 detection of glyphosate 3 1 sensing techniques the sensing technique is a method that allows various types of sensors to detect and determine analytes from a sample campos et al 2010 the most utilized sensing techniques are those that employ the use of electrochemical sensors optical sensors and mechanical sensors of all these sensors the most explored and exploited for gly sensing and detection is electrochemical sensors 3 1 1 electrochemical sensors electrochemical sensors have been found and explored to be effective analytical sensors table 2 used in the laboratory and on site monitoring and analysis of gly detection systems in multiple matrices such as food environmental fluids water biological fluids agricultural products and soil samples zambrano intriago et al 2021 most electrochemical sensors developed and used for gly sensing are those developed from metal and modified electrodes biosensors and electronic tongues 3 1 1 1 metal and modified electrodes many metals and modified electrodes have been successfully developed for gly sensing with high sensitivity and selectivity modified electrodes have been found to show more stability sensitivity and insusceptibility to potential interferences that can result in a signal error zambrano intriago et al 2021 for instance nanomaterials have been significantly used as electrochemical sensors for gly sensing due to their large surface to volume ratio which translates to better conductivity characteristics they possess escarpa et al 2015 also modified electrodes such as glassy carbon electrodes gce have been widely explored for gly sensing aguirre et al 2019 a study has reported the use of pencil graphite electrodes pregnant with multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and copper oxide nanoparticle combined with ionic liquids to develop an electrochemical sensor with a higher surface area better mechanical stability and higher electrical conductivity which guarantee gly sensing gholivand et al 2018 due to the high selectivity of the sensor when metal ions are present zambrano intriago et al 2021 that allows for gly cu2 complexation gly and its structural analogs such as glufosinate ampa and tridemorph pesticide can be detected in soil and water samples further accuracy can be guaranteed by using chromatographic methods unlike nanoparticles organometallic compounds have been explored for use as electrochemical sensors for gly detection because of their structural properties that influence their synthesis and electrical properties research reported that in modifying electrodes for better use as an electrochemical sensor for gly sensing the use of an organometallic compound known as copper phthalocyanine cupc has been explored on the surface of modified gce the cupc modified with mwcnts and deposited on the gce surface was observed to have a strong adsorption capacity and high specific surface area that allows for rapid gly detection in this system gly is detected when it adsorbs to the metacenter in the cupc sensor thereby forming gly cu2 ion complex as result of the enhanced sensitivity and selectivity at ultra levels and the presence of highly concentrated metal ions in the cupc organometallic compound its use as a sensor for gly is a promising method of gly detection zambrano intriago et al 2021 a search for a more selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for gly sensing resulted in the exploration and application of conductive polymers cpol synthetic materials to develop the gly sensor a highly conductive polymerized modified electrode from the polymerization of pyrrole together with composite copper electrodes electrochemically deposited on activated carbon fiber was developed to voltammetrically detect gly shrivastava et al 2021 this was observed to be effective in gly sensing in soil and apple pulp samples cpol was observed to afford the within trapped copper metal more physical robustness that allows the detection and determination of gly based on gly interaction with the copper metal ion another widely explored cpol is the electropolymerized pyroll py which is a highly conductive electrochemical sensor for gly detection jain et al 2017 zhang and coworkers 2017 reported a study where gold modified electrodes with the molecularly imprinted polymer of poly pyrrole mippy were used to develop an electrochemical sensor for the indirect electropolymerization of gly with the mippy using cyclic voltammetry obtaining a detection limit of 0 67 μg l 1 zhang et al 2017 noori and coworkers also reported the first direct electrochemical sensing of gly in water without pretreatment where screen printed gold working electrodes were used to detect gly by amperometric measurements to a detection limit of 2 μm noori et al 2018 in a different study completely solid state gold nanoelectrode arrays were easily made and employed for pretreatment free direct measurement of gly at nanomolar levels thermal de wetting of a thin gold layer onto graphene paper produced the gold nanoelectrode array the capacity of the method is not influenced by interferents according to the interference investigation of aminomethyl phosphonic acid ampa in the determination of gly that was also reported scandurra et al 2022a b reduced graphene oxide rgo has been the material of choice in making electrochemical sensors for gly sensing due to its ease of fabrication and ability to be produced on the kilogram scale rowley neale et al 2018 rgo is obtained from the electrochemical thermal and chemical reduction of graphite oxide setznagl and cesarino reported a study where a highly conductive electrochemical sensor was developed from a rgo mixed with copper nanoparticles cunps and electrodeposited on a gce surface this sensor was reported to be highly effective in gly sensing due to the availability of cunps and formation of a number of complexes of cu2 gly the electrochemical sensor was used for gly detection systems in water samples that have not been pretreated setznagl and cesarino 2022 3 1 1 2 biosensors biosensors are a distinct group of chemical sensors that are developed to cope as an analytical interdisciplinary technique gründler 2017 for sensing gly in food lu and gunasekaran 2019 and monitoring of environmental interferents bagheri et al 2019 biosensors recognize analytes from samples through catalytic signals from biochemical reactions immunological reactions and catalysis inhibition reactions quite several biosensors are available however the use of a biosensor depends on the nature of the substrate matrices and recognition element there are cell biosensors organism based biosensors enzyme based biosensors and antibody biosensors of all these only enzymatic biosensors and antibody sensors have reported results for the detection of gly ajiboye et al 2022 escarpa et al 2015 however of these two biosensors the enzymatic biosensors or enzyme based biosensor is widely used to develop electrochemical sensors for gly sensing an enzymatic biosensor is selective for gly sensing and has indirect direct catalytic properties the working principle of the enzymatic biosensor is based on their optimal capacity for trapping adsorption micro encapsulation crosslinking and covalent bonding processes sassolas et al 2012 however the limitation to using enzyme based electrochemical sensors is that enzymes have a limited shelf life borgmann et al 2011 which may be disadvantageous for long testing periods urease peroxidase and tyrosine are used as enzymes in the development of biosensors for the electrochemical detection of gly peroxidases are the most extensively researched and utilized enzyme for gly detection heme containing glycoproteins are known as peroxidases po also known as hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductases as its primary substrate h2o2 po catalyzes the oxidation of both organic and inorganic substances kalsoom et al 2015 pos have been widely explored because of their wide ph range high activity temperature fast regeneration and ability to bind covalently with nanoparticles bilal and iqbal 2019 unlike other organic compounds gly remains uncatalyzed but rather serve as an excellent inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of po hence this attribute is explored for gly sensing po is amenable for the detection of gly due to similarity of wide ph range since the gly molecule has both positive and negative charges at ph 4 this ph makes it possible to detect gly because it interacts well with the amino acid residues of the biocatalyst initial studies have proposed how to determine gly at this ph with a setup consisting of the immobilization of horseradish peroxidase hrp on ge mwcnts electrodes using electrophoretic deposition cahuantzi muñoz et al 2019 a research group developed a biosensor of a gold electrode surface and it was found to give a good performance for gly sensing and other gly structural analogs aminomethyl phosphonic acid ampa sensing in water and corn samples an improvement to this biosensor system was reported in another study of hrp dhamu et al 2021 roman and his group proposed the development of another hrp based biosensor this biosensor was made of an n type monocrystalline electrode whose surface was electrodeposited with a polyaniline film pan and an immobilized hrp enzyme pan was used because of its efficiency in binding to biomolecules which causes the biocatalytic properties of enzymes to favor charge transfer between the enzyme and the gly containing substrate in this biosensor the mechanism of detection is due to gly s ability to block hrp s activity in the oxidation of hydroquinones hqs when h2o2 is present thereby resulting in a decrease in the electric current signals which signifies the incomplete action of the hrp roman et al 2020 atemoya peroxidase has been extracted from the extraction of atemoya and has also been observed and reported to be an efficient enzyme based biosensor and as an electrochemical sensor for gly detection the extracted po was then combined with a mixture of mwcnts graphite powder with mineral oil in a plastic syringe that was attached to an electrode made of copper wire the enzyme system was reported to show application for gly sensing in real samples such as agricultural formulations milk orange and juice square wave voltammetry swv was used to observe the detection performance as the gly is capable of having an inhibitory effect on the oxidation of hqs when h2o2 is present in the system this enzymatic biosensor showed stability for a long time of about 8 weeks giving a high linear range of response from 100 to 4500 μm of gly sensing oliveira et al 2018 the use of antibody biosensors for gly sensing has also been studied for gly sensing though scanty information about its use for gly sensing is available dithiobis succinimidyl propanoate dps has been tested as a crosslinker group for polyclonal antibodies mounted on a gold surface for use in gly sensing by the mechanism of interactions that occur between antibody and antigen containing gly as shown in fig 3 dhamu and prasad 2020 3 1 1 3 electronic tongues electronic tongues are simple tools that are used for detection and analysis of an aqueous sample martínez gil et al 2013 they are recommended because of their low cost and relatively fast technology electronic tongues are cylinders made up of stainless steel that contain non selective electrodes noble metals au pt rh ir and ag and non noble metals ni co and cu make up these non selective electrodes the electronic tongues consist of at least one noble metal and one non noble metal in their setup electronic tongues function as an electrochemical sensor for gly detection systems when enabled with voltametric transduction campos et al 2012 the detection of gly by electronic tongues is highly selective and reproducible it was reported that a voltametric electronic tongue vet was accurate in determining and detecting gly in the presence of potential interferents like humic acids and calcium ions this vet consisted of co cu and pt metallic electrodes contained in a cylinder made of methacrylate the vet produced a signal pattern when gly is detected in an aqueous sample and the electric signals were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry dpv bataller et al 2012 this vet is low cost fast and simple in design and operation in the study by martnez gil and coworkers 2013 dpv was also employed with the use of a vet that contain two electrodes noble metals ir rh pt and au make up the first electrode whereas ag cu co and ni non noble metals make up the second electrode the objective of this vet system was to create and validate a mathematical model to assess gly and to differentiate between the presence of typical contaminants in natural water bodies that may cause interferences such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers and humic compounds martínez gil et al 2013 despite that these studies presented electronic tongues as a reliable method of predicting and detecting gly in aqueous systems or natural water bodies the sensitivity of electronic tongues to determine gly at low concentration levels is still in doubt for instance electronic tongues were observed to be non sensitive except when evaluation of gly was done at high concentrations of gly 16 905 169 050 μm bataller et al 2012 and 8452 5 84 525 μm martínez gil et al 2013 this implies that the vet could not detect gly in samples with low concentrations of gly hence electronic tongue is not a sensitive technique per se the main challenge of using electronic tongues as electrochemical sensors for gly detection is choosing the right equipment and mathematical model based on qualitative and quantitative metabolite analysis zambrano intriago et al 2021 as intriguing as electrochemical sensors for gly sensing are and as successful as they have been in the previous decade their use remains unclear conflicts arise as to the reproducibility and reliability of the method without regulated complex environments in real time detection this conflict is however attributed to the variations that exist in the production of these sensors and the complex reactions that are formed between gly and other compounds present in the sensors although provided with proof of concepts of its operation it is still necessary to show that the manufacturing is cost effective sensitive and repeatable for field detections to provide final validation 3 2 colorimetric method colorimetric methods have been reported to be a selective and ultrasensitive technique for the detection of gly residue in aqueous solutions table 3 colorimetry is believed to be a much simpler and cost effective technique to employ in the detection of gly colorimetric methods for the detection of gly involve the transformation of gly into a colored compound that can easily be detected under a beam of light jane sharma and coworkers 2012 reported a study in which the gly amino group was transformed into a derivative of dithiocarbamate which resulted in a reaction of copper i perchlorate that caused the formation of a yellowish green colored complex under the rays of light at a maximum absorbance of 392 nm sharma et al 2012 a cysteamine modified gold nanoparticle was used in a colorimetric technique for the on site detection of gly in plant tissues guan et al 2020 tu et al 2019 it was briefly observed that stabilized gold nanoparticles with cysteamine without aggregation are effective in the detection of gly zheng et al 2013 the system changes color from red to blue or purple when gly is present which aggregates to the gold nanoparticles however limitations exist with this technique due to the long testing time complex synthetic procedures and high detection limits associated with its use because of these limitations to the colorimetric method the need to develop a new colorimetric detection system for the rapid onsite detection and analysis of gly is required guan et al 2021 the use of gold nanoparticles aunps as an anti aggregation mechanism is presented as a novel colorimetric method for gly detection due to electrostatic interactions a specific concentration of pb2 can trigger the aggregation of aunps and a change in the color of the solution from red to gray however the chelation between gly and pb2 in the presence of gly can seriously impede the aforementioned process the colorimetric detection system for gly displays outstanding sensitivity because of its anti aggregation mechanism zhou et al 2017 a novel chemosensor called r g chemosensor nrg developed by the functionalization of amidogen has been successfully employed for gly detection in an aqueous solution the r g chemosensor was created by adding a picolyl group to the amidogen of a rhodamine based probe to create a cu2 ion trap the colorimetric method made use of the cu2 indicator displacement strategy which enables the easy naked eye detection of gly this is due to the discovery that gly binds to cu2 more strongly than previously thought as a result there is a rapid displacement of gly for cu2 from the rhodamine probe changing its hue from colorless to yellowish green fig 4 even at a low detection limit of 4 1 nm the chemosensor was found to be successful in the selective detection of gly in ambient samples guan et al 2020 also the copper doped polyvinyl alcohol nanofiber cd pva has been observed to be an advantageous sensor in the colorimetric detection of gly and its structural analogs de almeida et al 2015 the pva was optically changed to a different color using dithiocarbamic acid it was noted that the optical color changer of the cd pva nanofiber switches from blue to yellow when gly is detected the cd pva sensor is not very sensitive for lengthy periods of detection time 20 days despite the approach having strong color change stability at a quick response time about 1 3 s another drawback is that the chemosensor is susceptible to ions and compounds present in environmental waters hence a pre treatment is always required a l valle et al 2019 however liu and his team created a colorimetric sensor strip that can identify other organophosphorus substances including chlorpyrifos dimethoate and dichlorvos in addition to gly liu et al 2015 fast analysis and simple readout were two excellent benefits of this colorimetric sensor strip by examining the colorimetric property of 2 mercapto 5 nitrobenzimidazole capped silver nanoparticles mnbz ag nps aggregated with mg2 ions another colorimetric sensor sensitive to gly detection has been particularly designed rawat et al 2016 when gly is found a yellowish tint changes to an orange red hue according to reports this is because the mnbz ag nps mg2 ion and gly interacted to produce an inter particle complex which reduced the distance between the particles in the nanoparticle s structure wan et al 2022 3 3 spectroscopic method the most reported spectroscopic techniques for the detection of gly are fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy these are discussed in details in this section 3 3 1 fluorescence spectroscopy fs or fluorometry fs is a simple less expensive and reliable spectroscopic method based on the principle of emission which does not involve tedious analysis employed for the on site detection of gly a l valle et al 2019 fs is a convenient and rapid method for detecting gly that involves using fluorescent nanomaterials or fluorescence sensors guan et al 2021 to date fs has become increasingly popular in the detection of gly because of its low cost and ease of preparation peng et al 2022a b the major challenge of fs in the detection of gly is that gly structures lack fluorophore or chromophore groups this is overcome by the use of intermediates in the detection for example tyrosinase hong et al 2020 and anti glyphosate antibodies guan et al 2020 are utilized as intermediaries for gly fluorescence detection intermediates such as coumarin cu2 derivatives have also been reported to be used as gly fluorescence sensors and have been investigated to show promising detection of gly in crops with a response time of more than 5 min wang et al 2020b however the limitation observed in the cu2 based gly detection method is that the sensor shows poor stability which makes it susceptible to the complex environment wan et al 2022 moreover recent studies have corrected this deviation of fluorescence sensors to environmental influences by incorporating high stability fluorescent sources and materials into the sensor to detect gly for instance it has been claimed that gly may be detected using fluorescence magnetic nanoparticles fmps linked with particular dna probes fs fmps dna based on the competitive interaction between fmps and conjugated gly this method was an improvement to the previous study by the group where free gly was detected using gold conjugated nanoparticles coupled with dna lee et al 2013 the fluorescence intensity quantification of gly is then done using uv photometric analysis and laser scanning microscopy unfortunately other possible interactions between gly analogs and other environmental interferences that might occur are not adequately explored and accounted for which poses a challenge to the method also metal organic frameworks mofs fluorescence property has been investigated for the detection of gly mofs allows for the incorporation of small reference molecules into their unique cavities spaces making them a reliable ratio fluorescence sensor material w m liao et al 2018 for instance a study found reduced sensitivity to environmental interferences in the detection of gly with an iron based metal organic framework nh2 mil 88 fe ratio fluorescence sensor the sensor framework allows the embedding of small molecule rhb to correct deviations from the equipment and environment interferences cu2 has also been added as an intermediate to the ratio fluorescence sensor framework for a linear range enlargement the resultant nh2 mil 88 fe rhb cu2 ratio fluorescence sensor was observed to show fast gly detection with high stability fig 5 it was reported that the presence of gly directly influenced the fluorescence signals as the fluorescence signal is turned on when gly chelates with cu2 via hydrogen bonding during nh2 mil 88 fe rhb cu2 interaction with gly the ratio fluorescence sensor demonstrated satisfactory accuracy with sensitivity for the on site gly detection in agricultural formulations such as soybean cucumber wheat and tea wan et al 2022 another fluorescence sensor made up of carbonaceous fluorescent nanomaterials known as carbon quantum dots cqds has also been employed in the detection of gly cqds are small sized quantum dots with a large surface area and unique photoluminescence properties cqds are popular because of their environmental friendliness and low cytotoxicity miao et al 2017 cqds act as donor fluorophores to the gly structures which solve the problem of the lack of fluorophores in gly structures an immunosensor developed with cqds labeled antibodies has been specifically used to recognize the distribution of gly in plant tissues the principle is based on the existence of a linear association between the cqds fluorescence intensity and their logarithmic gly concentration the major challenge of using cqd fluorescence sensors is that excess cqds may be present in the system however by adding magnetic nanoparticles like fe3o4 to the system the challenge is eliminated wang et al 2016 also a sulfate loaded iron and nitrogen co doped cqds so4 2 cqds have been investigated to visualize the distribution concentration and metabolism of gly in the stem leaves roots and cultivated soil of crops so4 2 cqds possess a unique acidic ph response which allows the generation of ethanoic acid ch3cooh and thiocholine from the hydrolysis of acetylcholine ach by acetylcholinesterase ache the presence of gly is detected by the production of ch3cooh which decreased the ph of the system thereby turning on the gly response to fluorescence peng et al 2022a b 3 3 2 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy method nmr nmr spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that explores the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to give detailed information on the molecular structure of the atomic nuclei however very few studies are available for the study of the nmr spectroscopy method for gly detection a study has reported that 31p and 1h nmr have been explored to detect the presence of gly in biological fluids samples such as urine plasma blood and liver valle et al 2019 however the major limitation of using the method of nmr spectroscopy is that several signals can overlap in the quantification analysis of the samples being that the administered samples are therapeutic agents a l valle et al 2019 3 4 chromatographic methods the quantitation of herbicide residues in fruits vegetables often comprise of flow steps such as extraction the interferents removal herbicide residue determination and identity confirmation using different techniques tadeo et al 1996 initially spectrophotometric and or colorimetric methods have been employed in the determination of herbicides however the previously mentioned methods do not optimally produce results with desired sensitivity when compared with chromatographic methods the distinction between the hydrolysis products of herbicides from the parent compounds cannot also be handled by mere colorimetric and spectrophotometric techniques tadeo et al 2000 in sample analysis the choice or amenability of high performance liquid chromatography hplc is determined by the physico chemical properties of the analytes such as hydrogen bonding hydroxyl functionalities and thermal decomposability the primary degradation product or metabolite of gly ampa has been detected in surface and groundwater samples in regions like south america castro berman et al 2018 ronco et al 2016 efsa 2015 united states ramirez et al 2014a australia okada et al 2020 and europe di guardo and finizio 2018 therefore both ampa and gly are analyzed or determined in food and water samples yusà et al 2021 a better sensitivity is usually recorded when hplc is coupled with specific detectors like nitrogen phosphorous detector npd electron capture detector ecd and mass spectrometric detector ms unlike poor selectivity particularly with uv detection sequel to the inherent toxicity associated with gly gly residues in food products it is germane that food items suspected to contain gly be analyzed using sophisticated techniques and following sequential approaches 3 4 1 glyphosate extraction and clean up the extraction of gly from foods and water samples is a function of herbicide physico chemical characteristics and the matrices of the sample characteristically gly consists of three major ionizable acidic and amino functionalities groups pka4 pka1 10 98 5 95 2 29 0 78 zhu et al 1999 ampa on the other hand has acidic sites and an alkaline functionality pkas 5 6 10 2 and 0 9 guo et al 2016 in other words gly an ampa are amphoteric existing as zwitterion at ph less than 10 owing to amino nitrogen protonation yusà et al 2021 these aforementioned properties determine the procedures and reagents required for effective gly and ampa extraction and clean up in food samples extraction generally consists of sample homogenization with a suitable organic solvent and ph adjusted water or water by using sonicator or blender most commonly ethyl acetate acetonitrile and methanol are used for herbicides extraction from food items in the recent times supercritical fluid extraction sfe was employed for the herbicide residue extraction dean et al 1996 tadeo et al 1996 there are other applicable extraction methods such as soxhlet extraction classical method quechers microextraction nasiri et al 2020 microextraction can be categorized into stir bar sorptive extraction sbse solid phase microextraction spme and liquid phase microextraction lpme sbse makes use of magnetic stir bar instead of solvent as the extractant to achieve enhanced extraction efficiency spme on the other hand uses ad sorbent and capillary column to extract herbicides from samples though spme is also a solventless extraction technique it suffers limitation of short lifetime and fragility of the sorbent fibres kadivar and aliakbar 2019 lpme technique is a miniaturized form of liquid liquid extraction lle involving analyte transfer into microlitre volume of organic solvent liang et al 2022 however the technique is limited in terms of solvent selection and poor reproducibility farajzadeh et al 2018 when spme and sbse are compared sbse is more efficient in the extraction of targeted analytes with improved reproducibility however the demerits may have to do with the difficulty in removing the magnetic stir bar for rinsing after it has been used wang et al 2020a of all quechers is widely used for multiple residue or multiclass herbicide residues in vegetables fruits or water although it is characterized with easy and fast analytical steps the batch samples speed of pre treatment is affected by low centrifugation speed and enrichment factors samsidar et al 2018 3 4 2 liquid chromatographic analysis liquid chromatographic technique is efficient and fast for quantitation of organic contaminants in food items that are apparently difficult to identify due to non volatility thermal lability and non amenability to gas chromatographic gc analysis tandem lc ms ms has made it feasible for quantifying herbicide or pesticide residue in vegetables grains and fruits liang et al 2022 for gly analysis different hplc techniques have been developed these include liquid chromatography fluorescence detector lc fld hogendoorn et al 1999 ultra high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry uplc ms ms guo et al 2018 tittlemier et al 2017 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms granby et al 2003 y liao et al 2018 santilio et al 2019 liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry lc esi ms kruve et al 2011 and so on previous studies have reported the limit of detection lod for gly by hplc techniques to be 0 3 μg kg when coupled with mass spectrometric technique zoller et al 2018 in spite of this low detection limit studies are still being conducted for the development of highly sensitive accurate and precise liquid chromatographic method s for detection of gly at parts per trillion ppt level although there is an enhancement in lod for gly quantification by hplc tandem mass spectrometer santilio et al 2019 zoller et al 2018 table 4 shows the various liquid chromatographic methods of detection of gly and ampa with their limits of quantification loq 3 4 3 gas chromatographic gc analysis the usage of gc in organic sample analysis is dated back to 1950s but now widely applied in various fields involving chemical analysis including water and soil treatment and others an inert carrier gas ar n2 h or he is used to push a gasified sample through gas chromatographic column whereby separation takes place and the different composition of sample material is determined gc technique is amenable for the determination of samples that are non polar easily gasified and volatile at injector temperature without decomposition liang et al 2022 it is therefore extensively applied in herbicide residue analysis as a result of its high sensitivity and selectivity linked to the detectors that can be hyphenated interfaced with this method tadeo et al 2000 packed columns are often of choice in herbicide residues quantitation in food for several years for instance fluoro propylsilicones qf 1 methyl phenyl silicones ov 17 and methyl silicones se 30 ov 1 and dc 200 are some of the columns employed as stationary phases for herbicide residue analysis recently open tubular cross linked fused silica column of characteristic low polarity like hp 1 hp 5 db 1 and db 5 are applied the replacement of packed columns by fused silica capillary columns are ascribed to enhanced selectivity sensitivity and high resolution characteristic of the capillary columns tadeo et al 2000 kataoka et al developed a sensitive selective and fast gas chromatographic method for synchronized quantitation of gly ampa and glufosinate gluf in food and environmental samples kataoka et al 1996a the samples were derivatized using isopropyl chloroformate isopcf the recoveries obtained for gly ampa and gluf introduced into different food and environmental samples were 91 106 the loq of gluf gly and ampa were 2 0 1 2 and 0 8 ng ml for gly ampa and gluf respectively while that of carrot and soil were 20 12 and 8 ng g kataoka et al 1996a zhang and others developed a reliable and sensitive technique for ampa and gly detection in different environmental systems like soil and water zhang et al 2019b it was reported that the linearities of ampa and gly 10 1000 ng ml were r2 0 9991 and r2 0 9998 respectively in addition loq of 0 81 and 0 37 ng ml were recorded for ampa and gly respectively validating the applicability of the method developed in ampa and gly detection in different environmental media inherently gc amenability in ampa and gly quantitation have some limitations such as non suitability for polar compounds non suitability for thermally unstable compounds and the requirement for derivatization masiá et al 2016 table 5 shows the various gas chromatographic methods for detection of gly and ampa with their limits of quantification loq 4 treatment strategies for degradation and removal of glyphosate in environmental samples due to the broad overuse and accumulation of gly in the ecosystem adverse impacts on plant animals and health outcomes have been recorded including weakened plant systems alteration of terrestrial and marine animal metabolism and alteration of the human body systems van bruggen et al 2018 this compound may damage the aquatic system via factory effluents or textile chemicals baylis 2000 environmental concerns over gly have prompted the development of eco friendly ways to breakdown it for rehabilitation and restoration of gly contaminated areas three major products of gly metabolism ampa acetyl glyphosate and sarcosine are further degraded through separate biochemical activities moreover gly mostly breaks down into ampa because it cannot be broken down inside of cells it causes secondary environmental contamination gly has been shown in many studies to increase microorganism metabolism singh et al 2020 numerous conventional and novel strategies have been investigated for the breakdown of gly in fact large scale gly degradation has been achieved by the use of chemical and biological methods in addition to improved oxidation mechanisms espinoza montero et al 2020 rossi et al 2021 the relevant concepts methods and alternatives for the degradation of gly are discussed in this section below 4 1 degradation kinetics and thermodynamics for a more thorough comprehension of the processes at play during degradation and removal of gly several factors and variables are considered crucial these include a number of equations governing the process modeling removal parameters and isotherm and thermodynamic analysis several thermodynamics models for describing the processes that occur during glys removal or degradation have been reported the common ones used to describe the equilibrium of adsorption are the langmuir and freundlich isotherms pereira et al 2021 according to the langmuir isotherm adsorption of gly is taking place mostly in monolayers and this finding shows that the active sites on the adsorbent have energy levels that are equal to one another samuel et al 2017 dissanayake herath et al 2019 the freundlich isotherm predicts that an adsorbent system s energy loss would decrease in a manner that is proportional to the logarithm of the number of molecules that have been absorbed by the system mayakaduwa et al 2015 nourouzi et al 2012 the langmuir s model isotherm is described by the equation jiang et al 2018 1 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e the freundlich s model isotherm is described thus dissanayake herath et al 2019 2 q e k f c e 1 n where q e stands for equilibrium adsorption capacity in mg g q m represents the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g k l is the langmuir coefficient k f mgn 2 ln is the freundlich coefficient 1 n represents adsorption intensity and c e represents the equilibrium concentration mg l to provide further insight into the viability of the processes during adsorption and degradation of gly several kinetic models showing the rate of adsorption have been reported including the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso kinetic models and other comprehensive models such as the elovich s model pereira et al 2021 according to the pfo model only one parameter impacts the adsorption rate in the pso model the rate of adsorption is determined by two parameters in the model jiang et al 2018 elovich s model suggests that the adsorption sites each have their own unique energy which means that neither the interaction nor the desorption among entities really have much effect on the rate of the adsorption procedure however very little research has been done on the application of the elovich s model to gly adsorption since it is often employed in the setting of heterogeneous surface systems khenifi et al 2010 the equations governing the various kinetic models are represented in table 6 q 1 and q 2 are the adsorption capacity k 1 represent the pso constant and k 2 represents the pso constants a is the starting speed b is the desorption constant and t represents time 4 2 treatment and degradation alternatives 4 2 1 adsorption adsorption is a surface phenomenon in which particles become attracted to the top layer of a material layer in most cases it involves the molecules atoms or even ions of a dissolved state of a liquid solid or gas that are connected to the surface this concept has been employed in industrial biochemical and purification processes including wastewater treatment and other bioremediation activities because of its low cost lack of toxicity and great efficiency feng et al 2020a b numerous studies on adsorption as a method for removing gly from the environment have been conducted for decades they have explored the potential of different materials as adsorbent medium including biochar bc adsorption membranes resins clay compounds activated carbon etc to extract gly from the environment agboola et al 2022 p hadi et al 2015 d m jia et al 2017 mayakaduwa et al 2016 fig 6 provides a visual illustration of the various adsorption mechanisms that have been used for gly removal this includes molecular interactions among the entities in the system or diffusion via various sizes and volumes of pores furthermore electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent system and gly molecules or the formation of complexes including iron based complexes that enable gly removal from the aqueous system are viable methods for adsorptive remediation of gly from the aqueous system a typical example involves the utilization of zr based metal organic framework zr mofs for the adsorption of gly from aqueous solution zr mofs are known to adsorb and hydrolyze herbicides and chemical warfare agents such as vx moon et al 2015 denchy et al 2021 mendonca et al 2020 in the study by tao and coworkers they employed defects in mofs to selectively adsorbed gly from an aqueous solution in the presence of different pollutants like sulfamethoxazole sulpanilamide acephate methyl parathion and sulfamethazine tao et al 2022 hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions and phosphate zr bonding contributed to the adsorption of gly on this mofs it was determined that adsorption of gly to these mofs is spontaneous and proceed via chemical mechanism as shown in fig 7 tao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the huio 66s had the highest adsorption capacity in a multivariate system at the reporting time the adsorption performance of these mofs was not affected by competing ions and humic acids in another study zr mofs nu 1000 and uio 67 act as lewis acids with an affinity for the phosphate groups of the gly pankajakshan et al 2018 pankajakshan et al posited that the reduction in sizes increases the efficiency of adsorption the adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo second order model with solvent water in excess theoretical studies also showed strong binding between the zr phosphate with uio 67 and nu 1000 having 17 37 kj mol 1 and 37 63 kj mol 1 respectively biochar and activated carbon two typical adsorbents with a porous structure and high removal effectiveness has been found useful for different environmental applications agboola et al 2022 including the removal of gly for example the efficacy of waste newspaper activated carbon wnac in removing gly from water was investigated by nourouzi et al 2012 the adsorption of gly by wnac was modeled using the langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson adsorption isotherms the adsorption process was best suited by the langmuir adsorption isotherm model wnac is reported to have an optimal performance at ph of 2 5 in which it adsorbed 48 4 mg g gly in another similar study herath wickramasinghe 2015 examined the ability of a steam activated biochar produced from rice husk to extract gly from aqueous system biochar was made by slowly pyrolyzing risk husk at 700 c with steam activation batch adsorption and isotherm studies were used to investigate ph reaction time and gly dosage pfo pso and elovich model were used to evaluate adsorption kinetics also langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were utilized to compute biochar equilibrium sorption values the highest gly sorption was recorded at ph 4 and declined with increasing ph freundlich model best suited equilibrium isotherm data suggesting physisorption on heterogeneous and amorphous biochar surfaces furthermore mayakaduwa et al 2015 removed aqueous gly using bioenergy waste woody biochar the adsorption experiments yielded equilibrium isotherms and kinetics gly adsorption was ph dependent peaking at 5 6 at this ph the protonated amino moiety of gly may interact with biochar through electron donor acceptor interactions freundlich and temkin models best fit isotherm data showing gly multilayer sorption isotherm modeling indicated that biochar may adsorb 44 mg g of gly after 1 h equilibrium was attained with the adsorption chemical adsorption in which the sorbate and adsorbent either share electrons or the sorbate transfers electrons to the adsorbent controls the limits of the reaction rate better adsorption performance can be obtained by the surface modification or functionalization of the biochars used during the adsorption process for instance d jia et al 2020 reported the highest adsorption performance of any reported adsorbent for gly removal in the literature nano cufe2o4 modified biochar was used to remove aqueous gly hydrolysis at 500 c and coprecipitation created cufe2o4 biochar adsorbent freundlich and langmuir illustrate physisorption and chemisorption from equilibrium isotherm data the pso kinetic model explains adsorption kinetics indicating chemical adsorption may dominate cufe2o4 biochar adsorbs 269 4 mg g of gly in 4 h at ph 4 and ambient temperature also resin s porous structure and surface chemistry favor gly adsorption in aqueous systems in demonstrating the potential of resin for gly removal d m jia et al 2017 produced a composite resin by crosslinking polystyrene with nano sized iron oxides a pso model was shown to be the best fit for the adsorption kinetics of gly and it was demonstrated that low ph values are favorable for adsorption in addition gly was effectively removed from the resin composites by naoh solution indicating its desorptive property to allow for repeated use of the adsorbent in a similar investigation chen et al 2013 investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of gly removal using resin d301 the adsorption capability of resin d301 was high with a maximum capacity of 833 3 mgg 1 at 318 15 k the langmuir model showed that the adsorption of gly onto resin d301 is a monolayer adsorption also the experimental parameters showed that the sorption mechanism is exothermic and dominated by an intricate mechanism which is neither purely physical nor purely chemical gly adsorption on resin d301 is also consistent with the pso kinetic model with an apparent activation energy of 83 11 kj mol 1 the effectiveness of fe3 preloaded d151 resin in eliminating gly from aqueous system was investigated xiao and meng 2020 as a result of the research iron loaded resin has become the first gly adsorbent shown to be salt resistant gly adsorption was best at a ph of 3 35 resin adsorption was shown to be facilitated by a process involving ligand exchange between gly and water the highest adsorption capacity of gly achieved by the iron loaded resin was 481 85 mg g in the presence of 16 nacl which is much higher than the adsorption capabilities of any previously reported adsorbents irrespective of the efficacy and relevance of the adsorbents in removing gly from the aqueous environment there are still several challenges and limitations which should be addressed first it has been reported in the literature that the adsorbents require an acidic condition for the maximum removal of gly from the aqueous environment pereira et al 2021 this can impact the ph of water during treatment and the release to the environment might be detrimental to mankind also the disposal of the residue from the adsorption process is still a major challenge moreover there are no specific adsorbents which solely select gly from the aqueous environment the presence of other ions or entities with gly at high concentration can lower the efficacy of adsorbents as there is likelihood of competition among the ions and adsorbent feng et al 2020a b therefore adsorption cannot be selected as the major means for the removal of gly it could serve as a secondary means after the concentration of the competing ions and pollutants have reduced the development of novel and high performing polymeric adsorbents with low cost and highly porous structure with great compatibility with gly could pave the way for the widespread use of adsorption for the removal of gly 4 2 2 biological methods 4 2 2 1 bacterial degradation of glyphosates biological degradation of organic molecules is widely recognized as an effective and environmentally benign way for detoxifying water of organic contaminants to put it simply the metabolism of microorganisms in the biodegradation process causes the breakdown of gly into smaller molecules these processes include enzyme reactions which often produce harmless chemicals feng et al 2020a b these breakdown proceedings can be achieved using bacteria fungi actinomycete and algae there have been several reports of bacterial actinomycete and fungal degradation of gly however bacteria are by far the most commonly studied microorganism this is because many bacteria have the carbon phosphorus c p hydrolytic enzymes required for gly bioremediation hove jensen et al 2014 due to the fact that gly may be degraded by many different types of bacteria biodegradation of this herbicide is theoretically possible bacteria may then utilize the byproducts of this breakdown to get the essential nutrients for their own development and survival carbon nitrogen and phosphorus singh et al 2020 to fully take use of bacteria s potential for gly degradation researchers must first identify the numerous microbial degradation routes of gly in order to maximize the process and enhance environmental cleanup according to the model presented in fig 8 zhan et al 2018 gly degrading bacteria utilize two primary degradation routes which include c p lyase catalysis gly oxidoreductase and a third and minor route acetylation which generate respective intermediate products such as sarcosine ampa and acetylglyphosate in the one of the pathways c p lyase catalyzes the direct breaking of the c p link resulting in the metabolization of gly to sarcosine and phosphate firdous et al 2020 phosphate is further broken down by other designated microbes furthermore the enzyme sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine into glycine and formaldehyde after it has been consumed by microorganisms as a growth nutrients feng et al 2020a b according to borggaard gimsing 2008 microorganisms continue the breakdown of glycine while formaldehyde passes through a controlled route of carbon transfers that results in the production of co2 and nh4 afterwards the finished products are benign to the surrounding ecosystem this whole process of conversion of gly to sarcosine is highly dependent on the supply of phosphorus in another pathway the enzyme glyphosate oxidoreductase gox decomposing glyphosate into two metabolites through c n cleavage hove jensen et al 2014 glyoxylate which is oxidized in its entirety in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to create carbon dioxide and ampa which is digested by c p lyase into methylamine as well as phosphate the latter metabolite is used in the tetrahydrofolate thfa cycle where it is decomposed into formaldehyde and ammonia ampa is transformed to phosphonoformaldehyde and subsequently phosphonatase converts it to formaldehyde and phosphate which are then injected into the thfa pathway a v sviridov et al 2014 most research has shown that gly can be broken down into phosphorus through the two pathways mentioned above few studies however have shown the use of gly as a carbon or nitrogen resource a obojska et al 1999 pipket and amrheint 1988 also ampa has a slower rate of biodegradation when compared to sarcosine therefore future research should concentrate on improving the ability of microbes to degrade ampa and or finding novel microbes that are capable of concurrently and efficiently degrading gly and ampa another pathway for gly breakdown was discovered in achromobacter sp kg16 this process employed gly as a major source of phosphorus through acetylation phenomenon to synthesize acetylglyphosate a v sviridov et al 2014 there is still a lack of understanding regarding the biological function of this route in addition achromobacter sp kg16 is unable to use acetylglyphosate as an adequate source of phosphorus which contributes to the organism s substandard rate of development feng et al 2020a b the utilization of diverse bacteria for the microbial breakdown of gly has been documented by a number of studies for instance ochrobactrum intermedium sq20 achromobacter sp pseudomonas sp and comamonas odontotermitis p2 have all been used in a variety of conditions to study the breakdown of gly and its metabolites in contaminated niches via enrichment approach ermakova et al 2017 firdous et al 2018 2020 manogaran et al 2017 also gly may be used as a food source by some bacteria including pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp alcaligenes sp and geobacillus caldoxylosilyticus lerbs et al 1990 obojska et al 2002 moore et al 1983 pipke and amrhein 1988 more examples of bacteria utilized for gly breakdown are reported in table 7 furthermore the bacteria and their respective pathways for gly breakdown have been investigated and reported in the literature for example pseudomonas sp pg2982 uses c p lyase to decompose gly producing sarcosine that is then reduced by enzymes to formaldehyde and glycine kishore and jacob 1987 in the same line protein synthesis in arthrobacter sp glp 1 was facilitated by glycine which promoted the synthesis of serine and threonine as well as the peptide backbone isotope labeling has been used to provide a significant assessment of the fate of gly metabolites pipke and amrhein 1988 molecular and biochemical studies using escherichia coli have shown that the concentration of inorganic phosphorus influences the c p lyase and ultimately the whole metabolism of gly in the presence of the bacteria hove jensen et al 2010 santos beneit 2015 ochrobactrum anthropi gpk 3 pseudomonas sp lbr and bacillus cereus cb4 are bacterial isolates that may break down gly into ampa very effectively according to a few studies alexey v sviridov et al 2012 fan et al 2012 jacob et al 1988 also sequence analysis of genes for c p lyase and gly oxidoreductase in comamonas odontotermitis p2 further confirmed that these two processes operated in parallel inside the organism duke 2011 in order to evaluate the efficacy of microbes in degrading gly it is required to optimize the culture parameters these factors include the temperature of the culture the starting ph the concentration of the gly the inoculation biomass and the incubation the typical culture media are at temperature range of 25 and 37 c a ph between 6 and 7 5 and an aerobic medium depending on the kind of microbe being cultivated feng et al 2020a b zhan et al 2018 in spite of the potential shown by bacteria for the degradation of gly and other remediation activities there is still room for development so far pure cultures have been used to grow the bacteria and test the degradation of gly the use of mixed culture could be explored to improve the efficiency of the bacteria for gly removal also most studies have been done on a laboratory scale there is encouraging evidence that biological treatment can be utilized to effectively remediate wastewater and the ecosystem containing gly the data necessary to implement this method on a large scale is presently scarce determining the precise paths of gly biodegradation will need more research into the structures of the metabolites and biochemical changes in gly biodegradation as well as procedures for specialty chemicals or isolation of these metabolites and enzymes feng et al 2020a b furthermore studying the kinetics of microbial degradation is significant since it might provide valuable information for the development of processes finally biological treatment in conjunction with some other treatment methods is necessary for efficient degradation of not just gly but also its metabolites 4 2 2 2 fungal degradation of glyphosates the potential of various fungi for the degradation of gly and the provision of a source of carbon nitrogen or phosphorus have been explored in the literature with the major fungal genera reported including aspergillus fusarium penicillium and trichoderma castrejón godínez et al 2021 fu et al 2017 reported the degradation of gly using aspergillus oryzae a f02 interestingly glycine and sarcosine were not present in the fermentation liquid of a oryzae a f02 although ampa was present the breakdown process showed that gly led to the formation of ampa and that ampa ultimately led to the formation of methylamine in the end new substances were created through further methylamine degradation it was determined that the pace at which gly is degraded by a oryzae a f02 is largely dependent on the extent to which gly is degraded to ampa in another study carranza et al 2019 evaluate two non toxigenic aspergillus oryzae strains in vitro gly degradation a oryzae am1 and am2 absorbed phosphate and nitrogen from gly with 1 and1 5 mm gly degradation percentages were over 50 after 15 days furthermore am1 removed 57 of 10 mm gly also a oryzae am1 s gly tolerance permanence and competitiveness with native mycota were investigated a oryzae count remained stable during incubation and was unaffected by gly concentrations this strain was able to remove gly in vitro and in gly contaminated soil microcosms swe et al 2020 investigated the capability of fungi recovered from gly contaminated soil 10 different fungus strain were tested for tolerance level and laccase activity results showed that trichoderma harzianum and aspergillus aiger showed laccase activity and rapidly removed gly from mineral salt liquid media and in water under laboratory test kulikova et al 2020 assessed the impact of gly decomposition using fungi after 14 days only 5 7 of the introduced herbicide was detected when gly was applied at the approved levels 5 10 mg kg the data show that gly was mostly broken down by c p bond breaking and the formation of phosphates and they also imply that the nitrogen fixation process may have been inhibited njoku et al 2020 reported the gly degradation capabilities of selected fungi species in the contaminated soil because of the occurrence of ampa the investigation verified that the gly degradation mechanism was through glyphosate oxidoreductase gox with the exception of aspergillus fumigatus fjat 31052 the studies on the potential of fungi for gly removal are further reported in table 7 based on the studies the gly degradation potential of the various fungal genera is ranked thus fusarium penicillium trichoderma aspergillus even with the research reported so far the use of fungi as gly degraders is still in the preliminary phase hence there is still room for improvement in the understanding of the respective metabolic processes involved in gly degradation and extend the application of other fungal strains the use of transcriptomic approaches is touted as a viable method to consider njoku et al 2020 4 2 2 3 algae degradation of glyphosates the algal potential for glyphosate removal is still in the preliminary stage based on the literature search the only algae species capable of degrading gly is oscillatoria limnetica salman and abdul adel 2015 investigated the use of oscillatoria limnetica in bioremediation of gly under laboratory conditions variation in the gly breakdown efficiency of this species was recorded as it was exposed to varying amounts 5 20 mg l of gly ranging from 38 to 85 due to the paucity of research on algae s potential for gly breakdown there is still opportunity for growth and advancement of research based on these assessments this is corroborated by the favorable characteristics of algae which include 1 selectivity to pollutants 2 algae s fast cell cycle 3 perceived cost effectiveness 4 intense exposure in a short period few hours 5 the reaction of toxicants can be evaluated quickly and 6 feasibility of predicting the features of succeeding generations castrejón godínez et al 2021 in all to address the environmental problems impacted by the use of gly there need to develop novel study such as algae species with a high capability for gly breakdown which can aid in restoring a healthy ecosystem 4 2 3 advanced oxidation processes for glyphosates treatment advanced oxidation processes aops are a potential way for removing gly from aqueous environment they operate at or around atmospheric conditions to produce sufficiently powerful oxidizing agents causing breakdown of organic and inorganic compounds which might be inimical to the ecosystem espinoza montero et al 2020 the hydroxyl radical is particularly important in aops because of its relatively high standard potential in acidic conditions this radical is capable of oxidizing and breaking down organic materials until it is completely converted into carbon dioxide water and the related inorganic salt wang and xu 2011 for instance the hydroxyl radical breaks down gly resulting in the formation of either intermediates like ampa and sarcosine or final breakdown products like co2 no3 nh4 po4 3 etc reaction 3 these processes compile a wide variety of methods that rely on the generation of strong oxidants to break down and eliminate gly from aqueous media including photodegradation the fenton procedures oxidative degradation with uv light and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photoelectrocatalytic methods andreozzi et al 1999 wang and xu 2011 the potential routes of gly oxidation under various aops are summarized in fig 9 3 c3h8no5p oh co2 h2o no3 nh4 po4 3 prominent methods of gly removal based on aop are discussed and compared extensively in the subsections below 4 2 3 1 photolysis assisted methods a common method of gly removal from water is the ultraviolet based uv based treatment in which photolysis of water produces hydroxyl radicals which attack the gly molecules present in the water system a similar method to this includes the use of catalyst to facilitate the process of gly removal namely photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysts like titanium dioxide tio2 are frequently employed to get rid of gly because they are stable harmless to living species and are not too expensive feng et al 2020a b combining hydrogen peroxide with uv light manassero et al 2010 lowered the gly levels in water it was reported that the gly conversion accelerated at ph 3 7 furthermore a degradation route was proposed in which oxidant species can cleave the c p link to generate phosphate and subsequently glycine with the final products being formic acid ammonium nitrate formaldehyde and phosphate ions without ampa and sarcosine as intermediate products assalin et al 2010 confirmed the presence of a tio2 photocatalysis efficiently removed gly and its breakdown mediators 92 of total organic carbon was removed from an acid gly solution ph 10 after being treated for 30 min at an initial concentration of 0 25 mmoll 1 and of 6 0 g l 1 of tio2 s chen liu 2007 were able to degrade 92 of gly after 3 5 h of irradiation 4 2 3 2 electrochemical oxidation methods electrochemical oxidation provides enough anodic energy that causes organic materials to be degraded to complete mineralization or even less complicated biodegradable compounds this process can either occur in two scenarios including direct or indirect anodic oxidation processes for the treatment of organic contaminants the direct anodic oxidation process is a relatively inefficient way to decontaminate pollutants while indirect anodic oxidation process brings about partial or full detoxification espinoza montero et al 2020 when compared to other aops electrochemical oxidation is a relatively clean technology for degrading gly effectively it has remarkable energy efficiency without the use of harmful chemicals very few studies have explored the potential of electrochemical oxidation in degrading gly lan et al 2013 reported the electrochemically aided mno2 oxidation electro mno2 ability to remove gly using ruo2 tio2 coated titanium mesh significantly improved gly elimination also the vast majority of free mn2 ions were transformed to mno2 which further improved gly removal during the electro mno2 procedure gly removal was unaffected by the solution s ph glycine sarcosine and phosphate were among the first important reactive products discovered in the routes leading to gly breakdown finally nitrogen contained species were oxidized to no3 n acetic acid and nh3 n whereas glycolic acid and oxamic acid were formed from glycine in another investigation neto de andrade 2009 examined the electrochemical oxidation of the gly on iro2 and ruo2 electrodes it was found that low ph levels encourage gly oxidation also gly was completely removed from the electrolyzed solution and a nearly complete mineralization phosphate ion release 91 of the studied oxide materials while this method has many potential advantages it also has several problems including the expensive cost of electrodes corrosion the likelihood of poor effluent conductivity electrode fouling and the creation of compounds that affect water ecosystems or human health espinoza montero et al 2020 4 2 3 3 fenton methods the fenton method has been studied as a potential method for purifying water and sewage the iron fe2 ion functions as a catalyst in this process converting the hydroxyl oh radicals in hydrogen peroxide deng and zhao 2015 a few hybrid systems depending on the photo fenton system and the electro fenton system have already been created to increase the degrading efficiency of the process to increase the production of oh from the photodegradation of h2o2 and the uv induced conversion of fe3 to fe2 the photo fenton reaction incorporates ultraviolet uv or visible light irradiation into the traditional fenton system in a similar line electro fenton technology allows for the electrochemical generation of h2o2 fe2 or both wang and xu 2011 numerous reports have shown the efficacy of this strategy for gly breakdown and elimination for instance under laboratory condition de souza et al 2013 evaluated the efficacy of the photo fenton method in degrading gly in water and wastewater treatment using h2o2 oxalate and equimolar concentration of fe2 and fe3 after 60 min of the photo fenton process the concentration of gly had dropped to below detection with the ultimate breakdown product being 0 385 mmoll 1 phosphate ion also it was found that a reduction in gly content reduced effluent toxicity by 54 to remove gly from wastewater activated carbon fiber cathode was designed and used in an electro fenton ef reactor lan et al 2016 results showed that all traces of gly had been removed furthermore total organic carbon toc removal was 50 4 and chemical organic demand cod removal was 72 0 fast fe2 ion retrieval and regeneration at the cathode as well as very efficient hydroxyl radical production are likely major contributors to the process s remarkable efficiency so far the fenton method has not gotten a wide attention and application due to the fact that an acidic environment for the method to be effective table 8 however real water cannot be maintained at acidic ph which is inimical to the natural ecosystem also there is need to utilize more fe2 and fe3 ions for higher degradation efficiency of the system the recycling and reuse of the iron ions pose a major challenge concerning the adoption of this method 4 2 3 4 ozonation oxidation method ozone oxidation is one of the most efficient aops for treating wastewater containing gly in the shortest amount of time at the lowest possible concentration the chemistry of ozonation involves the breakdown of ozone in solution through the influence of hydroxyl ion to form oh radicals h2o2 is added to the reaction system to stimulate the breakdown of ozone and aid production of oh radicals hoigné 1998 also the ozonation efficiency can be enhanced by the increasing the ph of the system which stimulates steady generation of oh radicals assalin et al 2010 ozonation for gly removal can occur by either direct oxidation by ozone or indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals which then attack and decompose gly andreozzi et al 1999 the oxidation process via ozonation has resulted in the complete breakdown of gly which has been confirmed by various studies assalin et al 2010 using o3 and h2o2 together gly removal was achieved at a high efficiency 99 and ampa with a high percentage 85 in a very short amount of time jönsson et al 2013 even with the superior performance of this method it still faces certain limitations including high cost requirements solubility challenge for ozone in water waste management issue and unstable nature of ozone finally several studies are reporting the combination of two or more methods as hybrid systems to increase the degradation efficiency of glyphosates espinoza montero et al 2020 utilizing aops with adsorption together xing et al 2018 claimed that a complete glyphosate degradation could be accomplished for gly effluent by employing a catalytic wet oxidation process with modified activated carbon as the catalyst these hybrid processes are beneficial because they decompose gly and several of its intermediate products even though the afore mentioned methods have shown promise in treating wastewater containing gly in laboratory settings bringing them to an industrial scale would need more research the cost of these technologies is still a bottleneck to reduce the financial investment in this method it is recommended that it could be used after an initial step or route that reduces gly concentration 4 2 4 comparison of various advanced oxidation processes the right selection of the aop for gly treatment depends majorly on several factors such as the concentration of gly present in the medium of interest energy demand reaction set up environmental impact cost requirements availability of other resources among others in terms of cost requirement the expenses incurred in demonstrating each aop varies widely for instance the cost implication for ozonation oxidation method is high due to the advanced instrumentation requirement for the oxidation of ozone in water also the cost of heterogenous catalysts like titanium dioxide required for the photolysis and photochemical oxidation mechanisms could be higher feng et al 2020a b for energy demand the electrochemical oxidation method requires high electric current for anodic energy to convert gly to less toxic or biodegradable forms however fenton method may be executed using iron and other reagent in a laboratory environment to treat gly effectively furthermore the impact of these methods on the environment varies significantly too while electrochemical oxidation method has far less significant environmental impact because of the absence of toxic by products after the reaction process ozonation method could pose a threat on the ecosystem due to the generation of toxic by products in the same line the use of tio2 during photolysis could lead to the production of nanoparticles which could be inimical to the environment therefore the choice of the appropriate aop must rely on a meticulous consideration of the prevailing factors discussed above table 8 provides a summary of the details advantages disadvantages and comparison of the several methods for gly treatment 5 conclusions and perspectives due to effectiveness in controlling weed growth glyphosate has become one of the most widespread herbicides in the world the dangers of glyphosate accumulation and widespread exposure to individuals and the environment have however been shown in a significant number of studies this has prompted a plethora of investigations aimed at identifying and eliminating glyphosate from the global terrestrial and marine ecosystems this review contains an extensive discussion on the ecotoxicological effects of glyphosate on terrestrial marine and human organisms also several sensing and detecting techniques for detecting and quantifying glyphosates were also examined at length in the same line the methods for degrading and eliminating glyphosates from the environment were also compared and contrasted with the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment strategy being emphasized the toxicity of glyphosate on ecological systems is very high alterations in biochemical and metabolic processes induction of oxidative stress suppression of the immune system damage to the liver and kidneys in fish induction of genetic toxicity modifications to dna and impairments to mitochondria increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in humans decreased physiological efficiency massive disruption of the soil microbiota exposing plants to certain pathogens are just some of the negative effects of this herbicide on plant aquatic and human life these problems have prompted the use of detecting techniques for estimating the concentrations of herbicides in the natural environment electrochemical sensors colorimetric approaches spectroscopic methods and chromatographic procedures are all examined as viable means of glyphosate detection when comparing several methods for detecting parent and intermediate molecules chromatography is often considered to be among the most sensitive and selective adsorption biological methods using bacteria algae and fungi and advanced oxidation processes like photocatalytic oxidation electrochemical oxidation ozone oxidation fenton methods and hybrid process have all been proposed as treatment strategies for degrading and removing glyphosates to enable a sustainable ecosystem the most effective strategy for glyphosate breakdown and removal is a hybrid procedure that combines advanced oxidation processes with a biological approach however there are still significant limits and challenges to overcome in the identification and removal of glyphosates for environmental cleanup for example most sensing and treatment technologies are currently only being tested on a small scale in the lab therefore it is necessary to create a framework and procedures for taking the testing to an industrial level to address environmental issues and fulfill bioremediation needs on a worldwide scale it is necessary to assess and analyze the direct cost societal cost and energy cost implications of scaling up these technologies finally a substantial amount of study into glyphosate s oxidation processes and biodegradation pathways is still necessary better sensing and detection methods will also be required for precise determination of intermediate products enzymes and metabolites when these are achieved the promise of a sustainable ecosystem can be realized declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
