18840,reducing pathogenic risks in surface waters impacted by leaking or overflowing sewage requires the ability to detect human excreta in raw sewage discriminate human excreta from other types of animal excreta and differentiate between treated wastewater and raw sewage we used the relative concentrations of a degradable human specific pharmaceutical and a persistent artificial sweetener to indicate the presence of human excreta its degree of environmental degradation and the amount of dilution by freshwater sources samples were collected and analyzed for acetaminophen and sucralose between 2016 and 2018 from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and streams in metropolitan lexington kentucky usa both co analytes were consistently present in raw sewage with acetaminophen in higher concentrations than sucralose the presence of acetaminophen was related primarily to untreated human excreta with concentrations rapidly decreasing upon treatment to nearly undetectable levels in wwtp effluents and streams sucralose in surface waters was related to inputs of both raw sewage and wwtp effluents the ratio of acetaminophen to sucralose concentrations in raw sewage and spiked river waters exhibited linear decay kinetics with respect to time with larger decay constants observed at higher temperatures this co analyte indicator approach was evaluated at a local site previously suspected of receiving raw sewage the presence and ratios of the co analytes indicated the presence of domestic sewage that was not fully treated graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater fecal source tracking pharmaceuticals sweeteners co analytes pathogen indicators 1 introduction surface waters are susceptible to a variety of point and non point source excreta pollution in urban watersheds sanitary sewers release human associated pathogens and chemicals by leakage and overflows of untreated sewage and by discharge of effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps water contamination by human excreta poses significant health risks due to the presence of human adapted pathogens especially enteric viruses treated effluent still carries pathogenic risks but at a lesser scale and must be distinguished from untreated excrement sources to appropriately define risks the world health organization estimates one to four million cases of cholera and 20 to 40 thousand deaths occur due to contamination of drinking water annually who 2016 while more prevalent in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure exposure to freshwaters contaminated with human excreta can still pose risks to drinking water sources and recreational use of waterways in developed regions therefore fecal source identification of human excreta is critical for effective control of waterborne diseases and preservation of public health black et al 2007 glassmeyer et al 2005 murugan et al 2012 approaches for indicating the presence of human excreta and the potential for pathogenic risk include direct methods such as analyses of dna from microorganisms of interest he et al 2015 and utilizing non pathogenic indicator bacteria or their genes and chemical proxies potera 2012 wood et al 2000 each approach has varying cost and analytical limitations biological methods may require time to culture bacteria specialized reagents and advanced laboratory equipment and techniques biological methods are also limited by sharing of gut organisms between humans and other animals coupled with the potential for growth and variable decay in the environment glassmeyer et al 2005 emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and artificial sweeteners have been demonstrated as reliable indicators of the presence of human excreta raw or treated in surface water and groundwater buerge et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2011 potera 2012 robertson et al 2013 tran et al 2014 doummar and aoun 2018 mccance et al 2018 while the search for an ideal indicator or combination of indicators is ongoing the use of multiple indicators with varying persistence properties has shown promise especially if one indicator can serve as a baseline or benchmark against which to measure the presence and concentration of others black et al 2007 mclachlan et al 2017 the ability to estimate the age of human excreta if combined with knowledge of stream flow and other watershed characteristics could aid in targeting the freshest most potentially pathogenic sites of pollution for remediation tran et al 2014 suggested that co occurrence of conservative and non conservative indicators could identify recent introductions of untreated sewage mclachlan et al 2017 introduced the use of benchmarking to better model the degradation of chemicals in laboratory and field studies providing a way to estimate the degradation half life the benchmarking approach may be applicable in urban waters to not only indicate the presence of human excreta but to estimate the age by selecting two human sourced chemicals one that persists and one that degrades sucralose is a persistent artificial sweetener identified as an indicator of human excreta in the environment oppenheimer et al 2011 wood et al 2000 in 2003 300 tons of sucralose were produced in europe and america for worldwide consumption commonly in soft drinks bahndorf and kienle 2004 by 2012 25 of children and 41 of adults in the usa were consuming foods containing low calorie sweeteners including sucralose sylvetsky et al 2017 because 90 of sucralose is excreted from the human body unchanged and it is recalcitrant to degradation by wastewater treatment and environmental processes sucralose is increasingly found in surface waters that receive human excreta oppenheimer et al 2011 researchers in switzerland have detected sucralose in wastewaters groundwaters surface waters and tap waters buerge et al 2009 additional work has demonstrated concentrations in non receiving surface waters between 47 0 and 81 0 ppt ng l mawhinney et al 2011 with wastewater influent values as high as 69 7 ppb μg l tambosi et al 2010 the demonstrated measurable values and environmental persistence makes sucralose an ideal chemical marker for sewage and a possible analyte for source apportionment upon dilution by natural waters however recalcitrance to decay does not allow for sucralose to distinguish between fresh human excreta and treated effluent in freshwaters that requires an additional co analyte that degrades in the environment is also human source linked is similarly widespread and can be extracted and analyzed by the same processes as sucralose acetaminophen present in at least 235 prescription and over the counter medications blough and wu 2011 may be such a co analyte globally 137 900 metric tons were estimated to have been consumed in 2014 with 86 of production used for pharmaceuticals and north america accounting for 40 of market share market research store 2016 acetaminophen is also used to a minor extent in manufacturing of azo dyes and photographic chemicals national center for biotechnology information 2019 as acetaminophen is toxic to many animals it is not frequently used as a veterinary analgesic so its presence is strongly linked to human usage acetaminophen is extensively metabolized in the body with only 2 5 of the therapeutic dose excreted unchanged in urine within 24 h cummings et al 1967 however conjugated forms of excreted acetaminophen can be expected to undergo rapid deconjugation due to the presence of extra cellular enzymes especially β glucuronidase in sewage and experience degradation baronti et al 2000 influent acetaminophen concentrations as high as 182 8 ppb tran et al 2014 have been reported within urban sewersheds wastewater treatment is effective in removing acetaminophen as indicated by negligible concentrations in effluent tambosi et al 2010 and by ozone oxidation removals from simulated drinking water treatment westerhoff et al 2005 acetaminophen biodegradation in the environment has been reported li et al 2014 schaider et al 2017 although its presence as a synthetic compound in the environment has been extensively documented because of degradation without regular reintroduction from fresh human excreta acetaminophen should occur in natural waters at concentrations well below those in both untreated sewage and wwtp effluent unless dilution is minimal in this study we describe the use of the acetaminophen sucralose ratio ace suc for pinpointing the presence of human excreta carried in sewage identifying the degree of conventional treatment the sewage has undergone and estimating the degree of dilution and degradation of sewage releases into the environment we determined the concentrations of these co analytes across the treatment processes of two wwtps conducted laboratory decay kinetic experiments at different temperatures in varying microbial densities determined background values in local surface waters and analyzed these indicators in water samples near a suspected sewage leak the ace suc ratio allowed for identification of the fresh sewage signal across potential sources and provided discrimination of time in the environment the development of a more complete understanding of acetaminophen degradation under various environmental scenarios allowed for the ace suc ratio to provide information on the age of untreated sewage in receiving waters while the absolute concentrations of sucralose could estimate the degree of dilution with less contaminated waters the approach presented should be useful for municipalities seeking to characterize different signals for human excreta in their watersheds to optimize remediation of aging sewer infrastructure 2 methods 2 1 sampling three rounds of samples were collected from the west hickman and town branch wwtps in lexington kentucky usa during the spring summer and winter of 2016 2017 each wwtp handles a similar volume of sanitary sewage 154 and 136 million liters per day from estimated populations of 167 992 and 163 673 respectively dustin baker lfucg gis developer personal communication february 2 2018 population was estimated by taking the average household size from the 2010 census data and multiplying it by the number of residential units in each sewershed land use is predominantly suburban in the west hickman sewershed and urban in the town branch sewershed treatment processes at the wwtps are comparable but west hickman includes an additional pre sedimentation basin for grit removal prior to sampling 1 l and 250 ml polypropylene bottles were washed and dried and sodium thiosulfate was added to each 0 08 g for 1 l bottles or 0 02 g for 250 ml bottles to consume residual chlorine bottles were then autoclaved for 30 min one liter grab samples were taken in the prepared polypropylene bottles after primary screening influent after secondary clarification post activated sludge clarification tank effluent and after chlorination effluent duplicates and spikes were taken from the influent at town branch on february 7 2017 and from west hickman effluent on february 10 2017 eleven 250 ml stream samples were taken along a 1 km reach of a stream cane run in the vicinity of a suspected sanitary sewer leak from an older suburban neighborhood in north lexington in july 2018 fig s1 sampling occurred upstream downstream along a tributary in the vicinity of the suspected leak and at the confluence of the tributary with cane run another 34 samples were taken from streams in well sewered areas in lexington in 2017 and 2018 for comparison with concentrations found at the wwtps fig s1 these samples were taken at different times frozen and analyzed without loss of signal 2 2 kinetic degradation experiments four treatments were prepared across 17 samples using influent spiked surface water from a local spring mcconnell springs and spiked deionized water in autoclaved beakers to establish decay kinetics by microbial degradation of acetaminophen and sucralose surface water and deionized control samples were spiked with 1000 ppb μg l of acetaminophen and 500 ppb of sucralose to provide a 2 1 ratio of the co analytes and a large range across which to measure acetaminophen degradation sewage samples were not spiked as they contained measurable amounts of both co analytes five 500 ml replicate samples of influent and three 500 ml replicate samples of spiked surface water were kept at 4 c and continuously stirred while equivalent numbers of 500 ml influent and spiked surface water samples were kept at 21 c with continuous stirring all were sequestered from light to isolate microbial degradation processes from photodegradation additionally one 500 ml sample of surface water was autoclaved prior to spiking and maintained at 21 c in the absence of light to establish a negative control for biological activity each bottle with its sample solution was agitated on a shaker table for the entire experiment a 10 ml aliquot of each sample was taken every 12 h up to a maximum duration of 168 h for surface water at 4 c to establish the stability of the analytes upon storage three 10 ml samples of deionized water were spiked and stored under various conditions one sample was frozen one maintained in the dark at 4 c and the third kept at room temperature in direct sunlight for 10 days as a quality control check 10 samples across the treatments were spiked and checked for percent recovery throughout the entire extraction and analysis procedures 2 3 extraction preparation and analysis simultaneous extraction and preparation of both analytes from water samples were based on established methods loos et al 2009 with modifications for this study ten milliliter aliquots from kinetic degradation samples and various volumes for all remaining samples were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges strata x 6 ml 200 mg phenomenex deuterated internal standards of acetaminophen d 4 200 ppb and sucralose d 6 400 ppb were added to the samples prior to extraction for quantification cartridges were activated and conditioned with 5 ml each of water and methanol at a flow rate of 5 ml min prior to sample introduction all samples were passed through the wet cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min cartridges were then rinsed with 2 ml of water at 3 ml min and dried for 20 min at increasing levels of suction under vacuum analytes were eluted from the cartridge with 5 ml of methanol at 2 ml min then evaporated to dryness before being reconstituted to a 1 ml volume with a 90 10 water methanol solution liquid chromatography lc separation was performed at the environmental research training laboratories ertl university of kentucky with dual varian prostar 210 pumps using gradient chromatography on a phenomenex gemini c 18 column 150 2 0 mm 5 μm with a 10 μl injection volume the mobile phase consisted of h2o and methanol each with 0 1 formic acid an electrospray ionization chamber operated in positive mode for acetaminophen and negative mode for sucralose interfaced to a varian 1200 l mass spectrometer ms operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to identify the compounds of interest sequentially from a single extract prior to the start of sample analysis the ms conditions were optimized by infusion of standards to provide the best sensitivity and selectivity for each analyte and internal standard each batch of samples was run with accompanying quality control samples blanks lab water spikes sample matrix spikes duplicates and replicates which were extracted and analyzed as field unknowns throughout the study to determine the recovery accuracy and precision of the analytical procedures followed recovery from nine different lab water spikes averaged 93 recovery for acetaminophen and 92 recovery for sucralose while 25 matrix spikes averaged 91 recovery for acetaminophen and 92 recovery for sucralose ten different duplicate samples were analyzed and averaged 4 relative difference for acetaminophen and 6 relative difference for sucralose in addition there was good reproducibility for all eight replicates in the kinetic studies sample concentrations were established using calibration curves of deuterated internal standards detection limits were set based on the bounds of calibration standards where the instrument response was linear reportable limits were set to one order of magnitude larger than the detection limits and varied with the initial sample volumes that were extracted bottle blanks were extracted with each batch of samples collected and analyzed all blanks were less than the reporting limit 3 results 3 1 presence of acetaminophen and sucralose in wastewaters both acetaminophen and sucralose were consistently found in wwtp influents with acetaminophen concentrations twice as great as those found for sucralose table 1 and fig 1 a average acetaminophen concentrations in town branch and west hickman wwtp influents were 78 8 22 1 and 122 4 37 5 ppb respectively while the difference in acetaminophen values had overlapping distributions the differences in average concentrations at the inlets of the wwtps was significant by t test p 0 001 the variance in average concentration may be linked to differences in the sewershed collection areas and differences in dosing the town branch wwtp collects sewage from a more urbanized area with five hospitals sports stadia an airport and the university of kentucky the west hickman sewershed is comprised of suburban sprawl neighborhoods and shopping centers the variability recorded may be due to more variable therapeutic dosing in the suburbs combined with differences in sewer travel time that impacts deconjugation and degradation in sewers resulting in higher and more variable concentrations in west hickman influents acetaminophen concentrations from the clarification tank effluents and chlorinated final effluents were near or below detection limits at both plants denoting significant degradation of acetaminophen through the treatment processes of the 41 samples taken after activated sludge treatment only four had acetaminophen values greater than the reportable detection limit of 0 1 ppb values 0 1 ppb were not included in calculating the average in contrast sucralose concentrations did not vary across treatment but stayed constant and were statistically indistinguishable across processes and between treatment plants sucralose concentrations in influent averaged 40 2 25 6 ppb at town branch and 48 0 13 7 ppb at west hickman wwtp the unitless average of the ace suc ratio in influent was 2 5 for both wwtps the average ace suc ratios at each wwtp were not statistically different by t test p 0 72 and were thus combined for further statistical analysis the overall average ace suc ratio in untreated influent for all 26 samples from both wwtps was 2 6 0 7 for the 4 of 41 effluent samples 2 at each wwtp that had reportable amounts of acetaminophen the average ace suc value was 0 009 with a range in values from 0 0004 to 0 024 3 2 degradation kinetics of co analyte concentration ratios acetaminophen and sucralose spiked into sterile deionized water showed little degradation after 10 days with ace suc maintained at initial spike values of 2 5 for all treatments 20 c 4 c and 21 c sucralose concentrations varied little with concentrations within 5 ppb of the initial measurement across replicate experiments degradation of spiked acetaminophen and sucralose also did not occur over 96 h at benchtop temperatures 21 c in autoclaved surface water the ratio stayed constant at 2 7 however when the water matrix was not sterile and aerobic microbial activity was possible ace suc decreased over time with warmer temperatures associated with greater decay of acetaminophen and larger decreases in the ratio decay experiments at 4 c showed an average decrease in ace suc ratios of 0 46 0 7 n 5 and 0 10 0 02 n 3 for influent and surface water respectively fig 2 ratios dropped faster at 21 c with influent ace suc decreasing from 2 75 0 02 to below detection limits bdl after 48 h and surface water ace suc decreasing from 2 43 0 07 to bdl after 96 h maximum measured decay of acetaminophen was 91 ppb over a 72 h period spiked surface water at 21 c all observed decay was attributed to microbial activity as light was excluded from the experimental setup a linear least squares regression model for the 4 c data fits well for influent with a degradation rate of 0 005 per hour and r2 0 99 fig 2a but not as well for surface water with a rate of 0 0009 per hour and r2 0 31 fig 2b the latter fit is greatly improved by the removal of the 24 h data point a statistical outlier resulting from experimental lag time resulting in a degradation rate of 0 0006 per hour with r2 0 60 the lower degradation rate in surface waters was expected as the microbial activity and density were less than in influent at 21 c degradation of acetaminophen occurs much more quickly with ace suc ratios reduced to less than 1 after 48 h linear least squares regression yields maximum degradation rates of 0 05 per hour for influent r2 0 92 fig 2a and 0 036 per hour for stream water r2 0 95 fig 2b at 21 c 3 3 co analyte presence in surface waters of the 34 surface water samples collected from local streams 28 had acetaminophen concentrations above detection limits calculated with respect to the sample volume extracted so the ace suc ratio could be calculated sucralose was detected in all samples although in very low concentrations compared to levels found in wwtp influent or effluent across all surface water samples ace suc ratios ranged from bdl acetaminophen was below reportable limits to 0 7 with an average of 0 2 from samples where a ratio could be calculated from values above detection all samples had ratios far below those observed in wwtp influent the area selected for more detailed sampling drains a neighborhood that originally was developed with septic systems but is now served by sanitary sewers flow along the 100 m long by 0 3 m wide tributary is maintained by spring discharge emerging along a hillslope forming the head of a wooded draw originating in the subdivision the ungauged tributary flows southeast to a confluence with cane run an ephemeral stream that loses water to the underlying karst aquifer principal land use along the tributary and sampled reach of cane run is woodland and greenspace within a municipal park prior work at this site g m brion 2005 unpublished data detected male specific bacteriophage a human fecal indicator and inferred low fecal age from ratios of atypical to typical total coliform ac tc concentrations black et al 2007 however because of the extended time required for the ac tc ratio to change the previously measured indicators could not distinguish between untreated sewage and treated effluent sample sites fig s1 were classified as upstream cane run n 2 suspect tributary n 2 confluence n 3 and downstream cane run n 4 the flow of cane run during sampling was elevated compared to the previous week 0 02 vs 0 01 m3 s usgs 2018 due to precipitation on the day prior to sampling and was much greater than that noted in the tributary all samples from the tributary and cane run had detectable acetaminophen and sucralose concentrations acetaminophen concentrations fell from an average of 0 57 ppb along the suspect tributary to 0 07 0 08 ppb along cane run fig 3 a the tributary acetaminophen concentrations appear to be different from those found at the other sites along cane run but with only 2 samples taken at the tributary statistical findings are limited sucralose concentrations were similar regardless of sampling location and were 100 orders of magnitude lower than in wwtp influent 40 48 ppb averaged ace suc ratio values ranged from upstream at the confluence to 0 14 downstream consistent with the range of background values found in other surface waters fig 3b the elevated ace suc ratio along the tributary indicates the presence of untreated human excreta that has undergone some microbial decay as it is not above a value of 2 as was seen for influent sewage the detection of acetaminophen indicates that decay is less than would be found after activated sludge treatment given that acetaminophen was bdl in 37 of 41 wwtp effluent samples 4 discussion to be effective indicators of pathogens associated with human feces analytes must be closely linked with human excreta and should be able to pinpoint fresh fecal materials from those that have undergone treatment both acetaminophen and sucralose are strongly linked to human sources neither occurs naturally in the environment or is administered regularly to livestock hof 2000 within the wwtps and the urban watershed sucralose was commonly detectable and concentrations within influent and surface waters were within the range reported by mawhinney et al 2011 for surface water 0 047 2 90 ppb wastewater effluent and influent concentrations were not significantly different indicating that sucralose was not effectively removed at either wwtp sampled and therefore could only be linked with human excreta presence not fecal age our findings of artificial sweetener presence and persistence are consistent with other studies of raw and treated sewage buerge et al 2009 robertson et al 2013 and septage robertson et al 2013 sucralose was present in the urban environment persistent and provided a benchmark against which to measure the degradation of acetaminophen as well as indication of dilution of the sewage signal the ace suc ratio in the kinetic experiments provided well fit linear decay models under varying temperatures and in different water matrices relating the decrease of the ratio with an increase in time under microbial degradation the time for a 50 reduction in the ace suc ratio for influent at 21 c lab experiment is estimated to be 28 h dropping the ratio from an average of 2 6 to 1 3 however in the wwtp the ratio drops to levels far below 1 0 3 in west hickman wwtp effluent indicating that the activated sludge process with dense microbial densities and enhanced aeration is capable of greater decay rates than found in the kinetic experiments however the kinetic experiments do model the conditions that one would expect to see in the environment from a spill and while more research is required the behavior of the ace suc ratio appears to be linear in the range studied and able to provide estimates of the age of influent carrying human excreta acetaminophen concentrations in wwtp influent were greater than for sucralose which is consistent with the reported amounts of the two compounds manufactured for use and much greater than concentrations found in local surface water samples influent wwtp acetaminophen concentrations 50 3 200 0 ppb fell within the range of median values reported by tran et al 2014 for influents 15 2 337 0 ppb and fell to near non detectable levels in effluent due to microbial degradation and chemical oxidation westerhoff et al 2005 provided by treatment therefore very low concentrations of acetaminophen would be expected in waters that carry well treated effluent or are unpolluted by human excreta however ace suc ratio values 1 no matter how low the acetaminophen or sucralose concentrations or if dilution with uncontaminated water has occurred are suggestive of untreated or partially treated human excreta while the median ace suc ratio values were comparable across the wwtps sampled in this study a larger range of values was observed at town branch fig 1b which points to the need for understanding local variabilities in acetaminophen and sucralose concentrations in order to apply this approach to locate leaks and spills of untreated sewage given the surrounding land use in the cane run area the likelihood of highly concentrated continuously flowing acetaminophen sources other than domestic sewage within the immediate area is low only two potential sources were identified a veterinary supply facility and a regional mental health facility a review of the veterinary supply facility s product catalogue revealed no acetaminophen based products the mental health facility while a large campus is separated by a topographic low and is more than 700 m from the spring outlet as storm sewers drain into cane run less than 100 m from the facility and topographic gradients drive surface and groundwater flow toward cane run communication with the spring by runoff or groundwater flow is unlikely in the cane run area an increase in ace suc ratio values accompanied by an increase in acetaminophen concentrations are thought to indicate a recent or proximal leak of sewage from urban background conditions surface water sampling in other parts of the urban area indicated a regional background ace suc ratio of 0 3 when acetaminophen was detectable and the average ace suc value in the tributary was greater than background 1 4 sucralose concentrations in the tributary samples were 100 fold less than those in wwtp influents and effluents suggestive of dilution of wwtp influent or effluent with uncontaminated waters this degree of dilution is supported by acetaminophen concentrations in the tributary 0 6 and 0 5 ppb that were also 100 fold less than the closest wwtp influent averages 78 ppb town branch values of acetaminophen as low as in the tributary could be comparable to the average values from the west hickman sedimentation tank and effluent 0 8 and 0 3 ppb respectively after intense aerobic microbiological treatment yet ace suc values were several times higher in the tributary than in cane run 1 4 and 1 3 in the tributary versus averages of 0 13 0 14 in cane run the persistent sucralose concentration is suggestive of dilution rather than treatment while the acetaminophen concentrations could be consistent with either 100 fold dilution of influent by unpolluted waters or sewage degraded for more than 72 h at 21 c kinetic study model the combination of ace suc ratio values and acetaminophen concentrations five times the regional surface water averages are consistent with the conclusion that an ongoing release of untreated sewage into the tributary is occurring however this could not have been concluded unless the tributary was sampled the 10 fold difference in ace suc ratios seen between the tributary and the cane run creek samples did not result in an elevated ace suc ratio in cane run from upstream to downstream of the tributary suggesting that there is a limit to the sensitivity of the ratio with respect to dilution indicating a need to sample tributaries as well as the receiving streams inferences from our laboratory kinetic studies would allow estimates of the age of the apparent sewage leak even though the short length of the tributary would not allow for appreciable acetaminophen decay applying the regression found for the decay rate measured by the kinetic experiments at 21 c ace suc 0 05t 2 85 for a large leak i e minor dilution and high microbial density with a final ace suc value of 1 4 untreated domestic sewage would be estimated to have been in the tributary environment for 29 h knowing that significant dilution had occurred and applying the regression equation from the kinetic experiments for sewage diluted into stream water at 21 c ace suc 0 036t 3 39 for a final ace suc value of 1 4 the estimated in stream residence time would have been 55 h so a range of time values could be established that may be applied to a stream to define a region of concern of course extrapolation from laboratory to field conditions is a simplification and the rate of decay will vary with temperature and conditions nonetheless by monitoring temperature and flow rates it appears possible to utilize time estimates to backtrack up an impacted stream thereby localizing a sanitary survey and expensive visual inspection of local sewer mains to a smaller area optimizing resources 5 conclusions there is an urgent need for indicator systems that can inexpensively detect leaking sewers as many cities struggle to meet criteria for ambient microbial quality of surface waters due to hidden leaks undetected cross connections and overflows other workers have suggested the use of co analytes to trace wastewater contamination of groundwater tran et al 2014 mccance et al 2018 in a benchmarking scheme to estimate environmental degradation mclachlan et al 2017 and the use of multiple sweeteners with various degradation rates to differentiate recent from older contamination buerge et al 2009 our work is distinctive in using analytes from different categories of pharmaceutical and personal care products the sweetener sucralose and the drug acetaminophen that can be simultaneously detected in a single sample by lc ms and in using sucralose instead of acesulfame as a benchmark for age estimation furthermore by providing well fit linear models that can be used to estimate the time human excreta has been in the wwtp or environment we have developed a technique capable of distinguishing treated effluent from untreated sewage this technique is significantly less expensive and time consuming analytically than a previous multi indicator approach that utilized the ac tc ratio as a signal of fecal age along with epicoprostanol concentrations to pinpoint the presence of human linked viruses in surface waters black et al 2007 while the new technique may not be universally applicable and requires some effort to identify average co analyte concentrations and ratios in the study area an indicator system based on co analytes that are readily detectable in wastewater but display differential persistence in the environment can enable watershed managers to prioritize areas for remediation efforts declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18840,reducing pathogenic risks in surface waters impacted by leaking or overflowing sewage requires the ability to detect human excreta in raw sewage discriminate human excreta from other types of animal excreta and differentiate between treated wastewater and raw sewage we used the relative concentrations of a degradable human specific pharmaceutical and a persistent artificial sweetener to indicate the presence of human excreta its degree of environmental degradation and the amount of dilution by freshwater sources samples were collected and analyzed for acetaminophen and sucralose between 2016 and 2018 from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and streams in metropolitan lexington kentucky usa both co analytes were consistently present in raw sewage with acetaminophen in higher concentrations than sucralose the presence of acetaminophen was related primarily to untreated human excreta with concentrations rapidly decreasing upon treatment to nearly undetectable levels in wwtp effluents and streams sucralose in surface waters was related to inputs of both raw sewage and wwtp effluents the ratio of acetaminophen to sucralose concentrations in raw sewage and spiked river waters exhibited linear decay kinetics with respect to time with larger decay constants observed at higher temperatures this co analyte indicator approach was evaluated at a local site previously suspected of receiving raw sewage the presence and ratios of the co analytes indicated the presence of domestic sewage that was not fully treated graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater fecal source tracking pharmaceuticals sweeteners co analytes pathogen indicators 1 introduction surface waters are susceptible to a variety of point and non point source excreta pollution in urban watersheds sanitary sewers release human associated pathogens and chemicals by leakage and overflows of untreated sewage and by discharge of effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps water contamination by human excreta poses significant health risks due to the presence of human adapted pathogens especially enteric viruses treated effluent still carries pathogenic risks but at a lesser scale and must be distinguished from untreated excrement sources to appropriately define risks the world health organization estimates one to four million cases of cholera and 20 to 40 thousand deaths occur due to contamination of drinking water annually who 2016 while more prevalent in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure exposure to freshwaters contaminated with human excreta can still pose risks to drinking water sources and recreational use of waterways in developed regions therefore fecal source identification of human excreta is critical for effective control of waterborne diseases and preservation of public health black et al 2007 glassmeyer et al 2005 murugan et al 2012 approaches for indicating the presence of human excreta and the potential for pathogenic risk include direct methods such as analyses of dna from microorganisms of interest he et al 2015 and utilizing non pathogenic indicator bacteria or their genes and chemical proxies potera 2012 wood et al 2000 each approach has varying cost and analytical limitations biological methods may require time to culture bacteria specialized reagents and advanced laboratory equipment and techniques biological methods are also limited by sharing of gut organisms between humans and other animals coupled with the potential for growth and variable decay in the environment glassmeyer et al 2005 emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and artificial sweeteners have been demonstrated as reliable indicators of the presence of human excreta raw or treated in surface water and groundwater

is ongoing the use of multiple indicators with varying persistence properties has shown promise especially if one indicator can serve as a baseline or benchmark against which to measure the presence and concentration of others black et al 2007 mclachlan et al 2017 the ability to estimate the age of human excreta if combined with knowledge of stream flow and other watershed characteristics could aid in targeting the freshest most potentially pathogenic sites of pollution for remediation tran et al 2014 suggested that co occurrence of conservative and non conservative indicators could identify recent introductions of untreated sewage mclachlan et al 2017 introduced the use of benchmarking to better model the degradation of chemicals in laboratory and field studies providing a way to estimate the degradation half life the benchmarking approach may be applicable in urban waters to not only indicate the presence of human excreta but to estimate the age by selecting two human sourced chemicals one that persists and one that degrades sucralose is a persistent artificial sweetener identified as an indicator of human excreta in the environment oppenheimer et al 2011 wood et al 2000 in 2003 300 tons of sucralose were produced in europe and america for worldwide consumption commonly in soft drinks bahndorf and kienle 2004 by 2012 25 of children and 41 of adults in the usa were consuming foods containing low calorie sweeteners including sucralose sylvetsky et al 2017 because 90 of sucralose is excreted from the human body unchanged and it is recalcitrant to degradation by wastewater treatment and environmental processes sucralose is increasingly found in surface waters that receive human excreta oppenheimer et al 2011 researchers in switzerland have detected sucralose in wastewaters groundwaters surface waters and tap waters buerge et al 2009 additional work has demonstrated concentrations in non receiving surface waters between 47 0 and 81 0 ppt ng l mawhinney et al 2011 with wastewater influent values as high as 69 7 ppb μg l tambosi et al 2010 the demonstrated measurable values and environmental persistence makes sucralose an ideal chemical marker for sewage and a possible analyte for source apportionment upon dilution by natural waters however recalcitrance to decay does not allow for sucralose to distinguish between fresh human excreta and treated effluent in freshwaters that requires an additional co analyte that degrades in the environment is also human source linked is similarly widespread and can be extracted and analyzed by the same processes as sucralose acetaminophen present in at least 235 prescription and over the counter medications blough and wu 2011 may be such a co analyte globally 137 900 metric tons were estimated to have been consumed in 2014 with 86 of production used for pharmaceuticals and north america accounting for 40 of market share market research store 2016 acetaminophen is also used to a minor extent in manufacturing of azo dyes and photographic chemicals national center for biotechnology information 2019 as acetaminophen is toxic to many animals it is not frequently used as a veterinary analgesic so its presence is strongly linked to human usage acetaminophen is extensively metabolized in the body with only 2 5 of the therapeutic dose excreted unchanged in urine within 24 h cummings et al 1967 however conjugated forms of excreted acetaminophen can be expected to undergo rapid deconjugation due to the presence of extra cellular enzymes especially β glucuronidase in sewage and experience degradation baronti et al 2000 influent acetaminophen concentrations as high as 182 8 ppb tran et al 2014 have been reported within urban sewersheds wastewater treatment is effective in removing acetaminophen as indicated by negligible concentrations in effluent tambosi et al 2010 and by ozone oxidation removals from simulated drinking water treatment westerhoff et al 2005 acetaminophen biodegradation in the environment has been reported li et al 2014 schaider et al 2017 although its presence as a synthetic compound in the environment has been extensively documented because of degradation without regular reintroduction from fresh human excreta acetaminophen should occur in natural waters at concentrations well below those in both untreated sewage and wwtp effluent unless dilution is minimal in this study we describe the use of the acetaminophen sucralose ratio ace suc for pinpointing the presence of human excreta carried in sewage identifying the degree of conventional treatment the sewage has undergone and estimating the degree of dilution and degradation of sewage releases into the environment we determined the concentrations of these co analytes across the treatment processes of two wwtps conducted laboratory decay kinetic experiments at different temperatures in varying microbial densities determined background values in local surface waters and analyzed these indicators in water samples near a suspected sewage leak the ace suc ratio allowed for identification of the fresh sewage signal across potential sources and provided discrimination of time in the environment the development of a more complete understanding of acetaminophen degradation under various environmental scenarios allowed for the ace suc ratio to provide information on the age of untreated sewage in receiving waters while the absolute concentrations of sucralose could estimate the degree of dilution with less contaminated waters the approach presented should be useful for municipalities seeking to characterize different signals for human excreta in their watersheds to optimize remediation of aging sewer infrastructure 2 methods 2 1 sampling three rounds of samples were collected from the west hickman and town branch wwtps in lexington kentucky usa during the spring summer and winter of 2016 2017 each wwtp handles a similar volume of sanitary sewage 154 and 136 million liters per day from estimated populations of 167 992 and 163 673 respectively dustin baker lfucg gis developer personal communication february 2 2018 population was estimated by taking the average household size from the 2010 census data and multiplying it by the number of residential units in each sewershed land use is predominantly suburban in the west hickman sewershed and urban in the town branch sewershed treatment processes at the wwtps are comparable but west hickman includes an additional pre sedimentation basin for grit removal prior to sampling 1 l and 250 ml polypropylene bottles were washed and dried and sodium thiosulfate was added to each 0 08 g for 1 l bottles or 0 02 g for 250 ml bottles to consume residual chlorine bottles were then autoclaved for 30 min one liter grab samples were taken in the prepared polypropylene bottles after primary screening influent after secondary clarification post activated sludge clarification tank effluent and after chlorination effluent duplicates and spikes were taken from the influent at town branch on february 7 2017 and from west hickman effluent on february 10 2017 eleven 250 ml stream samples were taken along a 1 km reach of a stream cane run in the vicinity of a suspected sanitary sewer leak from an older suburban neighborhood in north lexington in july 2018 fig s1 sampling occurred upstream downstream along a tributary in the vicinity of the suspected leak and at the confluence of the tributary with cane run another 34 samples were taken from streams in well sewered areas in lexington in 2017 and 2018 for comparison with concentrations found at the wwtps fig s1 these samples were taken at different times frozen and analyzed without loss of signal 2 2 kinetic degradation experiments four treatments were prepared across 17 samples using influent spiked surface water from a local spring mcconnell springs and spiked deionized water in autoclaved beakers to establish decay kinetics by microbial degradation of acetaminophen and sucralose surface water and deionized control samples were spiked with 1000 ppb μg l of acetaminophen and 500 ppb of sucralose to provide a 2 1 ratio of the co analytes and a large range across which to measure acetaminophen degradation sewage samples were not spiked as they contained measurable amounts of both co analytes five 500 ml replicate samples of influent and three 500 ml replicate samples of spiked surface water were kept at 4 c and continuously stirred while equivalent numbers of 500 ml influent and spiked surface water samples were kept at 21 c with continuous stirring all were sequestered from light to isolate microbial degradation processes from photodegradation additionally one 500 ml sample of surface water was autoclaved prior to spiking and maintained at 21 c in the absence of light to establish a negative control for biological activity each bottle with its sample solution was agitated on a shaker table for the entire experiment a 10 ml aliquot of each sample was taken every 12 h up to a maximum duration of 168 h for surface water at 4 c to establish the stability of the analytes upon storage three 10 ml samples of deionized water were spiked and stored under various conditions one sample was frozen one maintained in the dark at 4 c and the third kept at room temperature in direct sunlight for 10 days as a quality control check 10 samples across the treatments were spiked and checked for percent recovery throughout the entire extraction and analysis procedures 2 3 extraction preparation and analysis simultaneous extraction and preparation of both analytes from water samples were based on established methods loos et al 2009 with modifications for this study ten milliliter aliquots from kinetic degradation samples and various volumes for all remaining samples were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges strata x 6 ml 200 mg phenomenex deuterated internal standards of acetaminophen d 4 200 ppb and sucralose d 6 400 ppb were added to the samples prior to extraction for quantification cartridges were activated and conditioned with 5 ml each of water and methanol at a flow rate of 5 ml min prior to sample introduction all samples were passed through the wet cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min cartridges were then rinsed with 2 ml of water at 3 ml min and dried for 20 min at increasing levels of suction under vacuum analytes were eluted from the cartridge with 5 ml of methanol at 2 ml min then evaporated to dryness before being reconstituted to a 1 ml volume with a 90 10 water methanol solution liquid chromatography lc separation was performed at the environmental research training laboratories ertl university of kentucky with dual varian prostar 210 pumps using gradient chromatography on a phenomenex gemini c 18 column 150 2 0 mm 5 μm with a 10 μl injection volume the mobile phase consisted of h2o and methanol each with 0 1 formic acid an electrospray ionization chamber operated in positive mode for acetaminophen and negative mode for sucralose interfaced to a varian 1200 l mass spectrometer ms operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to identify the compounds of interest sequentially from a single extract prior to the start of sample analysis the ms conditions were optimized by infusion of standards to provide the best sensitivity and selectivity for each analyte and internal standard each batch of samples was run with accompanying quality control samples blanks lab water spikes sample matrix spikes duplicates and replicates which were extracted and analyzed as field unknowns throughout the study to determine the recovery accuracy and precision of the analytical procedures followed recovery from nine different lab water spikes averaged 93 recovery for acetaminophen and 92 recovery for sucralose while 25 matrix spikes averaged 91 recovery for acetaminophen and 92 recovery for sucralose ten different duplicate samples were analyzed and averaged 4 relative difference for acetaminophen and 6 relative difference for sucralose in addition there was good reproducibility for all eight replicates in the kinetic studies sample concentrations were established using calibration curves of deuterated internal standards detection limits were set based on the bounds of calibration standards where the instrument response was linear reportable limits were set to one order of magnitude larger than the detection limits and varied with the initial sample volumes that were extracted bottle blanks were extracted with each batch of samples collected and analyzed all blanks were less than the reporting limit 3 results 3 1 presence of acetaminophen and sucralose in wastewaters both acetaminophen and sucralose were consistently found in wwtp influents with acetaminophen concentrations twice as great as those found for sucralose table 1 and fig 1 a average acetaminophen concentrations in town branch and west hickman wwtp influents were 78 8 22 1 and 122 4 37 5 ppb respectively while the difference in acetaminophen values had overlapping distributions the differences in average concentrations at the inlets of the wwtps was significant by t test p 0 001 the variance in average concentration may be linked to differences in the sewershed collection areas and differences in dosing the town branch wwtp collects sewage from a more urbanized area with five hospitals sports stadia an airport and the university of kentucky the west hickman sewershed is comprised of suburban sprawl neighborhoods and shopping centers the variability recorded may be due to more variable therapeutic dosing in the suburbs combined with differences in sewer travel time that impacts deconjugation and degradation in sewers resulting in higher and more variable concentrations in west hickman influents acetaminophen concentrations from the clarification tank effluents and chlorinated final effluents were near or below detection limits at both plants denoting significant degradation of acetaminophen through the treatment processes of the 41 samples taken after activated sludge treatment only four had acetaminophen values greater than the reportable detection limit of 0 1 ppb values 0 1 ppb were not included in calculating the average in contrast sucralose concentrations did not vary across treatment but stayed constant and were statistically indistinguishable across processes and between treatment plants sucralose concentrations in influent averaged 40 2 25 6 ppb at town branch and 48 0 13 7 ppb at west hickman wwtp the unitless average of the ace suc ratio in influent was 2 5 for both wwtps the average ace suc ratios at each wwtp were not statistically different by t test p 0 72 and were thus combined for further statistical analysis the overall average ace suc ratio in untreated influent for all 26 samples from both wwtps was 2 6 0 7 for the 4 of 41 effluent samples 2 at each wwtp that had reportable amounts of acetaminophen the average ace suc value was 0 009 with a range in values from 0 0004 to 0 024 3 2 degradation kinetics of co analyte concentration ratios acetaminophen and sucralose spiked into sterile deionized water showed little degradation after 10 days with ace suc maintained at initial spike values of 2 5 for all treatments 20 c 4 c and 21 c sucralose concentrations varied little with concentrations within 5 ppb of the initial measurement across replicate experiments degradation of spiked acetaminophen and sucralose also did not occur over 96 h at benchtop temperatures 21 c in autoclaved surface water the ratio stayed constant at 2 7 however when the water matrix was not sterile and aerobic microbial activity was possible ace suc decreased over time with warmer temperatures associated with greater decay of acetaminophen and larger decreases in the ratio decay experiments at 4 c showed an average decrease in ace suc ratios of 0 46 0 7 n 5 and 0 10 0 02 n 3 for influent and surface water respectively fig 2 ratios dropped faster at 21 c with influent ace suc decreasing from 2 75 0 02 to below detection limits bdl after 48 h and surface water ace suc decreasing from 2 43 0 07 to bdl after 96 h maximum measured decay of acetaminophen was 91 ppb over a 72 h period spiked surface water at 21 c all observed decay was attributed to microbial activity as light was excluded from the experimental setup a linear least squares regression model for the 4 c data fits well for influent with a degradation rate of 0 005 per hour and r2 0 99 fig 2a but not as well for surface water with a rate of 0 0009 per hour and r2 0 31 fig 2b the latter fit is greatly improved by the removal of the 24 h data point a statistical outlier resulting from experimental lag time resulting in a degradation rate of 0 0006 per hour with r2 0 60 the lower degradation rate in surface waters was expected as the microbial activity and density were less than in influent at 21 c degradation of acetaminophen occurs much more quickly with ace suc ratios reduced to less than 1 after 48 h linear least squares regression yields maximum degradation rates of 0 05 per hour for influent r2 0 92 fig 2a and 0 036 per hour for stream water r2 0 95 fig 2b at 21 c 3 3 co analyte presence in surface waters of the 34 surface water samples collected from local streams 28 had acetaminophen concentrations above detection limits calculated with respect to the sample volume extracted so the ace suc ratio could be calculated sucralose was detected in all samples although in very low concentrations compared to levels found in wwtp influent or effluent across all surface water samples ace suc ratios ranged from bdl acetaminophen was below reportable limits to 0 7 with an average of 0 2 from samples where a ratio could be calculated from values above detection all samples had ratios far below those observed in wwtp influent the area selected for more detailed sampling drains a neighborhood that originally was developed with septic systems but is now served by sanitary sewers flow along the 100 m long by 0 3 m wide tributary is maintained by spring discharge emerging along a hillslope forming the head of a wooded draw originating in the subdivision the ungauged tributary flows southeast to a confluence with cane run an ephemeral stream that loses water to the underlying karst aquifer principal land use along the tributary and sampled reach of cane run is woodland and greenspace within a municipal park prior work at this site g m brion 2005 unpublished data detected male specific bacteriophage a human fecal indicator and inferred low fecal age from ratios of atypical to typical total coliform ac tc concentrations black et al 2007 however because of the extended time required for the ac tc ratio to change the previously measured indicators could not distinguish between untreated sewage and treated effluent sample sites fig s1 were classified as upstream cane run n 2 suspect tributary n 2 confluence n 3 and downstream cane run n 4 the flow of cane run during sampling was elevated compared to the previous week 0 02 vs 0 01 m3 s usgs 2018 due to precipitation on the day prior to sampling and was much greater than that noted in the tributary all samples from the tributary and cane run had detectable acetaminophen and sucralose concentrations acetaminophen concentrations fell from an average of 0 57 ppb along the suspect tributary to 0 07 0 08 ppb along cane run fig 3 a the tributary acetaminophen concentrations appear to be different from those found at the other sites along cane run but with only 2 samples taken at the tributary statistical findings are limited sucralose concentrations were similar regardless of sampling location and were 100 orders of magnitude lower than in wwtp influent 40 48 ppb averaged ace suc ratio values ranged from upstream at the confluence to 0 14 downstream consistent with the range of background values found in other surface waters fig 3b the elevated ace suc ratio along the tributary indicates the presence of untreated human excreta that has undergone some microbial decay as it is not above a value of 2 as was seen for influent sewage the detection of acetaminophen indicates that decay is less than would be found after activated sludge treatment given that acetaminophen was bdl in 37 of 41 wwtp effluent samples 4 discussion to be effective indicators of pathogens associated with human feces analytes must be closely linked with human excreta and should be able to pinpoint fresh fecal materials from those that have undergone treatment both acetaminophen and sucralose are strongly linked to human sources neither occurs naturally in the environment or is administered regularly to livestock hof 2000 within the wwtps and the urban watershed sucralose was commonly detectable and concentrations within influent and surface waters were within the range reported by mawhinney et al 2011 for surface water 0 047 2 90 ppb wastewater effluent and influent concentrations were not significantly different indicating that sucralose was not effectively removed at either wwtp sampled and therefore could only be linked with human excreta presence not fecal age our findings of artificial sweetener presence and persistence are consistent with other studies of raw and treated sewage buerge et al 2009 robertson et al 2013 and septage robertson et al 2013 sucralose was present in the urban environment persistent and provided a benchmark against which to measure the degradation of acetaminophen as well as indication of dilution of the sewage signal the ace suc ratio in the kinetic experiments provided well fit linear decay models under varying temperatures and in different water matrices relating the decrease of the ratio with an increase in time under microbial degradation the time for a 50 reduction in the ace suc ratio for influent at 21 c lab experiment is estimated to be 28 h dropping the ratio from an average of 2 6 to 1 3 however in the wwtp the ratio drops to levels far below 1 0 3 in west hickman wwtp effluent indicating that the activated sludge process with dense microbial densities and enhanced aeration is capable of greater decay rates than found in the kinetic experiments however the kinetic experiments do model the conditions that one would expect to see in the environment from a spill and while more research is required the behavior of the ace suc ratio appears to be linear in the range studied and able to provide estimates of the age of influent carrying human excreta acetaminophen concentrations in wwtp influent were greater than for sucralose which is consistent with the reported amounts of the two compounds manufactured for use and much greater than concentrations found in local surface water samples influent wwtp acetaminophen concentrations 50 3 200 0 ppb fell within the range of median values reported by tran et al 2014 for influents 15 2 337 0 ppb and fell to near non detectable levels in effluent due to microbial degradation and chemical oxidation westerhoff et al 2005 provided by treatment therefore very low concentrations of acetaminophen would be expected in waters that carry well treated effluent or are unpolluted by human excreta however ace suc ratio values 1 no matter how low the acetaminophen or sucralose concentrations or if dilution with uncontaminated water has occurred are suggestive of untreated or partially treated human excreta while the median ace suc ratio values were comparable across the wwtps sampled in this study a larger range of values was observed at town branch fig 1b which points to the need for understanding local variabilities in acetaminophen and sucralose concentrations in order to apply this approach to locate leaks and spills of untreated sewage given the surrounding land use in the cane run area the likelihood of highly concentrated continuously flowing acetaminophen sources other than domestic sewage within the immediate area is low only two potential sources were identified a veterinary supply facility and a regional mental health facility a review of the veterinary supply facility s product catalogue revealed no acetaminophen based products the mental health facility while a large campus is separated by a topographic low and is more than 700 m from the spring outlet as storm sewers drain into cane run less than 100 m from the facility and topographic gradients drive surface and groundwater flow toward cane run communication with the spring by runoff or groundwater flow is unlikely in the cane run area an increase in ace suc ratio values accompanied by an increase in acetaminophen concentrations are thought to indicate a recent or proximal leak of sewage from urban background conditions surface water sampling in other parts of the urban area indicated a regional background ace suc ratio of 0 3 when acetaminophen was detectable and the average ace suc value in the tributary was greater than background 1 4 sucralose concentrations in the tributary samples were 100 fold less than those in wwtp influents and effluents suggestive of dilution of wwtp influent or effluent with uncontaminated waters this degree of dilution is supported by acetaminophen concentrations in the tributary 0 6 and 0 5 ppb that were also 100 fold less than the closest wwtp influent averages 78 ppb town branch values of acetaminophen as low as in the tributary could be comparable to the average values from the west hickman sedimentation tank and effluent 0 8 and 0 3 ppb respectively after intense aerobic microbiological treatment yet ace suc values were several times higher in the tributary than in cane run 1 4 and 1 3 in the tributary versus averages of 0 13 0 14 in cane run the persistent sucralose concentration is suggestive of dilution rather than treatment while the acetaminophen concentrations could be consistent with either 100 fold dilution of influent by unpolluted waters or sewage degraded for more than 72 h at 21 c kinetic study model the combination of ace suc ratio values and acetaminophen concentrations five times the regional surface water averages are consistent with the conclusion that an ongoing release of untreated sewage into the tributary is occurring however this could not have been concluded unless the tributary was sampled the 10 fold difference in ace suc ratios seen between the tributary and the cane run creek samples did not result in an elevated ace suc ratio in cane run from upstream to downstream of the tributary suggesting that there is a limit to the sensitivity of the ratio with respect to dilution indicating a need to sample tributaries as well as the receiving streams inferences from our laboratory kinetic studies would allow estimates of the age of the apparent sewage leak even though the short length of the tributary would not allow for appreciable acetaminophen decay applying the regression found for the decay rate measured by the kinetic experiments at 21 c ace suc 0 05t 2 85 for a large leak i e minor dilution and high microbial density with a final ace suc value of 1 4 untreated domestic sewage would be estimated to have been in the tributary environment for 29 h knowing that significant dilution had occurred and applying the regression equation from the kinetic experiments for sewage diluted into stream water at 21 c ace suc 0 036t 3 39 for a final ace suc value of 1 4 the estimated in stream residence time would have been 55 h so a range of time values could be established that may be applied to a stream to define a region of concern of course extrapolation from laboratory to field conditions is a simplification and the rate of decay will vary with temperature and conditions nonetheless by monitoring temperature and flow rates it appears possible to utilize time estimates to backtrack up an impacted stream thereby localizing a sanitary survey and expensive visual inspection of local sewer mains to a smaller area optimizing resources 5 conclusions there is an urgent need for indicator systems that can inexpensively detect leaking sewers as many cities struggle to meet criteria for ambient microbial quality of surface waters due to hidden leaks undetected cross connections and overflows other workers have suggested the use of co analytes to trace wastewater contamination of groundwater tran et al 2014 mccance et al 2018 in a benchmarking scheme to estimate environmental degradation mclachlan et al 2017 and the use of multiple sweeteners with various degradation rates to differentiate recent from older contamination buerge et al 2009 our work is distinctive in using analytes from different categories of pharmaceutical and personal care products the sweetener sucralose and the drug acetaminophen that can be simultaneously detected in a single sample by lc ms and in using sucralose instead of acesulfame as a benchmark for age estimation furthermore by providing well fit linear models that can be used to estimate the time human excreta has been in the wwtp or environment we have developed a technique capable of distinguishing treated effluent from untreated sewage this technique is significantly less expensive and time consuming analytically than a previous multi indicator approach that utilized the ac tc ratio as a signal of fecal age along with epicoprostanol concentrations to pinpoint the presence of human linked viruses in surface waters black et al 2007 while the new technique may not be universally applicable and requires some effort to identify average co analyte concentrations and ratios in the study area an indicator system based on co analytes that are readily detectable in wastewater but display differential persistence in the

18841,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability besides the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process which are still toxic required further energy intensive aerobic post treatment in this study an up flow electricity stimulated anaerobic system esas was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bromophenol 4 bp when cathode potential was 600 mv high toc removal efficiency 98 78 0 96 complete removal of 4 bp and phenol could be achieved at 4 bp loading rate of 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 suggesting debrominated product of 4 bp from cathode i e phenol would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of esas under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas whereas only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in control reactor besides electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species phenol degradation related species fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in esas moreover based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp in esas was proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic reduction debromination electrochemical stimulation microbial community mineralization 1 introduction anaerobic reduction process is regarded as a promising alternative for the removal of halogenated organic compounds where these toxic contaminants can be reductively transformed to less toxic metabolites by co metabolism li et al 2015 however the traditional anaerobic treatment system is confined by its relatively long reaction time poor stability for toxic contaminants and high demand of electron donor to promote the necessary reductive condition xu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 peng et al 2013 zu et al 2012 the use of electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism for anaerobic reduction of diverse contaminants including nitroaromatics jiang et al 2016a and 2016b halogenated compounds liang et al 2019 xu et al 2016 azo dyes cui et al 2014 2016 and nitrate feng et al 2015 sevda et al 2018 is attracting increasing attention compared with the traditional anaerobic processes reductive biodegradation of various pollutants in these electricity stimulated anaerobic systems esas could be significantly reinforced jiang et al 2018 by far esas developed in previous studies was mainly focused on the reduction but not mineralization of various recalcitrant contaminants such as halogenated organic compounds zhang and angelidaki 2014 the reductive intermediates or products formed in esas which were still toxic to the environment required further energy intensive aerobic post treatment problems are supposed to be resolved if anaerobic reduction in the cathode can be achieved followed by further mineralization of reductive products in the bioanode more importantly whether the reductive products of various recalcitrant pollutants such as halogenated organic compounds can be further mineralized and utilized as electron donor in the bioanode is a vital problem determining the operational costs of esas since additional electron donor is often required in order to achieve high dehalogenation efficiency however up to now it remains a challenge to achieve simultaneous bioremediation and mineralization of halogenated organic compounds in esas theoretically the reductive products of halogenated organic compounds from the cathode may be able to be utilized as bioanodic fuels in esas firstly the introduced anode in esas can serve as electron sink to accept electrons via extracellular electron transfer leading to improved degradation efficiency of recalcitrant compounds yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 has demonstrated the feasibility to use quinoline as the sole anodic fuel to enhance quinoline biodegradation and power generation simultaneously secondly applied external voltage or current can help realize thermodynamically unfavorable reactions for example electron acceptor with low reduction potential can be reduced efficiently at the cathode and substrate with high reduction potential can be oxidized effectively at the anode sulonen et al 2017 in our previous work both pyridine biodegradation and system stability could be remarkably improved in esas with the assistant of 0 3 ma direct current jiang et al 2018 thirdly the application of electrical stimulation has the significant impact on the structure of functional microbial community and retention of biomass which is critical for the degradation of recalcitrant organics ailijiang et al 2016 found that intermittent direct current could enrich bacteria species in the biofilm of anode for aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic biodegradation leading to improved treatment efficiency of phenol containing wastewater based on the concerns described above an up flow membrane free esas was designed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic dehalogenation and mineralization of halogenated organic compounds 4 bromphenol 4 bp which is attracting serious environmental concern due to its high toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation was chosen as the model halogenated organic compound li et al 2015 sim et al 2009 it was found that simultaneous debromination and mineralization of 4 bp could be effectively achieved in this up flow membrane free esas the effects of 4 bp loading rate applied cathodic potential and acetate dosage on the reactor performance were investigated moreover long term applicability of simultaneous bioremediation and mineralization of 4 bp in esas was further studied in addition the difference of microbial communities in both esas and control reactor were explored and compared in order to understand the key role of electrical stimulation on the enrichment of functional microbial communities finally possible debromination and mineralization mechanism for 4 bp in the up flow esas was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration two identical cylindrical reactors made of acrylic plastic with inner diameter of 6 cm height of 72 cm and working volume of 660 ml were used as esas and anaerobic control reactor in this study as shown in fig s1 both reactors were designed by installing cathode underneath and anode above graphite granules with diameter of 2 6 mm were filled in the bottom of the reactors as cathodes graphite felts 40 cm 15 cm 1 cm which were rolled up to a cylinder were installed at the upper portion of the reactors as the anodes to allow even distribution of the influent plates with evenly spaced holes were installed at the bottom of the cathode and anode cathode and anode chambers in both esas and anaerobic control reactor were placed in 3 cm apart prior to use both graphite granules and felts were pretreated according to the procedure described by chen et al 2017 two titanium wires 1 5 mm in diameter were inserted into both the anodic and cathodic compartments to allow external circuit connection the anode was connected to the cathode through a potentiostat bio logic science instruments vmp3 france for potential control the generated current cathode potentials and anode potentials were automatically recorded by the potentiostat ag agcl reference electrode assumed 0 197 v vs she was placed between the anode and cathode for the measurement of half potentials it should be noted that all potentials reported throughout this paper were referred to ag agcl electrode assumed 0 197 v vs she if not otherwise stated 2 2 reactor operation the influent composition was as follows na2hpo4 12h2o 3 06 g l 1 kh2po4 0 76 g l 1 nh4cl 0 5 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o 0 21 g l 1 cacl2 0 02 g l 1 and trace element solution 1 ml l 1 wu et al 2019 both 4 bp and sodium acetate were added at desired concentrations prior to use the influent was autoclaved at 120 c for 40 min and purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen sludge collected from an anaerobic reactor treating nitrobenzene containing wastewater was inoculated into both reactors at initial mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 8 5 g l 1 the temperature of both reactors was maintained at 35 2 c using water jacket throughout the experimental period the experimental period was divided into six phases and the experimental conditions for each phase are summarized in table 1 in phase i i e start up phase both esas and anaerobic control reactor were firstly operated in open circuit mode at 4 bp loading rate of 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 and acetate dosage of 7 32 mm in phase ii the circuit of esas was closed with the cathodic potential adjusted to 600 mv step by step within 24 h and kept for 20 days while anaerobic control reactor was still operated in open circuit mode in phase iii the cathodic potential of esas was adjusted from 600 to 1000 mv where 4 bp loading rate and acetate dosage were maintained at 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 and 7 32 mm respectively in phase iv the influent 4 bp concentration was increased from 0 29 to 1 45 mm with the corresponding 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 58 up to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 in order to evaluate the ability of esas and anaerobic control reactor when suffering from high 4 bp loading rate cathode potential was set as 800 mv and acetate dosage was remained at 7 32 mm in this phase in phase v in order to investigate the effect of acetate dosage on 4 bp removal phenol formation and electron donor requirement acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 to 0 mm at 4 bp loading rate of 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and cathode potential of 800 mv in phase vi in order to investigate the system stability of esas and control reactor acetate dosage was recovered to 7 32 mm for 60 days while 4 bp loading rate and cathode potential were controlled at 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 and 800 mv respectively after reaching a stable performance sludge samples were taken from both anode and cathode in both reactors to characterize the biofilm morphology and microbial community structure 2 3 analytical methods both 4 bp and phenol were identified and quantified by waters 2695 hplc equipped with an xbridge c18 column 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm and a diode array detector through authentic standard biogas composition was analyzed by gas chromatography agilent 6820 agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector using molecular sieve 5 a 60 80 mesh column as the separation column n2 was used as carrier gas and the operation temperatures of the injection port oven and detector were set at 100 c 90 c and 125 c respectively total organic carbon toc was measured on a toc analyzer vario toc elementar german bromide iron br concentration was detected with ionic chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa biodegradation intermediates of 4 bp were identified by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 7890 a gc 5975c msd hp 5ms column agilent usa according to chen et al 2017 samples for gc ms analysis were pretreated according to wu et al 2016 electrochemical monitoring was carried out according to liang et al 2019 cyclic voltammogram cv analysis was carried out in 4 bp abiotic electrochemical reduction system using graphite electrode and n2 saturated buffer ph 7 0 containing 100 mg l 1 4 bp at a potential scan rate of 1 mv s 14 bp removal efficiencies and toc removal efficiencies were evaluated based on the difference of 4 bp and toc concentrations between influent and effluent co substrate usage ratio i e acetate usage ratio mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal and coulombic efficiency ce for 4 bp reduction at the cathode were calculated according to shen et al 2013 4 bp removal rate and the energy consumption in the esas were calculated according to shen et al 2014 biofilm morphology was observed on a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250feg fei usa anodic and cathodic biofilm samples taken from the two reactors were pre treated as described previously chen et al 2017 five samples for high throughput sequencing were tagged as aan and aca collected from the anode and cathode of the anaerobic control reactor ean and eca collected from the anode and cathode of esas and inoc inocula sludge respectively dna extraction pcr amplification and data analysis were performed in accordance to jiang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up procedure as shown in fig s2 during start up phase 4 bp removal efficiencies within the first two days in both reactors were higher than those in the following 10 days probably due to the adsorption of 4 bp by activated sludge graphite granules and graphite felt however 4 bp removal efficiencies in both reactors decreased sharply to around 54 on day 3 probably due to the saturation of adsorption thereafter 4 bp removal efficiencies in the both reactors gradually increased to around 70 on day 7 which could be attributed to the acclimatization of microorganisms involved in both reactors up to day 10 no significant difference in terms of 4 bp removal between the two reactors could be observed the slight variation of 4 bp removal efficiency after day 7 indicated a steady status of both reactors at open circuit on day 11 the circuit of esas was closed with cathode potential controlled at 600 mv after day 20 toc removal efficiency 4 bp removal efficiency and br concentration in esas increased to 98 78 0 96 100 and 0 282 0 004 mm respectively which were much higher than 66 19 2 48 71 15 1 06 and 0 198 0 005 mm in the anaerobic control reactor fig 1 more importantly phenol concentration in esas effluent was undetectable while it was 0 151 0 007 mm in the effluent of control reactor suggesting that debromination product of 4 bp from cathode i e phenol would be utilized as the fuel at the bioanode of esas as a consequence the feasibility of simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp in the up flow esas was validated 3 2 effects of key operational parameters 3 2 1 cathodic potential during phase iii the effect of cathodic potential on reactor performance was investigated within cathodic potential range from 600 mv to 1000 mv as demonstrated in fig s3 as cathodic potential was reduced from 600 mv to 1000 mv the current density and the anodic potential increased from 1 34 0 03 a m 3 and 432 75 2 98 mv to 8 52 0 15 a m 3 and 94 46 10 28 mv respectively lower cathodic potential resulted in higher current density and anode potential which was consistent with our previous study shen et al 2014 when the cathodic potential was decreased from 600 mv to 1000 mv 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies in esas increased from 91 19 1 82 and 87 09 1 89 100 and 97 79 1 39 respectively fig 2 a however 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies in control reactor were only 66 21 2 41 and 65 19 2 48 which were much lower than those in esas moreover concentration profiles of the main degradation product of 4 bp i e phenol and br were shown in fig 2b phenol concentration in control reactor was 0 241 0 019 mm while only 0 072 0 013 mm in esas at the cathode potential of 600 mv with the further decrease of cathode potential in esas phenol concentration decreased from 0 072 0 013 mm 0 mm while br concentration increased and reached a plateau when the cathodic potential was below 750 mv high br release efficiency in esas was accompanied by high 4 bp removal efficiency indicating the formation of phenol as the main reductive product of 4 bp however probably due to the further biotransformation of phenol in the anode phenol was undetectable in esas at cathodic potential below 800 mv in order to further evaluate the effect of cathodic potential on 4 bp removal cv analysis was carried out in 4 bp abiotic electrochemical reduction system as shown in fig s4 an obvious reduction peak at about 1 1 v could be observed in the cv curve which was responsible for the transformation of 4 bp to phenol however the cathodic potential of the esas for 4 bp reduction used in this study was more positive than that in abiotic electrochemical system indicating that microorganisms would likely play an important role in 4 bp degradation as the biocatalyst in this study more negative cathodic potential was more favorable to 4 bp removal toc removal and phenol degradation probably because of the fact that reductive microenvironment in cathodic zone and oxidative microenvironment in anodic zone could be created at more negative cathodic potentials shen et al 2013 when the cathodic potential was below 800 mv hydrogen might be generated around the cathode marshall et al 2013 which could also be used as the electron donor to promote 4 bp reduction by autotrophic species cheng et al 2015 found that exposure of oxygen to bioanode facilitated the biodegradation of recalcitrant aniline in microbial fuel cells which could be attributed to the enrichment of aerobic aniline degrading bacteria and anode respiration bacteria however oxygen generation on the anode was undetectable in this study probably due to the negative potential of the anode senftle et al 2010 3 2 2 4 bp loading rate as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 93 mol m 3 d 1 on day 55 4 bp removal efficiencies in both esas and anaerobic control reactor were sharply decreased and then gradually recovered to 98 47 1 04 after day 67 in esas while only 65 48 1 05 after day 65 in anaerobic control reactor respectively thereafter 4 bp removal efficiency was maintained at around 99 49 0 63 in esas despite of the increase of 4 bp loading rate up to 2 31 mol m 3 d 1 as 4 bp loading rate further increased to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 4 bp removal efficiency was slightly decreased to 87 50 1 52 in esas however as 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 93 mol m 3 d 1 to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 4 bp removal efficiency in control reactor significantly decreased from 65 48 1 05 to 12 50 2 42 suggesting the poor debromination performance in the anaerobic control reactor especially at high 4 bp loading rate interestingly as shown in fig 3b almost no phenol was detectable in esas effluent at various 4 bp loading rates probably due to the low cathodic potential used during phase iv 800 mv in the anaerobic control reactor with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 to 1 73 mol m 3 d 1 effluent phenol concentration gradually increased from 0 151 0 007 mm to 0 292 0 011 mm however further increase of 4 bp loading rate to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 resulted in the decrease of effluent phenol concentration to 0 059 0 011 mm which was consistent with the low 4 bp removal efficiency during this period these results suggested that 4 bp removal phenol mineralization as well as system stability could be promoted by electrical stimulation especially at high loading rate besides as shown in fig s5 with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 to 2 31 mol m 3 d 1 ce for 4 bp reduction at the cathode increased from 26 59 3 45 to 94 36 4 58 especially ce for 4 bp reduction at 4 bp loading rate of 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 reached up to higher than 100 this might be due to the fact that 4 bp was not only reduced by the electrons from the cathode but also by anaerobic organisms using acetate as the electron donor under high acetate dosage in the influent similar phenomenon was also observed in an up flow biocatalyzed electrolysis reactor by wang et al 2012 where direct anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene resulted in ce values higher than 100 the loss of electrons in the cathode could be attributed to the side reactions in cathode zone such as hydrogen generation which consumed some electrons transferred from the anode 3 2 3 acetate dosage the dosage of the electron donor i e acetate played a key role in 4 bp reduction and phenol mineralization as indicated in fig 4 a when acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 to 4 88 mm 4 bp removal efficiency maintained at the level as high as 100 in esas however as acetate concentration was further decreased from 2 44 to 0 mm 4 bp removal efficiency reduced from 93 01 2 57 to 85 56 1 45 which could be attributed to the lack of sufficient electron donor under such conditions in addition with the decrease of acetate dosage from 2 44 to 0 mm anodic potential increased from 285 79 15 36 mv suggesting that the electrochemically active microorganisms on the anode might be seriously suppressed liang et al 2019 shen et al 2014 moreover as acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 mm to 0 mm in control reactor 4 bp removal efficiency continuously decreased from 28 33 2 35 to 2 12 1 74 confirming the negative effect on 4 bp reduction at low acetate dosage in anaerobic control system with the decrease of acetate dosage from 14 63 to 0 mm phenol concentration in esas effluent firstly decreased from 0 086 0 002 to 0 mm and then increased to 0 037 0 001 mm fig 4a at high acetate dosage the high residual of phenol in esas effluent could be attributed to the competition of alternative electron donor i e acetate towards phenol at low acetate dosage phenol residual in esas effluent could be linked with the suppression of anodic microorganisms in the anaerobic control reactor with the decrease of acetate dosage from 14 63 to 0 mm effluent phenol concentration continuously decreased from 0 121 0 004 to 0 002 0 001 mm which was consistent with the decrease of 4 bp removal efficiency it s worth noting that phenol concentration in esas effluent was always lower than that in the effluent of control reactor when acetate concentration was higher than 2 44 mm providing a key evidence for significant phenol removal in esas in particular under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm more than 85 56 1 46 of 4 bp was removed in esas whereas less than 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp was removed in anaerobic control reactor in addition the operational costs would be significantly affected by acetate usage ratio shen et al 2013 as indicated in fig 4b with acetate dosage decreased from 14 63 to 2 44 mm acetate usage ratios in esas decreased sharply from 12 61 1 31 to 2 26 1 44 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal however in control reactor acetate usage ratios decreased slowly from 44 52 1 55 to 28 45 2 19 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal as acetate dosage decreased from 14 63 to 2 44 mm particularly when 4 88 mm acetate was applied in the influent 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas whereas only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in the anaerobic control reactor in this study acetate usage ratios in the esas were obviously lower than those in anaerobic control reactor indicating the advantage of the esas in terms of low requirement for electron donor as compared with anaerobic control reactors besides the reduced acetate consumption could well compensate the additional cost in the esas caused by the application of electricity the energy consumption in the esas was always less than 0 05 kwh mol 1 4 bp which was significantly lower as compared with electrochemical systems shen et al 2013 especially when acetate dosage was as low as 4 88 mm the energy consumption was only 0 037 0 008 kwh mol 1 4 bp but with a high 4 bp removal rate of 4 64 0 53 mol m 3 d 1 in the esas above results strongly demonstrated the advantage of the esas in terms of process efficiency and operational cost as compared with anaerobic systems as well as electrochemical systems 3 3 long term operation on bioremediation of 4 bp in esas a stable long term performance is of primary concern to realize the commercial application of esas in order to investigate the stability of esas during long term operation esas was operated for another 2 months at cathode potential of 800 mv acetate dosage of 7 32 mm and 4 bp loading rate of 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 phase vi as shown in fig s6 during the 2 months operation complete removal of 4 bp was maintained in esas while phenol was always undetectable in the effluent toc removal efficiency slightly increased from 96 23 on day 325 to 99 34 on day 385 these results confirmed that the stable long term performance for debromination and mineralization of 4 bp could be achieved in esas suggesting that the practical application of esas would be technically feasible for enhanced biotic reduction of halogenated organic compounds in wastewater 3 4 response of microbial community after long term operation 3 4 1 biofilm morphology in order to obtain morphology of the biofilm developed on the electrodes sem analysis was carried out on the blank electrodes and the anodes and cathodes in both reactors after phase vi as indicated in fig 5 the sem images revealed that there was clear biofilm developed on the different electrodes compared to the blank electrodes apparently both cathode and anode in esas had thicker biofilm compared to the anaerobic control reactor what s more only sparse and uneven bacterial community could be found on graphite felt electrode in the anaerobic control reactor probably due to the high toxicity of 4 bp however abundant bacteria were observed on the surface of graphite felt in esas providing more active sites for intermediate mineralization and electron transfer the electrical stimulating effect on biofilm formation in esas was also reported by liu et al 2015 it s worth noting that biofilm can provide a relatively stable environment for the microorganisms enclosed and thus improve the system resistance to toxic substances and environmental fluctuations liu et al 2014 the presence of thicker biofilm would favor the enrichment and retention of functional microorganisms resulting in efficient biodegradation of 4 bp in esas 3 4 2 sequencing and microbial diversity illumina high throughput sequencing of v4 region of 16 s rrna gene was employed to analyze the diversity and structure of microbial community in the biofilm of both reactors after long term operation compared to inoc long time adaption to 4 bp caused obvious decrease in ace otus chao 1 and shannon diversity in aan aca ean and eca table s1 suggesting the reduced abundance and diversity of microbial community in the biofilm of both reactors this result was consistent with the previous findings yu et al 2016 gomes et al 2014 which indicated that the presence of recalcitrant organics induced microbial selection in the analyzed microcosms moreover shannon index of ean and eca were 3 27 and 3 19 respectively while aan and aca showed relatively lower shannon index 2 32 and 2 60 suggesting that bacterial community in esas were more diverse and homogeneous compared to the anaerobic control reactor the high community evenness and diversity of the biofilm in esas would play an important role in resisting environmental stressors such as toxic pollutants zhou et al 2015 in addition five set venn diagram analysis was made to identify the shared otus among the inoc aan aca ean and eca as shown in fig 6 the total otus in the five samples was 781 and 70 otus 8 96 of total otus were shared by them indicating the presence of a continuous core bacterial community in the five samples besides only 49 63 and 47 30 of otus were shared by the anode samples ean and aan and cathode samples eca and aca respectively these results indicated significant difference in community between ean and aan eca and aca which was probably due to the electrical stimulation in esas what s more the shared otus 143 by ean and inoc were higher than the shared otus 107 by aan and inoc which could be attributed to reduced biological toxicity in the anode zone of esas specific difference of community in esas and the anaerobic control reactor were further analyzed through bacterial taxonomic analysis 3 4 3 bacterial taxonomic identification as shown in fig s7 the effect of electrical stimulation on the variation in bacterial community was further verified at the phylum level a comparative analysis found that the abundance of tenericutes the dominant phylum in inoc dropped from 28 37 to 0 46 aan 0 04 ean 0 33 aca and 0 19 eca respectively indicating the inhibition of tenericutes by the toxic 4 bp in the biofilm of aan and aca the major phyla were proteobacteria 71 13 and 38 18 and bacteroidetes 17 49 and 27 91 while in the biofilm of ean and eca proteobacteria 57 34 and 33 42 thermotogae 12 07 and 17 14 spirochaetes 9 32 and 7 63 and bacteroidetes 8 76 and 15 98 were the dominant bacterial phyla these results showed that the bacterial community in esas were phylogenetically diverse as compared to the anaerobic control reactor at the phylum level both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were reported to be the predominant phyla responsible for dehalogenation of halogenated compounds yoshida et al 2005 lu et al 2012 liu et al 2013 however the abundance of these two phyla in ean an eca were obviously lower than those in aan and aca which could be attributed to the enrichment of spirochaetes and thermotogae in esas spirochaetes which has been found to be dominant in esas was capable of metabolizing various substrate such as glucose and acetate for electricity generation xu et al 2018 li et al 2018 the phylum thermotogae could utilize several complex carbohydrates such as cellulose and phenolic compounds for hydrogen production barros et al 2017 hierarchical clustering analysis at genus level was used to further identify the difference in community structure and function among the five samples after feeding with 4 bp for 385 days flavobacterium 5 01 aan 7 75 aca kosmotoga 2 30 aan 2 56 aca syntrophus 2 19 aan 1 87 aca blvii28 0 93 aan 3 51 aca bosea 0 71 aan 1 08 aca and treponema 1 02 aan 0 60 aca were dominant in the anaerobic control reactor table s2 besides fermentative bacteria paludibacter 2 50 zhang et al 2013 were abundant in aca while the non methanotrophic genus leptonema 2 28 kim et al 2014 was abundant in aan both flavobacterium and bosea were heterotrophic dehalogenation species low et al 2016 balaban et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 which accounted for the debromination of 4 bp kosmotoga a member of the phylum thermotogae was reported to be mainly responsible for fermentation or hydrolysis of complex substances barros et al 2017 gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 syntrophus was reported to be involved in the transformation of phenol and benzoate chen et al 2008 blvii28 accounted for the decomposition of carbohydrates to hydrogen and low molecular acids which served as the electron donor for the dehalogenation species yu et al 2017 in esas kosmotoga 12 03 ean 17 13 eca syntrophus 3 76 ean 2 34 eca blvii28 1 70 ean 4 80 eca treponema 2 96 ean 1 51 eca desulfovibrio 0 91 ean 12 07 eca sphaerochaeta 6 02 ean 5 21 eca arcobacter 2 69 ean 1 43 eca and comamonas 0 97 ean 1 16 eca flavobacterium 0 72 ean 1 21 eca bosea 0 60 ean 1 14 eca and thiobacillus 1 02 ean 0 18 eca were found to be the dominant species table s2 although the same inoculum was shared community structures of aan and ean fig 7 a aca and eca fig 7b were quite different from each other the abundances of kosmotoga desulfovibrio syntrophus comamonas arcobacter and sphaerochaeta in esas were obviously higher than those in the anaerobic control reactor while the abundances of flavobacterium paludibacter and leptonema in esas were much lower than those in anaerobic control reactor the low abundance of flavobacterium in the cathode of esas indicated that heterotrophic debromination was inhibited due to the electrical stimulation desulfovibrio which was an autotrophic species having dehalogenation capability sun et al 2000 lee et al 2011 might account for the enhanced debromination of 4 bp in the cathode of esas additionally desulfovibrio species in the biofilm of anode was reported to be able to degrade phenol using the electrode as the electron acceptor ailijiang et al 2016 kosmotoga which was the most abundant genus in the cathode of esas might be responsible for autotrophic debromination of 4 bp using fermented hydrogen the abundance of kosmotoga in the anode might account for the enhanced biodegradation of phenol in esas barros et al 2017 franchi et al 2018 syntrophus was reported to be involved in the transformation of phenol and benzoate chen et al 2008 the high abundances of syntrophus in esas might account for the enhanced mineralization of phenol the genus comamonas which was an electrogenic species could catabolize phenol or catechol by a meta cleavage pathway arai et al 2000 zhao and kong 2018 indicated that the dominance of comamonas in mfc anodic community was mainly attributed to the generation of electricity besides it was documented that arcobacter was frequently observed in the anode sediment of esas showing excellent performance in terms of electron transfer and bio current generation using acetate as the electron donor yu et al 2016 sphaerochaeta has been found to be dominant in esas which could be attributed to its important role in hydrogen production and electricity generation xu et al 2018 treponema was homoacetogen capable of reducing carbon dioxide to acetate using hydrogen as electron donor gao et al 2014 the autotrophic thiobacillus could oxidize hydrogen and inorganic compound such as s2 mateos et al 2018 alcántara et al 2004 hydrogen generated by cathode in esas probably facilitated the growth of treponema and thiobacillus as a result heterotrophic dehalogenation species flavobacterium and bosea phenol degradation related species kosmotoga and syntrophus and fermentative species blvii28 and paludibacter were enriched in the anaerobic control reactor analogous to other traditional anaerobic reduction system 4 bp debromination in the anaerobic control reactor mainly followed the heterotrophic pathway using acetate and other fermented low molecule organic compounds as electron donors yu et al 2017 however in comparison to the anaerobic control reactor the electrical stimulation in esas distinctly facilitated the growth of autotrophic dehalogenation species desulfovibrio phenol biodegradation related species kosmotoga syntrophus and comamonas fermentative species kosmotoga blvii28 and sphaerochaeta homoacetogens thiobacillus and treponema and electrochemically active species arcobacter sphaerochaeta and comamonas which contributed to the enhanced 4 bp reduction mineralization as well as electron transfer in esas the up flow esas not only favored the selection of autotrophic dehalogenation species but also was beneficial for the enrichment of some species involved in competitive and symbiotic microbial relationship 3 5 possible metabolism mechanism dominating 4 bp degradation gc ms analysis was used to further identify the main biodegradation intermediates of 4 bp in esas and anaerobic control reactor the mass spectra of 4 bp and its degradation intermediates after derivatization by bsa n o bis trimethylsilyl acetamide are shown in fig s8 in esas phenol benzoate succinic acid and pyruvate was identified as the main intermediates of 4 bp however only two intermediates namely phenol and benzoate were identified in the anaerobic control reactor besides catechol which was also presumed to be involved in phenol biodegradation zhou et al 2016 was undetectable in both esas and the anaerobic control reactor in addition the production of biogas such as h2 ch4 and co2 in esas was obviously higher than that in the anaerobic control reactor fig s9 indicating the key role of electricity stimulation on fermentative species based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis described above it could be inferred that both 4 bp and phenol in esas was metabolized through two different pathways fig 8 in the cathode of esas 4 bp was firstly reduced to phenol by the dehalogenation species on one hand the heterotrophic dehalogenation species namely flavobacterium and bosea were presumably involved in 4 bp biotransformation in the cathode utilizing acetate as the carbon source and electron donor on the other hand 4 bp could be reduced by the autotrophic dehalogenation species namely desulfovibrio enriched in the cathode of esas through autotrophic pathway using fermented hydrogen and electrons from the cathode electrode as the electron donor yu et al 2017 also reported that microbial dehalogenation could be enhanced by the direct use of electrons supplied by cathode then phenol in the anode could be converted to benzoate by phenol degradation species namely syntrophus and then to acetate and hydrogen by fermentative species phenol might also be oxidized by the anode at least to some extent with monohydroxylation occurred at the ortho position to generate catechol zhou et al 2016 then the phenyl rings of catechol broke up by phenol degradation species namely comamonas through a meta cleavage pathway to give the formation of succinic acid pyruvate and finally to co2 ch4 and h2 in the anode with the help of the abundant fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species arai et al 2000 the electrochemically active species transferred the electrons from hydrogen and acetate oxidized by fermentative species to the anode while methanogen used the co2 and hydrogen produced by the electrochemically active species and fermentative species to produce ch4 in the anaerobic control reactor heterotrophic dehalogenation species such as flavobacterium and bosea utilized the electron donors to reduce 4 bp to phenol which could only be partially transferred to benzoate acid it could be concluded that syntrophic interactions among the abundant functional communities in esas remarkably affected the metabolism pathway of 4 bp biodegradation 4 conclusions in this study an up flow electricity stimulated anaerobic system esas was designed to enhance anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp with enriched functional microorganisms regulated by electrical stimulation debrominated product i e phenol could be completely utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of esas besides under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas however only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in the anaerobic control reactor the up flow esas facilitated the growth of autotrophic dehalogenation species phenol biodegradation related species fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species which contributed to the enhanced 4 bp reduction and mineralization overall this study provided new insight for the development of efficient and economic ways to enhance mineralization of

18841,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability besides the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process which are still toxic required further energy intensive aerobic post treatment in this study an up flow electricity stimulated anaerobic system esas was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bromophenol 4 bp when cathode potential was 600 mv high toc removal efficiency 98 78 0 96 complete removal of 4 bp and phenol could be achieved at 4 bp loading rate of 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 suggesting debrominated product of 4 bp from cathode i e phenol would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of esas under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas whereas only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in control reactor besides electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species phenol degradation related species fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in esas moreover based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp in esas was proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic reduction debromination electrochemical stimulation microbial community mineralization 1 introduction anaerobic reduction process is regarded as a promising alternative for the removal of halogenated organic compounds where these toxic contaminants can be reductively transformed to less toxic metabolites by co metabolism li et al 2015 however the traditional anaerobic treatment system is confined by its relatively long reaction time poor stability for toxic contaminants and high demand of electron donor to promote the necessary reductive condition xu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 peng et al 2013 zu et al 2012 the use of electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism for anaerobic reduction of diverse contaminants including nitroaromatics jiang et al 2016a and 2016b halogenated compounds liang et al 2019 xu et al 2016 azo dyes cui et al 2014 2016 and nitrate feng et al 2015 sevda et al 2018 is attracting increasing attention compared with the traditional anaerobic processes reductive biodegradation of various pollutants in these electricity stimulated anaerobic systems esas could be significantly reinforced jiang et al 2018 by far esas developed in previous studies was mainly focused on the reduction but not mineralization of various recalcitrant contaminants such as halogenated organic compounds zhang and angelidaki 2014 the reductive intermediates or products formed in esas which were still toxic to the environment required further energy intensive aerobic post treatment problems are supposed to be resolved if anaerobic reduction in the cathode can be achieved followed by further mineralization of reductive products in the bioanode more importantly whether the reductive products of various recalcitrant pollutants such as halogenated organic compounds can be further mineralized and utilized as electron donor in the bioanode is a vital problem determining the operational costs of esas since additional electron donor is often required in order to achieve high dehalogenation efficiency however up to now it remains a challenge to achieve simultaneous bioremediation and mineralization of halogenated organic compounds in esas theoretically the reductive products of halogenated organic compounds from the cathode may be able to be utilized as bioanodic fuels in esas firstly the introduced anode in esas can serve as electron sink to accept electrons via extracellular electron transfer leading to improved degradation efficiency of recalcitrant compounds yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 has demonstrated the feasibility to use quinoline as the sole anodic fuel to enhance quinoline biodegradation and power generation simultaneously secondly applied external voltage or current can help realize thermodynamically unfavorable reactions for example electron acceptor with low reduction potential can be reduced efficiently at the cathode and substrate with high reduction potential can be oxidized effectively at the anode sulonen et al 2017 in our previous work both pyridine biodegradation and system stability could be remarkably improved in esas with the assistant of 0 3 ma direct current jiang et al 2018 thirdly the application of electrical stimulation has the significant impact on the structure of functional microbial community and retention of biomass which is critical for the degradation of recalcitrant organics ailijiang et al 2016 found that intermittent direct current could enrich bacteria species in the biofilm of anode for aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic biodegradation leading to improved treatment efficiency of phenol containing wastewater based on the concerns described above an up flow membrane free esas was designed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic dehalogenation and mineralization of halogenated organic compounds 4 bromphenol 4 bp which is attracting serious environmental concern due to its high toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation was chosen as the model halogenated organic compound li et al 2015 sim et al 2009 it was found that simultaneous debromination and mineralization of 4 bp could be effectively achieved in this up flow membrane free esas the effects of 4 bp loading rate applied cathodic potential and acetate dosage on the reactor performance were investigated moreover long term applicability of simultaneous bioremediation and mineralization of 4 bp in esas was further studied in addition the difference of microbial communities in both esas and control reactor were explored and compared in order to understand the key role of electrical stimulation on the enrichment of functional microbial communities finally possible debromination and mineralization mechanism for 4 bp in the up flow esas was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration two identical cylindrical reactors made of acrylic plastic with inner diameter of 6 cm height of 72 cm and working volume of 660 ml were used as esas and anaerobic control reactor in this study as shown in fig s1 both reactors were designed by installing cathode underneath and anode above graphite granules with diameter of 2 6 mm were filled in the bottom of the reactors as cathodes graphite felts 40 cm 15 cm 1 cm which were rolled up to a cylinder were installed at the upper portion of the reactors as the anodes to allow even distribution of the influent plates with evenly spaced holes were installed at the bottom of the cathode and anode cathode and anode chambers in both esas and anaerobic control reactor were placed in 3 cm apart prior to use both graphite granules and felts were pretreated according to the procedure described by chen et al 2017 two titanium wires 1 5 mm in diameter were inserted into both the anodic and cathodic compartments to allow external circuit connection the anode was connected to the cathode through a potentiostat bio logic science instruments vmp3 france for potential control the generated current cathode potentials and anode potentials were automatically recorded by the potentiostat ag agcl reference electrode assumed 0 197 v vs she was placed between the anode and cathode for the measurement of half potentials it should be noted that all potentials reported throughout this paper were referred to ag agcl electrode assumed 0 197 v vs she if not otherwise stated 2 2 reactor operation the influent composition was as follows na2hpo4 12h2o 3 06 g l 1 kh2po4 0

influent was autoclaved at 120 c for 40 min and purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen sludge collected from an anaerobic reactor treating nitrobenzene containing wastewater was inoculated into both reactors at initial mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 8 5 g l 1 the temperature of both reactors was maintained at 35 2 c using water jacket throughout the experimental period the experimental period was divided into six phases and the experimental conditions for each phase are summarized in table 1 in phase i i e start up phase both esas and anaerobic control reactor were firstly operated in open circuit mode at 4 bp loading rate of 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 and acetate dosage of 7 32 mm in phase ii the circuit of esas was closed with the cathodic potential adjusted to 600 mv step by step within 24 h and kept for 20 days while anaerobic control reactor was still operated in open circuit mode in phase iii the cathodic potential of esas was adjusted from 600 to 1000 mv where 4 bp loading rate and acetate dosage were maintained at 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 and 7 32 mm respectively in phase iv the influent 4 bp concentration was increased from 0 29 to 1 45 mm with the corresponding 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 58 up to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 in order to evaluate the ability of esas and anaerobic control reactor when suffering from high 4 bp loading rate cathode potential was set as 800 mv and acetate dosage was remained at 7 32 mm in this phase in phase v in order to investigate the effect of acetate dosage on 4 bp removal phenol formation and electron donor requirement acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 to 0 mm at 4 bp loading rate of 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and cathode potential of 800 mv in phase vi in order to investigate the system stability of esas and control reactor acetate dosage was recovered to 7 32 mm for 60 days while 4 bp loading rate and cathode potential were controlled at 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 and 800 mv respectively after reaching a stable performance sludge samples were taken from both anode and cathode in both reactors to characterize the biofilm morphology and microbial community structure 2 3 analytical methods both 4 bp and phenol were identified and quantified by waters 2695 hplc equipped with an xbridge c18 column 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm and a diode array detector through authentic standard biogas composition was analyzed by gas chromatography agilent 6820 agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector using molecular sieve 5 a 60 80 mesh column as the separation column n2 was used as carrier gas and the operation temperatures of the injection port oven and detector were set at 100 c 90 c and 125 c respectively total organic carbon toc was measured on a toc analyzer vario toc elementar german bromide iron br concentration was detected with ionic chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa biodegradation intermediates of 4 bp were identified by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 7890 a gc 5975c msd hp 5ms column agilent usa according to chen et al 2017 samples for gc ms analysis were pretreated according to wu et al 2016 electrochemical monitoring was carried out according to liang et al 2019 cyclic voltammogram cv analysis was carried out in 4 bp abiotic electrochemical reduction system using graphite electrode and n2 saturated buffer ph 7 0 containing 100 mg l 1 4 bp at a potential scan rate of 1 mv s 14 bp removal efficiencies and toc removal efficiencies were evaluated based on the difference of 4 bp and toc concentrations between influent and effluent co substrate usage ratio i e acetate usage ratio mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal and coulombic efficiency ce for 4 bp reduction at the cathode were calculated according to shen et al 2013 4 bp removal rate and the energy consumption in the esas were calculated according to shen et al 2014 biofilm morphology was observed on a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250feg fei usa anodic and cathodic biofilm samples taken from the two reactors were pre treated as described previously chen et al 2017 five samples for high throughput sequencing were tagged as aan and aca collected from the anode and cathode of the anaerobic control reactor ean and eca collected from the anode and cathode of esas and inoc inocula sludge respectively dna extraction pcr amplification and data analysis were performed in accordance to jiang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up procedure as shown in fig s2 during start up phase 4 bp removal efficiencies within the first two days in both reactors were higher than those in the following 10 days probably due to the adsorption of 4 bp by activated sludge graphite granules and graphite felt however 4 bp removal efficiencies in both reactors decreased sharply to around 54 on day 3 probably due to the saturation of adsorption thereafter 4 bp removal efficiencies in the both reactors gradually increased to around 70 on day 7 which could be attributed to the acclimatization of microorganisms involved in both reactors up to day 10 no significant difference in terms of 4 bp removal between the two reactors could be observed the slight variation of 4 bp removal efficiency after day 7 indicated a steady status of both reactors at open circuit on day 11 the circuit of esas was closed with cathode potential controlled at 600 mv after day 20 toc removal efficiency 4 bp removal efficiency and br concentration in esas increased to 98 78 0 96 100 and 0 282 0 004 mm respectively which were much higher than 66 19 2 48 71 15 1 06 and 0 198 0 005 mm in the anaerobic control reactor fig 1 more importantly phenol concentration in esas effluent was undetectable while it was 0 151 0 007 mm in the effluent of control reactor suggesting that debromination product of 4 bp from cathode i e phenol would be utilized as the fuel at the bioanode of esas as a consequence the feasibility of simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp in the up flow esas was validated 3 2 effects of key operational parameters 3 2 1 cathodic potential during phase iii the effect of cathodic potential on reactor performance was investigated within cathodic potential range from 600 mv to 1000 mv as demonstrated in fig s3 as cathodic potential was reduced from 600 mv to 1000 mv the current density and the anodic potential increased from 1 34 0 03 a m 3 and 432 75 2 98 mv to 8 52 0 15 a m 3 and 94 46 10 28 mv respectively lower cathodic potential resulted in higher current density and anode potential which was consistent with our previous study shen et al 2014 when the cathodic potential was decreased from 600 mv to 1000 mv 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies in esas increased from 91 19 1 82 and 87 09 1 89 100 and 97 79 1 39 respectively fig 2 a however 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies in control reactor were only 66 21 2 41 and 65 19 2 48 which were much lower than those in esas moreover concentration profiles of the main degradation product of 4 bp i e phenol and br were shown in fig 2b phenol concentration in control reactor was 0 241 0 019 mm while only 0 072 0 013 mm in esas at the cathode potential of 600 mv with the further decrease of cathode potential in esas phenol concentration decreased from 0 072 0 013 mm 0 mm while br concentration increased and reached a plateau when the cathodic potential was below 750 mv high br release efficiency in esas was accompanied by high 4 bp removal efficiency indicating the formation of phenol as the main reductive product of 4 bp however probably due to the further biotransformation of phenol in the anode phenol was undetectable in esas at cathodic potential below 800 mv in order to further evaluate the effect of cathodic potential on 4 bp removal cv analysis was carried out in 4 bp abiotic electrochemical reduction system as shown in fig s4 an obvious reduction peak at about 1 1 v could be observed in the cv curve which was responsible for the transformation of 4 bp to phenol however the cathodic potential of the esas for 4 bp reduction used in this study was more positive than that in abiotic electrochemical system indicating that microorganisms would likely play an important role in 4 bp degradation as the biocatalyst in this study more negative cathodic potential was more favorable to 4 bp removal toc removal and phenol degradation probably because of the fact that reductive microenvironment in cathodic zone and oxidative microenvironment in anodic zone could be created at more negative cathodic potentials shen et al 2013 when the cathodic potential was below 800 mv hydrogen might be generated around the cathode marshall et al 2013 which could also be used as the electron donor to promote 4 bp reduction by autotrophic species cheng et al 2015 found that exposure of oxygen to bioanode facilitated the biodegradation of recalcitrant aniline in microbial fuel cells which could be attributed to the enrichment of aerobic aniline degrading bacteria and anode respiration bacteria however oxygen generation on the anode was undetectable in this study probably due to the negative potential of the anode senftle et al 2010 3 2 2 4 bp loading rate as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 93 mol m 3 d 1 on day 55 4 bp removal efficiencies in both esas and anaerobic control reactor were sharply decreased and then gradually recovered to 98 47 1 04 after day 67 in esas while only 65 48 1 05 after day 65 in anaerobic control reactor respectively thereafter 4 bp removal efficiency was maintained at around 99 49 0 63 in esas despite of the increase of 4 bp loading rate up to 2 31 mol m 3 d 1 as 4 bp loading rate further increased to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 4 bp removal efficiency was slightly decreased to 87 50 1 52 in esas however as 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 93 mol m 3 d 1 to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 4 bp removal efficiency in control reactor significantly decreased from 65 48 1 05 to 12 50 2 42 suggesting the poor debromination performance in the anaerobic control reactor especially at high 4 bp loading rate interestingly as shown in fig 3b almost no phenol was detectable in esas effluent at various 4 bp loading rates probably due to the low cathodic potential used during phase iv 800 mv in the anaerobic control reactor with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 mol m 3 d 1 to 1 73 mol m 3 d 1 effluent phenol concentration gradually increased from 0 151 0 007 mm to 0 292 0 011 mm however further increase of 4 bp loading rate to 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 resulted in the decrease of effluent phenol concentration to 0 059 0 011 mm which was consistent with the low 4 bp removal efficiency during this period these results suggested that 4 bp removal phenol mineralization as well as system stability could be promoted by electrical stimulation especially at high loading rate besides as shown in fig s5 with the increase of 4 bp loading rate from 0 58 to 2 31 mol m 3 d 1 ce for 4 bp reduction at the cathode increased from 26 59 3 45 to 94 36 4 58 especially ce for 4 bp reduction at 4 bp loading rate of 2 89 mol m 3 d 1 reached up to higher than 100 this might be due to the fact that 4 bp was not only reduced by the electrons from the cathode but also by anaerobic organisms using acetate as the electron donor under high acetate dosage in the influent similar phenomenon was also observed in an up flow biocatalyzed electrolysis reactor by wang et al 2012 where direct anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene resulted in ce values higher than 100 the loss of electrons in the cathode could be attributed to the side reactions in cathode zone such as hydrogen generation which consumed some electrons transferred from the anode 3 2 3 acetate dosage the dosage of the electron donor i e acetate played a key role in 4 bp reduction and phenol mineralization as indicated in fig 4 a when acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 to 4 88 mm 4 bp removal efficiency maintained at the level as high as 100 in esas however as acetate concentration was further decreased from 2 44 to 0 mm 4 bp removal efficiency reduced from 93 01 2 57 to 85 56 1 45 which could be attributed to the lack of sufficient electron donor under such conditions in addition with the decrease of acetate dosage from 2 44 to 0 mm anodic potential increased from 285 79 15 36 mv suggesting that the electrochemically active microorganisms on the anode might be seriously suppressed liang et al 2019 shen et al 2014 moreover as acetate dosage was reduced from 14 63 mm to 0 mm in control reactor 4 bp removal efficiency continuously decreased from 28 33 2 35 to 2 12 1 74 confirming the negative effect on 4 bp reduction at low acetate dosage in anaerobic control system with the decrease of acetate dosage from 14 63 to 0 mm phenol concentration in esas effluent firstly decreased from 0 086 0 002 to 0 mm and then increased to 0 037 0 001 mm fig 4a at high acetate dosage the high residual of phenol in esas effluent could be attributed to the competition of alternative electron donor i e acetate towards phenol at low acetate dosage phenol residual in esas effluent could be linked with the suppression of anodic microorganisms in the anaerobic control reactor with the decrease of acetate dosage from 14 63 to 0 mm effluent phenol concentration continuously decreased from 0 121 0 004 to 0 002 0 001 mm which was consistent with the decrease of 4 bp removal efficiency it s worth noting that phenol concentration in esas effluent was always lower than that in the effluent of control reactor when acetate concentration was higher than 2 44 mm providing a key evidence for significant phenol removal in esas in particular under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm more than 85 56 1 46 of 4 bp was removed in esas whereas less than 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp was removed in anaerobic control reactor in addition the operational costs would be significantly affected by acetate usage ratio shen et al 2013 as indicated in fig 4b with acetate dosage decreased from 14 63 to 2 44 mm acetate usage ratios in esas decreased sharply from 12 61 1 31 to 2 26 1 44 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal however in control reactor acetate usage ratios decreased slowly from 44 52 1 55 to 28 45 2 19 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal as acetate dosage decreased from 14 63 to 2 44 mm particularly when 4 88 mm acetate was applied in the influent 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas whereas only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in the anaerobic control reactor in this study acetate usage ratios in the esas were obviously lower than those in anaerobic control reactor indicating the advantage of the esas in terms of low requirement for electron donor as compared with anaerobic control reactors besides the reduced acetate consumption could well compensate the additional cost in the esas caused by the application of electricity the energy consumption in the esas was always less than 0 05 kwh mol 1 4 bp which was significantly lower as compared with electrochemical systems shen et al 2013 especially when acetate dosage was as low as 4 88 mm the energy consumption was only 0 037 0 008 kwh mol 1 4 bp but with a high 4 bp removal rate of 4 64 0 53 mol m 3 d 1 in the esas above results strongly demonstrated the advantage of the esas in terms of process efficiency and operational cost as compared with anaerobic systems as well as electrochemical systems 3 3 long term operation on bioremediation of 4 bp in esas a stable long term performance is of primary concern to realize the commercial application of esas in order to investigate the stability of esas during long term operation esas was operated for another 2 months at cathode potential of 800 mv acetate dosage of 7 32 mm and 4 bp loading rate of 1 16 mol m 3 d 1 phase vi as shown in fig s6 during the 2 months operation complete removal of 4 bp was maintained in esas while phenol was always undetectable in the effluent toc removal efficiency slightly increased from 96 23 on day 325 to 99 34 on day 385 these results confirmed that the stable long term performance for debromination and mineralization of 4 bp could be achieved in esas suggesting that the practical application of esas would be technically feasible for enhanced biotic reduction of halogenated organic compounds in wastewater 3 4 response of microbial community after long term operation 3 4 1 biofilm morphology in order to obtain morphology of the biofilm developed on the electrodes sem analysis was carried out on the blank electrodes and the anodes and cathodes in both reactors after phase vi as indicated in fig 5 the sem images revealed that there was clear biofilm developed on the different electrodes compared to the blank electrodes apparently both cathode and anode in esas had thicker biofilm compared to the anaerobic control reactor what s more only sparse and uneven bacterial community could be found on graphite felt electrode in the anaerobic control reactor probably due to the high toxicity of 4 bp however abundant bacteria were observed on the surface of graphite felt in esas providing more active sites for intermediate mineralization and electron transfer the electrical stimulating effect on biofilm formation in esas was also reported by liu et al 2015 it s worth noting that biofilm can provide a relatively stable environment for the microorganisms enclosed and thus improve the system resistance to toxic substances and environmental fluctuations liu et al 2014 the presence of thicker biofilm would favor the enrichment and retention of functional microorganisms resulting in efficient biodegradation of 4 bp in esas 3 4 2 sequencing and microbial diversity illumina high throughput sequencing of v4 region of 16 s rrna gene was employed to analyze the diversity and structure of microbial community in the biofilm of both reactors after long term operation compared to inoc long time adaption to 4 bp caused obvious decrease in ace otus chao 1 and shannon diversity in aan aca ean and eca table s1 suggesting the reduced abundance and diversity of microbial community in the biofilm of both reactors this result was consistent with the previous findings yu et al 2016 gomes et al 2014 which indicated that the presence of recalcitrant organics induced microbial selection in the analyzed microcosms moreover shannon index of ean and eca were 3 27 and 3 19 respectively while aan and aca showed relatively lower shannon index 2 32 and 2 60 suggesting that bacterial community in esas were more diverse and homogeneous compared to the anaerobic control reactor the high community evenness and diversity of the biofilm in esas would play an important role in resisting environmental stressors such as toxic pollutants zhou et al 2015 in addition five set venn diagram analysis was made to identify the shared otus among the inoc aan aca ean and eca as shown in fig 6 the total otus in the five samples was 781 and 70 otus 8 96 of total otus were shared by them indicating the presence of a continuous core bacterial community in the five samples besides only 49 63 and 47 30 of otus were shared by the anode samples ean and aan and cathode samples eca and aca respectively these results indicated significant difference in community between ean and aan eca and aca which was probably due to the electrical stimulation in esas what s more the shared otus 143 by ean and inoc were higher than the shared otus 107 by aan and inoc which could be attributed to reduced biological toxicity in the anode zone of esas specific difference of community in esas and the anaerobic control reactor were further analyzed through bacterial taxonomic analysis 3 4 3 bacterial taxonomic identification as shown in fig s7 the effect of electrical stimulation on the variation in bacterial community was further verified at the phylum level a comparative analysis found that the abundance of tenericutes the dominant phylum in inoc dropped from 28 37 to 0 46 aan 0 04 ean 0 33 aca and 0 19 eca respectively indicating the inhibition of tenericutes by the toxic 4 bp in the biofilm of aan and aca the major phyla were proteobacteria 71 13 and 38 18 and bacteroidetes 17 49 and 27 91 while in the biofilm of ean and eca proteobacteria 57 34 and 33 42 thermotogae 12 07 and 17 14 spirochaetes 9 32 and 7 63 and bacteroidetes 8 76 and 15 98 were the dominant bacterial phyla these results showed that the bacterial community in esas were phylogenetically diverse as compared to the anaerobic control reactor at the phylum level both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were reported to be the predominant phyla responsible for dehalogenation of halogenated compounds yoshida et al 2005 lu et al 2012 liu et al 2013 however the abundance of these two phyla in ean an eca were obviously lower than those in aan and aca which could be attributed to the enrichment of spirochaetes and thermotogae in esas spirochaetes which has been found to be dominant in esas was capable of metabolizing various substrate such as glucose and acetate for electricity generation xu et al 2018 li et al 2018 the phylum thermotogae could utilize several complex carbohydrates such as cellulose and phenolic compounds for hydrogen production barros et al 2017 hierarchical clustering analysis at genus level was used to further identify the difference in community structure and function among the five samples after feeding with 4 bp for 385 days flavobacterium 5 01 aan 7 75 aca kosmotoga 2 30 aan 2 56 aca syntrophus 2 19 aan 1 87 aca blvii28 0 93 aan 3 51 aca bosea 0 71 aan 1 08 aca and treponema 1 02 aan 0 60 aca were dominant in the anaerobic control reactor table s2 besides fermentative bacteria paludibacter 2 50 zhang et al 2013 were abundant in aca while the non methanotrophic genus leptonema 2 28 kim et al 2014 was abundant in aan both flavobacterium and bosea were heterotrophic dehalogenation species low et al 2016 balaban et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 which accounted for the debromination of 4 bp kosmotoga a member of the phylum thermotogae was reported to be mainly responsible for fermentation or hydrolysis of complex substances barros et al 2017 gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 syntrophus was reported to be involved in the transformation of phenol and benzoate chen et al 2008 blvii28 accounted for the decomposition of carbohydrates to hydrogen and low molecular acids which served as the electron donor for the dehalogenation species yu et al 2017 in esas kosmotoga 12 03 ean 17 13 eca syntrophus 3 76 ean 2 34 eca blvii28 1 70 ean 4 80 eca treponema 2 96 ean 1

thiobacillus 1 02 ean 0 18 eca were found to be the dominant species table s2 although the same inoculum was shared community structures of aan and ean fig 7 a aca and eca fig 7b were quite different from each other the abundances of kosmotoga desulfovibrio syntrophus comamonas arcobacter and sphaerochaeta in esas were obviously higher than those in the anaerobic control reactor while the abundances of flavobacterium paludibacter and leptonema in esas were much lower than those in anaerobic control reactor the low abundance of flavobacterium in the cathode of esas indicated that heterotrophic debromination was inhibited due to the electrical stimulation desulfovibrio which was an autotrophic species having dehalogenation capability sun et al 2000 lee et al 2011 might account for the enhanced debromination of 4 bp in the cathode of esas additionally desulfovibrio species in the biofilm of anode was reported to be able to degrade phenol using the electrode as the electron acceptor ailijiang et al 2016 kosmotoga which was the most abundant genus in the cathode of esas might be responsible for autotrophic debromination of 4 bp using fermented hydrogen the abundance of kosmotoga in the anode might account for the enhanced biodegradation of phenol in esas barros et al 2017 franchi et al 2018 syntrophus was reported to be involved in the transformation of phenol and benzoate chen et al 2008 the high abundances of syntrophus in esas might account for the enhanced mineralization of phenol the genus comamonas which was an electrogenic species could catabolize phenol or catechol by a meta cleavage pathway arai et al 2000 zhao and kong 2018 indicated that the dominance of comamonas in mfc anodic community was mainly attributed to the generation of electricity besides it was documented that arcobacter was frequently observed in the anode sediment of esas showing excellent performance in terms of electron transfer and bio current generation using acetate as the electron donor yu et al 2016 sphaerochaeta has been found to be dominant in esas which could be attributed to its important role in hydrogen production and electricity generation xu et al 2018 treponema was homoacetogen capable of reducing carbon dioxide to acetate using hydrogen as electron donor gao et al 2014 the autotrophic thiobacillus could oxidize hydrogen and inorganic compound such as s2 mateos et al 2018 alcántara et al 2004 hydrogen generated by cathode in esas probably facilitated the growth of treponema and thiobacillus as a result heterotrophic dehalogenation species flavobacterium and bosea phenol degradation related species kosmotoga and syntrophus and fermentative species blvii28 and paludibacter were enriched in the anaerobic control reactor analogous to other traditional anaerobic reduction system 4 bp debromination in the anaerobic control reactor mainly followed the heterotrophic pathway using acetate and other fermented low molecule organic compounds as electron donors yu et al 2017 however in comparison to the anaerobic control reactor the electrical stimulation in esas distinctly facilitated the growth of autotrophic dehalogenation species desulfovibrio phenol biodegradation related species kosmotoga syntrophus and comamonas fermentative species kosmotoga blvii28 and sphaerochaeta homoacetogens thiobacillus and treponema and electrochemically active species arcobacter sphaerochaeta and comamonas which contributed to the enhanced 4 bp reduction mineralization as well as electron transfer in esas the up flow esas not only favored the selection of autotrophic dehalogenation species but also was beneficial for the enrichment of some species involved in competitive and symbiotic microbial relationship 3 5 possible metabolism mechanism dominating 4 bp degradation gc ms analysis was used to further identify the main biodegradation intermediates of 4 bp in esas and anaerobic control reactor the mass spectra of 4 bp and its degradation intermediates after derivatization by bsa n o bis trimethylsilyl acetamide are shown in fig s8 in esas phenol benzoate succinic acid and pyruvate was identified as the main intermediates of 4 bp however only two intermediates namely phenol and benzoate were identified in the anaerobic control reactor besides catechol which was also presumed to be involved in phenol biodegradation zhou et al 2016 was undetectable in both esas and the anaerobic control reactor in addition the production of biogas such as h2 ch4 and co2 in esas was obviously higher than that in the anaerobic control reactor fig s9 indicating the key role of electricity stimulation on fermentative species based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis described above it could be inferred that both 4 bp and phenol in esas was metabolized through two different pathways fig 8 in the cathode of esas 4 bp was firstly reduced to phenol by the dehalogenation species on one hand the heterotrophic dehalogenation species namely flavobacterium and bosea were presumably involved in 4 bp biotransformation in the cathode utilizing acetate as the carbon source and electron donor on the other hand 4 bp could be reduced by the autotrophic dehalogenation species namely desulfovibrio enriched in the cathode of esas through autotrophic pathway using fermented hydrogen and electrons from the cathode electrode as the electron donor yu et al 2017 also reported that microbial dehalogenation could be enhanced by the direct use of electrons supplied by cathode then phenol in the anode could be converted to benzoate by phenol degradation species namely syntrophus and then to acetate and hydrogen by fermentative species phenol might also be oxidized by the anode at least to some extent with monohydroxylation occurred at the ortho position to generate catechol zhou et al 2016 then the phenyl rings of catechol broke up by phenol degradation species namely comamonas through a meta cleavage pathway to give the formation of succinic acid pyruvate and finally to co2 ch4 and h2 in the anode with the help of the abundant fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species arai et al 2000 the electrochemically active species transferred the electrons from hydrogen and acetate oxidized by fermentative species to the anode while methanogen used the co2 and hydrogen produced by the electrochemically active species and fermentative species to produce ch4 in the anaerobic control reactor heterotrophic dehalogenation species such as flavobacterium and bosea utilized the electron donors to reduce 4 bp to phenol which could only be partially transferred to benzoate acid it could be concluded that syntrophic interactions among the abundant functional communities in esas remarkably affected the metabolism pathway of 4 bp biodegradation 4 conclusions in this study an up flow electricity stimulated anaerobic system esas was designed to enhance anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4 bp with enriched functional microorganisms regulated by electrical stimulation debrominated product i e phenol could be completely utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of esas besides under high 4 bp loading rate 2 32 mol m 3 d 1 and low electron donor dosage 4 88 mm 4 bp could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4 21 1 42 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in esas however only 13 45 1 38 of 4 bp could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31 28 3 38 mol acetate mol 1 4 bp removal in the anaerobic control reactor the up flow esas facilitated the growth of autotrophic dehalogenation species phenol biodegradation related species fermentative species homoacetogens and electrochemically active species which contributed to the enhanced 4 bp reduction and mineralization overall this study provided new insight for the development of efficient and economic ways to enhance mineralization of

18842,bisphenol a bpa is a semi persistent environmental endocrine disrupter and widely present in aqueous environments electrochemical detection is an effective method to monitor pollutants like bpa in aqueous environments however the electrode fouling from anodic polymeric products is one main barrier of electrochemical sensors for their practical applications in this work a renewable electrochemical sensor was rationally designed constructed and tested for efficient bpa detection the tio2 anodic material was surface engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites with tailored morphological shape exposed facet and crystal structure this electrode could be activated mainly as an electrochemical catalyst and partially as a photochemical catalyst the developed tio2 based sensor exhibited a good detection reliability and cyclic stability for determining bpa in water samples with an electrochemical signal decrease of less than 5 0 in 10 run cyclic tests by virtue of the bi functional properties of the tailored tio2 anodic material a unique photo assisted electrochemical sensor was further developed in which analyte digestion and analytical signal originated mainly from anodic conversion such a synergistic digesting mechanism distinguishes it from the reported electro assisted photochemical tio2 sensors our work provides a robust sensor for monitoring pollutants in aqueous environments and a new opportunity to develop renewable electrode materials with good reusability graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical sensor bisphenol a bpa electrode fouling photochemical regeneration tio2 water sample 1 introduction electrochemical detection is a promising method to monitor persistent organic pollutants pops in aqueous environments due to its good sensitivity high limit and easy operation chen and ostrom 2015 liu et al 2014a b c yáňez sedeňo et al 2009 in electrochemical detection environmental pollutants are converted to anodic polymeric products on the electrode surface via direct electron transfer pathway to generate analytical signal for quantitative determination however the generated polymeric products strongly deposit onto electrode surface and block reactive sites leading to a large decrease in detection performance for stable usage hanssen et al 2016 re using the electrode with well defined surface chemistry is of considerable interest for environmental monitoring reliability in practical detection electrode fouling is the consequence of two main mechanisms non faradic fouling of background species in sample matrix and electrochemical fouling of polymeric products from detection reaction electrochemical fouling is typical for most of the pops because their oxidation products are usually reactive and polymers appear spontaneously under proper environmental conditions hanssen et al 2016 great efforts have been made to reduce or even remove the electrode surface contamination e g using fouling resistant materials and surface regeneration methods ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 however fouling resistant materials can only remove contaminants partially while physical methods are restricted by their strong reliance on the electrode material other processes such as acid washing vacuum annealing chemical oxidation or reduction and electrochemical oxidative or reductive cleaning usually suffer from a poor stability and surface damage to the regenerated electrode hanssen et al 2016 photochemical oxidation based on semiconductor photocatalysts is proven to be an efficient regenerating strategy for electrochemical sensors hu et al 2016 2011 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 the deposited contaminants on electrode surface can be photochemically degraded and removed effectively by various reactive oxygen species produced from uv and or visible light illumination however to date all the reported electrochemical sensors are photo regenerated by other materials e g tio2 and zno for detecting materials e g au and pt hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 this is because metals and metal oxides usually lack either a sufficient electrochemical or photochemical activity due to their crystal and electronic bulk structures chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 however these detecting regenerating composite materials i e au tio2 au zno and pt tio2 require noble reagents and a time consuming preparation and usually suffer from low detection and regeneration capacities due to the spatial separation of the detection sites on the detecting material and the regeneration sites on the regenerating material for one single photochemically renewable electrode in addition the use of noble metals largely limits their practical usage hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 tio2 is a typical semiconductor with a high industrial importance due to its high stability low cost and nontoxicity for practical applications bai and zhou 2014 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c in our recent work the high energy 001 exposed tio2 single crystals scs engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites mi tio2 have proven to be an effective detecting material for electrochemical bpa sensing which can be attributed mainly to its strong molecular recognition capacity and superior anodic degradation activity pei et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 2017 however the mi tio2 electrode is limited to multi usages with a poor stability due to the severe surface contamination in the electrochemical detecting process fig s1 especially in practical environmental samples with a highly complex matrix inspired by the unique and outstanding bi functional properties photochemical and electrochemical activities of surface engineered mi tio2 liu et al 2017 2016 pei et al 2018 2015 zhang et al 2014 in this work we demonstrated for the first time that the mi tio2 ito electrode not only achieved bpa detection with a wide range and a high sensitivity but was also renewable under uv irradiation only for cyclic usage in both artificial and actual environmental samples the fouling and anti fouling processes on the mi tio2 ito electrode and their in depth mechanisms under different activation conditions were also elucidated in detail on the basis of these results a novel photo assisted electrochemical detection system was further proposed and validated for efficient environmental sensing with an improved anti fouling performance this system had a unique electrolysis dominant synergistic digesting mechanism on the tailored mi tio2 ito electrode in comparison with the reported electro assisted

electrochemical tests were conducted on a commercial workstation chi760e chi inc shanghai china with a three electrode system in a 50 ml quartz cell the mi tio2 ito 1 50 cm2 pt foil and ag agcl electrodes served as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively bpa was detected by dpv scanning from 0 0 to 1 0 v at 50 mv s 1 with a bpa dosage of 0 1 40 0 μm in 0

rpm then dried naturally for usage actual water samples included the surface water from chaohu lake the effluent from a secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the tap water from one of the university tap in hefei anhui china the actual water samples were micro filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and diluted by 0 2 m pbs aqueous solution to maintain a comparable ionic strength and electric conductivity as the artificial ones 0 1 m pbs for both ec and pec detections fig s4 a high performance liquid chromatography hplc method was used as reference for both artificial and actual water samples pei et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical detection of bpa on the mi tio2 ito electrode to develop the photochemical regeneration strategy for electrochemical sensors the mi tio2 ito electrode with an effective surface area of 1 5 cm2 was prepared to capture uv photons compared to the mi tio2 gce electrode of 0 196 cm2 in our previous work pei et al 2018 the mi tio2 ito electrode also exhibited a good bpa electrochemical detecting capacity under the testing conditions fig 1 fig 1a shows the amperometric response of mi tio2 ito electrode towards a series of bpa dosages the oxidation peak current i p was linearly proportional to the bpa concentration in a range of 0 1 40 0 μm with a high correlation coefficient of 0 99 and a low detection limit of 0 095 μm s n 3 interfering tests with five true structural analogues bpaf bpd bps hbp and hbpa were further carried out for bpa analysis as shown in fig s5 the five selected structural analogues did not exhibit any recognizable interference to the bpa detection on the mi tio2 ito based electrochemical sensor the analytical current signal exceeded 95 in the presence of all structural analogues under the testing conditions these results indicate that the mi tio2 ito electrode could be used for bpa detection with a good reliability and specificity which is mainly attributed to the excellent molecular recognition capacity and the superior anodic activity of the shape and facet tailored tio2 anodic material engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites on the surface and sub surface pei et al 2018 3 2 fouling regeneration and reusage of the mi tio2 ito electrode similar to most of the noble metal and carbon based electrodes ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 panizza and cerisola 2009 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 radical intermediates and polymeric products were continuously generated from anodic detection on the mi tio2 ito electrode to largely limit its cyclic usage for bpa detection fig 2 a shows the 11 run dpv cyclic tests in a 10 0 μm bpa solution without any treatment between each cycle in addition to the continuous decrease in oxidation peak current i p the peak potential of bpa oxidation e p was increasingly positively shifted and a new oxidation peak at 0 15 v progressively appeared which could be mainly attributed to the re oxidation of detection products hu et al 2016 these results indicate the severe electrode surface fouling and an increased electron transfer resistance between bpa analyte and the mi tio2 ito electrode from the insulating polymer film due to its strong interactions with the oxygen terminated mi tio2 ito surface ghanam et al 2017 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 it is well documented that the hydrophilic oxygen functional groups can increase the binding affinity of polymeric substances compared with an inert surface with an sp3 atomic structure peltola et al 2018 thus the analytical current rapidly decreased by more than 60 after only the 5th run test for bpa detection on the mi tio2 ito electrode fig 2b chemical elution cleaning with organic solvents is commonly used to detach an adhered polymer film from the detecting electrode surface to relieve electrochemical fouling and recover detection performance ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 however although a thorough chemical elution cleaning by absolute ethanol removed the polymer products from the mi tio2 ito electrode and the re oxidation peak at 0 15 v fig 2c the dpv response from bpa detection still decreased by more than 30 after only the 6th run test fig 2d these results clearly show that the chemical elution as a regular regenerating approach was not able to regenerate the fouled mi tio2 ito electrode in bpa detection for stable electrochemical analysis by virtue of the bi functionality of both photochemical and electrochemical activities of the surface engineered mi tio2 liu et al 2017 2016 pei et al 2018 2015 zhang et al 2014 the polymer products generated in situ from the bpa anodic detection could be exhaustively incinerated on the mi tio2 ito electrode by exposing to uv irradiation only fig 3 a shows the dpv curves of the fresh and 10 run renewed mi tio2 ito electrodes by photochemical regeneration under uv irradiation the dpv response in a 10 0 μm bpa solution remained sufficiently stable in 11 run cyclic tests 5 0 without any new re oxidation peak at 0 15 v which belongs to the detection intermediates and or products in whole electrochemical window fig 3a notably the peak potential e p of each cycle remained stable these results indicate that the generated polymeric intermediates could be completely removed and the electrochemical detection capacity was completely recovered on the mi tio2 ito electrode by the non selective oh mediated photochemical oxidation under uv band gap excitation from valance band to conduction band scheme 1 and figs s6 s8 see supporting material for details liu et al 2017 the analytical signal in the ten fouling anti fouling cyclic runs for bpa detection remained stable and exhibited no decrease from the polymeric surface fouling with a relatively standard deviation rsd of 2 8 n 10 with 4 independent experiments fig 3b these results ensure a good promise for reusable applications of the mi tio2 ito electrode in environmental monitoring the in situ cleaning properties under uv irradiation allowed the mi tio2 ito electrode to be readily renewed in many cycles without electrochemical activity loss the photochemically regenerated mi tio2 ito electrode after the 5 run cyclic tests in 10 0 μm bpa solution exhibited a comparable electrochemical activity to the fresh group fig 3c further providing direct evidence for the efficient photochemical regeneration of the surface fouled electrode these results indicate that the bi functional mi tio2 ito electrode achieved not only efficient bpa electrochemical detection but also effective photochemical regeneration of electrode by only exposing to uv irradiation in comparison to all of the reported renewable electrodes photochemically regenerated by other materials e g tio2 and zno hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 such a renewable tio2 based electrochemical sensor demonstrated a good potential for practical environmental monitoring due to its high stability low cost and non toxicity 3 3 photochemical regenerating mechanisms of the mi tio2 ito electrode to take mechanistic insights into the electrochemical fouling and photochemical regenerating processes the particle morphology crystal structure and surface chemistry of the fresh used and renewed mi tio2 ito electrodes were measured for comparison fig 4 and fig s9 table s1 both the morphological and crystal structures of mi tio2 ito electrode remained unchanged after the 10 run cyclic tests for bpa detection figs s9a and s9b the main xrd diffraction peaks remained figs s9c and s9d although they were largely shielded by the ito substrate due to a low loading dosage 0 3 mg cm 2 moreover the raman spectra indicate that eg peaks at 144 and 636 cm 1 b1g peak at 394 cm 1 and a1g peak at 514 cm 1 corresponded to tio2 while the relatively low intensity of the eg peak at 636 cm 1 confirmed the highly exposed 001 structure of mi tio2 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c also the same relative intensities and the no shifted raman peak confirmed that the crystal structure remained stable after the photochemical regeneration figs s9e and s9f these results indicate that the cycle between the electrochemical fouling and photochemical regenerating occurred mainly on the mi tio2 ito surface ghanam et al 2017 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 the eis electrochemical active surface area ecsa mott schottky and ftir results confirm anodic fouling by polymeric products on the mi tio2 ito electrode fig 4 and table s1 when bpa molecules were adsorbed onto mi tio2 ito electrode they were immediately oxidized to radical intermediates which strongly anchored onto electrode surface and self polymerized to block reactive sites for further and durable reactions scheme 1 panizza and cerisola 2009 in photochemical regeneration of electrochemical sensors the photocatalytic activity of regenerating material under uv irradiation is of considerable interest for cleaning detecting material surface in cyclic usage hu et al 2016 2011 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 by the photochemical regeneration of the mi tio2 ito electrode the in situ produced nonselective oh under uv irradiation could exhaustively mineralize anodic polymeric intermediates and recover surface reactive sites for a stable electrochemical performance scheme 1 and fig s8 control degradation tests under the typical conditions show that the 001 exposed mi tio2 exhibited a superior photochemical activity for both bpa conversion and mineralization over the 101 exposed degussa p25 figs s6 and s7 one of the best commercial anatase tio2 for environmental decontamination bai and zhou 2014 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c the non selective oh with a high redox potential of 2 80 ev is usually recognized as the main reactive oxygen species for photochemical reactions as confirmed by the radical inhibition photoluminescence pl and electron spin resonance esr tests fig s8 zhang et al 2014 these results indicate that the photochemical regeneration of the fouled mi tio2 ito electrode by the polymeric intermediates in bpa electrochemical detection was mediated by the high activity oh due to its nonselective radical nature scheme 1 this could explain the excellent photochemical regeneration capacity for electrochemical fouling on the mi tio2 ito electrode for cyclic bpa detection with a great consistence with the hplc results figs 3 and 4 table 1 and fig s2 3 4 photo assisted electrochemical detection of bpa the efficient digestion of analytes and the collection of analytical signals are of considerable interest for environmental monitoring chen and ostrom 2015 liu et al 2014a b c yáňez sedeňo et al 2009 the combination of electrocatalysis ec and photocatalysis pc to construct a photo electrochemical catalytic pec system has gained increasing interests for pollution control and monitoring in pec the anodic potential can be set to be higher or lower than the direct electrochemical oxidation potentials of both target pollutants and water molecule liu et al 2017 if the potential is higher the ec dominant pec is constructed and thus the largest synergism is anticipated the improved pc activity due to anodic bias and oxygen evolution in ec and the enhanced ec activity and stability owning to active oxygen species in pc in this mode the electrode should simultaneously possess both high pc and ec activities comparatively if the potential is lower the pc dominant pec is constructed and thus the synergism is anticipated the improved pc activity due to the anodic bias in ec for effective carrier separation while no significant ec activity owning to the weak anodic polarization in this mode the electrode usually possesses a high pc but weak ec activity for comparison in this work a photo assisted electrochemical sensor ec dominant pec sensor was constructed by virtue of the bi functional properties of the mi tio2 ito electrode in ec dominant pec sensor the electrochemical reaction is the main detection mechanism and most analytical signals arise from this selective digestion process fig 5 the nonselective photochemical digestion is incorporated to magnify analytical signal for more sensitive detection scheme s1 thus as a strong and selective digestion manner the ec dominant pec sensor could be used to monitor specific pollutants i e bpa fig 5 comparatively in the widely reported electro assisted photochemical sensor e g pc dominant pec sensor the photochemical reaction is the only detection mechanism and all analytical signals arise from this nonselective digestion process while the applied low bias is incorporated only to improve photocarrier separation rather than digest the analyte scheme s2 liao et al 2016 liu et al 2014a b c zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2006 zhao et al 2004 zheng et al 2008 thus as a strong and nonselective digestion manner the pc dominant pec sensors are typically used to monitor a general index i e chemical oxygen demand due to their low selectivity liao et al 2016 liu et al 2014a b c zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2006 zhao et al 2004 zheng et al 2008 obviously the ec dominant pec sensor and the pc dominant pec sensor are substantially different in analyte digesting and signal generating as well as their detecting properties for monitoring of pollutants as a nonselective digestion mechanism the photochemical reaction could play a dual role in the ec dominant pec sensor the positive role is to strengthen the analytical signal by promoting the analyte digestion capacity while the negative role is to reduce the analytical signal by consuming the surface enriched analyte as the background signal fig 5a and fig s10 moreover both the positive and negative roles of the photochemical digestion were highly dependent on uv intensity thus the regulation of photochemical digestion capacity and the determination of suitable uv intensity were of considerable interest fig 5a and fig s10 the photo assisted dpv tests were carried out under different uv intensities of 0 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mw cm 2 respectively in 0 1 m pbs solution containing 10 0 μm bpa fig 5a and fig s10 the analytical signal i net from both electrochemical and photochemical digestion processes at 0 8 v was much higher than the background signal i background from the photochemical digestion process at 0 0 0 4 v at all three given uv intensities fig 5a and b these results indicate a unique ec dominant pec digesting and detecting mechanism on the bi functional mi tio2 ito electrode with a great specificity for environmental monitoring scheme s1 furthermore the analytical signal i net from both electrochemical and photochemical digestion processes at 0 8 v reached its maximum of 2 8 μa cm 2 at mw cm 2 but decreased significantly when the uv intensity was further increased to 10 0 and 20 0 mw cm 2 all of which were much higher than that at 0 0 mw cm 2 ec sensor fig 5c in comparison the background signal i background from the photochemical digestion process and the total signal i background i net were both linearly correlated with the uv intensity up to 20 0 mw cm 2 fig 5 thus the uv intensity of 5 0 mw cm 2 was rationally selected for the ec dominant pec sensor fig 6 and table s3 under the optimized uv intensity of 5 0 mw cm 2 dpv tests were carried out with a series of bpa dosages fig 6a and a strong linear relationship between the photo assisted anodic peak current and the bpa concentration on the mi tio2 ito electrode was obtained r2 0 99 fig 6b moreover pec sensor exhibited a higher analytical signal and detection sensitivity for bpa sensing than ec sensor fig 6c and d in the linear range of 1 0 35 0 μm the pec sensitivity reached 0 196 0 004 μa μm 1 cm 2 which was much higher than the ec sensitivity of 0 143 0 001 μa μm 1 cm 2 fig 6c and d in addition the surface anti fouling capacity of pec sensor on the mi tio2 ito electrode was also better than that of ec sensor a 5 run cyclic test without any cleaning treatment between each run yielded a bpa signal decrease of less than 40 in pec sensor compared to a more than 60 decrease in ec sensor under similar testing conditions fig 6e and f also in the presence of the five structural analogues bpa signal remained stable on the mi tio2 ito electrode regardless of the interfering conditions figs s11 and s12 moreover this specificity was also verified by the hplc results figs s13 and s14 all these important detection properties render the novel pec sensor a better method for environmental monitoring 3 5 detection of bpa in real water samples the practical potentials of the mi tio2 ito electrode based ec and pec sensors for environmental monitoring were evaluated through detecting bpa in various real water samples which were first micro filtered and then dissolved in 0 2 m pbs aqueous solution to maintain a suitable ph and ionic strength in all of the real water samples bpa was too low to be detected directly thus the standard addition method was used to examine the detection accuracy and recovery efficiency of ec and pec sensors each sample was proceeded with 4 parallel detections n 4 and the rsd was below 5 0 table s3 the apparent recovery factors spiked with 1 0 30 0 μm bpa were calculated to be 99 6 102 4 for ec sensor and 100 7 101 9 for pec sensor table s3 these results indicate that both ec and pec sensors had good detection trueness in the real samples and the high consistency between ec and pec sensors with standard hplc demonstrates a good potential for practical applications for the cyclic detection of the real water samples the mi tio2 ito electrode was photochemically regenerated under uv irradiation after each test each sample was proceeded by 3 parallel detections n 3 and the rsd was below 5 0 table 1 the average apparent recovery factors from the real water samples spiked by 10 0 μm bpa were calculated to be 99 6 4 3 106 6 3 1 and 104 6 2 7 for tap water surface water and municipal sewage respectively in a 7 run cyclic detection table 1 although electrode fouling might be more severe in real samples the selected photochemical regeneration conditions could still renew the mi tio2 ito electrode effectively for multiple usages these results indicate that the photochemical regeneration of the mi tio2 ito electrode was an effective surface anti fouling strategy for real sample analysis and the high regeneration capacity and the stable detection efficiency demonstrate its potential for practical environmental applications the current detection limit shows that it was still hard to apply this method for environmental monitoring directly without sample extraction in future studies great efforts should be made to refine the electrochemical and photo assisted electrochemical detection properties of the tailored mi tio2 ito electrode 1 enhancing the electrochemical reactivity of tio2 for anodic oxidation e g by guest and or self doping morphology controlling including particle size and 001 101 exposed ratio and hybriding surface hetero and or homo junctions and 2 improving the affinity and selectivity for specific adsorption and enrichment e g by modifying the type properties and density of binding groups on catalyst surface and subsurface to construct new interacting pairs and regulating the surface charge of anodic materials depending on isoelectric point of tio2 and pka of target analytes to establish non covalent electrostatic interactions 4 conclusions in this work a renewable electrochemical sensor was constructed and validated to detect bpa in both artificial and real water samples based on the facet and shape tailored tio2 surface engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites by virtue of the bi functional properties under anodic bias and uv irradiation both the direct electrochemical detection and the indirect photochemical regeneration simultaneously occurred on the one single mi tio2 ito electrode for cyclic monitoring of bpa to improve the detection performance a unique photo assisted electrochemical sensor was further designed and validated catalytic mechanisms for both electrochemical detection and photochemical regeneration as well as photo assisted

18842,bisphenol a bpa is a semi persistent environmental endocrine disrupter and widely present in aqueous environments electrochemical detection is an effective method to monitor pollutants like bpa in aqueous environments however the electrode fouling from anodic polymeric products is one main barrier of electrochemical sensors for their practical applications in this work a renewable electrochemical sensor was rationally designed constructed and tested for efficient bpa detection the tio2 anodic material was surface engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites with tailored morphological shape exposed facet and crystal structure this electrode could be activated mainly as an electrochemical catalyst and partially as a photochemical catalyst the developed tio2 based sensor exhibited a good detection reliability and cyclic stability for determining bpa in water samples with an electrochemical signal decrease of less than 5 0 in 10 run cyclic tests by virtue of the bi functional properties of the tailored tio2 anodic material a unique photo assisted electrochemical sensor was further developed in which analyte digestion and analytical signal originated mainly from anodic conversion such a synergistic digesting mechanism distinguishes it from the reported electro assisted photochemical tio2 sensors our work provides a robust sensor for monitoring pollutants in aqueous environments and a new opportunity to develop renewable electrode materials with good reusability graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical sensor bisphenol a bpa electrode fouling photochemical regeneration tio2 water sample 1 introduction electrochemical detection is a promising method to monitor persistent organic pollutants pops in aqueous environments due to its good sensitivity high limit and easy operation chen and ostrom 2015 liu et al 2014a b c yáňez sedeňo et al 2009 in electrochemical detection environmental pollutants are converted to anodic polymeric products on the electrode surface via direct electron transfer pathway to generate analytical signal for quantitative determination however the generated polymeric products strongly deposit onto electrode surface and block reactive sites leading to a large decrease in detection performance for stable usage hanssen et al 2016 re using the electrode with well defined surface chemistry is of considerable interest for environmental monitoring reliability in practical detection electrode fouling is the consequence of two main mechanisms non faradic fouling of background species in sample matrix and electrochemical fouling of polymeric products from detection reaction electrochemical fouling is typical for most of the pops because their oxidation products are usually reactive and polymers appear spontaneously under proper environmental conditions hanssen et al 2016 great efforts have been made to reduce or even remove the electrode surface contamination e g using fouling resistant materials and surface regeneration methods ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 however fouling resistant materials can only remove contaminants partially while physical methods are restricted by their strong reliance on the electrode material other processes such as acid washing vacuum annealing chemical oxidation or reduction and electrochemical oxidative or reductive cleaning usually suffer from a poor stability and surface damage to the regenerated electrode hanssen et al 2016 photochemical oxidation based on semiconductor photocatalysts is proven to be an efficient regenerating strategy for electrochemical sensors hu et al 2016 2011 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 the deposited contaminants on electrode surface can be photochemically degraded and removed effectively by various reactive oxygen species produced from uv and or visible light illumination however to date all the reported electrochemical sensors are photo regenerated by other materials e g tio2 and zno for detecting materials e g au and pt hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 this is because metals and metal oxides usually lack either a sufficient electrochemical or photochemical activity due to their crystal and electronic bulk structures chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 however these detecting regenerating composite materials i e au tio2 au zno and pt tio2 require noble reagents and a time consuming preparation and usually suffer from low detection and regeneration capacities due to the spatial separation of the detection sites on the detecting material and the regeneration sites on the regenerating material for one single photochemically renewable electrode in addition the use of noble metals largely limits their practical usage hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 tio2 is a typical semiconductor with a high industrial importance due to its high stability low cost and nontoxicity for practical applications bai and zhou 2014 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c in our recent work the high energy 001 exposed tio2 single crystals scs engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites mi tio2 have proven to be an effective detecting material for electrochemical bpa sensing which can be attributed mainly to its strong molecular recognition capacity and superior anodic degradation activity pei et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 2017 however the mi tio2 electrode is limited to multi usages with a poor stability due to the severe surface contamination in the electrochemical detecting process fig s1 especially in practical environmental samples with a highly complex matrix inspired by the unique and outstanding bi functional properties photochemical and electrochemical activities of surface engineered mi tio2 liu et al 2017 2016 pei et al 2018 2015 zhang et al 2014 in this work we demonstrated for the first time that the mi tio2 ito electrode not only achieved bpa detection with a wide range and a high sensitivity but was also renewable under uv irradiation only for cyclic usage in both artificial and actual environmental samples the fouling and anti fouling processes on the mi tio2 ito electrode and their in depth mechanisms under different activation conditions were also elucidated in detail on the basis of these results a novel photo assisted electrochemical detection system was further proposed and validated for efficient environmental sensing with an improved anti fouling performance this system had a unique electrolysis dominant synergistic digesting mechanism on the tailored mi tio2 ito electrode in comparison with the reported electro assisted photochemical sensors with the photocatalysis dominated digesting mechanism on the other tio2 electrodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents tetrabutyl titanate was purchased from sigma

eis analysis was conducted from 100 khz to 0 1 hz with an ac potential of 0 5 v in 0 1 m pbs containing 10 0 μm bpa 2 3 detection of bpa in water samples electrochemical and photo assisted electrochemical tests were conducted on a commercial workstation chi760e chi inc shanghai china with a three electrode system in a 50 ml quartz cell the mi tio2 ito 1 50 cm2 pt foil and ag agcl electrodes served as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively bpa was detected by dpv scanning from 0 0 to 1 0 v at 50 mv s 1 with a bpa dosage of 0 1 40 0 μm in 0

rpm then dried naturally for usage actual water samples included the surface water from chaohu lake the effluent from a secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the tap water from one of the university tap in hefei anhui china the actual water samples were micro filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and diluted by 0 2 m pbs aqueous solution to maintain a comparable ionic strength and electric conductivity as the artificial ones 0 1 m pbs for both ec and pec detections fig s4 a high performance liquid chromatography hplc method was used as reference for both artificial and actual water samples pei et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical detection of bpa on the mi tio2 ito electrode to develop the photochemical regeneration strategy for electrochemical sensors the mi tio2 ito electrode with an effective surface area of 1 5 cm2 was prepared to capture uv photons compared to the mi tio2 gce electrode of 0 196 cm2 in our previous work pei et al 2018 the mi tio2 ito electrode also exhibited a good bpa electrochemical detecting capacity under the testing conditions fig 1 fig 1a shows the amperometric response of mi tio2 ito electrode towards a series of bpa dosages the oxidation peak current i p was linearly proportional to the bpa concentration in a range of 0 1 40 0 μm with a high correlation coefficient of 0 99 and a low detection limit of 0 095 μm s n 3 interfering tests with five true structural analogues bpaf bpd bps hbp and hbpa were further carried out for bpa analysis as shown in fig s5 the five selected structural analogues did not exhibit any recognizable interference to the bpa detection on the mi tio2 ito based electrochemical sensor the analytical current signal exceeded 95 in the presence of all structural analogues under the testing conditions these results indicate that the mi tio2 ito electrode could be used for bpa detection with a good reliability and specificity which is mainly attributed to the excellent molecular recognition capacity and the superior anodic activity of the shape and facet tailored tio2 anodic material engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites on the surface and sub surface pei et al 2018 3 2 fouling regeneration and reusage of the mi tio2 ito electrode similar to most of the noble metal and carbon based electrodes ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 panizza and cerisola 2009 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 radical intermediates and polymeric products were continuously generated from anodic detection on the mi tio2 ito electrode to largely limit its cyclic usage for bpa detection fig 2 a shows the 11 run dpv cyclic tests in a 10 0 μm bpa solution without any treatment between each cycle in addition to the continuous decrease in oxidation peak current i p the peak potential of bpa oxidation e p was increasingly positively shifted and a new oxidation peak at 0 15 v progressively appeared which could be mainly attributed to the re oxidation of detection products hu et al 2016 these results indicate the severe electrode surface fouling and an increased electron transfer resistance between bpa analyte and the mi tio2 ito electrode from the insulating polymer film due to its strong interactions with the oxygen terminated mi tio2 ito surface ghanam et al 2017 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 it is well documented that the hydrophilic oxygen functional groups can increase the binding affinity of polymeric substances compared with an inert surface with an sp3 atomic structure peltola et al 2018 thus the analytical current rapidly decreased by more than 60 after only the 5th run test for bpa detection on the mi tio2 ito electrode fig 2b chemical elution cleaning with organic solvents is commonly used to detach an adhered polymer film from the detecting electrode surface to relieve electrochemical fouling and recover detection performance ghanam et al 2017 hanssen et al 2016 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 however although a thorough chemical elution cleaning by absolute ethanol removed the polymer products from the mi tio2 ito electrode and the re oxidation peak at 0 15 v fig 2c the dpv response from bpa detection still decreased by more than 30 after only the 6th run test fig 2d these results clearly show that the chemical elution as a regular regenerating approach was not able to regenerate the fouled mi tio2 ito electrode in bpa detection for stable electrochemical analysis by virtue of the bi functionality of both photochemical and electrochemical activities of the surface engineered mi tio2 liu et al 2017 2016 pei et al 2018 2015 zhang et al 2014 the polymer products generated in situ from the bpa anodic detection could be exhaustively incinerated on the mi tio2 ito electrode by exposing to uv irradiation only fig 3 a shows the dpv curves of the fresh and 10 run renewed mi tio2 ito electrodes by photochemical regeneration under uv irradiation the dpv response in a 10 0 μm bpa solution remained sufficiently stable in 11 run cyclic tests 5 0 without any new re oxidation peak at 0 15 v which belongs to the detection intermediates and or products in whole electrochemical window fig 3a notably the peak potential e p of each cycle remained stable these results indicate that the generated polymeric intermediates could be completely removed and the electrochemical detection capacity was completely recovered on the mi tio2 ito electrode by the non selective oh mediated photochemical oxidation under uv band gap excitation from valance band to conduction band scheme 1 and figs s6 s8 see supporting material for details liu et al 2017 the analytical signal in the ten fouling anti fouling cyclic runs for bpa detection remained stable and exhibited no decrease from the polymeric surface fouling with a relatively standard deviation rsd of 2 8 n 10 with 4 independent experiments fig 3b these results ensure a good promise for reusable applications of the mi tio2 ito electrode in environmental monitoring the in situ cleaning properties under uv irradiation allowed the mi tio2 ito electrode to be readily renewed in many cycles without electrochemical activity loss the photochemically regenerated mi tio2 ito electrode after the 5 run cyclic tests in 10 0 μm bpa solution exhibited a comparable electrochemical activity to the fresh group fig 3c further providing direct evidence for the efficient photochemical regeneration of the surface fouled electrode these results indicate that the bi functional mi tio2 ito electrode achieved not only efficient bpa electrochemical detection but also effective photochemical regeneration of electrode by only exposing to uv irradiation in comparison to all of the reported renewable electrodes photochemically regenerated by other materials e g tio2 and zno hu et al 2016 2011 li et al 2010 wen et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2013 such a renewable tio2 based electrochemical sensor demonstrated a good potential for practical environmental monitoring due to its high stability low cost and non toxicity 3 3 photochemical regenerating mechanisms of the mi tio2 ito electrode to take mechanistic insights into the electrochemical fouling and photochemical regenerating processes the particle morphology crystal structure and surface chemistry of the fresh used and renewed mi tio2 ito electrodes were measured for comparison fig 4 and fig s9 table s1 both the morphological and crystal structures of mi tio2 ito electrode remained unchanged after the 10 run cyclic tests for bpa detection figs s9a and s9b the main xrd diffraction peaks remained figs s9c and s9d although they were largely shielded by the ito substrate due to a low loading dosage 0 3 mg cm 2 moreover the raman spectra indicate that eg peaks at 144 and 636 cm 1 b1g peak at 394 cm 1 and a1g peak at 514 cm 1 corresponded to tio2 while the relatively low intensity of the eg peak at 636 cm 1 confirmed the highly exposed 001 structure of mi tio2 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c also the same relative intensities and the no shifted raman peak confirmed that the crystal structure remained stable after the photochemical regeneration figs s9e and s9f these results indicate that the cycle between the electrochemical fouling and photochemical regenerating occurred mainly on the mi tio2 ito surface ghanam et al 2017 peltola et al 2018 takmakov et al 2010 the eis electrochemical active surface area ecsa mott schottky and ftir results confirm anodic fouling by polymeric products on the mi tio2 ito electrode fig 4 and table s1 when bpa molecules were adsorbed onto mi tio2 ito electrode they were immediately oxidized to radical intermediates which strongly anchored onto electrode surface and self polymerized to block reactive sites for further and durable reactions scheme 1 panizza and cerisola 2009 in photochemical regeneration of electrochemical sensors the photocatalytic activity of regenerating material under uv irradiation is of considerable interest for cleaning detecting material surface in cyclic usage hu et al 2016 2011 xu et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2016 by the photochemical regeneration of the mi tio2 ito electrode the in situ produced nonselective oh under uv irradiation could exhaustively mineralize anodic polymeric intermediates and recover surface reactive sites for a stable electrochemical performance scheme 1 and fig s8 control degradation tests under the typical conditions show that the 001 exposed mi tio2 exhibited a superior photochemical activity for both bpa conversion and mineralization over the 101 exposed degussa p25 figs s6 and s7 one of the best commercial anatase tio2 for environmental decontamination bai and zhou 2014 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014a b c the non selective oh with a high redox potential of 2 80 ev is usually recognized as the main reactive oxygen species for photochemical reactions as confirmed by the radical inhibition photoluminescence pl and electron spin resonance esr tests fig s8 zhang et al 2014 these results indicate that the photochemical regeneration of the fouled mi tio2 ito electrode by the polymeric intermediates in bpa electrochemical detection was mediated by the high activity oh due to its nonselective radical nature scheme 1 this could explain the excellent photochemical regeneration capacity for electrochemical fouling on the mi tio2 ito electrode for cyclic bpa detection with a great consistence with the hplc results figs 3 and 4 table 1 and fig s2 3 4 photo assisted electrochemical detection of bpa the efficient digestion of analytes and the collection of analytical signals are of considerable interest for environmental monitoring chen and ostrom 2015 liu et al 2014a b c yáňez sedeňo et al 2009 the combination of electrocatalysis ec and photocatalysis pc to construct a photo electrochemical catalytic pec system has gained increasing interests for pollution control and monitoring in pec the anodic potential can be set to be higher or lower than the direct electrochemical oxidation potentials of both target pollutants and water molecule liu et al 2017 if the potential is higher the ec dominant pec is constructed and thus the largest synergism is anticipated the improved pc activity due to anodic bias and oxygen evolution in ec and the enhanced ec activity and stability owning to active oxygen species in pc in this mode the electrode should simultaneously possess both high pc and ec activities comparatively if the potential is lower the pc dominant pec is constructed and thus the synergism is anticipated the improved pc activity due to the anodic bias in ec for effective carrier separation while no significant ec activity owning to the weak anodic polarization in this mode the electrode usually possesses a high pc but weak ec activity for comparison in this work a photo assisted electrochemical sensor ec dominant pec sensor was constructed by virtue of the bi functional properties of the mi tio2 ito electrode in ec dominant pec sensor the electrochemical reaction is the main detection mechanism and most analytical signals arise from this selective digestion process fig 5 the nonselective photochemical digestion is incorporated to magnify analytical signal for more sensitive detection scheme s1 thus as a strong and selective digestion manner the ec dominant pec sensor could be used to monitor specific pollutants i e bpa fig 5 comparatively in the widely reported electro assisted photochemical sensor e g pc dominant pec sensor the photochemical reaction is the only detection mechanism and all analytical signals arise from this nonselective digestion process while the applied low bias is incorporated only to improve photocarrier separation rather than digest the analyte scheme s2 liao et al 2016 liu et al 2014a b c zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2006 zhao et al 2004 zheng et al 2008 thus as a strong and nonselective digestion manner the pc dominant pec sensors are typically used to monitor a general index i e chemical oxygen demand due to their low selectivity liao et al 2016 liu et al 2014a b c zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2006 zhao et al 2004 zheng et al 2008 obviously the ec dominant pec sensor and the pc dominant pec sensor are substantially different in analyte digesting and signal generating as well as their detecting properties for monitoring of pollutants as a nonselective digestion mechanism the photochemical reaction could play a dual role in the ec dominant pec sensor the positive role is to strengthen the analytical signal by promoting the analyte digestion capacity while the negative role is to reduce the analytical signal by consuming the surface enriched analyte as the background signal fig 5a and fig s10 moreover both the positive and negative roles of the photochemical digestion were highly dependent on uv intensity thus the regulation of photochemical digestion capacity and the determination of suitable uv intensity were of considerable interest fig 5a and fig s10 the photo assisted dpv tests were carried out under different uv intensities of 0 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mw cm 2 respectively in 0 1 m pbs solution containing 10 0 μm bpa fig 5a and fig s10 the analytical signal i net from both electrochemical and photochemical digestion processes at 0 8 v was much higher than the background signal i background from the photochemical digestion process at 0 0 0 4 v at all three given uv intensities fig 5a and b these results indicate a unique ec dominant pec digesting and detecting mechanism on the bi functional mi tio2 ito electrode with a great specificity for environmental monitoring scheme s1 furthermore the analytical signal i net from both electrochemical and photochemical digestion processes at 0 8 v reached its maximum of 2 8 μa cm 2 at mw cm 2 but decreased significantly when the uv intensity was further increased to 10 0 and 20 0 mw cm 2 all of which were much higher than that at 0 0 mw cm 2 ec sensor fig 5c in comparison the background signal i background from the photochemical digestion process and the total signal i background i net were both linearly correlated with the uv intensity up to 20 0 mw cm 2 fig 5 thus the uv intensity of 5 0 mw cm 2 was rationally selected for the ec dominant pec sensor fig 6 and table s3 under the optimized uv intensity of 5 0 mw cm 2 dpv tests were carried out with a series of bpa dosages fig 6a and a strong linear relationship between the photo assisted anodic peak current and the bpa concentration on the mi tio2 ito electrode was obtained r2 0 99 fig 6b moreover pec sensor exhibited a higher analytical signal and detection sensitivity for bpa sensing than ec sensor fig 6c and d in the linear range of 1 0 35 0 μm the pec sensitivity reached 0 196 0 004 μa μm 1 cm 2 which was much higher than the ec sensitivity of 0 143 0 001 μa μm 1 cm 2 fig 6c and d in addition the surface anti fouling capacity of pec sensor on the mi tio2 ito electrode was also better than that of ec sensor a 5 run cyclic test without any cleaning treatment between each run yielded a bpa signal decrease of less than 40 in pec sensor compared to a more than 60 decrease in ec sensor under similar testing conditions fig 6e and f also in the presence of the five structural analogues bpa signal remained stable on the mi tio2 ito electrode regardless of the interfering conditions figs s11 and s12 moreover this specificity was also verified by the hplc results figs s13 and s14 all these important detection properties render the novel pec sensor a better method for environmental monitoring 3 5 detection of bpa in real water samples the practical potentials of the mi tio2 ito electrode based ec and pec sensors for environmental monitoring were evaluated through detecting bpa in various real water samples which were first micro filtered and then dissolved in 0 2 m pbs aqueous solution to maintain a suitable ph and ionic strength in all of the real water samples bpa was too low to be detected directly thus the standard addition method was used to examine the detection accuracy and recovery efficiency of ec and pec sensors each sample was proceeded with 4 parallel detections n 4 and the rsd was below 5 0 table s3 the apparent recovery factors spiked with 1 0 30 0 μm bpa were calculated to be 99 6 102 4 for ec sensor and 100 7 101 9 for pec sensor table s3 these results indicate that both ec and pec sensors had good detection trueness in the real samples and the high consistency between ec and pec sensors with standard hplc demonstrates a good potential for practical applications for the cyclic detection of the real water samples the mi tio2 ito electrode was photochemically regenerated under uv irradiation after each test each sample was proceeded by 3 parallel detections n 3 and the rsd was below 5 0 table 1 the average apparent recovery factors from the real water samples spiked by 10 0 μm bpa were calculated to be 99 6 4 3 106 6 3 1 and 104 6 2 7 for tap water surface water and municipal sewage respectively in a 7 run cyclic detection table 1 although electrode fouling might be more severe in real samples the selected photochemical regeneration conditions could still renew the mi tio2 ito electrode effectively for multiple usages these results indicate that the photochemical regeneration of the mi tio2 ito electrode was an effective surface anti fouling strategy for real sample analysis and the high regeneration capacity and the stable detection efficiency demonstrate its potential for practical environmental applications the current detection limit shows that it was still hard to apply this method for environmental monitoring directly without sample extraction in future studies great efforts should be made to refine the electrochemical and photo assisted electrochemical detection properties of the tailored mi tio2 ito electrode 1 enhancing the electrochemical reactivity of tio2 for anodic oxidation e g by guest and or self doping morphology controlling including particle size and 001 101 exposed ratio and hybriding surface hetero and or homo junctions and 2 improving the affinity and selectivity for specific adsorption and enrichment e g by modifying the type properties and density of binding groups on catalyst surface and subsurface to construct new interacting pairs and regulating the surface charge of anodic materials depending on isoelectric point of tio2 and pka of target analytes to establish non covalent electrostatic interactions 4 conclusions in this work a renewable electrochemical sensor was constructed and validated to detect bpa in both artificial and real water samples based on the facet and shape tailored tio2 surface engineered by inorganic framework molecular imprinting sites by virtue of the bi functional properties under anodic bias and uv irradiation both the direct electrochemical detection and the indirect photochemical regeneration simultaneously occurred on the one single mi tio2 ito electrode for cyclic monitoring of bpa to improve the detection performance a unique photo assisted electrochemical sensor was further designed and validated catalytic mechanisms for both electrochemical detection and photochemical regeneration as well as photo assisted electrochemical synergism on the mi tio2 ito electrode were elucidated our findings could provide a new opportunity to refine electrochemical sensors for detecting pollutants in aqueous environments

18843,treatment processes such as membrane filtration with reverse osmosis ro are used to produce drinking water with a high degree of biostability to our knowledge the influence of ro water on biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila has not yet been investigated therefore this study aimed i to determine the legionella growth potential of remineralised ro water produced by a pilot plant and to compare this to conventional treated groundwater and ii to determine if different pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water can cause growth of l pneumophila the legionella growth potential of water was determined with the boiler biofilm monitor bbm that mimics the flow of water in a premise plumbing system the legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water was determined by using the biomass production potential bpp test atp concentrations in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with remineralised ro water fluctuated around 100 pg atp cm 2 in contrast bbms fed with conventionally treated water resulted in ten fold higher atp concentrations in the biofilm moreover conventionally treated water had a legionella growth potential that was 1000 fold higher than that of remineralised ro water furthermore glass copper and pvc c had the lowest biofilm concentrations and legionella growth potential in the bpp test followed by pe xb pe xc and pe 100 the highest biofilm concentration and legionella growth potential were with pvc p hence our study demonstrated that remineralised ro water did not enhance growth of l pneumophila in the bbm that mimics the premises plumbing system however when pe or pvc p materials are used growth of l pneumophila can still occur in the premises plumbing system despite the high

source water blend of anoxic groundwater and riverbank filtrated surface water and to remineralise the filtrate before it is distributed due to the effective removal of bdoc by ro it is expected that the remineralised filtrate could prevent the growth of l pneumophila in the downstream drinking water system bdoc in the drinking water system does however not only come from the treated water it is known that certain pipe materials which are used in the distribution or premises plumbing system release organic substances into the water that promote growth of microorganisms escobar et al 2001 rożej et al 2015 including l pneumophila buse et al 2014 colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 to the best of our knowledge the influence of remineralised ro water and the effect of pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water on biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila has not yet been investigated therefore the objectives of our study were to determine i the legionella growth potential of remineralised ro water and compare this to conventionally treated water and ii whether different pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water in the distribution system or premises plumbing systems enhance growth of l pneumophila 2 material methods 2 1 conventional drinking water ro and remineralisation processes at the drinking water treatment plant for the conventional water purification stream the extracted groundwater is submitted to aeration rapid sand filtration softening activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection before the treated water is pumped into the distribution system the ro pilot plant is operated with a capacity of 7 m3h 1 recovery rate of 75 followed by ion exchange and remineralisation 2 2 legionella growth potential of water the legionella growth potential of the ro remineralised ro and conventional treated water was determined using the boiler biofilm monitor bbm which mimics the flow of water in a premises plumbing system van der kooij et al 2017 in short the bbm consisted of a boiler placed upstream of a biofilm monitor that was filled with glass rings three times an hour the boiler flushed the biofilm monitor for 20 s with 1 5 2 l water of interest this water had a temperature of 38 c due to mixing of hot 70 c and cold water the biofilm monitor was placed in a cabinet so that the temperature was maintained at 38 c and the monitor remained in complete darkness a bbm was placed i directly after the ro installation ii directly after the ro water that was remineralised and iii directly after the conventional treatment the bbms fed with ro and remineralised ro water operated from 30 march till 9 september 2015 whereas the bbm fed with conventionally treated water started later 1 july till 18 october 2015 due to some electric power issues the day that the bbms were started is referred to as day 0 after two weeks of bbm operation the bbm system was inoculated with l pneumophila by inserting a short silicon tube precultured with l pneumophila serogroup 1 serotype 1 in the plumbing part of the boiler where water flows through before it enters the biofilm monitor glass rings and water were sampled in duplicate every two weeks during a period of six months biofilm was removed from the glass rings by sonication for three consecutive times in 10 ml of each time new sterile water with low energy for 2 min drinking water samples and biofilm samples after sonication were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate atp and l pneumophila the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm pg atp cm 2 of each water type was determined by calculating the 90 percentile using the standard formula for percentiles in excel 2013 of the atp concentrations in the biofilm that were determined on the glass rings which were obtained every two weeks from the bbm the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm colony forming units cfu cm 2 of each water type was determined by calculating the 90 percentile of the cfu of l pneumophila in the biofilm that were determined on the glass rings which were obtained every two weeks from the bbm van der kooij et al 2017 2 3 legionella growth potential of materials the legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water was determined by using the biomass production potential bpp test for materials which was developed previously van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 nen en 16421 copper pe xb pe xc pvc c and pe 100 were tested together with glass as negative control and pvc p as positive control in duplicate by incubating 150 cm2 of each material in 900 ml remineralised ro water which was produced in the pilot ro installation at the treatment plant see 2 1 subsequently the samples were incubated for 16 weeks at 37 c in the dark every week the water in the flask was renewed after 16 weeks material pieces 25 cm2 and water 100 ml were analyzed for atp thereafter the samples were inoculated with l pneumophila from a stock culture with concentration of 8 105 cfu ml 1 0 1 ml was added to 900 ml at 24 28 and 32 weeks material pieces 25 cm2 and water 100 ml were taken and the material pieces were added to 40 ml of sterile water subsequently the biofilm was removed by swabbing the material surface using a cotton swab next the samples containing material cotton swab and 40 ml of water were sonicated once with high energy for 2 min amplitude of 45 30 watt water samples and biofilm samples after swabbing and sonication were analyzed for atp and l pneumophila respectively the biomass production at week 24 28 and 32 was calculated for each material by taking the sum of the atp concentration of the biofilm attached biomass and of the water suspended biomass the biomass production potential bpp of the material was then calculated by averaging the three biomass production values in addition the biofilm formation potential of each material was determined by calculating the average atp concentrations of the attached biomass only at week 24 28 and 32 the legionella growth potential of each material was determined by calculating the average cfu of l pneumophila in the biofilm on each material at 24 28 and 32 weeks 2 4 analytical methods the atp concentration as measure for active biomass was determined in all water and biofilm samples by measuring the amount of light produced in a luciferin luciferase assay van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 this assay consisted of adding a nucleotide releasing buffer celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands to the sample to release atp from the cells next reagents were added and the generated light signal was measured as relative light units after a two second delay time and a ten second integration time with a luminometer celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands the atp concentration was calculated from the relative light units values by using an average conversion factor determined from calibration curves the detection limit was 1 ng atp l 1 colony counts of l pneumophila were determined using the culture method on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with antibiotics polymixine b sulfaat and natriumcefazoline and the plates were incubated at 37 c for seven days edelstein 1981 iso standard 11731 2 typical colonies were counted and subsequently confirmed using buffered charcoal yeast extract agar without cysteine 3 results 3 1 legionella growth potential of the different water types 3 1 1 atp the atp concentration in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with conventionally treated water at day 19 was already relatively high with 280 36 pg atp cm 2 when compared to the other water types fig 1 a the atp concentration continued to increase to 1700 92 pg atp cm 2 at day 75 after which it remained stable until the end of the experiment day 104 the atp concentration on the glass rings from the bbm fed with ro water and remineralised ro water was clearly lower than that of conventionally treated water fig 1a in these two bbms the atp concentration of the biofilm varied between 40 and 150 pg atp cm 2 throughout the experiment with no clear difference between ro water and remineralised ro water we calculated the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm from the atp concentrations of the biofilm on the glass rings in the bbm for each of the three water types the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm of the conventional treated water was 1642 pg atp cm 2 whereas the biofilm formation potential of the ro water and the remineralised ro water were 238 pg atp cm 2 and 133 pg atp cm 2 respectively table 1 the biofilm formation potential of ro water and remineralised ro water were thus comparable to each other and around ten fold lower than that of the conventionally treated water 3 1 2 legionella pneumophila after inoculation with the silicone tube precultured with l pneumophila serogroup 1 serotype 1 in the bbm s l pneumophila could be cultivated from the water of all three bbm s with numbers fluctuating between 200 and 1000 cfu l 1 this demonstrates that the inoculation of the bbm system with l pneumophila using the silicone tube was successful as has been observed before van der kooij et al 2017 l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with conventionally treated water were 4000 cfu cm 2 at day 47 fig 1b thereafter numbers peaked to 22 000 cfu cm 2 at day 61 after which l pneumophila stabilized around 10 000 cfu cm 2 till the end of the experiment l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with ro water and remineralised ro water were clearly lower than those in the bbm fed with conventionally treated water fig 1b the l pneumophila numbers of the biofilm in the bbm fed with ro water rose to 45 cfu cm 2 after 80 days and then declined to numbers that were around the detection limit of 4 3 cfu cm 2 fig 1b in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with remineralised ro water the highest l pneumophila numbers 30 cfu cm 2 were observed at day 107 thereafter numbers also declined to numbers that were around the detection limit fig 1b we calculated the legionella growth potential from the l pneumophila numbers of the biofilm on the glass rings in the bbm for each of the three water types the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm of conventionally treated water was 16 601 cfu cm 2 whereas that of ro water and remineralised ro water were 34 cfu cm 2 and 23 cfu cm 2 respectively the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm of ro water and remineralised ro water were thus comparable to each other but three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventionally treated water table 1 3 2 legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water 3 2 1 atp atp concentrations of the water and biofilm were determined on four different moments during incubation of seven different materials in the bpp test with remineralised ro water as test water for all the materials the atp concentration of the water suspended biomass was relatively stable in time week 24 32 fig 2 a the atp concentrations ranged from 3 to 160 ng atp l 1 in water fig 2a furthermore the average atp concentrations in water were similar for the different materials 3 31 ng atp l 1 except for pvc p positive control which had consistently higher atp concentrations 100 164 ng atp l 1 the atp concentrations in the biofilm attached biomass differed more between the different materials than the atp concentrations of the water fig 2b the atp concentrations in the biofilm on the materials glass copper and pvc c were the lowest 200 pg atp cm 2 followed by pe xb and pe xc 800 pg atp cm 2 and pe 100 2000 3000 pg atp cm 2 the highest atp concentration was found in the biofilm on pvc p 8000 20 000 pg atp cm 2 table 2 shows the total biomass production potential bpp and the biofilm formation potential of the materials the materials copper glass and pvc c showed a bpp lower than 200 pg atp cm 2 the bpps of pe xb and pe xc were comparable 880 208 and 794 69 pg atp cm 2 respectively besides the positive control pvc p bpp 14 885 3300 pg atp cm 2 pe 100 had the highest bpp among the different materials 2204 207 pg atp cm 2 the biofilm formation potential values ranged from 56 to 14 260 pg atp cm 2 for the different materials and were in the same order as observed for the bpp values from low to high values copper glass pvc c pe xc pe xb pe 100 and pvc p 3 2 2 legionella pneumophila the l pneumophila numbers in water and biofilm were relatively stable during week 24 32 for all materials in the bpp test fig 3 a furthermore the average l pneumophila numbers in water did not differ considerable between glass pvc c pe xb and pe xc and varied between 10 and 250 cfu ml 1 the l pneumophila numbers in the water of pe 100 were just above that 385 cfu ml 1 in contrast the l pneumophila numbers in the water with copper were below the detection limit of 1 cfu ml 1 whereas the l pneumophila numbers in the water of the positive control pvc p were the highest 4000 20 000 cfu ml 1 fig 3a the l pneumophila numbers observed in the biofilm were lowest for copper 10 40 cfu cm 2 whereas the highest numbers were detected for pvc p 1 106 cfu cm 2 fig 3b l pneumophila numbers observed in the biofilm of the materials pvc c and glass were around 1 103 cfu cm 2 whereas the materials pe xb and pe 100 showed l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm of around 1 104 cfu cm 2 l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm of pe xc 5 103 cfu cm 2 were in between the numbers observed in the biofilm on glass pvc c and pe xb pe 100 the l pneumophila numbers in water and biofilm of each material were used to calculate the legionella growth potential the legionella growth potential values for the different materials followed the same trend as was observed for the bpp and biofilm formation potential copper had the lowest legionella growth potential 25 cfu cm 2 whereas pvc p had the highest legionella growth potential 1 4 106 cfu cm 2 table 2 the materials pvc c glass and pe xc showed a legionella growth potential ranging from 1359 to 5065 cfu cm 2 respectively the materials pe xb and pe 100 resulted in approximately five times higher legionella growth potential values 11 377 and 18 140 cfu cm 2 respectively than pvc c glass or pe xc 4 discussion 4 1 legionella growth potential of different water types the opportunistic pathogen l pneumophila can be dispersed via drinking water which poses a potential health threat there are several factors which can influence growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water system such as the aoc concentration of drinking water van der kooij 1992 pipe materials colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 hydraulics douterelo et al 2013 soini et al 2002 iron conley et al 1985 van der lugt et al 2017 and temperature lautenschlager et al 2010 plouffe et al 1983 furthermore a recent study demonstrated that the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm is positively correlated with the aoc concentration of drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 consequently this has led to the hypothesis that a reduction of aoc in the drinking water leads to a reduction of the legionella growth potential this hypothesis was investigated in our study where the legionella growth potential of conventionally treated groundwater was compared with that of remineralised ro treated groundwater produced by a pilot plant since the aoc concentration for conventionally treated water was between 8 and 30 μg c l 1 whereas the ro treated water had an aoc concentration below 1 μg c l 1 pers comm g liu m lut the atp concentrations and legionella numbers detected in the biofilm of ro water and remineralised ro water were comparable these results show that the remineralisation step had little influence on the biofilm formation potential and legionella growth potential of the water it can therefore be concluded that no or very low concentrations of biodegradable substances are added to the water due to the remineralisation step after the ro process our results also showed that conventionally treated water has a considerably higher legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential than ro water and remineralised ro water in two previous studies the legionella growth potential of treated water at different production locations using different sources for drinking water production in the netherlands have been determined van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 the legionella growth potential observed for the conventionally treated groundwater from our study was comparable to the highest values obtained from conventionally treated groundwater that were reported in those previous studies van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 furthermore the legionella growth potential of ro water and remineralised ro water were comparable to a drinking water type that showed the lowest legionella growth potential and which was produced from oxygenic groundwater with a very low aoc concentration 1 0 μg c l 1 van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 ro decreases the aoc and legionella growth potential of the treated water and these values were among the lowest measured in the netherlands van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 ro thus seems a good treatment option to considerably lower the legionella growth potential of the water which might lead to a reduced risk of dispersal of l pneumophila through drinking water however our results were obtained in a pilot scaled ro system and it is recommended to i determine the legionella growth potential of drinking water and ii monitor for legionella in buildings in the distribution system when the full scale system is operational our results also support the conclusion of van der kooij et al 2017 that drinking water with aoc concentrations around or below 1 μg aoc l 1 does not or barely support growth of l pneumophila van der kooij et al 2017 van der kooij et al 2017 found a correlation between the biofilm formation potential and the legionella growth potential both determined with the bbm for different water types that were previously analyzed van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 when we add the legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential of the three analyzed water types from our study they agree very well with the correlation observed before fig 4 the correlation showed that a ten times lower atp concentration of the biofilm formation potential results in a hundred fold lower l pneumophila numbers of the legionella growth potential both determined with the bbm this means that reducing the biofilm concentration is an effective way to reduce l pneumophila van der kooij et al 2017 also observed that the legionella growth potential correlated with the growth potential of drinking water which was determined by measuring the aoc concentration of the water more importantly we demonstrated in our study that this relationship can be used to support the installation of specific treatment processes such as ro that reduce the aoc concentration in the drinking water and hence the legionella growth potential 4 2 legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water the above discussed results showed that remineralised ro water significantly reduced the legionella growth potential besides water being a source of bdoc pipe materials in contact with drinking water can also release growth promoting substances escobar et al 2001 rożej et al 2015 and can therefore enhance the growth of for example l pneumophila buse et al 2014 colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 consequently we investigated whether certain pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water can still enhance microbial growth in general and specifically growth of l pneumophila our results demonstrated that pe based pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water enhanced microbial growth and growth of l pneumophila these results were similar to those found when these pipe material types were tested with drinking water produced from anoxic groundwater that had been conventionally treated aeration and rapid filtration van der kooij veenendaal 2011 2014 rogers et al 1994 also reported that pe materials resulted in higher biofilm formation than pvc c or glass they reported that l pneumophila easily colonize plastic materials pp pe and pvc they arranged tested materials with respect to biofilm formation in ascending order glass stainless steel pp pvc mild carbon steel pe latex rogers et al 1994 rożej et al 2015 however they used conventionally treated water instead of remineralised ro water in their test given the similar findings between materials in contact with conventionally treated drinking water or remineralised ro water we conclude that the drinking water quality has no or very limited influence on the amount of microbial biomass formed or l pneumophila grown on pe based materials in contact with drinking water in contrast pvc c and newly used copper did not enhance growth of l pneumophila compared to the negative control glass when these pipe materials are used in drinking water distribution or premises plumbing systems the improved drinking water quality obtained with ro treatment can reduce growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water environment in the netherlands drinking water companies restrict the use of pe materials in the distribution system because of the relatively high release of growth promoting compounds from pe and therefore preferable pvc u is used vewin 2015 when drinking water companies will want to switch from supplying conventionally treated groundwater to remineralised ro water in the future it is expected that the biofilm formation will be limited due to i the low biofilm formation potential of the water and ii the main use of pipe materials in the distribution system that have a low concentration of growth promoting compounds furthermore it is also important to note that in the netherlands the temperature in the distribution system is rarely higher than 25 c which further reduces the risk of growth of l pneumophila van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 van der kooij et al 2002 in contrast the drinking water temperature in premises plumbing systems in the netherlands can be more favorable for growth of l pneumophila furthermore in premises plumbing systems different materials are used such as copper pvc c pe x and pvc p it was observed in our study that new copper material in contact with remineralised ro water decreased the legionella growth potential of the materials a study of a dynamic model drinking water system also showed that copper pipes have an inhibitory effect on growth of l pneumophila in heterotrophic biofilms van der kooij et al 2005 however this inhibitory effect was only temporary because after two years l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on copper were the same as for the other materials tested stainless steel and pe x the authors suggested that the initial inhibitory effect of copper on l pneumophila growth disappeared due to the accumulation of corrosion products covering the surfaces and thereby preventing release of copper ions van der kooij et al 2005 most other studies that investigated the effect of copper on microbial growth also demonstrated that copper repressed biofilm growth for example yu et al 2010 and morvay et al 2011 noted fewer cells within drinking water biofilms on copper coupons than with other materials and lehtola et al 2005 demonstrated faster biofilm growth on pe than on copper pipes lu et al 2014 yu et al 2010 morvay et al 2011 lehtola et al 2005 in contrast with the results of these studies and our study gião et al 2015 found slightly more l pneumophila on new copper material than on pvc u and pex reaching the conclusion that copper is not directly effective in reducing growth of l pneumophila this apparent discrepancy between our results and the results of gião et al 2015 could have been caused by applying a different procedure peptide nucleoid acid probe to enumerate l pneumophila in addition gião et al 2015 also used a different incubation period they sampled the biofilm after 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 days whereas we sampled the biofilm after 16 weeks it has been reported that new copper material can sometimes contain a thin oily layer which can be degraded by microorganisms thereby leading to increased growth during the first month van der kooij et al 2002 our observation that l pneumophila growth was more enhanced on pe and pvc p materials than on copper and pvc c in contact with remineralised ro water gives reason for concern in the last few years the use of copper in premises plumbing systems has decreased whereas the use of pe and pvc p in shower or garden hoses has increased based on the results of our study it would be better to restrict the use of pe and pvc p in premises plumbing systems and increase the use of materials that have a lower bpp or legionella growth potential such as copper stainless steel or pvc c materials to reduce the risk of l pneumophila growth in premises plumbing systems overall the results of our study showed that remineralised ro water reduced growth of l pneumophila in the bbm but that this improved drinking water quality had no or very limited influence on the amount of biomass formed on pipe materials that release relatively high concentrations of growth promoting substances i e pe and pvc p hence when such materials are used in premises plumbing systems l pneumophila might still grow despite the high quality of the supplied remineralised ro water we therefore conclude that ro can be used to prevent legionella contamination furthermore when pipe materials with a low legionella growth potential are used in the distribution and premises plumbing systems in combination with ro treated drinking water the risk of growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water environment can be significantly reduced 4 3 conclusions conventionally treated groundwater has a relatively high legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential when the same water is treated with a ro pilot plant this ro water has a very low legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential in addition the remineralised ro water does not or hardly enhance growth of l pneumophila in the bbm system that mimicked a premises plumbing system remineralisation of ro treated water has no effect on the biofilm formation potential and legionella growth potential of the water the bpp test showed that the drinking water quality has no or a very limited influence on the biomass concentration or growth of l pneumophila on materials that excrete relatively high concentrations of growth promoting substances i e pe and pvc p pe based materials and pvc p elevate the legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential and the use of those materials in premises plumbing systems can thus increase the risk of l pneumophila growth prevention of l pneumohila contamination can be achieved by combining ro treatment at the production plant and using pipe materials with no or low concentrations of growth promoting compounds in the distribution and premises

18843,treatment processes such as membrane filtration with reverse osmosis ro are used to produce drinking water with a high degree of biostability to our knowledge the influence of ro water on biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila has not yet been investigated therefore this study aimed i to determine the legionella growth potential of remineralised ro water produced by a pilot plant and to compare this to conventional treated groundwater and ii to determine if different pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water can cause growth of l pneumophila the legionella growth potential of water was determined with the boiler biofilm monitor bbm that mimics the flow of water in a premise plumbing system the legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water was determined by using the biomass production potential bpp test atp concentrations in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with remineralised ro water fluctuated around 100 pg atp cm 2 in contrast bbms fed with conventionally treated water resulted in ten fold higher atp concentrations in the biofilm moreover conventionally treated water had a legionella growth potential that was 1000 fold higher than that of remineralised ro water furthermore glass copper and pvc c had the lowest biofilm concentrations and legionella growth potential in the bpp test followed by pe xb pe xc and pe 100 the highest biofilm concentration and legionella growth potential were with pvc p hence our study demonstrated that remineralised ro water did not enhance growth of l pneumophila in the bbm that mimics the premises plumbing system however when pe or pvc p materials are used growth of l pneumophila can still occur in the premises plumbing system despite the high

snoeyink 1984 the biofilm present in the distribution and or premises plumbing system can have a negative impact on water quality due to the presence of opportunistic pathogens such as legionella pneumophila in the biofilm van der kooij et al 2003 l pneumophila can cause disease in humans and tap water installations have been identified as a source for dissemination reviewed in van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 l pneumophila is able to multiply in protozoa that in turn graze on the available biofilm in the drinking water environment kuiper et al 2004 declerck et al 2009 lau and ashbolt 2009 a log log linear correlation between biofilm concentration and l pneumophila numbers in a drinking water pilot system that mimics the premise plumbing system was recently demonstrated van der kooij et al 2017 the same study also showed that the biofilm concentration is related to assimilable organic carbon aoc concentration in water this implies that by reducing the aoc concentration in drinking water less biofilm will be formed resulting in lower l pneumophila numbers treatment processes are available to produce drinking water with a high degree of biostability one such process is membrane filtration with reverse osmosis ro ro removes almost all ions and organic matter such as bdoc gagliardo et al 1998 kamp et al 2000 radjenović et al 2008 which can result in the production of drinking water with extremely low aoc concentrations 1 μg cl 1 park and hu 2010 prest et al 2016 to this end the dutch drinking water company oasen is planning to apply 100 ro to treat their anoxic source water blend of anoxic groundwater and riverbank filtrated surface water and to remineralise the filtrate before it is distributed due to the effective removal of bdoc by ro it is expected that the remineralised filtrate could prevent the growth of l pneumophila in the downstream drinking water system bdoc in the drinking water system does however not only come from the treated water it is known that certain pipe materials which are used in the distribution or premises plumbing system release organic substances into the water that promote growth of microorganisms escobar et al 2001 rożej et al 2015 including l pneumophila buse et al 2014 colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 to the best of our knowledge the influence of remineralised ro water and the effect of pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water on biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila has not yet been investigated therefore the objectives of our study were to determine i the legionella growth potential of remineralised ro water and compare this to conventionally treated water and ii whether different pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water in the distribution system or premises plumbing systems enhance growth of l pneumophila 2 material methods 2 1 conventional drinking water ro and remineralisation processes at the drinking water treatment plant for the conventional water purification stream the extracted groundwater is submitted to aeration rapid sand filtration softening activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection before the treated water is pumped into the distribution system the ro pilot plant is operated with a capacity of 7 m3h 1 recovery rate of 75 followed by ion exchange and remineralisation 2 2 legionella growth potential of water the legionella growth potential of the ro remineralised ro and conventional treated water was determined using the boiler biofilm monitor bbm which mimics the flow of water in a premises plumbing system van der kooij et al 2017 in short the bbm consisted of a boiler placed upstream of a biofilm monitor that was filled with glass rings three times an hour the boiler flushed the biofilm monitor for 20 s with 1 5 2 l water of interest this water had a temperature of 38 c due to mixing of hot 70 c and cold water the biofilm monitor was placed in a cabinet so that the temperature was maintained at 38 c and the monitor remained in complete darkness a bbm was placed i directly after the ro installation ii directly after the ro water that was remineralised and iii directly after the conventional treatment the bbms fed with ro and remineralised ro water operated from 30 march till 9 september 2015 whereas the bbm fed with conventionally treated water started later 1 july till 18 october 2015 due to some electric power issues the day that the bbms were started is referred to as day 0 after two weeks of bbm operation the bbm system was inoculated with l pneumophila by inserting a short silicon tube precultured with l pneumophila serogroup 1 serotype 1 in the plumbing part of the boiler where water flows through before it enters the biofilm monitor glass rings and water were sampled in duplicate every two weeks during a period of six months biofilm was removed from the glass rings by sonication for three consecutive times in 10 ml of each time new sterile water with low energy for 2 min drinking water samples and biofilm samples after sonication were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate atp and l pneumophila the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm pg atp cm 2 of each water type was determined by calculating the 90 percentile using the standard formula for percentiles in excel 2013 of the atp concentrations in the biofilm that were determined on the glass rings which were obtained every two weeks from the bbm the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm colony forming units cfu cm 2 of each water type was determined by calculating the 90 percentile of the cfu of l pneumophila in the biofilm that were determined on the glass rings which were obtained every two weeks from the bbm van der kooij et al 2017 2 3 legionella growth potential of materials the legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water was determined by using the biomass production potential bpp test for materials which was developed previously van der kooij and veenendaal 2001 nen en 16421 copper pe xb pe xc pvc c and pe 100 were tested together with glass as negative control and pvc p as positive control in duplicate by incubating 150 cm2 of each material in 900 ml remineralised ro water which was produced in the pilot ro installation at the treatment plant see 2 1 subsequently the samples were incubated for 16 weeks at 37 c in the dark every week the water in the flask was renewed after 16 weeks material pieces 25 cm2 and water 100 ml were analyzed for atp thereafter the samples were inoculated with l pneumophila from a stock culture with concentration of 8 105 cfu ml 1 0 1 ml was added to 900 ml at 24 28 and 32 weeks material pieces 25 cm2 and water 100 ml were taken and the material pieces were added to 40 ml of sterile water subsequently the biofilm was removed by swabbing the material surface using a cotton swab next the samples containing material cotton swab and 40 ml of water were sonicated once with high energy for 2 min amplitude of 45 30 watt water samples and biofilm samples after swabbing and sonication were analyzed for atp and l pneumophila respectively the biomass production at week 24 28 and 32 was calculated for each material by taking the sum of the atp concentration of the biofilm attached biomass and of the water suspended biomass the biomass production potential bpp of the material was then calculated by averaging the three biomass production values in addition the biofilm formation potential of each material was determined by calculating the average atp concentrations of the attached biomass only at week 24 28 and 32 the legionella growth potential of each material was determined by calculating the average cfu of l pneumophila in the biofilm on each material at 24 28 and 32 weeks 2 4 analytical methods the atp concentration as measure for active biomass was determined in all water and biofilm samples by measuring the amount of light produced in a luciferin luciferase assay van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 this assay consisted of adding a nucleotide releasing buffer celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands to the sample to release atp from the cells next reagents were added and the generated light signal was measured as relative light units after a two second delay time and a ten second integration time with a luminometer celsis international b v maastricht airport the netherlands the atp concentration was calculated from the relative light units values by using an average conversion factor determined from calibration curves the detection limit was 1 ng atp l 1 colony counts of l pneumophila were determined using the culture method on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with antibiotics polymixine b sulfaat and natriumcefazoline and the plates were incubated at 37 c for seven days edelstein 1981 iso standard 11731 2 typical colonies were counted and subsequently confirmed using buffered charcoal yeast extract agar without cysteine 3 results 3 1 legionella growth potential of the different water types 3 1 1 atp the atp concentration in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with conventionally treated water at day 19 was already relatively high with 280 36 pg atp cm 2 when compared to the other water types fig 1 a the atp concentration continued to increase to 1700 92 pg atp cm 2 at day 75 after which it remained stable until the end of the experiment day 104 the atp concentration on the glass rings from the bbm fed with ro water and remineralised ro water was clearly lower than that of conventionally treated water fig 1a in these two bbms the atp concentration of the biofilm varied between 40 and 150 pg atp cm 2 throughout the experiment with no clear difference between ro water and remineralised ro water we calculated the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm from the atp concentrations of the biofilm on the glass rings in the bbm for each of the three water types the biofilm formation potential determined with the bbm of the conventional treated water was 1642 pg atp cm 2 whereas the biofilm formation potential of the ro water and the remineralised ro water were 238 pg atp cm 2 and 133 pg atp cm 2 respectively table 1 the biofilm formation potential of ro water and remineralised ro water were thus comparable to each other and around ten fold lower than that of the conventionally treated water 3 1 2 legionella pneumophila after inoculation with the silicone tube precultured with l pneumophila serogroup 1 serotype 1 in the bbm s l pneumophila could be cultivated from the water of all three bbm s with numbers fluctuating between 200 and 1000 cfu l 1 this demonstrates that the inoculation of the bbm system with l pneumophila using the silicone tube was successful as has been observed before van der kooij et al 2017 l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with conventionally treated water were 4000 cfu cm 2 at day 47 fig 1b thereafter numbers peaked to 22 000 cfu cm 2 at day 61 after which l pneumophila stabilized around 10 000 cfu cm 2 till the end of the experiment l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with ro water and remineralised ro water were clearly lower than those in the bbm fed with conventionally treated water fig 1b the l pneumophila numbers of the biofilm in the bbm fed with ro water rose to 45 cfu cm 2 after 80 days and then declined to numbers that were around the detection limit of 4 3 cfu cm 2 fig 1b in the biofilm on the glass rings from the bbm fed with remineralised ro water the highest l pneumophila numbers 30 cfu cm 2 were observed at day 107 thereafter numbers also declined to numbers that were around the detection limit fig 1b we calculated the legionella growth potential from the l pneumophila numbers of the biofilm on the glass rings in the bbm for each of the three water types the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm of conventionally treated water was 16 601 cfu cm 2 whereas that of ro water and remineralised ro water were 34 cfu cm 2 and 23 cfu cm 2 respectively the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm of ro water and remineralised ro water were thus comparable to each other but three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventionally treated water table 1 3 2 legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water 3 2 1 atp atp concentrations of the water and biofilm were determined on four different moments during incubation of seven different materials in the bpp test with remineralised ro water as test water for all the materials the atp concentration of the water suspended biomass was relatively stable in time week 24 32 fig 2 a the atp concentrations ranged from 3 to 160 ng atp l 1 in water fig 2a furthermore the average atp concentrations in water were similar for the different materials 3 31 ng atp l 1 except for pvc p positive control which had consistently higher atp concentrations 100 164 ng atp l 1 the atp concentrations in the biofilm attached biomass differed more between the different materials than the atp concentrations of the water fig 2b the atp concentrations in the biofilm on the materials glass copper and pvc c were the lowest 200 pg atp cm 2 followed by pe xb and pe xc 800 pg atp cm 2 and pe 100 2000 3000 pg atp cm 2 the highest atp concentration was found in the biofilm on pvc p 8000 20 000 pg atp cm 2 table 2 shows the total biomass production potential bpp and the biofilm formation potential of the materials the materials copper glass and pvc c showed a bpp lower than 200 pg atp cm 2 the bpps of pe xb and pe xc were comparable 880 208 and 794 69 pg atp cm 2 respectively besides the positive control pvc p bpp 14 885 3300 pg atp cm 2 pe 100 had the highest bpp among the different materials 2204 207 pg atp cm 2 the biofilm formation potential values ranged from 56 to 14 260 pg atp cm 2 for the different materials and were in the same order as observed for the bpp values from low to high values copper glass pvc c pe xc pe xb pe 100 and pvc p 3 2 2 legionella pneumophila the l pneumophila numbers in water and biofilm were relatively stable during week 24 32 for all materials in the bpp test fig 3 a furthermore the average l pneumophila numbers in water did not differ considerable between glass pvc c pe xb and pe xc and varied between 10 and 250 cfu ml 1 the l pneumophila numbers in the water of pe 100 were just above that 385 cfu ml 1 in contrast the l pneumophila numbers in the water with copper were below the detection limit of 1 cfu ml 1 whereas the l pneumophila numbers in the water of the positive control pvc p were the highest 4000 20 000 cfu ml 1 fig 3a the l pneumophila numbers observed in the biofilm were lowest for copper 10 40 cfu cm 2 whereas the highest numbers were detected for pvc p 1 106 cfu cm 2 fig 3b l pneumophila numbers observed in the biofilm of the materials pvc c and glass were around 1 103 cfu cm 2 whereas the materials pe xb and pe 100 showed l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm of around 1 104 cfu cm 2 l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm of pe xc 5 103 cfu cm 2 were in between the numbers observed in the biofilm on glass pvc c and pe xb pe 100 the l pneumophila numbers in water and biofilm of each material were used to calculate the legionella growth potential the legionella growth potential values for the different materials followed the same trend as was observed for the bpp and biofilm formation potential copper had the lowest legionella growth potential 25 cfu cm 2 whereas pvc p had the highest legionella growth potential 1 4 106 cfu cm 2 table 2 the materials pvc c glass and pe xc showed a legionella growth potential ranging from 1359 to 5065 cfu cm 2 respectively the materials pe xb and pe 100 resulted in approximately five times higher legionella growth potential values 11 377 and 18 140 cfu cm 2 respectively than pvc c glass or pe xc 4 discussion 4 1 legionella growth potential of different water types the opportunistic pathogen l pneumophila can be dispersed via drinking water which poses a potential health threat there are several factors which can influence growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water system such as the aoc concentration of drinking water van der kooij 1992 pipe materials colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 hydraulics douterelo et al 2013 soini et al 2002 iron conley et al 1985 van der lugt et al 2017 and temperature lautenschlager et al 2010 plouffe et al 1983 furthermore a recent study demonstrated that the legionella growth potential determined with the bbm is positively correlated with the aoc concentration of drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 consequently this has led to the hypothesis that a reduction of aoc in the drinking water leads to a reduction of the legionella growth potential this hypothesis was investigated in our study where the legionella growth potential of conventionally treated groundwater was compared with that of remineralised ro treated groundwater produced by a pilot plant since the aoc concentration for conventionally treated water was between 8 and 30 μg c l 1 whereas the ro treated water had an aoc concentration below 1 μg c l 1 pers comm g liu m lut the atp concentrations and legionella numbers detected in the biofilm of ro water and remineralised ro water were comparable these results show that the remineralisation step had little influence on the biofilm formation potential and legionella growth potential of the water it can therefore be concluded that no or very low concentrations of biodegradable substances are added to the water due to the remineralisation step after the ro process our results also showed that conventionally treated water has a considerably higher legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential than ro water and remineralised ro water in two previous studies the legionella growth potential of treated water at different production locations using different sources for drinking water production in the netherlands have been determined van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 the legionella growth potential observed for the conventionally treated groundwater from our study was comparable to the highest values obtained from conventionally treated groundwater that were reported in those previous studies van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 furthermore the legionella growth potential of ro water and remineralised ro water were comparable to a drinking water type that showed the lowest legionella growth potential and which was produced from oxygenic groundwater with a very low aoc concentration 1 0 μg c l 1 van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 ro decreases the aoc and legionella growth potential of the treated water and these values were among the lowest measured in the netherlands van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 ro thus seems a good treatment option to considerably lower the legionella growth potential of the water which might lead to a reduced risk of dispersal of l pneumophila through drinking water however our results were obtained in a pilot scaled ro system and it is recommended to i determine the legionella growth potential of drinking water and ii monitor for legionella in buildings in the distribution system when the full scale system is operational our results also support the conclusion of van der kooij et al 2017 that drinking water with aoc concentrations around or below 1 μg aoc l 1 does not or barely support growth of l pneumophila van der kooij et al 2017 van der kooij et al 2017 found a correlation between the biofilm formation potential and the legionella growth potential both determined with the bbm for different water types that were previously analyzed van der kooij and veenendaal 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 when we add the legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential of the three analyzed water types from our study they agree very well with the correlation observed before fig 4 the correlation showed that a ten times lower atp concentration of the biofilm formation potential results in a hundred fold lower l pneumophila numbers of the legionella growth potential both determined with the bbm this means that reducing the biofilm concentration is an effective way to reduce l pneumophila van der kooij et al 2017 also observed that the legionella growth potential correlated with the growth potential of drinking water which was determined by measuring the aoc concentration of the water more importantly we demonstrated in our study that this relationship can be used to support the installation of specific treatment processes such as ro that reduce the aoc concentration in the drinking water and hence the legionella growth potential 4 2 legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised ro water the above discussed results showed that remineralised ro water significantly reduced the legionella growth potential besides water being a source of bdoc pipe materials in contact with drinking water can also release growth promoting substances escobar et al 2001 rożej et al 2015 and can therefore enhance the growth of for example l pneumophila buse et al 2014 colbourne et al 1984 hambsch et al 2014 rogers et al 1994 consequently we investigated whether certain pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water can still enhance microbial growth in general and specifically growth of l pneumophila our results demonstrated that pe based pipe materials in contact with remineralised ro water enhanced microbial growth and growth of l pneumophila these results were similar to those found when these pipe material types were tested with drinking water produced from anoxic groundwater that had been conventionally treated aeration and rapid filtration van der kooij veenendaal 2011 2014 rogers et al 1994 also reported that pe materials resulted in higher biofilm formation than pvc c or glass they reported that l pneumophila easily colonize plastic materials pp pe and pvc they arranged tested materials with respect to biofilm formation in ascending order glass stainless steel pp pvc mild carbon steel pe latex rogers et al 1994 rożej et al 2015 however they used conventionally treated water instead of remineralised ro water in their test given the similar findings between materials in contact with conventionally treated drinking water or remineralised ro water we conclude that the drinking water quality has no or very limited influence on the amount of microbial biomass formed or l pneumophila grown on pe based materials in contact with drinking water in contrast pvc c and newly used copper did not enhance growth of l pneumophila compared to the negative control glass when these pipe materials are used in drinking water distribution or premises plumbing systems the improved drinking water quality obtained with ro treatment can reduce growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water environment in the netherlands drinking water companies restrict the use of pe materials in the distribution system because of the relatively high release of growth promoting compounds from pe and therefore preferable pvc u is used vewin 2015 when drinking water companies will want to switch from supplying conventionally treated groundwater to remineralised ro water in the future it is expected that the biofilm formation will be limited due to i the low biofilm formation potential of the water and ii the main use of pipe materials in the distribution system that have a low concentration of growth promoting compounds furthermore it is also important to note that in the netherlands the temperature in the distribution system is rarely higher than 25 c which further reduces the risk of growth of l pneumophila van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 van der kooij et al 2002 in contrast the drinking water temperature in premises plumbing systems in the netherlands can be more favorable for growth of l pneumophila furthermore in premises plumbing systems different materials are used such as copper pvc c pe x and pvc p it was observed in our study that new copper material in contact with remineralised ro water decreased the legionella growth potential of the materials a study of a dynamic model drinking water system also showed that copper pipes have an inhibitory effect on growth of l pneumophila in heterotrophic biofilms van der kooij et al 2005 however this inhibitory effect was only temporary because after two years l pneumophila numbers in the biofilm on copper were the same as for the other materials tested stainless steel and pe x the authors suggested that the initial inhibitory effect of copper on l pneumophila growth disappeared due to the accumulation of corrosion products covering the surfaces and thereby preventing release of copper ions van der kooij et al 2005 most other studies that investigated the effect of copper on microbial growth also demonstrated that copper repressed biofilm growth for example yu et al 2010 and morvay et al 2011 noted fewer cells within drinking water biofilms on copper coupons than with other materials and lehtola et al 2005 demonstrated faster biofilm growth on pe than on copper pipes lu et al 2014 yu et al 2010 morvay et al 2011 lehtola et al 2005 in contrast with the results of these studies and our study gião et al 2015 found slightly more l pneumophila on new copper material than on pvc u and pex reaching the conclusion that copper is not directly effective in reducing growth of l pneumophila this apparent discrepancy between our results and the results of gião et al 2015 could have been caused by applying a different procedure peptide nucleoid acid probe to enumerate l pneumophila in addition gião et al 2015 also used a different incubation period they sampled the biofilm after 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 days whereas we sampled the biofilm after 16 weeks it has been reported that new copper material can sometimes contain a thin oily layer which can be degraded by microorganisms thereby leading to increased growth during the first month van der kooij et al 2002 our observation that l pneumophila growth was more enhanced on pe and pvc p materials than on copper and pvc c in contact with remineralised ro water gives reason for concern in the last few years the use of copper in premises plumbing systems has decreased whereas the use of pe and pvc p in shower or garden hoses has increased based on the results of our study it would be better to restrict the use of pe and pvc p in premises plumbing systems and increase the use of materials that have a lower bpp or legionella growth potential such as copper stainless steel or pvc c materials to reduce the risk of l pneumophila growth in premises plumbing systems overall the results of our study showed that remineralised ro water reduced growth of l pneumophila in the bbm but that this improved drinking water quality had no or very limited influence on the amount of biomass formed on pipe materials that release relatively high concentrations of growth promoting substances i e pe and pvc p hence when such materials are used in premises plumbing systems l pneumophila might still grow despite the high quality of the supplied remineralised ro water we therefore conclude that ro can be used to prevent legionella contamination furthermore when pipe materials with a low legionella growth potential are used in the distribution and premises plumbing systems in combination with ro treated drinking water the risk of growth of l pneumophila in the drinking water environment can be significantly reduced 4 3 conclusions conventionally treated groundwater has a relatively high legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential when the same water is treated with a ro pilot plant this ro water has a very low legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential in addition the remineralised ro water does not or hardly enhance growth of l pneumophila in the bbm system that mimicked a premises plumbing system remineralisation of ro treated water has no effect on the biofilm formation potential and legionella growth potential of the water the bpp test showed that the drinking water quality has no or a very limited influence on the biomass concentration or growth of l pneumophila on materials that excrete relatively high concentrations of growth promoting substances i e pe and pvc p pe based materials and pvc p elevate the legionella growth potential and biofilm formation potential and the use of those materials in premises plumbing systems can thus increase the risk of l pneumophila growth prevention of l pneumohila contamination can be achieved by combining ro treatment at the production plant and using pipe materials with no or low concentrations of growth promoting compounds in the distribution and premises

18844,frequent off flavor events caused by geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol have caused concern among consumers about the quality of potable water pseudanabaena galeata a filamentous cyanobacterium is a known producer of 2 methylisoborneol in lakes and reservoirs the use of algicides to control cyanobacteria must consider the potential release of contaminants into the water this is the first study to systematically investigate the effectiveness of copper sulphate cuso4 potassium permanganate kmno4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on the cell viability and integrity of pseudanabaena galeata following algicide or oxidant treatment the release and degradation of 2 methylisoborneol was also examined it is evident that all of these chemicals can decrease pseudanabaena galeata viability and damage cell membranes and the filamentous pseudanabaena galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial microcystis aeruginosa of the three compounds used kmno4 showed the stronger ability to compromise cell integrity and 5 0 mg l kmno4 could induce 91 1 5 lysis of pseudanabaena galeata within 2 h it was found that h2o2 had the potential to degrade 2 methylisoborneol with 16 0 0 4 degraded by 20 0 mg l h2o2 within 8 h in contrast 2 methylisoborneol could not be degraded by cuso4 dosage 1 5 mg l reaction time 8 h and kmno4 dosage 5 0 mg l reaction time 3 h basically results showed that the oxidation capacity of h2o2 against pseudanabaena galeata was enhanced under sunlight the results will help drinking water utilities to better understand the

biocide it is still the most commonly applied algicide because it is economical effective and easy to apply elder and horne 1978 padovesi fonseca and philomeno 2004 because h2o2 decomposes to water

pty ltd nsw australia respectively 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 treatment of p galeata under visible light algicides were added to 1 l experimental flask containing 1 l cyanobacterial test cultures and then the samples were placed in an incubator 22 1 c for reaction the reaction system was irradiated continuously under the fluorescent lamp tms 018 philips which has a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm fan et al 2013b and a light intensity of 60 μmol photons m 2s 1 specific dose of every algicide was selected to compare the impact on p galeata cells for cuso4 and h2o2 0 5 1 5 and 3 0 20 0 mg l were chosen because they were regarded as recommend doses in lakes or reservoirs for cyanobacterial removal hobson et al 2012 furthermore the guideline value of world health organization for cu used in water bodies is less than 2 0 mg l world health organization 2008 the applied doses of kmno4 in water treatment plants are more dependent on water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon fe and mn fan et al 2013b 1 0 5 0 mg l kmno4 were selected for comparison as effective doses for pre treatment chen and yeh 2005 cuso4 was added to achieve copper

fig s1 c 2 2 2 h2o2 oxidize p galeata under sunlight appropriate amounts of h2o2 were added into 1 l open topped beakers height 20 cm containing bloom water to achieve desired h2o2 concentrations of 0 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l and placed in purpose designed water bath on the roof of south australia water corporation 34º51 0 s 138º33 0 e adelaide australia in september spring season during a period of uninterrupted full sun between 10 30 and 13 30 open topped beakers were used to ensure culture was exposed to full sunlight the water bath incorporated a refrigerative chiller and stirring device to achieve a constant temperature of 22 1 c the light intensity at 12 noon was 1800 μmol photons m 2s 1 measured with a scalar quantum sensor li cor li 190 because the light attenuation will occur in the water column carr et al 2010 and the height of bloom water in this study is only 20 cm which is much less than the depth of lake or reservoir shade cloth was placed over the container to simulate the light intensity in the middle and upper levels of a lake or reservoir and achieved a light intensity of 460 μmol photons m 2s 1 at 12 noon after 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 h 10 ml samples were taken and analysed for h2o2 residual measurement cell counts and flow cytometry respectively residual h2o2 was observed after 3 h as shown in fig s1 d 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis the methods of analysis of ph turbidity conductivity dissolved organic carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus alkalinity as caco3 and bicarbonate were shown in the supplementary material 2 3 2 residual cu kmno4 and h2o2 levels analysis the details about residual cu kmno4 and h2o2 detection of the treated samples were also shown in the supplementary material 2 3 3 cell counts cell counts were performed using a nikon 50i microscope and sedgewick rafter counting chamber s52 1 ml west chester usa the samples were fixed with lugol s solution 20 μl of lugol s iodine stock solution added to 1 ml of algae sample and then counted at 100 magnification 16 fields of view were counted in the sedgwick rafter counting chamber nelson et al 2005 2 3 4 flow cytometry analysis a facscalibur flow cytometer becton dickinson usa equipped with an air cooled 15 mw argon laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm was used for all fluorescence measurements and optically expressed cell features fluorescent filters and detectors were all standard with green fluorescence collected in channel fl1 530 nm and red fluorescence collected in channel fl3 670 nm probe fluorescence forward scatter fsc cell size and side scatter ssc cell granularity brookes et al 2000 measurements were collected and analysed using cellquest software becton dickinson usa fl1 and fl3 were used to identify the cyanobacterial cells fl1 was used to determine the fluorescent intensity of fluorescein diacetate fda fda sigma was used to assess the metabolic activity of the cyanobacterial cells a sample volume of 400 μl was mixed with 300 μl of fda 40 μg ml and incubated for 7 min at 22 1 c and then analysed by flow cytometry approximately 1000 filaments were recorded by the flow cytometry in the viable and nonviable regions 2 3 5 odour compounds analysis 20 ml of every sample was collected after treatment and then divided into two equal parts one part was stored in amber glass bottle at 4 c with 40 mg l hgcl2 added to lyse p galeata cells and inhibit biodegradation of 2 mib the other part was firstly filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane gf c whatman and then the filtrate was stored at 4 c in amber glass bottle with 40 mg l hgcl2 added to inhibit biodegradation the total concentration of 2 mib were measured by analyzing unfiltered samples while extracellular 2 mib concentration was determined by analyzing filtrated samples gf c whatman for 2 mib detection the samples were diluted 100 times due to the high initial concentration of 2 mib then 25 ml diluted samples were firstly pre concentrated by using solid phase micro extraction spme manual devices supelco usa yuan et al 2013 the adsorbed compounds were then thermally desorbed from the spme fiber directly into the injection port of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and quantitatively analysed using selected ion monitoring mode yuan et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis each treatment for each experiment had three replicates and the data expressed as the means standard deviation sd the entire treatment experiment including cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 treatment of p galeata under visible light and h2o2 oxidize p galeata under sunlight was done within one week all parameters were compared across treatments with two way anova using the spss software version 16 0 and the significance was set to p 0 05 the control is cell number and total extracellular 2 mib at time zero all statistical analyses were carried out using origin 9 1 3 results 3 1 assessment of p galeata cell viability after treatment by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light different initial doses of cuso4 0 1 5 mg l kmno4 0 5 0 mg l and h2o2 0 20 0 mg l were used for treatment of p galeata respectively the optical properties of cells shift as their physiology changes in response to chemical treatment following treatment with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light p galeata cells had reduced chlorophyll a autofluorescence and lower metabolic activity measured as fda fluorescent intensity see flow cytometric dot plots in figs s2 s4 these algicides usually inhibit effect on photosystem i1 psii activity and then effect chlorophyll a autofluorescence of algal cell samson et al 1988 neubauer and schreiber 1989 ou et al 2012 breeuwer et al 1995 and neyts et al 1991 reported that fda a non fluorescent diacetyl fluorescein ester can become fluorescent upon hydrolysis by cytoplasmic esterases and be used to measure esterase activity of the target cells the decrease of fda fluorescent intensity for the target cells indicated the algicides inhibit the activity of esterase in p galeata cells furthermore mcintyre and guéguen 2013 reported that cu could bind to protein like and humic like components in algae cells and then quench a small part fluorescence of them similarly the decrease of fda fluorescence in cuso4 system may be also due to the quench of cu which binds to the fda hydrolysis product by esterase and this effect should be weak the percentages of live p galeata cells treated by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light which were calculated from fda fluorescent intensity of individual cells figs s2 s4 are shown in fig 1 a c 28 1 1 of the p galeata cells lost cell viability when treated with a copper concentration of 0 5 mg l after 2 days exposure fig 1 a the proportion of dead cells increased with increasing cuso4 concentration or treatment time approximately 80 1 4 of cells exposed to 0 75 mg l cuso4 lost cell viability after 2 days of exposure fig 1 a almost all cyanobacterial cells were compromised when treated with cuso4 concentrations of 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l after 2 days exposure fig 1 a the viability of p galeata cells was moderately affected by kmno4 when the doses of kmno4 were less than 3 0 mg l fig 1 b however the percentage of dead cells increased to 81 3 1 when treated with 4 0 mg l kmno4 after 4 h fig 1 b the highest concentration of kmno4 5 0 mg l resulted in almost no viable cells after 4 h of exposure fig 1 b h2o2 effectively destroyed p galeata cells even at the lowest dose rates fig 1 c there were only 63 2 1 42 1 1 and 36 1 3 viable cells after 4 h when treated with h2o2 doses of 3 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively almost no viable cells were remained after 2 days exposure at all three concentrations the highest concentration of h2o2 20 0 mg l resulted in only 7 0 8 viable cells after 4 h 3 2 assessment of p galeata cell lysis by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light total cell numbers after treatment with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light are shown in fig 2 cell density increased from the initial 6 0 104 to 8 3 104 cells ml with 0 mg l cuso4 and h2o2 after 48 h treatment fig 2 a and c however it is not obvious for the growth of p galeata cells with 0 mg l kmno4 fig 2 b which may be due to the short treatment time 4 h as the cuso4 dose increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l there was a decrease in the total number of cells providing evidence of cell lysis fig 2 a there was a slight decrease in total cell concentration after oxidation by lower kmno4 doses 1 0 and 3 0 mg l however total cell concentration declined rapidly when treated with 4 0 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 fig 2 b h2o2 caused a large reduction in cell numbers even at the lowest concentrations tested fig 2 c the results above were in line with the variations of cell viability in fig 1 3 3 assess of the release and degradation of 2 mib by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light 2 mib is a semi volatile compound and the volatilization of 2 mib was investigated in the current study the concentration of total 2 mib for initial bloom water containing p galeata cells was 5529 65 ng l then the cyanobacterial test culture in an uncapped bottle was placed in the incubator 22 1 c the level of total 2 mib was collected and measured after 3 h and 8 h and the total 2 mib concentration decreased to 5227 50 and 5027 52 ng l respectively the volatilization rate in this study which is a 10 0 5 loss of 2 mib after 8 h is higher than the finding of wert et al 2014 who observed a 10 0 5 loss of 2 mib at room temperature 22 c after 24 h the reason may be due to the difference of the initial 2 mib concentration the concentrations of total and extracellular 2 mib for cultures treated with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 after 8 h 3 h and 8 h exposure respectively were shown in fig 3 total 2 mib concentration was the same for all cuso4 dosages suggesting that cuso4 does not degrade 2 mib basically fig 3 a extracellular 2 mib increased with increasing cuso4 concentration and was equivalent to total 2 mib at the highest cuso4 doses of 1 0 and 1 5 mg l demonstrating that all odour compounds had been released from cells fig 3 b showed that kmno4 does not degrade 2 mib basically even at the highest concentrations tested after 3 h exposure extracellular 2 mib did not increase significantly when the kmno4 dose increased from 0 to 3 0 mg l suggesting that low concentrations of kmno4 had minimal impact on p galeata cells however p galeata cells showed significant damage at kmno4 concentrations of 4 0 and 5 0 mg l with almost all intracellular 2 mib released fig 3 b this is consistent with total cell number data discussed above fig 2 b as mentioned above the concentration of total 2 mib for the cyanobacterial test culture was 5529 65 ng l then the level of total 2 mib declined to 5027 52 4900 138 4806 68 4521 96 and 4140 158 ng l with 0 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h reaction respectively the decline of total 2 mib with h2o2 should be due to volatilization and oxidation of h2o2 although molecular oxygen o2 would be produced for h2o2 decomposition which may increase the volatilization of 2 mib when o2 is released from aqueous solution this effect is weak and can be neglected liang et al 2014 furthermore it was found that the total 2 mib concentration with 3 0 20 0 mg l h2o2 was lower than that without h2o2 after 8 h reaction obviously p 0 0382 which demonstrated that a part 2 mib was degraded by h2o2 and there were 2 3 0 3 4 0 0 1 9 2 0 4 and 16 0 0 4 of total 2 mib degraded by 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h reaction respectively simultaneously extracellular 2 mib concentration increased with increasing h2o2 dose as a result of lysing p galeata cells fig 3 c as shown in fig 3 it was found that the concentration of extracellular 2 mib with h2o2 treatment was significantly lower than observed for cuso4 and kmno4 p 0 0015 demonstrating the ability of h2o2 to remove 2 mib was higher than cuso4 and kmno4 this may be attributed to the higher oxidation ability of h2o2 which can produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and the higher dosage of h2o2 in this study 3 4 assessment of p galeata cell viability and cell lysis by h2o2 under sunlight the effect of h2o2 on p galeata cell viability and cell lysis under sunlight was studied and the results presented in figs s5 and 4 it can be seen that the cell viability and total cell concentration decreased slightly after exposure to solar irradiation alone after 3 h however cell viability of p galeata cell declined significantly when h2o2 was included p 0 0028 total cell number of p galeata also decreased obviously when h2o2 was added p 0 0038 almost all p galeata cells were lysed when treated with 10 0 mg l h2o2 after 3 h under solar irradiation in contrast 24 h was needed to damage most of p galeata cells with 10 0 mg l h2o2 under visible light see fig 1 c furthermore it was found that the cell viability and total cell number declined as the oxidant dose increased from 0 to 20 0 mg l for the same treatment time 3 5 kinetics of p galeata cell lysis the kinetics of cyanobacterial cell lysis is often determined using the chick watson model daly et al 2007 wert et al 2013 in the current study there was a time delay between the addition of algicides and the membrane rupture of p galeata cells which could be seen as a lag phase a similar lag phase was previously observed for h2o2 oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells huo et al 2015 and chlorination of colonial m aeruginosa cells fan et al 2016 more recently fan et al 2018 found a lag phase for k2feo4 oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells this observed lag phase was incorporated into a delayed chick watson model proposed by huo et al 2015 and used to estimate cell lysis rates for algicides as follows ln n n 0 1 t t l a g k t t l a g t t l a g where t h the contact time t lag h the lag phase time n0 the number of intact cells at t 0 n the number of intact cells after a given treatment and k h 1 the rate constant at which lysis occurs it was reported that the data was not suitable for developing a model accurately when n n0 0 05 fan et al 2016 therefore in the current study it was decided to investigate the delayed chick watson model using the data for n n0 0 05 as shown in table 1 a lag phase tlag was observed before cell damage for all p galeata cells exposed to 0 5 1 5 mg l cuso4 1 0 5 0 mg l kmno4 and 3 0 20 0 mg l h2o2 respectively furthermore the tlag declined with increasing dose concentrations of cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 as presented in table 1 the lysis rates of cuso4 with p galeata cells were in the range of 0 022 0 198 h 1 the reaction rates of h2o2 were slightly higher than copper treatment 0 048 0 245 h 1 and kmno4 had the highest reaction rates 0 059 0 965 h 1 the results indicate that kmno4 has a higher oxidation capacity of p galeata cells especially when the initial concentration is larger than 3 0 mg l furthermore table 1 shows that a shorter lag phase and the higher cell lysis rate were observed when the p galeata cells were treated by h2o2 under sunlight compared to visible light 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 on p galeata and 2 mib under visible light all of the oxidants algicidal agents have a detrimental impact on p galeata viability and integrity under visible light cuso4 is a potent algicide chorus and bartram 1999 and even at the lowest cuso4 concentration of 0 5 mg l led to lysis in 59 7 2 1 of the population after 2 days treatment fig 2 a h2o2 can produce hydroxyl radicals which cause damage to cyanobacterial cells by the oxidation of proteins lipids and dna latifi et al 2009 and is considered an alternative algicide results from the current study show that h2o2 can damage p galeata cells efficiently even at the lowest dosage rates under visible light fig 2 c for kmno4 it is worth noting that the action of kmno4 at concentrations less than 3 0 mg l did not compromise either membrane integrity or cell viability this is in agreement with the study by fan et al 2013b which reported that kmno4 at a concentration of less than 3 0 mg l did not damage the cell membrane of m aeruginosa in contrast the current study showed p galeata cells were seriously damaged for kmno4 doses of 4 0 and 5 0 mg l and the lysis rates reached 0 479 and 0 965 h 1 respectively which was higher than that for 1 5 mg l cuso4 0 198 h 1 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 0 245 h 1 although cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 could inactivate and damage p galeata cells there was a lag phase before cell membranes were impaired for all three algicides table 1 which agrees with other researchers huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 this lag phase has been attributed to the mucilage that surrounds some cyanobacteria protecting them from algicide activity huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 furthermore it was found that the lag phase was shortened when higher initial cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 concentration were used similar observations were made by huo et al 2015 when m aeruginosa was treated with h2o2 these results indicated that higher dosage of the oxidants algicidal agent had a stronger ability to remove the cell bound mucilage and a faster way to destroy cell membrane as presented in table 1 the cell lysis rates for cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on p galeata were 0 198 h 1 0 110 h 1 and 0 965 h 1 for 1 5 mg l cuso4 10 0 mg l h2o2 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 respectively fan et al 2013b evaluated the effectiveness of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on m aeruginosa cell integrity under visible light and found that cell lysis rates were 0 135 h 1 0 039 h 1 and 0 038 h 1 for 1 5 mg l cuso4 10 2 mg l h2o2 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 respectively these indicate that the filamentous p galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial m aeruginosa it has also been found that the rate constants for filamentous cyanobacteria i e anabaena circinalis cylindrospermopsis raciborskii aphanizomenon issatsckenka are higher k 1607 4190 m 1 s 1 than for unicellular colonial m aeruginosa k 756 1100 m 1 s 1 when chlorine is used lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012 many factors may contribute to the susceptibility of cyanobacteria including strain specificity cell membrane thickness growth stage and the presence or absence of a mucilaginous sheath wert et al 2013 it was shown that m aeruginosa cells could produce a large amount of mucilage which surrounds the cell surface to form colonies tien et al 2002 chiou et al 2010 ma et al 2014 hence the main reason for the lower activity of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 against m aeruginosa cells is probably due to the large amount of mucilage which can protect the cell membrane increased levels of extracellular 2 mib fig 3 coincided with higher cell lysis rates table 1 for cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 systems it was also found that kmno4 had low ability to degrade 2 mib even at the highest dosage tested 5 0 mg l fig 3 b this supports the findings of glaze et al 1990 who demonstrated that kmno4 had low effect on degradation of 2 mib and was attributed to the molecular geometry of 2 mib furthermore because h2o2 can produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals which can oxidize 2 mib under visible light wert et al 2014 tan et al 2016 it was found that 2 mib was degraded obviously by h2o2 at dosages larger than 10 0 mg l fig 3 c although 2 mib can be oxidized by h2o2 it is interesting to note that only 16 0 0 4 2 mib was degraded at concentration of 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h treatment and the first order degradation rate is about 6 8 10 6 s 1 which is far less than the result of jo et al 2011 who degraded 2 mib in distilled water with a uv dose of 1200 mj cm2 and 6 0 mg l h2o2 and found the degradation rate is 7 2 0 2 10 3 s 1 there are may be three reasons firstly uv radiation can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 and produce more hydroxyl radicals secondly the initial 2 mib in our study is 5529 65 ng l which is higher than jo s study 306 ng l thirdly hydrogen peroxide would react with other compounds produced by cyanobacteria i e intracellular organic matter released when the p galeata cell are damaged by h2o2 in current study 4 2 effect of h2o2 on p galeata cell under sunlight results showed cell lysis rates were higher under sunlight compared to visible light at the same initial h2o2 concentration table 1 this phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of uv wavelengths on one hand uv can prevent the growth of cyanobacteria via direct photo degradation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species ou et al 2011 as we know australia has high levels of solar uv radiation mainly because of its geographical position with a latitude range of 10ºs to 43ºs and the latitude of adelaide is 34º51 0 s gies et al 2004 moreover the large loss of ozone observed over antarctica also increases the solar uv intensity gies et al 2004 hence the solar uv radiation should be high even in spring season as presented in table 1 the cell lysis rate was 0 056 h 1 without h2o2 under sunlight on the other hand as shown in fig s6 the absorption spectrum of h2o2 is between 200 and 400 nm and the uva 315 400 nm and uvb 280 315 nm are containing in the sunlight lirvall et al 1996 hence the presence of uva and uvb can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 to produce more hydroxyl radicals which cause damage to cyanobacterial cells by the oxidation of proteins lipids and dna latifi et al 2009 4 3 operational applications and recommendations considered as potential algicides oxidants cuso4 and h2o2 have been used effectively to control cyanobacterial growth in lakes and reservoirs cuso4 is still the most commonly applied algicide in lakes or reservoirs until now since it is economical effective and easy to apply elder and horne 1978 padovesi fonsec and philomeno 2004 wang et al 2017 kinley et al 2017 this study demonstrated that cuso4 can prevent the growth of p galeata cells as an algistat as well as an algicide and may be used to prevent p galeata bloom in lakes or reservoirs in the future however because cu addition to lakes or reservoirs will lead to the heavy metal accumulation and toxicity which is harmful to human and animal health moderate amount of cu should be used to control p galeata and the guideline value of world health organization for cu used in lakes or reservoirs is less than 2 0 mg l world health organization 2008 it is also notable that appropriate dose levels should be used to avoid the damage of p galeata cells to the point where large amounts of intracellular 2 mib are released as an environmentally friendly oxidant h2o2 could also be a potential algistat to control the growth of p galeata h2o2 did not only damage the membrane integrity of p galeata cells but it also degraded 2 mib for example 16 0 4 of total 2 mib was degraded by 20 0 mg l h2o2 within 8 h as shown in fig 3 c the algicidal activity of h2o2 when used in a reservoir lake is enhanced due to the presence of sunlight which includes uv wavelengths brookes et al 2004 hipsey et al 2004 h2o2 was used to control harmful cyanobacteria in a whole lake in the netherlands and the results showed that the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii which was the dominant species in this lake could be controlled effectively when 2 0 mg l h2o2 was added while there were no major impacts on eukaryotic phytoplankton zooplankton or macrofauna matthijs et al 2012 hence the use of h2o2 to control p galeata in a reservoir lake may also be possible in future although h2o2 may be considered as a potential chemical to control p galeata the ability to achieve reasonable contact time in a reservoir lake should be carefully assessed as shown in fig 4 a low dose of h2o2 i e 3 0 mg l was sufficient to control p galeata under natural sunlight nevertheless uv radiation is usually high only at the surface and attenuated with depth brookes et al 2004 light penetration would be very limited when there is a large cyanobacteria bloom furthermore matthijs et al 2012 reported that a concentration of h2o2 higher than 2 5 mg l would be harmful to the zooplankton kmno4 is better suited to pretreatment in drinking water processing plants kmno4 is the only chemical tested in this study that had minimal impact on membrane integrity of p galeata cells at lowest dose tested 3 0 mg l however the p galeata cells were damaged when the dosage of kmno4 was equal to and greater than 4 0 mg l resulting in the release of intracellular 2 mib overall it may be feasible to use kmno4 as a pretreatment at the lower doses which could not only enhance the removal of p galeata for the subsequent coagulation and flocculation process but also avoid the lysis of p galeata cells although cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 can damage and inhibit the growth of p galeata cells each of the algicides oxidants has drawbacks that limit their application in reservoirs or drinking water treatment plants the use of cuso4 could lead to the accumulation of heavy metal at the bottom of the reservoir which is toxic to the aquatic organisms santore et al 2001 h2o2 is a strong oxidant and difficult to handle in its pure form for kmno4 over dosing must be avoided because a residual kmno4 of 0 05 mg l or greater will result in a pink taint to the drinking water welch 1963 hence the application of each of these chemicals should be assessed against the desired outcomes and respective advantages disadvantages furthermore the application of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 as algicides should always be applied at the early stages of a p galeata bloom when cell densities are low so as to minimize extracellular 2 mib 5 conclusions addition of each of the water treatment algicides cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 could impair the cell viability and integrity of p galeata cells in this study compared with cuso4 and h2o2 it is apparent that kmno4 had a higher oxidation rate and could lead to lysis of most of the p galeata cells within 2 h 5 0 mg l kmno4 the release of intracellular 2 mib increased at higher dosages in longer treatment times for all three chemicals it is worth noting that h2o2 had the ability to degrade 2 mib with 10 0 mg l or higher dosage while the degradation ability of cuso4 and kmno4 for 2 mib was negligible when the dosages of cuso4 and kmno4 were lower than 1 5 and 5 0 mg l respectively moreover because of the presence of uv in sunlight the oxidation rate of h2o2 against p galeata cells was enhanced this study provides important information and guidance for reservoir and treatment plant

18844,frequent off flavor events caused by geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol have caused concern among consumers about the quality of potable water pseudanabaena galeata a filamentous cyanobacterium is a known producer of 2 methylisoborneol in lakes and reservoirs the use of algicides to control cyanobacteria must consider the potential release of contaminants into the water this is the first study to systematically investigate the effectiveness of copper sulphate cuso4 potassium permanganate kmno4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on the cell viability and integrity of pseudanabaena galeata following algicide or oxidant treatment the release and degradation of 2 methylisoborneol was also examined it is evident that all of these chemicals can decrease pseudanabaena galeata viability and damage cell membranes and the filamentous pseudanabaena galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial microcystis aeruginosa of the three compounds used kmno4 showed the stronger ability to compromise cell integrity and 5 0 mg l kmno4 could induce 91 1 5 lysis of pseudanabaena galeata within 2 h it was found that h2o2 had the potential to degrade 2 methylisoborneol with 16 0 0 4 degraded by 20 0 mg l h2o2 within 8 h in contrast 2 methylisoborneol could not be degraded by cuso4 dosage 1 5 mg l reaction time 8 h and kmno4 dosage 5 0 mg l reaction time 3 h basically results showed that the oxidation capacity of h2o2 against pseudanabaena galeata was enhanced under sunlight the results will help drinking water utilities to better understand the risk of pseudanabaena galeata lysis and 2 methylisoborneol release during raw water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pseudanabaena galeata 2 methylisoborneol algicide oxidation cell

ecosystems sellner 1997 brookes and carey 2011 the quality of source water for drinking sanitation and irrigation can deteriorate when harmful algae proliferate through the production of odourous and toxic metabolites kanoshina et al 2003 yang et al 2008 nyakairu et al 2010 schindler et al 2012 geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are reportedly responsible for most off flavor events in aquatic environments izaguirre and taylor 2004 jüttner and watson 2007 watson et al 2007 graham et al 2010 omur ozbek et al 2012 geosmin and 2 mib are semi volatile compounds that impart a muddy moldy or earthy musty flavor to drinking water at very low concentrations 4 10 ng l cook et al 2001 the presence of odour compounds in source water is frequently interpreted by consumers as unsafe to drink watson et al 2007 smith et al 2008 hence the threshold concentration of the odour compounds in drinking water is 10 ng l in china mh and sac 2006 and the odour in drinking water should be less than 3 threshold odour numbers in the u s a us epa 2012 there are more than 40 species of cyanobacteria which can produce geosmin or 2 mib izaguirre and taylor 2004 jüttner and watson 2007 including bloom forming genera such as pseudanabaena and anabaena as well as benthic epiphytic species of phormidium and oscillatoria the off flavor episodes caused by geosmin and 2 mib have frequently occurred in different water sources in the past two decades and bloom forming pseudanabaena species are implicated in a number of these events izaguirre and taylor 1998 izaguirre et al 1999 niiyama et al 2016 huang et al 2018 a pseudanabaena bloom occurred in castaic lake a large reservoir in southern california in the fall of 1993 izaguirre and taylor 1998 the musty smelling compound 2 mib in the water column reached or exceeded 150 ng l and persisted for two months with significant implications for the local drinking water in the summer of 1996 off flavor episodes caused by a pseudanabaena bloom were recorded in two southern california reservoirs san vicente reservoir and lake skinner izaguirre et al 1999 these events resulted in many consumers complaint from the respective communities niiyama et al 2016 reported that tainted tap water supplied from lake biwa japan was attributed to 2 mib produced by pseudanabaena huang et al 2018 found that pseudanabaena was an important 2 mib contributing phytoplankton in qingcaosha reservoir shanghai china some chemical compounds such as copper sulfate cuso4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and potassium permanganate kmno4 have been used as algicides to control the growth of problem cyanobacteria although copper addition to lakes or reservoirs as an algicide can result in cu accumulation in the sediments and act as a broad spectrum biocide it is still the most commonly applied algicide because it is economical effective and easy to apply elder and horne 1978 padovesi fonseca and philomeno 2004 because h2o2 decomposes to water and oxygen without chemical residues it is viewed as an environmentally friendly alternative algicide kay et al 1982 drabkova et al 2007 in order to maximize the removal of cyanobacteria cells in the conventional drinking water treatment plant preoxidation techniques such as chlorination or kmno4 are usually applied chen and yeh 2006 ma et al 2012a the surface characteristics and charge of cyanobacteria cells can be changed by oxidation and enhances the removal effectiveness of the coagulation and flocculation process it has been reported that the use of chlorine can cause significant cell lysis and intracellular odourous and toxic metabolites release even at low dosages peterson et al 1995 daly et al 2007 ma et al 2012b hence kmno4 may be a more appropriate pretreatment oxidant fan et al 2013a because microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa is the most common harmful cyanobacteria xu et al 2017 and microcystins which are cyclic heptapeptides ortea et al 2004 and produced mainly by m aeruginosa have a potential health risk to animals and humans who come into contact with the contaminated water paerl and huisman 2008 brookes and carey 2011 there is considerable research about m aeruginosa lysis and microcystins removal by cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 for example fan et al 2013b have systematically studied and compared cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on m aeruginosa removal it was found that cuso4 and h2o2 could not only destroy the viability of m aeruginosa cells but also showed algistatic potential 7 days after treatment kmno4 can also damage m aeruginosa cells at a higher dosage 10 mg l resulting in a cell lysis rate of 0 829 h 1 barrington and ghadouani 2008 investigated the effect of h2o2 on cyanobacteria chlorophyta and diatoms under visible light and found that cyanobacteria exhibited a rate constant approximately twice that of chlorophyta and diatoms at concentrations of 3 10 3 to 5 10 2 g h2o2 μg chlorophyll a moreover rodríguez et al 2007 investigated the effect of permanganate on mc lr degradation and found that permanganate can effectively oxidize mc lr while lu et al 2018 found that h2o2 can only degrade mc lr slightly although unicellular microcystis can be efficiently removed by cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 fan et al 2013b li et al 2014 there may be some differences for the multicellular filamentous pseudanabaena to the best of our knowledge there has been no reported study investigating treatment of pseudanabaena using these three algicides as well as associated removal of 2 mib the effectiveness of h2o2 can be enhanced with uv and this combination has been shown to help with improving water quality zhou and smith 2001 the removal of pseudanabaena and 2 mib could also be enhanced under sunlight the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the effect of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on the cell viability and integrity of pseudanabaena 2 assess the removal efficiency of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on 2 mib 3 study the enhanced effect of h2o2 on pseudanabaena and 2 mib under sunlight 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 algae cultivation pseudanabaena galeata p galeata psa 016 was obtained from australian water quality centre algal culture collection and is a known producer of 2 mib it was isolated from tarago lagoon victoria australia p galeata was cultured in bg11 medium ph 7 5 the filamentous p galeata has an average cell size of 1 5 2 2 μm broad and 3 5 7 5 μm long and a filament length up to 40 μm the cultures were maintained in an incubator thermoline trh at 25 c under 30 μmol photons m 2s 1 with a light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h after 15 days culture the cultures were at the late exponential phase of growth with a final cell yield of 107 cells ml then the cultures were shaken well and taken out for future use 2 1 2 raw water and treatment to simulate a bloom the natural source water was sampled from the myponga reservoir an important drinking water source in adelaide australia on september 15 2017 and filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter gf c whatman to remove natural algae the main characteristics of the filtered raw water were ph 8 0 turbidity 1 91 ntu 14 4 mg l dissolved organic carbon 14 7 mg l total organic carbon 0 025 mg l ammonia nitrogen 0 132 mg l total nitrogen 0 051 mg l total phosphorus 67 mg l total alkalinity as mg l caco3 and conductivity 545 μs cm then the filtered raw water was stored at 4 c for future use the filtered raw water was taken out from the refrigerator and then stored at room temperature 22 1 c for 8 h before this raw water was used for experiment to simulate the algal bloom in a high algae laden period the filtered raw water was spiked with p galeata cultures to achieve a final cell density of approximately 6 104 cells ml bloom water 2 1 3 chemicals cuso4 analytical reagent grade h2o2 30 w w analytical reagent grade and kmno4 analytical reagent grade were purchased from chem supply pty ltd adelaide australia nuplex industries ltd nsw australia and sigma aldrich pty ltd nsw australia respectively 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 treatment of p galeata under visible light algicides were added to 1 l experimental flask containing 1 l cyanobacterial test cultures and then the samples were placed in an incubator 22 1 c for reaction the reaction system was irradiated continuously under the fluorescent lamp tms 018 philips which has a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm fan et al 2013b and a light intensity of 60 μmol photons m 2s 1 specific dose of every algicide was selected to compare the impact on p galeata cells for cuso4 and h2o2 0 5 1 5 and 3 0 20 0 mg l were chosen because they were regarded as recommend doses in lakes or reservoirs for cyanobacterial removal hobson et al 2012 furthermore the guideline value of world health organization for cu used in water bodies is less than 2 0 mg l world health organization 2008 the applied doses of kmno4 in water treatment plants are more dependent on water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon fe and mn fan et al 2013b 1 0 5 0 mg l kmno4 were selected for comparison as effective doses for pre treatment chen and yeh 2005 cuso4 was added to achieve copper concentrations of 0 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 mg l after 0 2 4 8 24 and 48 h reaction 10 ml sample was taken out by pipetting gun from each flask for cu residual cell counts and flow cytometry analysis respectively 20 ml sample was taken after 8 h for analysis of total and extracellular odour compounds residual cu was present after 48 h treatment for different systems as shown in fig s1 a kmno4 was added to achieve concentrations of 0 1 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 mg l 10 ml sample was withdrawn by pipetting gun after 0 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 h and immediately analysed to determine kmno4 residual as well as cell counts and flow cytometry analysis 20 ml sample was taken after 3 h incubation for analysis of total and extracellular odour compounds residual kmno4 was present after 4 h reaction as shown in fig s1 b h2o2 was added to achieve concentrations of 0 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l and 10 ml sample was taken by pipetting gun after 0 2 4 8 24 and 48 h reaction and analysed for h2o2 residual cell counts and flow cytometry respectively and 20 ml sample was taken for total and extracellular odour compounds after 8 h reaction residual h2o2 was present after 48 h treatment for different systems as shown in fig s1 c 2 2 2 h2o2 oxidize p galeata under sunlight appropriate amounts of h2o2 were added into 1 l open topped beakers height 20 cm containing bloom water to achieve desired h2o2 concentrations of 0 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l and placed in purpose designed water bath on the roof of south australia water corporation 34º51 0 s 138º33 0 e adelaide australia in september spring season during a period of uninterrupted full sun between 10 30 and 13 30 open topped beakers were used to ensure culture was exposed to full sunlight the water bath incorporated a refrigerative chiller and stirring device to achieve a constant temperature of 22 1 c the light intensity at 12 noon was 1800 μmol photons m 2s 1 measured with a scalar quantum sensor li cor li 190 because the light attenuation will occur in the water column carr et al 2010 and the height of bloom water in this study is only 20 cm which is much less than the depth of lake or reservoir shade cloth was placed over the container to simulate the light intensity in the middle and upper levels of a lake or reservoir and achieved a light intensity of 460 μmol photons m 2s 1 at 12 noon after 0 0 5 1 2 and 3 h 10 ml samples were taken and analysed for h2o2 residual measurement cell counts and flow cytometry respectively residual h2o2 was observed after 3 h as shown in fig s1 d 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis the methods of analysis of ph turbidity conductivity dissolved organic carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus alkalinity as caco3 and bicarbonate were shown in the supplementary material 2 3 2 residual cu kmno4 and h2o2 levels analysis the details about residual cu kmno4 and h2o2 detection of the treated samples were also shown in the supplementary material 2 3 3 cell counts cell counts were performed using a nikon 50i microscope and sedgewick rafter counting chamber s52 1 ml west chester usa the samples were fixed with lugol s solution 20 μl of lugol s iodine stock solution added to 1 ml of algae sample and then counted at 100 magnification 16 fields of view were counted in the sedgwick rafter counting chamber nelson et al 2005 2 3 4 flow cytometry analysis a facscalibur flow cytometer becton dickinson usa equipped with an air cooled 15 mw argon laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm was used for all fluorescence measurements and optically expressed cell features fluorescent filters and detectors were all standard with green fluorescence collected in channel fl1 530 nm and red fluorescence collected in channel fl3 670 nm probe fluorescence forward scatter fsc cell size and side scatter ssc cell granularity brookes et al 2000 measurements were collected and analysed using cellquest software becton dickinson usa fl1 and fl3 were used to identify the cyanobacterial cells fl1 was used to determine the fluorescent intensity of fluorescein diacetate fda fda sigma was used to assess the metabolic activity of the cyanobacterial cells a sample volume of 400 μl was mixed with 300 μl of fda 40 μg ml and incubated for 7 min at 22 1 c and then analysed by flow cytometry approximately 1000 filaments were recorded by the flow cytometry in the viable and nonviable regions 2 3 5 odour compounds analysis 20 ml of every sample was collected after treatment and then divided into two equal parts one part was stored in amber glass bottle at 4 c with 40 mg l hgcl2 added to lyse p galeata cells and inhibit biodegradation of 2 mib the other part was firstly filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane gf c whatman and then the filtrate was stored at 4 c in amber glass bottle with 40 mg l hgcl2 added to inhibit biodegradation the total concentration of 2 mib were measured by analyzing unfiltered samples while extracellular 2 mib concentration was determined by analyzing filtrated samples gf c whatman for 2 mib detection the samples were diluted 100 times due to the high initial concentration of 2 mib then 25 ml diluted samples were firstly pre concentrated by using solid phase micro extraction spme manual devices supelco usa yuan et al 2013 the adsorbed compounds were then thermally desorbed from the spme fiber directly into the injection port of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and quantitatively analysed using selected ion monitoring mode yuan et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis each treatment for each experiment had three replicates and the data expressed as the means standard deviation sd the entire treatment experiment including cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 treatment of p galeata under visible light and h2o2 oxidize p galeata under sunlight was done within one week all parameters were compared across treatments with two way anova using the spss software version 16 0 and the significance was set to p 0 05 the control is cell number and total extracellular 2 mib at time zero all statistical analyses were carried out using origin 9 1 3 results 3 1 assessment of p galeata cell viability after treatment by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light different initial doses of cuso4 0 1 5 mg l kmno4 0 5 0 mg l and h2o2 0 20 0 mg l were used for treatment of p galeata respectively the optical properties of cells shift as their physiology changes in response to chemical treatment following treatment with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light p galeata cells had reduced chlorophyll a autofluorescence and lower metabolic activity measured as fda fluorescent intensity see flow cytometric dot plots in figs s2 s4 these algicides usually inhibit effect on photosystem i1 psii activity and then effect chlorophyll a autofluorescence of algal cell samson et al 1988 neubauer and schreiber 1989 ou et al 2012 breeuwer et al 1995 and neyts et al 1991 reported that fda a non fluorescent diacetyl fluorescein ester can become fluorescent upon hydrolysis by cytoplasmic esterases and be used to measure esterase activity of the target cells the decrease of fda fluorescent intensity for the target cells indicated the algicides inhibit the activity of esterase in p galeata cells furthermore mcintyre and guéguen 2013 reported that cu could bind to protein like and humic like components in algae cells and then quench a small part fluorescence of them similarly the decrease of fda fluorescence in cuso4 system may be also due to the quench of cu which binds to the fda hydrolysis product by esterase and this effect should be weak the percentages of live p galeata cells treated by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light which were calculated from fda fluorescent intensity of individual cells figs s2 s4 are shown in fig 1 a c 28 1 1 of the p galeata cells lost cell viability when treated with a copper concentration of 0 5 mg l after 2 days exposure fig 1 a the proportion of dead cells increased with increasing cuso4 concentration or treatment time approximately 80 1 4 of cells exposed to 0 75 mg l cuso4 lost cell viability after 2 days of exposure fig 1 a almost all cyanobacterial cells were compromised when treated with cuso4 concentrations of 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l after 2 days exposure fig 1 a the viability of p galeata cells was moderately affected by kmno4 when the doses of kmno4 were less than 3 0 mg l fig 1 b however the percentage of dead cells increased to 81 3 1 when treated with 4 0 mg l kmno4 after 4 h fig 1 b the highest concentration of kmno4 5 0 mg l resulted in almost no viable cells after 4 h of exposure fig 1 b h2o2 effectively destroyed p galeata cells even at the lowest dose rates fig 1 c there were only 63 2 1 42 1 1 and 36 1 3 viable cells after 4 h when treated with h2o2 doses of 3 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively almost no viable cells were remained after 2 days exposure at all three concentrations the highest concentration of h2o2 20 0 mg l resulted in only 7 0 8 viable cells after 4 h 3 2 assessment of p galeata cell lysis by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light total cell numbers after treatment with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light are shown in fig 2 cell density increased from the initial 6 0 104 to 8 3 104 cells ml with 0 mg l cuso4 and h2o2 after 48 h treatment fig 2 a and c however it is not obvious for the growth of p galeata cells with 0 mg l kmno4 fig 2 b which may be due to the short treatment time 4 h as the cuso4 dose increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l there was a decrease in the total number of cells providing evidence of cell lysis fig 2 a there was a slight decrease in total cell concentration after oxidation by lower kmno4 doses 1 0 and 3 0 mg l however total cell concentration declined rapidly when treated with 4 0 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 fig 2 b h2o2 caused a large reduction in cell numbers even at the lowest concentrations tested fig 2 c the results above were in line with the variations of cell viability in fig 1 3 3 assess of the release and degradation of 2 mib by cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 under visible light 2 mib is a semi volatile compound and the volatilization of 2 mib was investigated in the current study the concentration of total 2 mib for initial bloom water containing p galeata cells was 5529 65 ng l then the cyanobacterial test culture in an uncapped bottle was placed in the incubator 22 1 c the level of total 2 mib was collected and measured after 3 h and 8 h and the total 2 mib concentration decreased to 5227 50 and 5027 52 ng l respectively the volatilization rate in this study which is a 10 0 5 loss of 2 mib after 8 h is higher than the finding of wert et al 2014 who observed a 10 0 5 loss of 2 mib at room temperature 22 c after 24 h the reason may be due to the difference of the initial 2 mib concentration the concentrations of total and extracellular 2 mib for cultures treated with cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 after 8 h 3 h and 8 h exposure respectively were shown in fig 3 total 2 mib concentration was the same for all cuso4 dosages suggesting that cuso4 does not degrade 2 mib basically fig 3 a extracellular 2 mib increased with increasing cuso4 concentration and was equivalent to total 2 mib at the highest cuso4 doses of 1 0 and 1 5 mg l demonstrating that all odour compounds had been released from cells fig 3 b showed that kmno4 does not degrade 2 mib basically even at the highest concentrations tested after 3 h exposure extracellular 2 mib did not increase significantly when the kmno4 dose increased from 0 to 3 0 mg l suggesting that low concentrations of kmno4 had minimal impact on p galeata cells however p galeata cells showed significant damage at kmno4 concentrations of 4 0 and 5 0 mg l with almost all intracellular 2 mib released fig 3 b this is consistent with total cell number data discussed above fig 2 b as mentioned above the concentration of total 2 mib for the cyanobacterial test culture was 5529 65 ng l then the level of total 2 mib declined to 5027 52 4900 138 4806 68 4521 96 and 4140 158 ng l with 0 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h reaction respectively the decline of total 2 mib with h2o2 should be due to volatilization and oxidation of h2o2 although molecular oxygen o2 would be produced for h2o2 decomposition which may increase the volatilization of 2 mib when o2 is released from aqueous solution this effect is weak and can be neglected liang et al 2014 furthermore it was found that the total 2 mib concentration with 3 0 20 0 mg l h2o2 was lower than that without h2o2 after 8 h reaction obviously p 0 0382 which demonstrated that a part 2 mib was degraded by h2o2 and there were 2 3 0 3 4 0 0 1 9 2 0 4 and 16 0 0 4 of total 2 mib degraded by 3 0 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h reaction respectively simultaneously extracellular 2 mib concentration increased with increasing h2o2 dose as a result of lysing p galeata cells fig 3 c as shown in fig 3 it was found that the concentration of extracellular 2 mib with h2o2 treatment was significantly lower than observed for cuso4 and kmno4 p 0 0015 demonstrating the ability of h2o2 to remove 2 mib was higher than cuso4 and kmno4 this may be attributed to the higher oxidation ability of h2o2 which can produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and the higher dosage of h2o2 in this study 3 4 assessment of p galeata cell viability and cell lysis by h2o2 under sunlight the effect of h2o2 on p galeata cell viability and cell lysis under sunlight was studied and the results presented in figs s5 and 4 it can be seen that the cell viability and total cell concentration decreased slightly after exposure to solar irradiation alone after 3 h however cell viability of p galeata cell declined significantly when h2o2 was included p 0 0028 total cell number of p galeata also decreased obviously when h2o2 was added p 0 0038 almost all p galeata cells were lysed when treated with 10 0 mg l h2o2 after 3 h under solar irradiation in contrast 24 h was needed to damage most of p galeata cells with 10 0 mg l h2o2 under visible light see fig 1 c furthermore it was found that the cell viability and total cell number declined as the oxidant dose increased from 0 to 20 0 mg l for the same treatment time 3 5 kinetics of p galeata cell lysis the kinetics of cyanobacterial cell lysis is often determined using the chick watson model daly et al 2007 wert et al 2013 in the current study there was a time delay between the addition of algicides and the membrane rupture of p galeata cells which could be seen as a lag phase a similar lag phase was previously observed for h2o2 oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells huo et al 2015 and chlorination of colonial m aeruginosa cells fan et al 2016 more recently fan et al 2018 found a lag phase for k2feo4 oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells this observed lag phase was incorporated into a delayed chick watson model proposed by huo et al 2015 and used to estimate cell lysis rates for algicides as follows ln n n 0 1 t t l a g k t t l a g t t l a g where t h the contact time t lag h the lag phase time n0 the number of intact cells at t 0 n the number of intact cells after a given treatment and k h 1 the rate constant at which lysis occurs it was reported that the data was not suitable for developing a model accurately when n n0 0 05 fan et al 2016 therefore in the current study it was decided to investigate the delayed chick watson model using the data for n n0 0 05 as shown in table 1 a lag phase tlag was observed before cell damage for all p galeata cells exposed to 0 5 1 5 mg l cuso4 1 0 5 0 mg l kmno4 and 3 0 20 0 mg l h2o2 respectively furthermore the tlag declined with increasing dose concentrations of cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 as presented in table 1 the lysis rates of cuso4 with p galeata cells were in the range of 0 022 0 198 h 1 the reaction rates of h2o2 were slightly higher than copper treatment 0 048 0 245 h 1 and kmno4 had the highest reaction rates 0 059 0 965 h 1 the results indicate that kmno4 has a higher oxidation capacity of p galeata cells especially when the initial concentration is larger than 3 0 mg l furthermore table 1 shows that a shorter lag phase and the higher cell lysis rate were observed when the p galeata cells were treated by h2o2 under sunlight compared to visible light 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 on p galeata and 2 mib under visible light all of the oxidants algicidal agents have a detrimental impact on p galeata viability and integrity under visible light cuso4 is a potent algicide chorus and bartram 1999 and even at the lowest cuso4 concentration of 0 5 mg l led to lysis in 59 7 2 1 of the population after 2 days treatment fig 2 a h2o2 can produce hydroxyl radicals which cause damage to cyanobacterial cells by the oxidation of proteins lipids and dna latifi et al 2009 and is considered an alternative algicide results from the current study show that h2o2 can damage p galeata cells efficiently even at the lowest dosage rates under visible light fig 2 c for kmno4 it is worth noting that the action of kmno4 at concentrations less than 3 0 mg l did not compromise either membrane integrity or cell viability this is in agreement with the study by fan et al 2013b which reported that kmno4 at a concentration of less than 3 0 mg l did not damage the cell membrane of m aeruginosa in contrast the current study showed p galeata cells were seriously damaged for kmno4 doses of 4 0 and 5 0 mg l and the lysis rates reached 0 479 and 0 965 h 1 respectively which was higher than that for 1 5 mg l cuso4 0 198 h 1 and 20 0 mg l h2o2 0 245 h 1 although cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 could inactivate and damage p galeata cells there was a lag phase before cell membranes were impaired for all three algicides table 1 which agrees with other researchers huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 this lag phase has been attributed to the mucilage that surrounds some cyanobacteria protecting them from algicide activity huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 furthermore it was found that the lag phase was shortened when higher initial cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 concentration were used similar observations were made by huo et al 2015 when m aeruginosa was treated with h2o2 these results indicated that higher dosage of the oxidants algicidal agent had a stronger ability to remove the cell bound mucilage and a faster way to destroy cell membrane as presented in table 1 the cell lysis rates for cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on p galeata were 0 198 h 1 0 110 h 1 and 0 965 h 1 for 1 5 mg l cuso4 10 0 mg l h2o2 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 respectively fan et al 2013b evaluated the effectiveness of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 on m aeruginosa cell integrity under visible light and found that cell lysis rates were 0 135 h 1 0 039 h 1 and 0 038 h 1 for 1 5 mg l cuso4 10 2 mg l h2o2 and 5 0 mg l kmno4 respectively these indicate that the filamentous p galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial m aeruginosa it has also been found that the rate constants for filamentous cyanobacteria i e anabaena circinalis cylindrospermopsis raciborskii aphanizomenon issatsckenka are higher k 1607 4190 m 1 s 1 than for unicellular colonial m aeruginosa k 756 1100 m 1 s 1 when chlorine is used lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012 many factors may contribute to the susceptibility of cyanobacteria including strain specificity cell membrane thickness growth stage and the presence or absence of a mucilaginous sheath wert et al 2013 it was shown that m aeruginosa cells could produce a large amount of mucilage which surrounds the cell surface to form colonies tien et al 2002 chiou et al 2010 ma et al 2014 hence the main reason for the lower activity of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 against m aeruginosa cells is probably due to the large amount of mucilage which can protect the cell membrane increased levels of extracellular 2 mib fig 3 coincided with higher cell lysis rates table 1 for cuso4 kmno4 and h2o2 systems it was also found that kmno4 had low ability to degrade 2 mib even at the highest dosage tested 5 0 mg l fig 3 b this supports the findings of glaze et al 1990 who demonstrated that kmno4 had low effect on degradation of 2 mib and was attributed to the molecular geometry of 2 mib furthermore because h2o2 can produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals which can oxidize 2 mib under visible light wert et al 2014 tan et al 2016 it was found that 2 mib was degraded obviously by h2o2 at dosages larger than 10 0 mg l fig 3 c although 2 mib can be oxidized by h2o2 it is interesting to note that only 16 0 0 4 2 mib was degraded at concentration of 20 0 mg l h2o2 after 8 h treatment and the first order degradation rate is about 6 8 10 6 s 1 which is far less than the result of jo et al 2011 who degraded 2 mib in distilled water with a uv dose of 1200 mj cm2 and 6 0 mg l h2o2 and found the degradation rate is 7 2 0 2 10 3 s 1 there are may be three reasons firstly uv radiation can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 and produce more hydroxyl radicals secondly the initial 2 mib in our study is 5529 65 ng l which is higher than jo s study 306 ng l thirdly hydrogen peroxide would react with other compounds produced by cyanobacteria i e intracellular organic matter released when the p galeata cell are damaged by h2o2 in current study 4 2 effect of h2o2 on p galeata cell under sunlight results showed cell lysis rates were higher under sunlight compared to visible light at the same initial h2o2 concentration table 1 this phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of uv wavelengths on one hand uv can prevent the growth of cyanobacteria via direct photo degradation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species ou et al 2011 as we know australia has high levels of solar uv radiation mainly because of its geographical position with a latitude range of 10ºs to 43ºs and the latitude of adelaide is 34º51 0 s gies et al 2004 moreover the large loss of ozone observed over antarctica also increases the solar uv intensity gies et al 2004 hence the solar uv radiation should be high even in spring season as presented in table 1 the cell lysis rate was 0 056 h 1 without h2o2 under sunlight on the other hand as shown in fig s6 the absorption spectrum of h2o2 is between 200 and 400 nm and the uva 315 400 nm and uvb 280 315 nm are containing in the sunlight lirvall et al 1996 hence the presence of uva and uvb can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 to produce more hydroxyl radicals which cause damage to cyanobacterial cells by the oxidation of proteins lipids and dna latifi et al 2009 4 3 operational applications and recommendations considered as potential algicides oxidants cuso4 and h2o2 have been used effectively to control cyanobacterial growth in lakes and reservoirs cuso4 is still the most commonly applied algicide in lakes or reservoirs until now since it is economical effective and easy to apply elder and horne 1978 padovesi fonsec and philomeno 2004 wang et al 2017 kinley et al 2017 this study demonstrated that cuso4 can prevent the growth of p galeata cells as an algistat as well as an algicide and may be used to prevent p galeata bloom in lakes or reservoirs in the future however because cu addition to lakes or reservoirs will lead to the heavy metal accumulation and toxicity which is harmful to human and animal health moderate amount of cu should be used to control p galeata and the guideline value of world health organization for cu used in lakes or reservoirs is less than 2 0 mg l world health organization 2008 it is also notable that appropriate dose levels should be used to avoid the damage of p galeata cells to the point where large amounts of intracellular 2 mib are released as an environmentally friendly oxidant h2o2 could also be a potential algistat to control the growth of p galeata h2o2 did not only damage the membrane integrity of p galeata cells but it also degraded 2 mib for example 16 0 4 of total 2 mib was degraded by 20 0 mg l h2o2 within 8 h as shown in fig 3 c the algicidal activity of h2o2 when used in a reservoir lake is enhanced due to the presence of sunlight which includes uv wavelengths brookes et al 2004 hipsey et al 2004 h2o2 was used to control harmful cyanobacteria in a whole lake in the netherlands and the results showed that the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii which was the dominant species in this lake could be controlled effectively when 2 0 mg l h2o2 was added while there were no major impacts on eukaryotic phytoplankton zooplankton or macrofauna matthijs et al 2012 hence the use of h2o2 to control p galeata in a reservoir lake may also be possible in future although h2o2 may be considered as a potential chemical to control p galeata the ability to achieve reasonable contact time in a reservoir lake should be carefully assessed as shown in fig 4 a low dose of h2o2 i e 3 0 mg l was sufficient to control p galeata under natural sunlight nevertheless uv radiation is usually high only at the surface and attenuated with depth brookes et al 2004 light penetration would be very limited when there is a large cyanobacteria bloom furthermore matthijs et al 2012 reported that a concentration of h2o2 higher than 2 5 mg l would be harmful to the zooplankton kmno4 is better suited to pretreatment in drinking water processing plants kmno4 is the only chemical tested in this study that had minimal impact on membrane integrity of p galeata cells at lowest dose tested 3 0 mg l however the p galeata cells were damaged when the dosage of kmno4 was equal to and greater than 4 0 mg l resulting in the release of intracellular 2 mib overall it may be feasible to use kmno4 as a pretreatment at the lower doses which could not only enhance the removal of p galeata for the subsequent coagulation and flocculation process but also avoid the lysis of p galeata cells although cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 can damage and inhibit the growth of p galeata cells each of the algicides oxidants has drawbacks that limit their application in reservoirs or drinking water treatment plants the use of cuso4 could lead to the accumulation of heavy metal at the bottom of the reservoir which is toxic to the aquatic organisms santore et al 2001 h2o2 is a strong oxidant and difficult to handle in its pure form for kmno4 over dosing must be avoided because a residual kmno4 of 0 05 mg l or greater will result in a pink taint to the drinking water welch 1963 hence the application of each of these chemicals should be assessed against the desired outcomes and respective advantages disadvantages furthermore the application of cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 as algicides should always be applied at the early stages of a p galeata bloom when cell densities are low so as to minimize extracellular 2 mib 5 conclusions addition of each of the water treatment algicides cuso4 h2o2 and kmno4 could impair the cell viability and integrity of p galeata cells in this study compared with cuso4 and h2o2 it is apparent that kmno4 had a higher oxidation rate and could lead to lysis of most of the p galeata cells within 2 h 5 0 mg l kmno4 the release of intracellular 2 mib increased at higher dosages in longer treatment times for all three chemicals it is worth noting that h2o2 had the ability to degrade 2 mib with 10 0 mg l or higher dosage while the degradation ability of cuso4 and kmno4 for 2 mib was negligible when the dosages of cuso4 and kmno4 were lower than 1 5 and 5 0 mg l respectively moreover because of the presence of uv in sunlight the oxidation rate of h2o2 against p galeata cells was enhanced this study provides important information and guidance for reservoir and treatment plant operators assessing treatment options for blooms of cyanobacteria and more specifically those involving p galeata acknowledgements this work was supported by natural science foundation of china
