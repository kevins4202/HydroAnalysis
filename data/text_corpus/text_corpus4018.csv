describing key areas of inquiry such as watershed resilience variables and their interactions leveraging watershed natural properties processes and dynamics to facilitate and enable resilience analytical methods and tools including monitoring modeling metrics and scenario planning and their applications to watersheds at different spatial and temporal scales and infusing resilience concepts as core values in watershed adaptive management keywords watershed management persistence adaptation transformation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction management of watersheds to provide a wide variety of ecological and human services represents a critical global challenge anthropogenic activities have significantly altered rivers lakes wetlands and groundwater systems and the ability of these systems to provide vital watershed services 60 23 watersheds have some capacity to absorb and respond to disturbances while maintaining their essential structure and functions 11 15 however the capacity of watersheds to absorb and respond without disruption or modification is limited research and practice suggest that freshwater systems may evolve towards states with potentially novel structural and functional characteristics caused by endogenous and exogenous forcings acting at various temporal and spatial scales with implications for the watershed services they provide 36 75 31 managing for maintaining some current or ideal state or for restoration to a previous state which is a traditional approach to resilience may not always be possible prompting the need to consider if there are other modes of resilience in watersheds to consider if more than one mode of resilience exists how do we know when or if we should update management approaches to reflect or anticipate emerging conditions stakeholders across sectors and geographies are paying increasing attention to the resilience of their watersheds as they plan and manage the supply of services economic growth and needed investments for instance cities like cape town são paulo and mexico city have recently nearly run out of both surface and groundwater resources 16 revealing resilience challenges and prompting additional action to help secure their water supplies national agencies in argentina uruguay and china have invested significantly in policies initiatives and projects to increase resilience in watersheds and improve provision of watershed services 46 94 watershed resilience is gaining attention in water resources management practice decision making policy and scholarship 83 84 85 31 this paper i provides a review of research literature on approaches to define and apply resilience thinking to watersheds ii identifies knowledge gaps through an assessment of this literature and the collection of research questions through a series of stakeholder engagement activities and iii derives a proposed research agenda describing key areas of inquiry on this topic of global importance 2 review of approaches towards defining resilience in watersheds the concept of resilience has been around for centuries e g hooke s law for compression and deformation of springs and has been applied across many disciplines physics engineering health psychology sociology disaster studies and ecology among others 85 97 74 54 1 grove et al 32 define resilience as the capacity to deal with change and continue to develop the intergovernmental panel on climate change describes resilience as preserving function identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation learning and transformation 43 unlike a more commonplace definition of resilience as bouncing back to preexisting conditions following a disruption or disturbance the ipcc definition encompasses the potential reorganization of the system an insight that also emerges from paleoecology and paleoclimate research into so called no analogs 96 71 such work observes that quite distinct and stable ecological communities have existed in assemblages that have no analogs to existing communities further application of the concept in the life and environmental sciences garnered increased attention in characterizing the ability of an ecological system to self organize persist and absorb perturbations 68 67 37 38 53 30 7 there have been several efforts in the literature on resilience thinking focused specifically on watersheds 97 6 48 these are complemented with a variety of investigations in related areas such as water systems 85 7 aquatic ecosystems 74 54 water related disasters 45 72 among others most of these efforts tend to pursue the concept of resilience through ecological social or engineering approaches ecological resilience relates to the magnitude of disturbance s that an ecosystem in a relatively stable state can absorb before it shifts into a new presumably stable regime holling and gunderson 39 social resilience is the capacity of social systems such as communities to withstand and adapt to disturbances that result from social political or environmental changes 4 engineering approaches to resilience in watersheds focus on optimization and the use of infrastructure to manage watershed system changes e g expansion of supply disaster recovery ecosystem restoration 33 73 86 80 ecological resilience approaches have been employed in watershed conservation and management with a primary focus on understanding the biophysical processes and structures of terrestrial ecosystems and how those are impacted by natural disturbances and anthropogenic interventions these studies have employed both data analysis 22 98 99 36 and process based model simulations 20 42 52 mainstream freshwater conservation approaches are perhaps typical of ecological resilience methodologies in that they define a baseline or a preferred past stable state as a set of management targets as such ecosystem management in practice has come to imply persistence or managing to return to a stable form one which according to no analog research studies may be overly constrained in its definition e g 74 77 a number of researchers have critiqued these persistence approaches however by demonstrating the evolution of natural systems through a series of states hirota et al 36 recognized forest savanna and treeless states arrived at by transitions through tipping points in tropical watersheds and empirically reconstructed a time history of transition between states through analyzing the response of tree abundance to precipitation levine et al 52 predicted the stability and potential transitions of the amazon watershed to climate change with coupled hydrology vegetation climate models the management implications of these investigations emphasize the importance of the connection between biophysical changes in watershed systems and their ability to provide watershed services when watersheds transition between states these services were noted to change as well in reliability form and timing indeed these transitions appear to represent ecological reorganization processes according to no analog studies social resilience approaches have focused on community and institutional aspects and deriving best practices to build resilience in watersheds 48 5 59 89 there are several implications for watershed management that emerge from these studies resilience building requires collaboration across levels of government jurisdictional boundaries and functional sectors e g water supply energy food governance and regulatory systems can hold implicit resilience definitions such as mandating specific eco hydrological conditions as stable as is common with us environmental protection agency regulations or the us endangered species act or evolving such as the european water framework directive which periodically renormalizes watershed conditions based on recent trends resilience building efforts in watersheds must also engage a diversity of nongovernmental actors particularly those that live and work within the watershed thus building strong networks and enhancing social capital among these actors can strengthen resilience in watersheds particularly when supported by flexible governance structures that can adapt quickly under strain for instance the colorado river has important water transfers such as the central arizona project to regions outside the watershed suggesting that actions to increase or define watershed resilience may require interventions within the management rather than hydrological watershed 48 this demonstrates the fundamental requirement of taking a systems approach in building resilience in watersheds as drivers may emerge across different spatial temporal and sectoral scales in engineering based approaches watershed resilience has focused on defining and measuring specific metrics of hydrological and biophysical performance often facilitated by hydraulic infrastructure watershed resilience is evaluated through monitoring and modeling coupled with the definition of multiple objective functions and optimization analyses for management and decision making the selection of objective functions and resilience metrics is dependent on the specific management context and on decision maker preferences 15 87 in contrast socio ecological resilience approaches have made less emphasis on design and measurement and instead assumed that one system can exist in several alternative stable states rather than a single optimized zone 62 27 thus a strongly engineered watershed may be very resilient from a human services perspective but not from an ecological perspective while managing a watershed for ecological objectives may have to make compromises on some human services such as flood risk but provide larger ecological resilience the potential tradeoffs between engineering and socio ecological approaches to resilience remains widespread and largely unresolved in practice and can lead to quite different approaches to watershed resilience i e pursuing infrastructure vs social participatory solutions 44 9 92 several recent studies have attempted to integrate across approaches in order to bring a broader perspective into managing watersheds nemec et al 64 analyzed data on ecological and social resilience using nine watershed properties ecological variability diversity modularity acknowledgement of slow variables tight feedbacks social capital innovation overlap in governance and ecosystem services the approach used in their analysis is static using data to create a snapshot of resilience rather than a non stationary approach koebele et al 48 present a disaster recovery focused program that promotes resilience building activities in disaster affected communities through infrastructure planning and replacement efforts carried out by place based watershed social coalitions cosens and williams 21 analyzed hydropower infrastructure planning ecosystem health and social institutional governance mechanisms to improve resilience in the transboundary columbia river basin identifying alternative stable resilience states and the need for transitions in management strategies over time other efforts to integrate and reconcile these different and complementary approaches to resilience in watersheds have been pursued through applying principles of resilience thinking in hydrology and ecohydrology 28 93 29 and more broadly to water systems 85 7 these efforts integrate the ecological social and engineering perspectives discussed above and broaden the scope of resilience to encompass different possible watershed trajectories of change this literature incorporates three key and complementary concepts persistence the ability of a watershed to change by absorbing disturbances and reorganize while undergoing changes to retain the same identity and function adaptation or adaptability the ability of a watershed to adjust its responses to more gradual incremental and or predictable external drivers and internal change and transformation or transformability the ability to reorganize as a different kind of watershed when structures e g ecological economic social make the present one untenable a conceptual depiction of this framework that integrates approaches to resilience in watersheds is shown on fig 1 persistence adaptation and transformation can be thought of as resilience modes that apply to the various variables in a watershed system e g hydrological ecological social institutional governance cultural engineering infrastructure among others in this framework resilience can be thought of as a vector where each component of the vector is a watershed system variable each at its own position in the cycle durations over time of each resilience mode for a given watershed variable will vary of course depending on the specifics of the watershed and the variable further one can think of a watershed transitioning between more than one of each resilience mode i e more than one range of the watershed variable for persistence adaptation or transformation if for instance the variable depicted is the persistent flow regime of a natural stream the first adaptation period could correspond to progressive increases in stormflow runoff due to urbanization within the stream s watershed this continues until the stream is transformed into an urban drainage flowway in a possible additional transition the river could adapt to increases in discharge due to additional runoff generated by land use change in upstream watersheds and may transform into a major river or an increasingly inundated floodplain a similar rationale could apply if the watershed variable is evapotranspiration fluxes which could increase due to forcings such as agricultural expansion and climate change generating one or more cycles of persistence adaptation and transformation in the watershed other examples of watershed trajectories through resilience modes can be driven by extreme events e g hurricanes policy e g water management or infrastructure e g reservoirs interventions for water supply flood protection drought mitigation and other transitions each of these resulting in the variation over time of a given watershed system variable an illustrative example of a watershed system transitioning through these resilience modes is the everglades wetlands over time the discharge flow rate of these wetlands to florida bay and the salinity of the water in the wetlands have changed significantly during the second half of the 20th century large scale efforts to drain these wetlands to make land available for agriculture and urban development and protect from flooding led to alteration of flow rates and salinity throughout the watersheds in this ecosystem prior to this period at least throughout the 19th century the everglades persisted in a state significantly wetter with freshwater discharge rates of 2 3 times those post drainage and salinity levels about 20 times lower 63 57 than present values the anthropogenic interventions consisting of building hydraulic infrastructure canals levees pumps to modify the physical configuration of everglades watersheds and their drainage connectivity pattern forced the system over decades to adapt to the new hydraulics and water quality and transform to its current version it is worth noting that a valid question would be whether the everglades are still adapting or have completely transformed and may now be persisting again in their current state another question would be whether these transitions have made the everglades inherently less or more resilient and another question is whether the everglades have undergone more cycles through resilience modes through their history e g sea level rise during the last deglaciation answering these questions would merit further analysis of this watershed system under this resilience framework 3 knowledge gaps and a potential research agenda in watershed resilience the study of resilience in watersheds presents an important opportunity for the convergence of research in related areas such as social ecological hydrological systems water resources engineering and management resilience thinking applied to water systems nature based solutions and water security among others knowledge gaps derived through our review of the literature on resilience thinking approaches to watersheds were complemented and reconciled with a set of research questions collected through a series of stakeholder engagement activities see section 4 we mapped the results of this analysis into the following proposed areas of research need i defining and characterizing resilience for a given watershed i e resilience modes and transition durations resilience variables their interactions and thresholds ii leveraging watershed natural properties processes and dynamics to facilitate and enable resilience iii analytical methods and tools including monitoring modeling metrics and scenario planning and their applications to watersheds at different spatial and temporal scales and iv infusing resilience concepts in watershed adaptive management particularly focusing on understanding different trajectories of change in a watershed and avoiding undesired outcomes a potential agenda covering these areas of research and describing key topics of inquiry in these areas is presented in the discussion that follows while emphasizing that these areas are not mutually exclusive nor disconnected silos of knowledge but rather intersecting and interdisciplinary areas of investigation illustrating examples of cross cutting topics that should be advanced 3 1 characterization of watershed resilience variables and their interactions the water cycle globally and for any given watershed is not stationary and increasingly influenced by climate change and other stressors such as urban growth land use and socioeconomic changes this poses the challenge of identifying both quantitatively and qualitatively variables modes and transitions and characterizing conditions that can enable resilience in a given watershed 47 2 90 research in this area can focus on consolidating and analyzing historical data as well as developing new data sources and analytical approaches to define the persistence adaptation and transformation modes their range of values for the numerous resilience variables and conditions that may lead to transitions between modes a salient example of a watershed variable that continues to be the focus of attention in characterizing resilience is the flow regime 75 79 51 78 seasonal cues in the flow regime have been linked to specific ecological or livelihood outcomes such as the initiation of fish spawning with late spring flows however the flow regime is also climate sensitive and limited guidance has been developed to suggest how the range of choices presented by a shifting climate might guide management of flows in a watershed this is inherently interdisciplinary work for instance technological innovation has been a key driver of human development and adaptation to social and environmental challenges and will continue to be fundamental to watershed resilience engineering solutions such as dams reservoirs canals and water transfers have dramatically altered the water cycle and transformed watersheds for human use social feedback mechanisms can mediate transitions and build resilience i e social norms cultural values institutions markets technology knowledge and learning all serve to inform our approach to managing natural and human systems such as watersheds in general terms 26 83 84 institutional structures and arrangements are needed to consolidate this in a persistence mode approaches towards conservation of the biophysical attributes and functions of watersheds can help preserve their productive capacities and resilience but these same approaches may not be successful in conditions approaching an adaptation and transformation mode indeed as suggested above restoration centric efforts may hinder the system reorganization and cause unintended side effects without actually slowing or reducing the impacts of drivers such as climate change efforts at watershed restoration may be thus reframed in a persistence mode restoration of ecological communities to some baseline may be useful and important as should be restoration of ecological function for adaptation and transformation mode conditions however restoration of ecological communities may have limited and even adverse impacts as the eco hydrological system reorganizes under a new emerging set of physical and biotic conditions restoration of hydrological functions however would likely remain relevant and useful whether best efforts should be made to restore watersheds noting that a full community or hydrological restoration is rarely possible allow them to adapt to changing conditions or transform to a new flow regime is a question of practical importance affecting long term planning and management a noteworthy example of this is the yongding river basin in china commonly referred to as the mother river of beijing this river was a threat to the old city of beijing due to frequent floods however increasing water use largely because of population and economic growth has led to the river running dry certainly it is not an aim to restore the river ecosystem towards a flooding status stepwise ecological restoration was proposed to drive towards an alternative resilience mode rather than attempt to return to flow conditions similar to the past 55 similar approaches can be implemented to deal with watershed changes due to climate change or relatively irreversible human activity impacts 3 2 leveraging watershed natural properties and processes towards resilience while most of the world s watersheds are dominated by traditional engineering grey infrastructure there is a growing body of literature that has documented the feasibility of implementing approaches to manage water through leveraging the watershed s natural infrastructure in this literature terms such as green infrastructure green solutions and nature based solutions nbs are used somewhat interchangeably 17 in this review we use nbs as a representative way to capture the utilization of natural infrastructure to complement grey infrastructure in addressing water challenges such as water security biodiversity conservation and helping communities mitigate and adapt to climate change in theory nbs or hybrid grey nbs approaches can address multiple modes of watershed resilience while providing co benefits to communities and nature although the general biogeophysical mechanisms by which nbs impact key variables such as water quantity and quality are well understood the empirical experience of implementing nbs towards watershed resilience at the times places and scales of interest require further investigation for example nbs interventions are usually localized and it is unclear how local impacts might propagate and route downstream along the watershed resulting benefits from nbs may shift from one set of beneficiaries to another set perhaps keeping the overall resilience at a similar level but making a difference to internal distribution and equity similarly it is unclear when the watershed impacts of nbs will become detectable or will surpass a certain threshold and for how long these impacts will be sustained some literature reports how nbs can become an important tool to mitigate water security pressures 65 69 1 for instance restoration of native vegetation changing to sustainable and extensive land use wetland creation re meandering and floodplain reconnection have a buffering effect on river flow and sediment control and enhance groundwater storage as such they may be able to moderate the impact of increasingly variable rainfall patterns nbs may also be instrumental in maintaining ecosystem integrity e g through watershed restoration and conservation which can increase the ecosystem s resilience to climate change nbs that protect natural vegetation from future conversion are maintaining hydrologic functions that might otherwise be lost further some interventions classed as nbs reduce the exposure of people to water related risks for example by zoning to restrict development and maintain vegetation in floodplains the effectiveness of these types of nbs are driven as much by reducing exposure to flood risk as by avoiding changes in vegetation and ecosystem presence that could alter hydrologic flows there is also an opportunity to investigate approaches to move towards a more widespread use of hybrid solutions that integrate nbs with traditional engineering solutions for current and future watershed resilience 70 although some functions of nbs can be fulfilled by built infrastructure the high flexibility and adaptive capacity of nbs are specific advantages for resilience 58 uncertainties created by climate change and an unpredictable future render static solutions with high sunk costs and low adaptive capacity such as large reservoirs and similar gray infrastructure increasingly risky investments nbs are often smaller more affordable more flexible and more multipurpose than conventional interventions 66 as such nbs are compatible with the type of adaptive solutions and no regret strategies that are advocated in the context of uncertain future change despite their potential rigorous studies of the effectiveness of nbs with a focus on specific aspects of watershed resilience are scarce in the literature this is driven in part because those impacts take time to manifest and most projects are young in other cases projects are not yet implemented at the scale needed to see watershed scale impacts much of our current understanding about the impact of nbs comes from comparing healthy and degraded watersheds often with a focus on forests e g the hubbard brook ecosystem study 40 from evaluations of agricultural best management practices and from limited studies of ecological restoration projects e g wetland restoration 3 there is also a need to better understand the costs and uncertainty in investments associated with the operation and maintenance of these projects compared to engineering infrastructure a body of evidence derived directly from nbs applications should allow for improved understanding of their effectiveness in delivering targeted resilience outcomes other gaps in the evidence of nbs applicability to watershed resilience relate to drylands and floodplains which feature prominently in the climate adaptation literature 24 41 88 because of their potential to attenuate the impacts of drought and reduce risk to extreme events for instance persistent droughts land degradation and desertification in drylands are often slow onset processes that over time may well lead to disaster more attention should also be given to evidence based studies of nbs in promoting resilience in these cases particularly in rapidly growing urban coastal areas around the world where large populations depend on ecosystem services for protection and livelihoods 3 3 integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis the study of watershed resilience offers opportunities for development and application of integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis approaches that contribute to advance our understanding of the topics such as coupling and feedbacks between resilience variables e g physical biological engineering social thresholds and rates of transitions between resilience modes and overall dynamics of the watershed resilience problem integrative modeling approaches are intended to address the nexus of human and natural systems e g water supply and demand energy agriculture and land use climate socioeconomics by achieving this integration such models can focus on the feedbacks between these systems along with the evolution of the systems themselves and the interactions between these systems and other key forcers such as climate change socioeconomic and technological change and policy interventions they can be used to explore large ranges of key parameter spaces which is ideal for interactions with decision makers and stakeholders 46 94 as recognition of the importance of complexity of human natural systems such as watersheds has grown the focus of integrative models has shifted from studying the interactions of a limited number of systems energy economy climate at the global level to consideration of multiple interactions energy water land economy climate and at greater temporal spatial and process resolution scales recent research has explored the effects of climate on watersheds and their connections to energy agriculture and climate 10 34 35 and bioenergy and agricultural watershed systems 91 49 in this increasingly system complexity context the design of resilience strategies in watersheds can be approached through combined modeling scenarios and data analytics this combination can be approached through the interaction between ensembles of data and models with varied parameters stakeholder input is important so that scenarios can approximately describe interactions between natural and human systems given limited observations imperfect assumptions and finite model choices for instance approaches such as digital twinning allow simulation of multiple scenarios and possible interventions in a digital environment and is a promising route for watershed resilience 8 81 stakeholder input is also important so that decision makers understand and have confidence in the model outputs and are willing to use them in their decision making 14 13 an existing challenge in modeling and data approaches is to provide results at appropriate spatial and temporal scales that allow assessment of the effectiveness of interventions towards watershed resilience for example a recent study shows that many models can simulate the hydrological processes of sponge city practices however the use of these modeling results in decision support tools is relatively poor and ineffective due to lack of stakeholder involvement 56 in such contexts decision support tools and systems need to be tailored to meet diverse user requirements to ensure that it provides useful usable and used information for decision support for a diverse audience 100 an increasingly important research topic in human natural modeling towards watershed resilience is to develop visual analytics methods for cross scale comparison of outputs from integrative models with a focus on the impact of spatial and temporal scales and variations on scenarios and maximizing knowledge transfer that underpins evidence based decision making this is critical for assessing interactions feedbacks between watershed system variables as well as the dynamics of resilience modes e g rates of change reversibility and hysteresis 50 95 inter comparison of model simulations is helpful to provide insight into uncertainty of an ensemble analysis and the impact of model structure on outputs 3 4 developing a resilience focus in adaptive watershed management management of a watershed aligned with resilience principles such as those discussed in this paper represents an evolution from traditional approaches used in water resources engineering and ecosystem based management ongoing climate impacts coupled with other forms of global change may render historical management targets constrictive irrelevant or even damaging managing watersheds under a resilience paradigm suggests a more dynamic interactive form of engagement whereby watersheds may be managed for desired conditions and services either persistence or adaptation but potentially with physical and biological characteristics that exhibit limited resemblance to their recent historical state transformation the development of holistic management strategies from headwaters to floodplain to groundwater may be necessary as single system approaches are not sufficient 77 18 this represents a new frontier for hydrologists ecologists and social scientists and will inevitably require novel and more intensive forms of stakeholder engagement community based collaborative decision making to define watershed objectives and management actions the science of watershed resilience will need to combine insights from these disciplines into a new forward looking framework that is only beginning to emerge operationally 19 despite these challenges there are immediate opportunities for advancing resilience oriented strategies in watershed management for example approaches for addressing flood hazards are moving away from large structural control measures to nbs or hybrid designs that expand the flood inundation capacity of the landscape lowering the velocity and water level of flood flows and thereby reducing risk to property and life 69 66 by restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity with the landscape and accommodating ecologically beneficial high flows this approach has the potential to recover lost watershed floodplain functions and is compatible with the resilience principles described here the multitude of water infrastructure projects e g dams levees and canals at the end of their functional lifespan or requiring relicensing represents another opportunity to infuse resilience principles in watershed management 25 65 evaluating the potential watershed resilience benefits of removing water infrastructure against potential costs and risks would be a valuable exercise for prioritizing projects for strategic removal in the future as well as identifying new projects that are more flexible and effective additional work is needed to define both general and specific indicators of resilience 64 12 and to demonstrate how they can be incorporated in watershed management approaches recently poff et al 76 explored a quantitative approach to evaluate trade offs between ecological and engineering objectives in an integrated vulnerability assessment method this approach has been applied to a wide range of cases across economic development contexts it has already been integrated within new approaches to non stationary watershed planning and design methodologies 61 while also serving as a complement to established approaches to assessing climate risk in watershed decision making 82 these and other climate informed risk assessment approaches hold promise for identifying novel solutions for building resilience in managed watersheds and communicating options and building stakeholder consensus through environmental governance mechanisms 4 watershed resilience an initial set of research questions as part of this review we conducted several workshops surveys and consultations with various stakeholder groups watershed and conservation managers scientists practitioners and decision makers to elicit input on knowledge gaps that could be assembled into an initial list of research questions around watershed resilience these questions also informed the proposed areas of research described in section 3 we have paired this list of questions with the proposed research areas with the understanding that a given question may cut across more than one area of inquiry the table below summarizes this initial set of research questions further tuned by the identification of knowledge gaps in the reviewed literature and additional discussions while preparing this paper these questions can be thought of as future lines of investigation on watershed resilience research area research questions characterization of watershed resilience variables and their interactions how can watershed resilience modes be effectively identified and measured using comparable and transferable metrics to what degree can resilience be managed as past conditions tracking change through time or for potential future states how can we react to climate and impacts of other stressors and shocks or can we redefine growth and prosperity for times of ongoing change should we maintain existing flows despite climate change revert to past flows anticipate or track emerging trends what are the trigger points and the associated risk of actions or inaction on the resilience of a watershed leveraging watershed natural properties and processes towards resilience how do we deliver on outcomes for watershed resilience both from biodiversity ecosystems and human wellbeing standpoints measured by delivery of services to people what are the characteristics of watershed resilience that can be strengthened through nbs what is the effectiveness of nbs in watersheds on multiple scales in time and space what do we know about trade offs externalities uncertainties and potential negative impacts of nbs on other ecosystem services and specific communities how do we quantitatively assess co benefits and enhancements on ecosystem services and community social outcomes influenced by nbs integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis what are new methods in data driven and physically based modeling that are needed to delineate resilience modes in a watershed and quantify outcomes across the wide variety of resilience variables how can watershed modelling help quantify changes in watershed variables in space and time and linkages to persistence adaptation and transformation modes of resilience how can we advance modeling methods to better integrate biophysical and socioeconomic systems in assessing watershed interventions and their impacts on resilience how can future scenarios e g climate socioeconomic land use be effectively integrated into watershed resilience assessments and to what extent might they result in better long term outcomes how can data and scenarios best inform decision making in watersheds where decision making authority is fragmented among several institutions and regulations developing a resilience focus in adaptive watershed management how can watershed services for nature and people be improved through resilience thinking compared to planning conducted with traditional engineering or ecological management approaches what are the underlying social processes or driving forces such as attitudes behavior and standard institutional processes that create barriers to resilience planning in watersheds how do they function to prevent such planning what are the linkages between the levels of alteration to watershed processes in space and time that are commonly used to assess watershed resilience and the ability of watersheds to sustain nature and provide services to people how can monitoring evaluation and learning be conducted to demonstrate that resilience planning is progressing towards improved provision of watershed services benefits to people and nature what can be learned scaled and transferred between watersheds towards more established and sustainable pathways to resilience 5 concluding remarks resilience has emerged as a standard for evaluating the sustainability of watershed management much in the same way that cost benefits and ecological flow maintenance have served as standards in the past progress towards increased resilience in watersheds is hindered by conflicting management objectives interests existing policies inflexible infrastructure design and a lack of quantitative tools and data to facilitate critical decision making resilience modes are heuristic for decision makers such as resource managers infrastructure operators and watershed planners because matching resilience actions to the correct trajectory of change can determine the success and failure of projects and policies aligning decisions to the appropriate trajectory of change can define the options for successful and context sensitive interventions what we monitor for progress against targets and how we evaluate success indeed actions that are not aligned with the appropriate trajectory of change may even be counterproductive ideally monitoring systems should aim to detect potential shifts in trajectory such as transitions from persistence to adaptation to transformation actions that are intended to support a persistence mode may be inappropriate or even counterproductive for a context where adaptation or transformation are in play resilience mode mismatches may have important ramifications inducing fragility rather than building resilience efforts to keep a watershed in a persistence mode when external drivers are forcing adaptation or transformation may have quite perverse consequences as ecological communities and populations try to adjust behaviors range and phenologies in spite of resource management planning as society looks forward to a future with changing physical and socioeconomic drivers resilience in watersheds needs to be better understood as a set of informed choices that can be shaped towards implementation the research agenda summarized in this paper consisting of proposed areas of inquiry and research questions can be useful for generating discussion and guiding future research in characterizing resilience in a watershed how nature can play a role in its successful operationalization the integrative monitoring modeling tools and data that are required to understand conceptualize design and implement effective resilience solutions in watersheds and the infusion of resilience thinking in watershed adaptive management approaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

ecosystems 74 54 water related disasters 45 72 among others most of these efforts tend to pursue the concept of resilience through ecological social or engineering approaches ecological resilience relates to the magnitude of disturbance s that an ecosystem in a relatively stable state can absorb before it shifts into a new presumably stable regime holling and gunderson 39 social resilience is

approaches have been employed in watershed conservation and management with a primary focus on understanding the biophysical processes and structures of terrestrial ecosystems and how those are impacted by natural disturbances and anthropogenic interventions these studies have employed both data analysis 22 98 99 36 and process based model simulations 20 42 52 mainstream freshwater conservation approaches are perhaps typical of ecological resilience methodologies in that they define a baseline or a preferred past stable state as a set of management targets as such ecosystem management in practice has come to imply persistence or managing to return to a stable form one which according to no analog research studies may be overly constrained in its definition e g 74 77 a

treeless states arrived at by transitions through tipping points in tropical watersheds and empirically reconstructed a time history of transition between states through analyzing the response of tree abundance to precipitation levine et al 52 predicted the stability and potential transitions of the amazon watershed to climate change with coupled hydrology vegetation climate models the management implications of these investigations emphasize the importance of the connection between biophysical changes in watershed systems and their ability to provide watershed services when watersheds transition between states these services were noted to change as well in reliability form and timing indeed these transitions appear to represent ecological reorganization processes according to no analog studies social resilience approaches have focused on community and institutional aspects and deriving best practices to build resilience in watersheds 48 5 59 89 there are several implications for watershed management that emerge from these studies resilience building requires collaboration across levels of government jurisdictional boundaries and functional sectors e g water supply energy food governance and regulatory systems can hold implicit resilience definitions such as mandating specific eco hydrological conditions as stable as is common with us environmental protection agency regulations or the us endangered species act or evolving such as the european water framework directive which periodically renormalizes watershed conditions based on recent trends resilience building efforts in watersheds must also engage a diversity of nongovernmental actors particularly those that live and work within the watershed thus building strong networks and enhancing social capital among these actors can strengthen resilience in watersheds particularly when supported by flexible governance structures that can adapt quickly under strain for instance the colorado river has important water transfers such as the central arizona project to regions outside the watershed suggesting that actions to increase or define watershed resilience may require interventions within the management rather than hydrological watershed 48 this demonstrates the fundamental requirement of taking a systems approach in building resilience in watersheds as drivers may emerge across different spatial temporal and sectoral scales in engineering based approaches watershed resilience has focused on defining and measuring specific metrics of hydrological and biophysical performance often facilitated by hydraulic infrastructure watershed resilience is evaluated through monitoring and modeling coupled with the definition of multiple objective functions and optimization analyses for management and decision making the selection of objective functions and resilience metrics is dependent on the specific management context and on decision maker preferences 15 87 in contrast socio ecological resilience approaches have made less emphasis on design and measurement and instead assumed that one system can exist in several alternative stable states rather than a single optimized zone 62 27 thus a strongly engineered watershed may be very resilient from a human services perspective but not from an ecological perspective while managing a watershed for ecological objectives may have to make compromises on some human services such as flood risk but provide larger ecological resilience the potential tradeoffs between engineering and socio ecological approaches to resilience remains widespread and largely unresolved in practice and can lead to quite different approaches to watershed resilience i e pursuing infrastructure vs social participatory solutions 44 9 92 several recent studies have attempted to integrate across approaches in order to bring a broader perspective into managing watersheds nemec et al 64 analyzed data on ecological and social resilience using nine watershed properties ecological variability diversity modularity acknowledgement of slow variables tight feedbacks social capital innovation overlap in governance and ecosystem services the approach used in their analysis is static using data to create a snapshot of resilience rather than a non stationary approach koebele et al 48 present a disaster recovery focused program that promotes resilience building activities in disaster affected communities through infrastructure planning and replacement efforts carried out by place based watershed social coalitions cosens and williams 21 analyzed hydropower infrastructure planning ecosystem health and social institutional governance mechanisms to improve resilience in the transboundary columbia river basin identifying alternative stable resilience states and the need for transitions in management strategies over time other efforts to integrate and reconcile these different and complementary approaches to resilience in watersheds have been pursued through applying principles of resilience thinking in hydrology and ecohydrology 28 93 29 and more broadly to water systems 85 7 these efforts integrate the ecological social and engineering perspectives discussed above and broaden the scope of resilience to encompass different possible watershed trajectories of change this literature incorporates three key and complementary concepts persistence the ability of a watershed to change by absorbing disturbances and reorganize while undergoing changes to retain the same identity and function adaptation or adaptability the ability of a watershed to adjust its responses to more gradual incremental and or predictable external drivers and internal change and transformation or transformability the ability to reorganize as a different kind of watershed when structures e g ecological economic social make the present one untenable a conceptual depiction of this framework that integrates approaches to resilience in watersheds is shown on fig 1 persistence adaptation and transformation can be thought of as resilience modes that apply to the various variables in a watershed system e g hydrological ecological social institutional governance cultural engineering infrastructure among others in this framework resilience can be thought of as a vector where each component of the vector is a watershed system variable each at its own position in the cycle durations over time of each resilience mode for a given watershed variable will vary of course depending on the specifics of the watershed and the variable further one can think of a watershed transitioning between more than one of each resilience mode i e more than one range of the watershed variable for persistence adaptation or transformation if for instance the variable depicted is the persistent flow regime of a natural stream the first adaptation period could correspond to progressive increases in stormflow runoff due to urbanization within the stream s watershed this continues until the stream is transformed into an urban drainage flowway in a possible additional transition the river could adapt to increases in discharge due to additional runoff generated by land use change in upstream watersheds and may transform into a major river or an increasingly inundated floodplain a similar rationale could apply if the watershed variable is evapotranspiration fluxes which could increase due to forcings such as agricultural expansion and climate change generating one or more cycles of persistence adaptation and transformation in the watershed other examples of watershed trajectories through resilience modes can be driven by extreme events e g hurricanes policy e g water management or infrastructure e g reservoirs interventions for water supply flood protection drought mitigation and other transitions each of these resulting in the variation over time of a given watershed system variable an illustrative example of a watershed system transitioning through these resilience modes is the everglades wetlands over time the discharge flow rate of these wetlands to florida bay and the salinity of the water in the wetlands have changed significantly during the second half of the 20th century large scale efforts to drain these wetlands to make land available for agriculture and urban development and protect from flooding led to alteration of flow rates and salinity throughout the watersheds in this ecosystem prior to this period at least throughout the 19th century the everglades persisted in a state significantly wetter with freshwater discharge rates of 2 3 times those post drainage and salinity levels about 20 times lower 63 57 than present values the anthropogenic interventions consisting of building hydraulic infrastructure canals levees pumps to modify the physical configuration of everglades watersheds and their drainage connectivity pattern forced the system over decades to adapt to the new hydraulics and water quality and transform to its current version it is worth noting that a valid question would be whether the everglades are still adapting or have completely transformed and may now be persisting again in their current state another question would be whether these transitions have made the everglades inherently less or more resilient and another question is whether the everglades have undergone more cycles through resilience modes through their history e g sea level rise during the last deglaciation answering these questions would merit further analysis of this watershed system under this resilience framework 3 knowledge gaps and a potential research agenda in watershed resilience the study of resilience in watersheds presents an important opportunity for the convergence of research in related areas such as social ecological hydrological systems water resources engineering and management resilience thinking applied to water systems nature based solutions and water security among others knowledge gaps derived through our review of the literature on resilience thinking approaches to watersheds were complemented and reconciled with a set of research questions collected through a series of stakeholder engagement activities see section 4 we mapped the results of this analysis into the following proposed areas of research need i defining and characterizing resilience for a given watershed i e resilience modes and transition durations resilience variables their interactions and thresholds ii leveraging watershed natural properties processes and dynamics to facilitate and enable resilience iii analytical methods and tools including monitoring modeling metrics and scenario planning and their applications to watersheds at different spatial and temporal scales and iv infusing resilience concepts in watershed adaptive management particularly focusing on understanding different trajectories of change in a watershed and avoiding undesired outcomes a potential agenda covering these areas of research and describing key topics of inquiry in these areas is presented in the discussion that follows while emphasizing that these areas are not mutually exclusive nor disconnected silos of knowledge but rather intersecting and interdisciplinary areas of investigation illustrating examples of cross cutting topics that should be advanced 3 1 characterization of watershed resilience variables and their interactions the water cycle globally and for any given watershed is not stationary and increasingly influenced by climate change and other stressors such as urban growth land use and socioeconomic changes this poses the challenge of identifying both quantitatively and qualitatively variables modes and transitions and characterizing conditions that can enable resilience in a given watershed 47 2 90 research in this area can focus on consolidating and analyzing historical data as well as developing new data sources and analytical approaches to define the persistence adaptation and transformation modes their range of values for the numerous resilience variables and conditions that may lead to transitions between modes a salient example of a watershed variable that continues to be the focus of attention in characterizing resilience is the flow regime 75 79 51 78 seasonal cues in the flow regime have been linked to specific ecological or livelihood outcomes such as the initiation of fish spawning with late spring flows however the flow regime is also climate sensitive and limited guidance has been developed to suggest how the range of choices presented by a shifting climate might guide management of flows in a watershed this is inherently interdisciplinary work for instance technological innovation has been a key driver of human development and adaptation to social and environmental challenges and will continue to be fundamental to watershed resilience engineering solutions such as dams reservoirs canals and water transfers have dramatically altered the water cycle and transformed watersheds for human use social feedback mechanisms can mediate transitions and build resilience i e social norms cultural values institutions markets technology knowledge and learning all serve to inform our approach to managing natural and human systems such as watersheds in general terms 26 83 84 institutional structures and arrangements are needed to consolidate this in a persistence mode approaches towards conservation of the biophysical attributes and functions of watersheds can help preserve their productive capacities and resilience but these same approaches may not be successful in conditions approaching an adaptation and transformation mode indeed as suggested above restoration centric efforts may hinder the system reorganization and cause unintended side effects without actually slowing or reducing the impacts of drivers such as climate change efforts at watershed restoration may be thus reframed in a persistence mode restoration of ecological communities to some baseline may be useful and important as should be restoration of ecological function for adaptation and transformation mode conditions however restoration of ecological communities may have limited and even adverse impacts as the eco hydrological system reorganizes under a new emerging set of physical and biotic conditions restoration of hydrological functions however would likely remain relevant and useful whether best efforts should be made to restore watersheds noting that a full community or hydrological restoration is rarely possible allow them to adapt to changing conditions or transform to a new flow regime is a question of practical importance affecting long term planning and management a noteworthy example of this is the yongding river basin in china commonly referred to as the mother river of beijing this river was a threat to the old city of beijing due to frequent floods however increasing water use largely because of population and economic growth has led to the river running dry certainly it is not an aim to restore the river ecosystem towards a flooding status stepwise ecological restoration was proposed to drive towards an alternative resilience mode rather than attempt to return to flow conditions similar to the past 55 similar approaches can be implemented to deal with watershed changes due to climate change or relatively irreversible human activity impacts 3 2 leveraging watershed natural properties and processes towards resilience while most of the world s watersheds are dominated by traditional engineering grey infrastructure there is a growing body of literature that has documented the feasibility of implementing approaches to manage water through leveraging the watershed s natural infrastructure in this literature terms such as green infrastructure green solutions and nature based solutions nbs are used somewhat interchangeably 17 in this review we use nbs as a representative way to capture the utilization of natural infrastructure to complement grey infrastructure in addressing water challenges such as water security biodiversity conservation and helping communities mitigate and adapt to climate change in theory nbs or hybrid grey nbs approaches can address multiple modes of watershed resilience while providing co benefits to communities and nature although the general biogeophysical mechanisms by which nbs impact key variables such as water quantity and quality are well understood the empirical experience of implementing nbs towards watershed resilience at the times places and scales of interest require further investigation for example nbs interventions are usually localized and it is unclear how local impacts might propagate and route downstream along the watershed resulting benefits from nbs may shift from one set of beneficiaries to another set perhaps keeping the overall resilience at a similar level but making a difference to internal distribution and equity similarly it is unclear when the watershed impacts of nbs will become detectable or will surpass a certain threshold and for how long these impacts will be sustained some literature reports how nbs can become an important tool to mitigate water security pressures 65 69 1 for instance restoration of native vegetation changing to sustainable and extensive land use wetland creation re meandering and floodplain reconnection have a buffering effect on river flow and sediment control and enhance groundwater storage as such they may be able to moderate the impact of increasingly variable rainfall patterns nbs may also be instrumental in maintaining ecosystem integrity e g through watershed restoration and conservation which can increase the ecosystem s resilience to climate change nbs that protect natural vegetation from future conversion are maintaining hydrologic functions that might otherwise be lost further some interventions classed as nbs reduce the exposure of people to water related risks for example by zoning to restrict development and maintain vegetation in floodplains the effectiveness of these types of nbs are driven as much by reducing exposure to flood risk as by avoiding changes in vegetation and ecosystem presence that could alter hydrologic flows there is also an opportunity to investigate approaches to move towards a more widespread use of hybrid solutions that integrate nbs with traditional engineering solutions for current and future watershed resilience 70 although some functions of nbs can be fulfilled by built infrastructure the high flexibility and adaptive capacity of nbs are specific advantages for resilience 58 uncertainties created by climate change and an unpredictable future render static solutions with high sunk costs and low adaptive capacity such as large reservoirs and similar gray infrastructure increasingly risky investments nbs are often smaller more affordable more flexible and more multipurpose than conventional interventions 66 as such nbs are compatible with the type of adaptive solutions and no regret strategies that are advocated in the context of uncertain future change despite their potential rigorous studies of the effectiveness of nbs with a focus on specific aspects of watershed resilience are scarce in the literature this is driven in part because those impacts take time to manifest and most projects are young in other cases projects are not yet implemented at the scale needed to see watershed scale impacts much of our current understanding about the impact of nbs comes from comparing healthy and degraded watersheds often with a focus on forests e g the hubbard brook ecosystem study 40 from evaluations of agricultural best management practices and from limited studies of ecological restoration projects e g wetland restoration 3 there is also a need to better understand the costs and uncertainty in investments associated with the operation and maintenance of these projects compared to engineering infrastructure a body of evidence derived directly from nbs applications should allow for improved understanding of their effectiveness in delivering targeted resilience outcomes other gaps in the evidence of nbs applicability to watershed resilience relate to drylands and floodplains which feature prominently in the climate adaptation literature 24 41 88 because of their potential to attenuate the impacts of drought and reduce risk to extreme events for instance persistent droughts land degradation and desertification in drylands are often slow onset processes that over time may well lead to disaster more attention should also be given to evidence based studies of nbs in promoting resilience in these cases particularly in rapidly growing urban coastal areas around the world where large populations depend on ecosystem services for protection and livelihoods 3 3 integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis the study of watershed resilience offers opportunities for development and application of integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis approaches that contribute to advance our understanding of the topics such as coupling and feedbacks between resilience variables e g physical biological engineering social thresholds and rates of transitions between resilience modes and overall dynamics of the watershed resilience problem integrative modeling approaches are intended to address the nexus of human and natural systems e g water supply and demand energy agriculture and land use climate socioeconomics by achieving this integration such models can focus on the feedbacks between these systems along with the evolution of the systems themselves and the interactions between these systems and other key forcers such as climate change socioeconomic and technological change and policy interventions they can be used to explore large ranges of key parameter spaces which is ideal for interactions with decision makers and stakeholders 46 94 as recognition of the importance of complexity of human natural systems such as watersheds has grown the focus of integrative models has shifted from studying the interactions of a limited number of systems energy economy climate at the global level to consideration of multiple interactions energy water land economy climate and at greater temporal spatial and process resolution scales recent research has explored the effects of climate on watersheds and their connections to energy agriculture and climate 10 34 35 and bioenergy and agricultural watershed systems 91 49 in this increasingly system complexity context the design of resilience strategies in watersheds can be approached through combined modeling scenarios and data analytics this combination can be approached through the interaction between ensembles of data and models with varied parameters stakeholder input is important so that scenarios can approximately describe interactions between natural and human systems given limited observations imperfect assumptions and finite model choices for instance approaches such as digital twinning allow simulation of multiple scenarios and possible interventions in a digital environment and is a promising route for watershed resilience 8 81 stakeholder input is also important so that decision makers understand and have confidence in the model outputs and are willing to use them in their decision making 14 13 an existing challenge in modeling and data approaches is to provide results at appropriate spatial and temporal scales that allow assessment of the effectiveness of interventions towards watershed resilience for example a recent study shows that many models can simulate the hydrological processes of sponge city practices however the use of these modeling results in decision support tools is relatively poor and ineffective due to lack of stakeholder involvement 56 in such contexts decision support tools and systems need to be tailored to meet diverse user requirements to ensure that it provides useful usable and used information for decision support for a diverse audience 100 an increasingly important research topic in human natural modeling towards watershed resilience is to develop visual analytics methods for cross scale comparison of outputs from integrative models with a focus on the impact of spatial and temporal scales and variations on scenarios and maximizing knowledge transfer that underpins evidence based decision making this is critical for assessing interactions feedbacks between watershed system variables as well as the dynamics of resilience modes e g rates of change reversibility and hysteresis 50 95 inter comparison of model simulations is helpful to provide insight into uncertainty of an ensemble analysis and the impact of model structure on outputs 3 4 developing a resilience focus in adaptive watershed management management of a watershed aligned with resilience principles such as those discussed in this paper represents an evolution from traditional approaches used in water resources engineering and ecosystem based management ongoing climate impacts coupled with other forms of global change may render historical management targets constrictive irrelevant or even damaging managing watersheds under a resilience paradigm suggests a more dynamic interactive form of engagement whereby watersheds may be managed for desired conditions and services either persistence or adaptation but potentially with physical and biological characteristics that exhibit limited resemblance to their recent historical state transformation the development of holistic management strategies from headwaters to floodplain to groundwater may be necessary as single system approaches are not sufficient 77 18 this represents a new frontier for hydrologists ecologists and social scientists and will inevitably require novel and more intensive forms of stakeholder engagement community based collaborative decision making to define watershed objectives and management actions the science of watershed resilience will need to combine insights from these disciplines into a new forward looking framework that is only beginning to emerge operationally 19 despite these challenges there are immediate opportunities for advancing resilience oriented strategies in watershed management for example approaches for addressing flood hazards are moving away from large structural control measures to nbs or hybrid designs that expand the flood inundation capacity of the landscape lowering the velocity and water level of flood flows and thereby reducing risk to property and life 69 66 by restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity with the landscape and accommodating ecologically beneficial high flows this approach has the potential to recover lost watershed floodplain functions and is compatible with the resilience principles described here the multitude of water infrastructure projects e g dams levees and canals at the end of their functional lifespan or requiring relicensing represents another opportunity to infuse resilience principles in watershed management 25 65 evaluating the potential watershed resilience benefits of removing water infrastructure against potential costs and risks would be a valuable exercise for prioritizing projects for strategic removal in the future as well as identifying new projects that are more flexible and effective additional work is needed to define both general and specific indicators of resilience 64 12 and to demonstrate how they can be incorporated in watershed management approaches recently poff et al 76 explored a quantitative approach to evaluate trade offs between ecological and engineering objectives in an integrated vulnerability assessment method this approach has been applied to a wide range of cases across economic development contexts it has already been integrated within new approaches to non stationary watershed planning and design methodologies 61 while also serving as a complement to established approaches to assessing climate risk in watershed decision making 82 these and other climate informed risk assessment approaches hold promise for identifying novel solutions for building resilience in managed watersheds and communicating options and building stakeholder consensus through environmental governance mechanisms 4 watershed resilience an initial set of research questions as part of this review we conducted several workshops surveys and consultations with various stakeholder groups watershed and conservation managers scientists practitioners and decision makers to elicit input on knowledge gaps that could be assembled into an initial list of research questions around watershed resilience these questions also informed the proposed areas of research described in section 3 we have paired this list of questions with the proposed research areas with the understanding that a given question may cut across more than one area of inquiry the table below summarizes this initial set of research questions further tuned by the identification of knowledge gaps in the reviewed literature and additional discussions while preparing this paper these questions can be thought of as future lines of investigation on watershed resilience research area research questions characterization of watershed resilience variables and their interactions how can watershed resilience modes be effectively identified and measured using comparable and transferable metrics to what degree can resilience be managed as past conditions tracking change through time or for potential future states how can we react to climate and impacts of other stressors and shocks or can we redefine growth and prosperity for times of ongoing change should we maintain existing flows despite climate change revert to past flows anticipate or track emerging trends what are the trigger points and the associated risk of actions or inaction on the resilience of a watershed leveraging watershed natural properties and processes towards resilience how do we deliver on outcomes for watershed resilience both from biodiversity ecosystems and human wellbeing standpoints measured by delivery of services to people what are the characteristics of watershed resilience that can be strengthened through nbs what is the effectiveness of nbs in watersheds on multiple scales in time and space what do we know about trade offs externalities uncertainties and potential negative impacts of nbs on other ecosystem services and specific communities how do we quantitatively assess co benefits and enhancements on ecosystem services and community social outcomes influenced by nbs integrative monitoring modeling and data analysis what are new methods in data driven and physically based modeling that are needed to delineate resilience modes in a watershed and quantify outcomes across the wide variety of resilience variables how can watershed modelling help quantify changes in watershed variables in space and time and linkages to persistence adaptation and transformation modes of resilience how can we advance modeling methods to better integrate biophysical and socioeconomic systems in assessing watershed interventions and their impacts on resilience how can future scenarios e g climate socioeconomic land use be effectively integrated into watershed resilience assessments and to what extent might they result in better long term outcomes how can data and scenarios best inform decision making in watersheds where decision making authority is fragmented among several institutions and regulations developing a resilience focus in adaptive watershed management how can watershed services for nature and people be improved through resilience thinking compared to planning conducted with traditional engineering or ecological management approaches what are the underlying social processes or driving forces such as attitudes behavior and standard institutional processes that create barriers to resilience planning in watersheds how do they function to prevent such planning what are the linkages between the levels of alteration to watershed processes in space and time that are commonly used to assess watershed resilience and the ability of watersheds to sustain nature and provide services to people how can monitoring evaluation and learning be conducted to demonstrate that resilience planning is progressing towards improved provision of watershed services benefits to people and nature what can be learned scaled and transferred between watersheds towards more established and sustainable pathways to resilience 5 concluding remarks resilience has emerged as a standard for evaluating the sustainability of watershed management much in the same way that cost benefits and ecological flow maintenance have served as standards in the past progress towards increased resilience in watersheds is hindered by conflicting management objectives interests existing policies inflexible infrastructure design and a lack of quantitative tools and data to facilitate critical decision making resilience modes are heuristic for decision makers such as resource managers infrastructure operators and watershed planners because matching resilience actions to the correct trajectory of change can determine the success and failure of projects and policies aligning decisions to the appropriate trajectory of change can define the options for successful and context sensitive interventions what we monitor for progress against targets and how we evaluate success indeed actions that are not aligned with the appropriate trajectory of change may even be counterproductive ideally monitoring systems should aim to detect potential shifts in trajectory such as transitions from persistence to adaptation to transformation actions that are intended to support a persistence mode may be inappropriate or even counterproductive for a context where adaptation or transformation are in play resilience mode mismatches may have important ramifications inducing fragility rather than building resilience efforts to keep a watershed in a persistence mode when external drivers are forcing adaptation or transformation may have quite perverse consequences as ecological communities and populations try to adjust behaviors range and phenologies in spite of resource management planning as society looks forward to a future with changing physical and socioeconomic drivers resilience in watersheds needs to be better understood as a set of informed choices that can be shaped towards implementation the research agenda summarized in this paper consisting of proposed areas of inquiry and research questions can be useful for generating discussion and guiding future research in characterizing resilience in a watershed how nature can play a role in its successful operationalization the integrative monitoring modeling tools and data that are required

20091,bangladesh is increasingly experiencing different challenges from scarce drinking water sources and health risks explicitly or implicitly attributed to climate change this systematic bibliographic review manually screened 47 articles under four categories including water and health climate and water climate and health and climate water and health from 2010 to 2022 this research is critical for ensuring the availability of safe drinkable water and public health adaptation to climate change in bangladesh the findings revealed that cholera infant diarrhea pneumonia dengue and malaria are prevalent in the vulnerable groups the present number and distribution of regional healthcare centers demonstrates potable water procedures and medical centers are insufficient relative to demands overall this study revealed several techniques that help guarantee safe potable water including holding rainwater pond sand filters and drinkable water supply a knowledge based approach was used to propound an adaptation framework for tackling the impact of changing climate especially on safe water availability and public health and also identified six research gaps this research serves as a roadmap for future scholars academicians practitioners and policymakers and indicates the need for more progress in the database on national climate change research keywords adaptation and mitigation bangladesh climate change public health safe water availability waterborne and vector borne diseases data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction consequently in the meanwhile climate change has placed its mark on several recent sharp climatic instances globally including recent prolonged and destructive flood incidents in pakistan bangladesh india china and the uk severe drought in asia and africa extreme heatwaves in central europe pacific coast of the us and canada and southwest zone of the us demolishing cyclones and storm surges all across the shores 24 39 40 57 88 98 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the eventuality of climatic change is likely to make extreme weather events more common and more severe around the world 38 39 41 forty seven of the least developed countries ldc mainly concentrated in africa and asia are contributing less to global climatic instability but suffering more intensively 21 30 likewise bangladesh is one of the asian countries of the ldc group with a very negligible carbon footprint only 0 56 globally 27 but bangladesh is considered one of the most climate vulnerable countries owing to its geographical position and low topographic relief 30 as a result bangladesh is experiencing exacerbated risks of human and economic downfall because of rising sea levels and temperatures as well as salinity intrusion storm surge increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and increased regional climate unpredictability and severe events such as more catastrophic floods droughts and storms 54 30 10 27 climatic events are having undeniable impacts on inland water sources and human health from the perspective of bangladesh 1 herein the consequences of climate change have two dimensions in terms of water such as water availability and water quality and both instances are intricately related to human health most importantly water extraction and supply systems are not well developed in bangladesh thus following a natural disaster the overall water infrastructure gets severely affected 102 for instance floods or tidal surges can outpour deep wells ponds streams and other waterways contaminating the natural freshwater sources in the process 102 1 as a result water insecurity has become imminent more or less all around bangladesh albeit the coastal inhabitants are conspicuously victimized due to salinity intrusion owing to the crisis of water resources for drinking and household usage 2 53 89 moreover climate change has indeed been attributed to several short and long term health risks including a rise in communicable diseases water borne vector borne and food borne non communicable diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease high blood pressure and mental illness and innutrition 66 25 furthermore climate change has triggered an enormous input of microbial contamination bacterial protozoan and viral pathogens and impairs the inland water quality intimately related to human health risks 42 43 1 statistically every year about 80 of illnesses in developing countries and approximately 1 8 million people are reckoned to die globally due to unsafe drinking water and water borne diseases 107 43 1 globally climate change leads to fatalities of about 150 000 people annually where children and aged communities are acutely vulnerable to this exacerbation 24 in bangladesh several researchers conducted their studies on the impact of climate change on water resources 101 55 79 43 1 and the consequence of adverse climate change on human health 24 49 10 25 33 47 nevertheless the pieces of evidence regarding the nexus of climate water health are widely missing in the streams of scientific research so this systematic investigation that attempts to synthesize information about the impact of climate change on the water system and human health from the perspective of bangladesh besides this study also points out some current research gaps it identifies several adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the upcoming challenges and provides direction and guidelines for future researchers and policymakers 2 methods 2 1 search strategy and study design the study adopted a mixed method of design that included a systematic search of the literature bibliographic review and analysis of the literature based on research questions 84 74 the study emphasized reviewing all the possible research articles connected to climate change s impact on water quality and human health in south asian countries however review articles and book chapters were included that were published from 2010 to 2022 the electronic literature search was conducted using sciencedirect and google scholar databases for literature review for transparency the systematic review s scope was limited to the following keywords climate change water quality and health impact for bangladesh only the research methodology by hansen et al 29 was followed to systematically analyze the publication during the above mentioned time frame fig 1 2 2 article inclusion criteria the four level manual literature assessment of i title ii keywords iii abstract and iv full publication was done for publication screening and eligibility 29 if the title clarified that the publication was associated with climate change impact on water quality and related human health it was considered for review if the title had no connection with climate change impact on water quality the second level keywords were considered and onward the research questions involved i is there any association of climate change with water quality and consequent health impact ii what is the available data regarding the impact of climate change on water quality in bangladesh and iii what are the future challenges for the people of bangladesh from water quality degradation due to climate change for this purpose two broad categorizations were assessed including publications i climate change impact on water quality in bangladesh and ii impact of water quality degradation because of climate change on human health for bangladesh the preliminary search results for inclusion and duplicate removal were sorted following prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses guideline 68 75 74 the publication with no association with climate change and false positive results was excluded 74 besides english publications solely related to climate change and its impact on water quality in bangladesh along with its health impact from the degraded water quality were included fig 1 3 results and discussions manual screening listed 55 articles under four categories from 2010 to 2022 including water and health n 22 articles climate and water n 18 articles climate and health n 10 articles and climate water and health n 5 articles that met the inclusion criteria explicitly hence the following subsections will discuss the findings from the depth review of these ancillary articles 3 1 climatic causes of drinking water deficiency in bangladesh bangladesh has been divided into four risk hotspots zones directly as a result of consequences and recurrence of catastrophic natural hazards 1 a cyclone or storm surge zone on the southern coast 2 a flood prone zone in most areas 3 sea level rise and saltwater intrusion zone in the southern coastline and 4 rising temperature drought risk zone in the northwest region 59 25 the number of publications on climate change addressing its impact on water or and human health explicitly or implicitly increases from the northern region to the southern part in bangladesh fig 2 approximately 33 of the studies found were conducted in the khulna division under southwestern coastal geographical settings followed by barisal 13 coastal area dhaka 13 floodplain zone rajshahi 9 drought prone area chittagong 13 coastal area and sylhet 5 urban and rural area divisions respectively approximately 31 of the publications covered the whole country focusing on cyclone flood drought journals and saline water intrusion prone areas the investigation in urban and rural settings was least observed salinity intrusion is a severe threat to fresh groundwater and natural freshwater wetlands 96 79 according to ipcc 38 and the world bank 110 the salinization of water and its dispersal in coastal areas are growing with sea levels rising in contrast climate change induced global warming is the primary driver of rising sea levels moreover researchers pointed out two principal causes of coastal river waters salinization and unsuitable for use for drinking purposes such as the sea level rise and gradual diminution of upstream water drift especially in the dry season 54 81 besides these two prime causes there are other causes of salinity intrusion like geographical location sedimentation cyclones storm and tidal surges and other man made reasons like shrimp cultivations in these areas 18 this condition is deteriorating in several coastal regions of the southwestern part of bangladesh wherein surface water salinity has surpassed 20 parts per trillion ppt in comparison the international permissible standard of who and fao is 0 5 ppt 54 in addition cyclones storm surges and coastal floods often strike facilitating saltwater intrusion for instance during the 2009 cyclone aila the status of supply water in 12 unions of satkhira district s shyamnagar upazila degraded due to the destruction of around 158 pond sand filters 966 tube wells and 2 006 reserved ponds as a result thousands of people were compelled to drink contaminated water since they had no other choices 20 102 91 because natural wetlands are being harmed by salinization indigenous people seek remedies such as artificial ponds to conserve freshwater or rainfall collecting 1 with the exception of the southern part which receives abundant often too much rainfall bangladesh is witnessing a rise in drought frequency 3 according to the water resources planning organization annually droughts affect around 47 percent of bangladesh s total geographical land and 53 percent of its demography 103 despite the limited research on the lack of the northwestern site the bulk of them blamed groundwater extraction for watering purposes under the

the major socio economic factors influencing climate change s vulnerability 34 69 54 one of the most important factors increasing climate change vulnerability in bangladesh is bangladesh s restricted scientific and technological framework 31 a robust adaptation plan prioritizes the demands of local populations and respects their experience for instance rainwater harvesting was chosen by 93 percent of respondents in durgabati village as the best solution for dealing with drinkable water scarcity and the use of polythene in thatched roofs reduced water contamination in comparison pond sand filters were preferred by 85 percent of those surveyed in gopalpur village 1 they are establishing effective relationships coordination and synchronization between government agencies and non governmental organizations ngos 23 a bottom up technique involving residents and specialists in the sector to identify key aspects and their possible adjustments will improve the performance of scenario development since actual stakeholders have less access to information 32 31 for coastal areas mitigation measures should include preserving the upstream water supplies and limiting the effects of seawater intrusion and salinities in metro areas diminishing the quality of drinking water because they are in such dire straits it is critical to excavate waterways and drill a deep well for underground water utilization 81 social tree planting homestead agriculture and pond fishing might be fostered for the inland coastal population as a viable alternative to the prevailing socioeconomic system 55 firm governance can drive any action plans integrating local and official actors for tackling the impact of climate change especially on water quality and public health through adaptation and mitigation strategies following the above discussion a framework for climate change adaptation in bangladesh is proposed in this study as demonstrated in fig 5 adopted from cross et al 17 climate change acclimatization framework for regulating natural resources and conservation an adaptation planning is formulated considering the factors influencing vulnerabilities to climate change adaptation should be domain specific to set objectives for building a conceptual model for the specific domain and assess the conceptual model assessment suggestions are afterward incorporated into existing policies on climate change adaptation an action plan is developed to integrate the public and private organizations and guidelines from the local people and other relevant stakeholders to specialists bottom up approach the action plan is evaluated and implemented the strategy s effectiveness is assessed to add further recommendations to the existing policies besides the bangladesh delta plan 2100 bdp2100 was developed as a long term strategic planning and venture to protect sustainability in economic growth improve biodiversity protection fortify adaptability to natural calamities and encourage efficient water governance in reaction to climate related effects and related impacts 12 also it concentrates on different adaptation routes that recognize the existence of future states ambiguity and sometimes unpredictability the national adaptation plan of bangladesh 2030 2050 which was published in 2022 and other domestic actions have recently shown that bangladesh is a very productive country in international climate change negotiations in these documents public health was maintained as a prime concern area of the initiative 70 4 research gaps analysis intense investigation of the existing studies we have pointed out some crucial gaps in climate water health researches which are abridged below specific regions notably those in the north have been less explored in climate change impact studies from the selected studies while there is a substantial quantity of current information in specific disciplines performed in the southwestern coastal region such information may not be conducive for the whole country because of variations in environmental settings in the north from the southern coastal areas even though the climate change impact implications regarding water quality and human health are fewer none of the studies presented the impact of degraded water quality in light of climate change upon other animals e g domestic animals and vegetables that humans directly consume the quality of microbiological surface water is critical because it has been linked to health complications in those who drink swim or consume crops and vegetables irrigated with surface water however socio economic upliftment and climate change are likely to impact the quality of microbiological surface water hence more detailed studies regarding climate change induced microbiological water quality are imperative in the streams of climate water health research furthermore bangladesh s specific climatic sensitivity has been well investigated but the mental health consequences of climate change are still largely unrecognized in the country consequently the researchers should pay close attention to apprehending the effects of climate change on mental health and well being 5 concluding remarks this study elucidates the imminent risk of climate change for safe water availability and linked health problems in bangladesh the availability of groundwater and surface water resources is due to the effects of climatic hazards like salinization drought during the dry season extreme floods during the wet season and cyclones or storm surges moreover our study points out several issues such as lack of safe drinking water measures lack of safe water supply to vulnerable need for installation of safe drinking and accessible water sources inadequate health care facilities relative to demand river encroachment and massive river sand filling which required further focus analogously firm measures should be taken such as building floodwalls developing drought tolerant crops adopting water saving irrigation systems and preventing settlements in sensitive places besides our study recommends several mitigation strategies to alleviate the damage of climate change through effective policies technological innovations and a shift in the way of life these and other potential adaptation measures ultimately help adapt to health problems and curtail waterborne diseases and more importantly it will be easier to achieve sustainable development goals sdgs 1 2 3 6 and 13 which are directly related to climate change water health however bangladesh might have to pay a heavy price in productivity and human lives if swift actions are not made right away to avert and adapt to climate change to handle the challenges effectively this research suggested that multiple stakeholders gos ngos and communities should take measures to monitor alteration evaluate impact facilitate adaptation and develop plans to ascertain safe

20091,bangladesh is increasingly experiencing different challenges from scarce drinking water sources and health risks explicitly or implicitly attributed to climate change this systematic bibliographic review manually screened 47 articles under four categories including water and health climate and water climate and health and climate water and health from 2010 to 2022 this research is critical for ensuring the availability of safe drinkable water and public health adaptation to climate change in bangladesh the findings revealed that cholera infant diarrhea pneumonia dengue and malaria are prevalent in the vulnerable groups the present number and distribution of regional healthcare centers demonstrates potable water procedures and medical centers are insufficient relative to demands overall this study revealed several techniques that help guarantee safe potable water including holding rainwater pond sand filters and drinkable water supply a knowledge based approach was used to propound an adaptation framework for tackling the impact of changing climate especially on safe water availability and public health and also identified six research gaps this research serves as a roadmap for future scholars academicians practitioners and policymakers and indicates the need for more progress in the database on national climate change research keywords adaptation and mitigation bangladesh climate change public health safe water availability waterborne and vector borne diseases data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction consequently in the meanwhile climate change has placed its mark on several recent sharp climatic instances globally including recent prolonged and destructive flood incidents in pakistan bangladesh india china and the uk severe drought in asia and africa extreme heatwaves in central europe pacific coast of the us and canada and southwest zone of the us demolishing cyclones and storm surges all across the shores 24 39 40 57 88 98 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the eventuality of climatic change is likely to make extreme weather events more common and more severe around the world 38 39 41 forty seven of the least developed countries ldc mainly concentrated in africa and asia are contributing less to global climatic instability but suffering more intensively 21 30 likewise bangladesh is one of the asian countries of the ldc group with a very negligible carbon footprint only 0 56 globally 27 but bangladesh is considered one of the most climate vulnerable countries owing to its geographical position and low topographic relief 30 as a result bangladesh is experiencing exacerbated risks of human and economic downfall because of rising sea levels and temperatures as well as salinity intrusion storm surge increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and increased regional climate unpredictability and severe events such as more catastrophic floods droughts and storms 54 30 10 27 climatic events are having undeniable impacts on inland water sources and human health from the perspective of bangladesh 1 herein the consequences of climate change have two dimensions in terms of water such as water availability and water quality and both instances are intricately related to human health most importantly water extraction and supply systems are not well developed in bangladesh thus following a natural disaster the overall water infrastructure gets severely affected 102 for instance floods or tidal surges can outpour deep wells ponds streams and other waterways contaminating the natural freshwater sources in the process 102 1 as a result water insecurity has become imminent more or less all around bangladesh albeit the coastal inhabitants are conspicuously victimized due to salinity intrusion owing to the crisis of water resources for drinking and household usage 2 53 89 moreover climate change has indeed been attributed to several short and long term health risks including a rise in communicable diseases water borne vector borne and food borne non communicable diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease high blood pressure and mental illness and innutrition 66 25 furthermore climate change has triggered an enormous input of microbial contamination bacterial protozoan and viral pathogens and impairs the inland water quality intimately related to human health risks 42 43 1 statistically every year about 80 of illnesses in developing countries and approximately 1 8 million people are reckoned to die globally due to unsafe drinking water and water borne diseases 107 43 1 globally climate change leads to fatalities of about 150 000 people annually where children and aged communities are acutely vulnerable to this exacerbation 24 in bangladesh several researchers conducted their studies on the impact of climate change on water resources 101 55 79 43 1 and the consequence of adverse climate change on human health 24 49 10 25 33 47 nevertheless the pieces of evidence regarding the nexus of climate water health are widely missing in the streams of scientific research so this systematic investigation that attempts to synthesize information about the impact of climate change on the water system and human health from the perspective of bangladesh besides this study also points out some current research gaps it identifies several adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the upcoming challenges and provides direction and guidelines for future researchers and policymakers 2 methods 2 1 search strategy and study design the study adopted a mixed method of design that included a systematic search of the literature bibliographic review and analysis of the literature based on research questions 84 74 the study emphasized reviewing all the possible research articles connected to climate change s impact on water quality and human health in south asian countries however review articles and book chapters were included that were published from 2010 to 2022 the electronic literature search was conducted using sciencedirect and google scholar databases for literature review for transparency the systematic review s scope was limited to the following keywords climate change water quality and health impact for bangladesh only the research methodology by hansen et al 29 was followed to systematically analyze the publication during the above mentioned time frame fig 1 2 2 article inclusion criteria the four level manual literature assessment of i title ii keywords iii abstract and iv full publication was done for publication screening and eligibility 29 if the title clarified that the publication was associated with climate change impact on water quality and related human health it was considered for review if the title had no connection with climate change impact on water quality the second level keywords were considered and onward the research questions involved i is there any association of climate change with water quality and consequent health impact ii what is the available data regarding the impact of climate change on water quality in bangladesh and iii what are the future challenges for the people of bangladesh from water quality degradation due to climate change for this purpose two broad categorizations were assessed including publications i climate change impact on water quality in bangladesh and ii impact of water quality degradation because of climate change on human health for bangladesh the preliminary search results for inclusion and duplicate removal were sorted following prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses guideline 68 75 74 the publication with no association with climate change and false positive results was excluded 74 besides english publications solely related to climate change and its impact on water quality in bangladesh along with its health impact from the degraded water quality were included fig 1 3 results and discussions manual screening listed 55 articles under four categories from 2010 to 2022 including water and health n 22 articles climate and water n 18 articles climate and health n 10 articles and climate water and health n 5 articles that met the inclusion criteria explicitly hence the following subsections will discuss the findings from the depth review of these ancillary articles 3 1 climatic causes of drinking water deficiency in bangladesh bangladesh has been divided into four risk hotspots zones directly as a result of consequences and recurrence of catastrophic natural hazards 1 a cyclone or storm surge zone on the southern coast 2 a flood prone zone in most areas 3 sea level rise and saltwater intrusion zone in the southern coastline and 4 rising temperature drought risk zone in the northwest region 59 25 the number of publications on climate change addressing its impact on water or and human health explicitly or implicitly increases from the northern region to the southern part in bangladesh fig 2 approximately 33 of the studies found were conducted in the khulna division under southwestern coastal geographical settings followed by barisal 13 coastal area dhaka 13 floodplain zone rajshahi 9 drought prone area chittagong 13 coastal area and sylhet 5 urban and rural area divisions respectively approximately 31 of the publications covered the whole country focusing on cyclone flood drought journals and saline water intrusion prone areas the investigation in urban and rural settings was least observed salinity intrusion is a severe threat to fresh groundwater and natural freshwater wetlands 96 79 according to ipcc 38 and the world bank 110 the salinization of water and its dispersal in coastal areas are growing with sea levels rising in contrast climate change induced global warming is the primary driver of rising sea levels moreover researchers pointed out two principal causes of coastal river waters salinization and unsuitable for use for drinking purposes such as the sea level rise and gradual diminution of upstream water drift especially in the dry season 54 81 besides these two prime causes there are other causes of salinity intrusion like geographical location sedimentation cyclones storm and tidal surges and other man made reasons like shrimp cultivations in these areas 18 this condition is deteriorating in several coastal regions of the southwestern part of bangladesh wherein surface water salinity has surpassed 20 parts per trillion ppt in comparison the international permissible standard of who and fao is 0 5 ppt 54 in addition cyclones storm surges and coastal floods often strike facilitating saltwater intrusion for instance during the 2009 cyclone aila the status of supply water in 12 unions of satkhira district s shyamnagar upazila degraded due to the destruction of around 158 pond sand filters 966 tube wells and 2 006 reserved ponds as a result thousands of people were compelled to drink contaminated water since they had no other choices 20 102 91 because natural wetlands are being harmed by salinization indigenous people seek remedies such as artificial ponds to conserve freshwater or rainfall collecting 1 with the exception of the southern part which receives abundant often too much rainfall bangladesh is witnessing a rise in drought frequency 3 according to the water resources planning organization annually droughts affect around 47 percent of bangladesh s total geographical land and 53 percent of its demography 103 despite the limited research on the lack of the northwestern site the bulk of them blamed groundwater extraction for watering purposes under the project of barind irrigation rather than examining the complete water cycle for freshwater resources 3 9 maximum temperature increases promote excessive evaporation and unpredictability in transboundary water flow ultimately resulting in the declination of surface water level whereas surface water availability substantially impacts groundwater aquifer regeneration 99 76 according to alauddin and sarker 9 in the north western regions of bangladesh the groundwater aquifers are not thoroughly recharged besides they have low recharge potential all these circumstances mentioned above make the northwestern part more vulnerable to drought hence the negative impacts of climate change on the freshwater source and rainfall rate are indisputable ultimately causing hydrological and

climate change 34 69 54 81 13 31 79 92 1 10 high temperatures extreme precipitation flooding cyclones riverbank erosion salinity intrusion waterlogging sea level rise and other climatic stressors increase vulnerability to infectious disease 49 10 95 58 51 71 mobility from remote areas to cities 81 16 irrigation water demand change for different crops 87 49 drinking water crisis and pollution 101 81 abedin et al 2018 socio economic factors such as local people gender age literacy livelihood health and agriculture 101 36 9 11 13 24 55 43 79 1 95 25 56 high population density and poverty are the major socio economic factors influencing climate change s vulnerability 34 69 54 one of the most important factors increasing climate change vulnerability in bangladesh is bangladesh s restricted scientific and technological framework 31 a robust adaptation plan prioritizes the demands of local populations and respects their experience for instance rainwater harvesting was chosen by 93 percent of respondents in durgabati village as the best solution for dealing with drinkable water scarcity and the use of polythene in thatched roofs reduced water contamination in comparison pond sand filters were preferred by 85 percent of those surveyed in gopalpur village 1 they are establishing effective relationships coordination and synchronization between government agencies and non governmental organizations ngos 23 a bottom up technique involving residents and specialists in the sector to identify key aspects and their possible adjustments will improve the performance of scenario development since actual stakeholders have less access to information 32 31 for coastal areas mitigation measures should include preserving the upstream water supplies and limiting the effects of seawater intrusion and salinities in metro areas diminishing the quality of drinking water because they are in such dire straits it is critical to excavate waterways and drill a deep well for underground water utilization 81 social tree planting homestead agriculture and pond fishing might be fostered for the inland coastal population as a viable alternative to the prevailing socioeconomic system 55 firm governance can drive any action plans integrating local and official actors for tackling the impact of climate change especially on water quality and public health through adaptation and mitigation strategies following the above discussion a framework for climate change adaptation in bangladesh is proposed in this study as demonstrated in fig 5 adopted from cross et al 17 climate change acclimatization framework for regulating natural resources and conservation an adaptation planning is formulated considering the factors influencing vulnerabilities to climate change adaptation should be domain specific to set objectives for building a conceptual model for the specific domain and assess the conceptual model assessment suggestions are afterward incorporated into existing policies on climate change adaptation an action plan is developed to integrate the public and private organizations and guidelines from the local people and other relevant stakeholders to specialists bottom up approach the action plan is evaluated and implemented the strategy s effectiveness is assessed to add further recommendations to the existing policies besides the bangladesh delta plan 2100 bdp2100 was developed as a long term strategic planning and venture to protect sustainability in economic growth improve biodiversity protection fortify adaptability to natural calamities and encourage efficient water governance in reaction to climate related effects and related impacts 12 also it concentrates on different adaptation routes that recognize the existence of future states ambiguity and sometimes unpredictability the national adaptation plan of bangladesh 2030 2050 which was published in 2022 and other domestic actions have recently shown that bangladesh is a very productive country in international climate change negotiations in these documents public health was maintained as a prime concern area of the initiative 70 4 research gaps analysis intense investigation of the existing studies we have pointed out some crucial gaps in climate water health researches which are abridged below specific regions notably those in the north have been less explored in climate change impact studies from the selected studies while there is a substantial quantity of current information in specific disciplines performed in the southwestern coastal region such information may not be conducive for the whole country because of variations in environmental settings in the north from the southern coastal areas even though the climate change impact implications regarding water quality and human health are fewer none of the studies presented the impact of degraded water quality in light of climate change upon other animals e g domestic animals and vegetables that humans directly consume the quality of microbiological surface water is critical because it has been linked to health complications in those who drink swim or consume crops and vegetables irrigated with surface water however socio economic upliftment and climate change are likely to impact the quality of microbiological surface water hence more detailed studies regarding climate change induced microbiological water quality are imperative in the streams of climate water health research furthermore bangladesh s specific climatic sensitivity has been well investigated but the mental health consequences of climate change are still largely unrecognized in the country consequently the researchers should pay close attention to apprehending the effects of climate change on mental health and well being 5 concluding remarks this study elucidates the imminent risk of climate change for safe water availability and linked health problems in bangladesh the availability of groundwater and surface water resources is due to the effects of climatic hazards like salinization drought during the dry season extreme floods during the wet season and cyclones or storm surges moreover our study points out several issues such as lack of safe drinking water measures lack of safe water supply to vulnerable need for installation of safe drinking and accessible water sources inadequate health care facilities relative to demand river encroachment and massive river sand filling which required further focus analogously firm measures should be taken such as building floodwalls developing drought tolerant crops adopting water saving irrigation systems and preventing settlements in sensitive places besides our study recommends several mitigation strategies to alleviate the damage of climate change through effective policies technological innovations and a shift in the way of life these and other potential adaptation measures ultimately help adapt to health problems and curtail waterborne diseases and more importantly it will be easier to achieve sustainable development goals sdgs 1 2 3 6 and 13 which are directly related to climate change water health however bangladesh might have to pay a heavy price in productivity and human lives if swift actions are not made right away to avert and adapt to climate change to handle the challenges effectively this research suggested that multiple stakeholders gos ngos and communities should take measures to monitor alteration evaluate impact facilitate adaptation and develop plans to ascertain safe drinking water and improve healthcare facilities to address the challenge of climate change and amplify holistic solutions authors contributions smt and aha had the idea and designed the study aha and

20092,in this paper we propose to study the operational interest of the build back better concept bbb and highlighting its importance in mitigating risks and improving the resilience of critical infrastructures in the paris region to flood risk during the recovery and the reconstruction phases based on an in depth examination of the bbb concept and its relevance to risk management we propose an adapted methodological approach suitable for the paris region critical infrastructures finally the approach initially designed for a reconstruction context is implemented to reduce the vulnerabilities of infrastructures in the prevention phase we then talk about build better before and present here a development in this sense our proposed framework is structured into two major axes risk quantification and decision support for the multi criteria optimization of the investments required to mitigate the quantified risks with this in mind we first propose to develop an fmea failure mode and effects analysis in order to identify and formalize the direct and indirect vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures in a flooding context the output of the risk assessment is then used within a multi criteria optimization framework for optimal risk reduction under budget constraints keywords building back better critical infrastructures flooding ile de france region risk analysis multicriteria decision aid data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 natural disasters and the need for a paradigm shift the total loss resulting from natural disasters reached 5 trillion over the period 1980 2019 of which 1092 billion was caused by flooding alone even more alarming is the fact that the effect of climate change would accentuate the occurrence of extreme precipitation events that could lead to even greater economic losses 28 in light of the damage caused by natural disasters in general and floods in particular it seems that more efforts are still needed to reduce the vulnerabilities of our territories to ensure their resilience and sustainability moreover and if these disasters are logically perceived as negative the post disaster period can be a real opportunity to rebuild and rethink our societies and territories in a safer perspective through the implementation of vulnerability reduction actions aiming at achieving a better resilience of the territory in the long term 6 for this reason the sendai framework 2015 2030 adopted at the third united nations world conference on disaster risk reduction explicitly put forward the concept of building back better as a matter of fact the 4th priority action defined within the framework of this program is to strengthen disaster preparedness to respond effectively and to build back better during the phases of recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction 39 hence the framework suggests a paradigm shift that relies on the reconstruction and the recovery processes to improve the physical social environmental and economic conditions of an urban system to make it more resilient to future disasters 26 it is therefore interesting to discuss the definitions of bbb and how they could be integrated into the natural risk management process we propose in this research to take the case of critical infrastructures ci cis represent major elements of urban vulnerability and resilience 2 ci includes the physical and computer service networks facilities assets necessary for the proper functioning of a society and its economy 16 the vulnerabilities of these networks are unfortunately multiplied by interdependencies that can generate cascading effects thus many critical infrastructures can become inoperable in the event of power cuts communication or transport failures etc ci becomes even more critical in times of natural disaster as its failure can significantly threaten first responder deployment and emergency management services 23 the importance of ci further extends into the recovery and reconstruction phases of the affected territories in fact the recovery phase begins with the restoration of damaged ci networks several studies used the re establishment of ci networks and their return to normal functioning as indicators for measuring the resilience and recovery of societies 11 in order to operationalize the concept of bbb and to ensure its effective implementation it is necessary to establish a common and shared definition of build back better bbb among the different stakeholders involved in the recovery and the reconstruction processes in this regard 32 maintains that the concept is good in theory but faces the same difficulties as the concept of resilience struggling to find any operational application this is due in particular to the polysemy of the term and the wide range of the possible interpretations that could be made of it reconstructing what and better in what understanding to this end the first part of this paper introduces the concept of bbb and focuses on its potential added value to the disaster risk management cycle sections 2 and 3 shed light on the operational practices of ile de france cis managers in terms of flood risk management with a view to analyzing the relevance of integrating the bbb concept as a resilience driver for these cis section 4 is devoted to the development of our proposed methodology for implementing bbb for cis finally the conclusions are outlined in section 5 2 the concept of building back better a definition of the concept and territorial operationalization s perspectives in the lack of a common and agreed upon definition build back better bbb remains a vague term used to express a wide range of ideas 25 the term better is itself interpreted in different ways 22 since it could refer to a recomposition of the affected territory that promotes security resilience economic development environmental issues etc nevertheless and despite this semantic vagueness there seems to be a consensus in the institutional definitions proposed by the unisdr a a unisdr united nations office for disaster risk reduction and gfdrr b b gfdrr global facility for disaster reduction and recovery we recall these definitions here and adopt them in the rest of this paper 2 1 building back better a definition of the concept the unisdr defines build back better as the use of the recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction phases to improve the resilience of affected nations and communities through the integration of risk reduction measures 39 similarly the gfdrr defines bbb as a disaster recovery approach that aims to reduce vulnerability to future disasters and that aspires to improve a community s resilience to better rebound after physical social and economic shocks thus recovery within a bbb framework presents an opportunity for disaster affected communities to reduce their existing and foreseeable vulnerabilities in this context and in the wake of the hurricanes that hit the caribbean in 2017 the gfdrr recalls the need for a paradigm shift by considering the recovery phase as a catalyst to better rebuild the affected territories through the integration of three interdependent pillars see fig 1 build back stronger build back faster and build back more inclusively 18 der sarkissian et al 11 propose bbb indicators focusing on critical infrastructure in particular urban networks including 1 resilience aspects indicators responding to exposure to hazards vulnerabilities lack of redundancy lack of robustness slow recovery speeds and high interdependency levels 2 environmental and sustainability indicators 3 socioeconomic development indicators it is clear from these definitions that the bbb raises the question of better adaptation to identified risks depending on the objects considered it can also be an opportunity to carry out innovative processes of consultation with the populations to improve the environmental or technical performance of the infrastructures hence the post disaster phase can be a window of opportunity for initiating new urban dynamics to improve the resilience and to reduce the vulnerability of risk prone territories this phase seems to present in fact a concomitance of factors favorable to initiate virtuous processes of risk management such as the reactivation of the memory of risk the de compartmentalization between the different actors who decide to collaborate and to work together and above all the mobilization of exceptional monetary funds for reconstruction 27 therefore the concept of build back better seems to refer to an ideal approach to post disaster reconstruction that aspires to create a new state of normality that is better than the one that existed before a disaster occurred potentially contradictory dimensions of build back better are emerging how to rebuild better and faster at the same time how to arbitrate between the budgets allocated to a rapid provisional return to service of infrastructures and those allocated to a less vulnerable and or more efficient reconstruction it can thus be assumed that definitions of the bbb vary according to the context and the actors considered in this article we position ourselves as a critical infrastructure manager wishing to anticipate post flood reconstruction as we will see later our study context has led us to focus our research towards vulnerability reduction 2 2 the bbb which position within the cycle of natural risk management as it is not an isolated phase of the disaster risk management cycle see fig 2 post disaster reconstruction is conditioned by the risk prevention and mitigation strategies deployed in a territory in fact it should be highlighted that the reconstruction process fills a central position in the recovery process which in turn is embedded in a longer and more complex dynamic namely the disaster risk management cycle 17 31 the management of natural hazards is often schematized by a cycle commonly referred to as the disaster risk management cycle 4 this concept was first introduced by 3 who identified four phases to describe the risk management process this cyclical representation relies on the principle that risks do not dissipate at the end of a disaster and that a risk prone territory must remain in a state of constant preparedness for an eventual future disastrous event 6 although the terminology may differ from one author to another two phases can be distinguished in the disaster risk management cycle pre disaster and post disaster phases which are separated by the occurrence of a shock the disaster while the pre disaster phase represents the normal functioning of a territory the post disaster phase is characterized by i a short term period in which the emphasis is on making people and property safe and on implementing effective solutions to mitigate the damage caused by the shock and by ii a medium to a long term period in which the impacted urban system must be reconstructed the post disaster phase can thus be subdivided into a response sub phase and a recovery sub phase the response sub phase it takes place just after the occurrence of a disaster it includes all measures taken during or directly after a shock to save lives minimize physical damage or to improve the recovery process 7 24 the recovery sub phase it is the final stage in the disaster risk management cycle the recovery of an affected territory involves ensuring a rapid return to normality in the short term and a reduction of vulnerabilities in the medium and the long term 24 moreover it must be noted that there are two possible options for rebuilding a territory in the recovery sub phase the first variant consists of repairing the damaged facilities and infrastructures and restoring them to a level similar to the pre disaster level identical reconstruction which may lead to reproducing the same vulnerabilities in the territory the second variant of reconstruction on the other hand aims to improve the pre disaster conditions and to rebuild better by integrating measures for risk reduction and for integrating other considerations such as energy efficiency urban integration and sustainable development 14 in this second case we can then speak of build back better 2 3 bbb the need for ex ante planning and risk anticipation to avoid replicating the same vulnerabilities it is essential to plan the reconstruction process before a disaster occurs in order to identify the appropriate levers for the recovery of a territory this is why pre disaster recovery planning for reconstruction and recovery is a prerequisite and a logical step towards ensuring that communities build back better following a natural disaster 18 21 this proactive approach is aiming at identifying the relevant structural and non structural actions necessary for risk mitigation by analyzing different disaster scenarios to this end several governments and agencies have begun to develop ex ante recovery plans and guides to better prepare and anticipate the reconstruction phase the table 1 provides an overview of the recovery plans prepared by some territories the pre disaster planning approach can be applied theoretically at various scales to all aspects of post disaster recovery this being said we believe that another sine qua none condition for the effective operationalization of the bbb concept consists of an in depth analysis of the flood related risks for the urban territory as a whole and more specifically for the urban object under study the risk management strategies deployed to mitigate the risks should also be considered and evaluated in this regard being particularly interested in the resilience of the ile de france region s cis in the context of a major flooding event the following section of our paper recalls the challenges of a major flood in the ile de france region as well as its impacts on the territory and its infrastructures and the flood risk management strategies being considered by the cis managers the elements presented in the following section are mainly the findings of bibliographical research and interviews with some of ile de france s cis managers 3 a territorial approach for bbb ile de france region s cis in a flooding context 3 1 ile de france flooding context vulnerabilities of cis vs prevention and mitigation strategies the effect of a major flood in ile de france is one of the three most feared natural hazards in france a major flood of the seine and its tributaries could generate direct damage costing up to 30 billion euros according to the different flood scenarios 29 30 the cis in the ile de france region are particularly vulnerable to flooding and could suffer considerable damage 29 30 accordingly it is estimated that the indirect impacts of flooding particularly concerning the malfunctioning of these cis could reach 50 billion euros in this respect and to mitigate these potential damages the cis managers are deploying strategies aiming mainly at limiting the damage to their infrastructures to restore them to service as soon as possible after the flooding 38 these mitigation and protection strategies are justified by the fact that the proper functioning of cis relies on subsystems and components that are not adapted to submersion by water and even less to a long submersion as could be the case in a centennial flood scenario as an example the proper functioning of the power distribution network is highly dependent on the reliability of the feeder stations and the high voltage low voltage substations which are highly sensitive to water similarly the majority of railway infrastructures such as signaling and switching equipment are very sensitive to water contact which makes the ratp c c régie autonome des transport parisien metro system and sncf d d société nationale des chemins de fer français national railway network urban transport networks highly vulnerable in the event of flooding according to toubin 37 local regulations 12 require public transport network managers and fluid distributors water energy to analyse their vulnerability and integrate into their projects all suitable constructive provisions aimed at allowing normal operation of the lines or at the very least to withstand prolonged immersion for several days without structural damage and restarting activity as quickly as possible after the water has left these vulnerabilities alongside the corresponding protective measures determine the extent of the damage to the cis and highlight a possible way of operationalizing the bbb concept for these latter here we can see the concerns and contradictions raised by the injunctions to resilience and the bbb knowing that a major flood will occur sooner or later it may be important to have a tool that allows the best choices to be made for reconstruction in a context of great tension with the desire to rebuild as quickly as possible while reducing current vulnerabilities 3 2 the post flood reconstruction of cis in ile de france what operational reality the prevention and mitigation strategies mentioned above have led all cis managers to develop investment plans that aim to reduce the vulnerability of their critical assets in a preventive approach interviews with several of them one for each network mentioned allowed us to describe the nature of their plans in table 2 the interviewees were all engineers in charge of protecting a specific network from flood risk hydraulic project manager business manager and plan for flood protection responsible for security and risk management or head of mission flood impact assessment these investment plans are essentially self funded and are conducted over the long term between 5 and 15 years as part of a proactive and preventive logic that can be described as build better before building back better ile de france cis in a flooding context would rather be interpreted from the perspective of planning a better adaptation of the vulnerable sub systems and not a reconstruction in the strict sense of the term the damage to infrastructures would be very limited it would seem that only a small number of components in the floodplain are likely to require repair or replacement indeed the spatial extent of the feared floods generally covers only a small part of the network lines and given the slow rise of the water a large part of the most sensitive equipment can be dismantled 1 38 as a result cis managers do not primarily fear large scale structural ruin phenomena yet in addition to occasional structural disorders a large number of sensitive equipment could be impacted in fact instead of waiting for the occurrence of a major flood suffering damages and then thinking about how to better rebuild these infrastructures cis managers undertake preventing flood protection investments to the extent that this is technically and economically possible and prefer in the event of a major flood to implement dismantling dewatering and safeguard measures to restart rapidly after the recession of waters 3 3 conclusion a perspective of operationalizing the bbb concept for ile de france cis in a flooding context in view of the findings drawn up in the previous sections we question the priority of needs in terms of tools to improve the resilience of parisian critical infrastructures and the possible perspectives of operationalizing the bbb concept for the ile de france region cis in fact the term building back does not seem the most appropriate for the case of parisian critical infrastructures given the prevention and mitigation strategies deployed by their managers hence risk management in the post flooding phase and more specifically in the recovery sub phase will essentially consist of actions aiming at restoring rehabilitating and adapting the most vulnerable equipment it therefore appears to be a priority to propose an approach adapted to the reduction of ex ante vulnerabilities likely to provide elements that are also useful in the ex post reconstruction phase or even to be used in this context we will therefore use the term building back better in its broad understanding which will encompass any action or measure aiming at reducing vulnerabilities and improving the resilience of a ci strongly linked to the concept of build back better which is its starting point our approach can be assimilated to the build better before 40 in this respect the remainder of this paper will focus on developing an approach for ex ante planning of vulnerability reduction measures our approach is intended as a decision making tool for quantifying risks and optimizing investments that can be deployed in prevention and mitigation or if not possible during the recovery phase depending on the economic conjuncture and the decision makers preferences finally and for ease of reading this article is limited to a brief illustrated presentation of the implementation of our approach readers interested in these details as well as in practical applications can consult 8 9 4 a comprehensive framework for building back better ile de france s cis 4 1 overview of the methodological approach our proposed methodology has two building blocks i risk analysis and ii decision support for the multi criteria optimization of the investments required to mitigate the quantified risks fig 3 in the first building block risk analysis we propose to identify the failure modes of the components of a ci by carrying out a functional analysis followed by a failure mode and effects analysis fmea in addition since interdependencies between the components of a critical infrastructure are a key factor in the propagation of cascading failures we introduce the criticality index as a criterion to quantify each component s contribution to the set of all possible cascading failure scenarios moreover we also integrate other criteria that may be relevant in the risk management process and that may differ from one ci to another according to the nature of its subsystems components and the preferences of its managers subsequently we analyze the possible adaptation solutions for mitigating the quantified risks in the previous steps in this respect we present a generic typology of safety barriers that can be implemented for ile de france s cis table 3 the second building block of our approach multicriteria optimization provides decision making support concerning the optimal allocation of safety barriers to mitigating risks on the basis of the undertaken risk assessment we derive a utility function of each potential safety barrier which reflects its impact on risk reduction to this end a total aggregation method topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to derive the utility function of each safety barrier by combining the different criteria retained according to the preferences of the decision makers finally we combine the result of the multi criteria analysis with a mathematical optimization model in particular the knapsack model in order to take into account the different criteria related to risk mitigation the budgetary constraints faced by ci managers and the need to optimize the allocation of financial resources the methodological building blocks fig 3 of our approach are explained more in detail in the following sections 4 2 focus on the framework 4 2 1 functional analysis as a basis for risk analysis in our approach a functional analysis of the ci of interest is first carried out to identify its subsystems and components as well as the possible interactions between them this first step of functional analysis is a prerequisite for the development of the dysfunctional model of a ci in a flooding event 15 to this end we proceed in two phases we establish an exhaustive inventory of the critical infrastructure s subsystems and components and then we identify the elements of the external environment that could cause their failure subsequently functional dependencies between the subsystems under study are mapped in the form of an adjacency matrix according to the following formalism if there is a dependency relationship between the two components i and j cell i j takes the value 1 otherwise 0 4 2 2 risk analysis thanks to its exhaustiveness the established functional model helps to map the different interactions and interdependencies between the components of the ci by confronting these characteristics with the potential impacts of flooding both the causes and the direct and cascading effects of the failure of each component can be assessed the results of this analysis are compiled in an fmea listing the sub systems of the ci and their components the failures causes of each component and the effects of their failures see table 4 the results of the fmea are then used for the construction of cascading failures scenarios as developed in the following section 4 2 3 determination of the cascading failures profiles to overcome the limits of the fmea in explicitly considering the cascading failures caused by each component we propose in our framework to determine the behavioral profile of each component according to their role in the set of all possible cascading failures scenarios and quantifying their contribution through a criticality index hence we refer to the behavioral profiles proposed by 15 23 as follow aggressive profile component or subsystem that tends to be a cascade failure initiator diffuser profile component or subsystem that contributes to the propagation of cascade failures sensitive profile component or subsystem that suffers cascading failures at the end of the chain assuming that an aggressive profile is more critical than a diffuser profile which is itself more critical than a sensitive one each of the aforementioned categories is weighted using the rank sum weight formula proposed by 35 the criticality indexes for each behavioral profile are finally given as follows 1 i c agressive 0 5 n u m b er occurenc e aggressive 2 i c diffuser 0 33 n u m b er occurenc e diffuser 3 i c sensitive 0 17 n u m b er occurenc e sensitive finally the global criticality index of each component is given as 4 i c global i c agressive i c diffuser i c sensitive 4 2 4 additional relevant criteria for risk assessment in addition to risk quantification other criteria can be integrated to address different aspects of risk mitigation planning and operational preferences of the ci s managers see 8 9 for example the following criteria can be considered damage cost dc this criterion quantifies the financial loss that the ci manager would suffer if a component is damaged due to a major flood time to restore rebuild a damaged component tr this criterion estimates the time necessary to restore a damaged component to service or to rebuild it identically obviously it is worth noting that these criteria are not restrictive and can be adjusted according to the nature of the ci and the preferences of its managers 4 2 5 identification of relevant safety barriers following this first phase of multi criteria characterization of the relative criticality of the ci s components we proceed to the identification of the relevant safety barriers in this respect the risk management standards distinguish between different types of safety barriers 10 33 34 in our research we use the following typology see table 3 which is adapted to our object of study therefore we propose to identify the safety barriers for each component vulnerable to flooding as well as the cost required for their implementation a survey of the various possible safety barriers was conducted with the ratp s committee of experts in order to identify all the global and local safety barriers that could be implemented these barriers include mobile protections to prevent water ingress dismantling of sensitive equipment reinforcement of the tunnel s supporting structure against hydrostatic pressure etc innovative and complementary safety barriers to those identified by the committee of experts were also selected on the basis of feedback from the reconstructions in new york prague and tokyo 9 4 2 6 aggregation of the risk quantification criteria using the topsis method under this section we position ourselves as a ci s manager decision maker whose objective is to optimize the allocation of financial resources to reduce the overall vulnerability of the cis to flooding therefore the decision aid problem we are dealing with consists of identifying the best safety barriers for mitigating the quantified risks our objective is therefore to sort from the most useful to the least useful the different barriers according to the multi criteria characterization of the relative criticality of the ci s components carried out in the previous steps accordingly we use the topsis method 20 in order to derive a utility function by aggregating the retained criteria according to the preferences of the decision makers this method consists of identifying a compromise solution that is as close as possible to the ideal solution for which all the relevant criteria are optimal and as far as possible from the worst solution for which these latter criteria are the least optimal the interested reader can find more details on the application of the topsis method in 19 20 finally it should be pointed out that given the nature of the considered criteria the utility function derived by the topsis method is an aggregation of the individual risk level that will be reduced by the implementation of an identified safety barrier in the remainder of this paper we will note r i this utility function and r the overall decreased risk such as r r i 4 2 7 the optimal allocation of safety barriers considering budgetary constraints while the utility function r derived by the topsis method in the previous section allows us to establish a classification among the possible options in terms of reducing cis vulnerabilities to flooding it does not nevertheless provide insight into the best way to optimize the allocation of these options hence to take into account the utility of each safety barrier to maximize risk reduction and to respect budgetary constraints we combine the result of the multi criteria analysis with a mathematical optimization model we therefore formulate our problem as a mono objective knapsack to maximize risk reduction under the constraint of an available budget limit in this case each criterion is weighted according to its relative importance and then aggregated with the other criteria which makes it possible to transform the multi objective optimization problem into a single objective optimization proble the mathematical formulation of our problem is as follows 5 max r m a x x i r i 6 x i c i c x i 0 1 i 1 2 n x i t h e c a n d i d a t e s a f e t y b a r r i e r r i t h e d e c r e a s e d r i s k b y x i c i t h e c o s t o f i m p l e m e n t i n g x i c t h e a v a i l a b l e b u d g e t 5 application of the approach 5 1 functional analysis and cascading failure scenario we illustrate our approach via an implementation for an urban rail system such as ratp sncf exposed to the risk of flooding the studied system is composed of a station as well as two neighbouring half inter stations it is a generic system that can easily be transposed to more or less extended real cases the research was carried out with the help of several engineers specialized in rail infrastructure asset management the relevant granularity for our study being that of the component for each of the subsystems selected we identified all of these components and carried out the functional analysis for the sake of clarity we do not detail here the development of the functional analysis and the fmea and we content ourselves with explaining our approach for the low voltage power supply subsystem see table 5 the approach was applied in a similar way to the other subsystems based on the fmea we then build cascading failure scenarios table 6 these then enable cascading failure profiles 5 2 decision support for the selection of safety barriers the topsis method is then used to calculate the utility of each barrier aggregated risk avoided for all aggregated criteria except for the cost criterion table 7 in order to choose the best set of barriers we use the knapsack optimisation method which includes the cost necessary to implement each barrier the aim is to optimise the allocation of safety barriers while taking into account the usefulness of each barrier in reducing risk the cost of implementing it and the financial resources available for the reliability process we assume here that the urban rail network manager has a budget of 5 million euros after calculation the result of the optimisation proposes to retain 36 reliability solutions among the 73 solutions identified with an overall cost of 4 926 360 euros and a residual risk of 0 47 initial risk 5 078 ie residual risk of 9 fig 4 the reliability solutions selected for the low voltage power supply subsystem are highlighted in grey in table 7 the curve fig 4 of the cost function illustrates the cumulative investment costs relative to the deployment of each barrier this curve shows then the cumulative cost versus deployed safety barriers the curve risk fig 4 shows the reduction of the aggregated risk versus the cumulative investment cost in this figure there no direct link between the individual deployed barriers and the risk reduction this is why there is no match between the deployed barriers and the end of the curve 6 conclusions in this article we have proposed to study the prospects for operationalizing the concept of build back better for parisian critical infrastructures after defining and highlighting the interest of the build back better concept we conducted a survey of engineers specializing in the asset management of critical infrastructures at the end of these discussions it appeared that the post flood phase can be an opportunity to make significant improvements to damaged infrastructure and networks especially if the reconstruction process is anticipated and planned in advance nevertheless it was identified that it was a priority to have a tool to help reduce vulnerabilities that can also be used in the prevention phase and it is in this sense that our research was then oriented in this sense we have proposed a methodological approach combining risk analysis and multi criteria optimization methods with the aim of optimizing the allocation of safety barriers likely to reduce the vulnerability of cis faced with the risk of flooding the implementation of the proposed method makes it possible to plan the investments necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the infrastructures taking into account in particular the cost of the infrastructures likely to be damaged their criticality vis à vis the operation of the network the type of security barrier passive active etc the time required to restore the infrastructure to service and the manager s budget very promising the method could be implemented on an increasing number of case studies allowing its robustness to be tested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20092,in this paper we propose to study the operational interest of the build back better concept bbb and highlighting its importance in mitigating risks and improving the resilience of critical infrastructures in the paris region to flood risk during the recovery and the reconstruction phases based on an in depth examination of the bbb concept and its relevance to risk management we propose an adapted methodological approach suitable for the paris region critical infrastructures finally the approach initially designed for a reconstruction context is implemented to reduce the vulnerabilities of infrastructures in the prevention phase we then talk about build better before and present here a development in this sense our proposed framework is structured into two major axes risk quantification and decision support for the multi criteria optimization of the investments required to mitigate the quantified risks with this in mind we first propose to develop an fmea failure mode and effects analysis in order to identify and formalize the direct and indirect vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures in a flooding context the output of the risk assessment is then used within a multi criteria optimization framework for optimal risk reduction under budget constraints keywords building back better critical infrastructures flooding ile de france region risk analysis multicriteria decision aid data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 natural disasters and the need for a paradigm shift the total loss resulting from natural disasters reached 5 trillion over the period 1980 2019 of which 1092 billion was caused by flooding alone even more alarming is the fact that the effect of climate change would accentuate the occurrence of extreme precipitation events that could lead to even greater economic losses 28 in light of the damage caused by natural disasters in general and floods in particular it seems that more efforts are still needed to reduce the vulnerabilities of our territories to ensure their resilience and sustainability moreover and if these disasters are logically perceived as negative the post disaster period can be a real opportunity to rebuild and rethink our societies and territories in a safer perspective through the implementation of vulnerability reduction actions aiming at achieving a better resilience of the territory in the long term 6 for this reason the sendai framework 2015 2030 adopted at the third united nations world conference on disaster risk reduction explicitly put forward the concept of building back better as a matter of fact the 4th priority action defined within the framework of this program is to strengthen disaster preparedness to respond effectively and to build back better during the phases of recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction 39 hence the framework suggests a paradigm shift that relies on the reconstruction and the recovery processes to improve the physical social environmental and economic conditions of an urban system to make it more resilient to future disasters 26 it is therefore interesting to discuss the definitions of bbb and how they could be integrated into the natural risk management process we propose in this research to take the case of critical infrastructures ci cis represent major elements of urban vulnerability and resilience 2 ci includes the physical and computer service networks facilities assets necessary for the proper functioning of a society and its economy 16 the vulnerabilities of these networks are unfortunately multiplied by interdependencies that can generate cascading effects thus many critical infrastructures can become inoperable in the event of power cuts communication or transport failures etc ci becomes even more critical in times of natural disaster as its failure can significantly threaten first responder deployment and emergency management services 23 the importance of ci further extends into the recovery and reconstruction phases of the affected territories in fact the recovery phase begins with the restoration of damaged ci networks several studies used the re establishment of ci networks and their return to normal functioning as indicators for measuring the resilience and recovery of societies 11 in order to operationalize the concept of bbb and to ensure its effective implementation it is necessary to establish a common and shared definition of build back better bbb among the different stakeholders involved in the recovery and the reconstruction processes in this regard 32 maintains that the concept is good in theory but faces the same difficulties as the concept of resilience struggling to find any operational application this is due in particular to the polysemy of the term and the wide range of the possible interpretations that could be made of it reconstructing what and better in what understanding to this end the first part of this paper introduces the concept of bbb and focuses on its potential added value to the disaster risk management cycle sections 2 and 3 shed light on the operational practices of ile de france cis managers in terms of flood risk management with a view to analyzing the relevance of integrating the bbb concept as a resilience driver for these cis section 4 is devoted to the development of our proposed methodology for implementing bbb for cis finally the conclusions are outlined in section 5 2 the concept of building back better a definition of the concept and territorial operationalization s perspectives in the lack of a common and agreed upon definition build back better bbb remains a vague term used to express a wide range of ideas 25 the term better is itself interpreted in different ways 22 since it could refer to a recomposition of the affected territory that promotes security resilience economic development environmental issues etc nevertheless and despite this semantic vagueness there seems to be a consensus in the institutional definitions proposed by the unisdr a a unisdr united nations office for disaster risk reduction and gfdrr b b gfdrr global facility for disaster reduction and recovery we recall these definitions here and adopt them in the rest of this paper 2 1 building back better a definition of the concept the unisdr defines build back better as the use of the recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction phases to improve the resilience of affected nations and communities through the integration of risk reduction measures 39 similarly the gfdrr defines bbb as a disaster recovery approach that aims to reduce vulnerability to future disasters and that aspires to improve a community s resilience to better rebound after physical social and economic shocks thus recovery within a bbb framework presents an opportunity for disaster affected communities to reduce their existing and foreseeable vulnerabilities in this context and in the wake of the hurricanes that hit the caribbean in 2017 the gfdrr recalls the need for a paradigm shift by considering the recovery phase as a catalyst to better rebuild the affected territories through the integration of three interdependent pillars see fig 1 build back stronger build back faster and build back more inclusively 18 der sarkissian et al 11 propose bbb indicators focusing on critical infrastructure in particular urban networks including 1 resilience aspects indicators responding to exposure to hazards vulnerabilities lack of redundancy lack of robustness slow recovery speeds and high interdependency levels 2 environmental and sustainability indicators 3 socioeconomic development indicators it is clear from these definitions that the bbb raises the question of better adaptation to identified risks depending on the objects considered it can also be an opportunity to carry out innovative processes of consultation with the populations to improve the environmental or technical performance of the infrastructures hence the post disaster phase can be a window of opportunity for initiating new urban dynamics to improve the resilience and to reduce the vulnerability of risk prone territories this phase seems to present in fact a concomitance of factors favorable to initiate virtuous processes of risk management such as the reactivation of the memory of risk the de compartmentalization between the different actors who decide to collaborate and to work together and above all the mobilization of exceptional monetary funds for reconstruction 27 therefore the concept of build back better seems to refer to an ideal approach to post disaster reconstruction that aspires to create a new state of normality that is better than the one that existed before a disaster occurred potentially contradictory dimensions of build back better are emerging how to rebuild better and faster at the same time how to arbitrate between the budgets allocated to a rapid provisional return to service of infrastructures and those allocated to a less vulnerable and or more efficient reconstruction it can thus be assumed that definitions of the bbb vary according to the context and the actors considered in this article we position ourselves as a critical infrastructure manager wishing to anticipate post flood reconstruction as we will see later our study context has led us to focus our research towards vulnerability reduction 2 2 the bbb which position within the cycle of natural risk management as it is not an isolated phase of the disaster risk management cycle see fig 2 post disaster reconstruction is conditioned by the risk prevention and mitigation strategies deployed in a territory in fact it should be highlighted that the reconstruction process fills a central position in the recovery process which in turn is embedded in a longer and more complex dynamic namely the disaster risk management cycle 17 31 the management of natural hazards is often schematized by a cycle commonly referred to as the disaster risk management cycle 4 this concept was first introduced by 3 who identified four phases to describe the risk management process this cyclical representation relies on the principle that risks do not dissipate at the end of a disaster and that a risk prone territory must remain in a state of constant preparedness for an eventual future disastrous event 6 although the terminology may differ from one author to another two phases can be distinguished in the disaster risk management cycle pre disaster and post disaster phases which are separated by the occurrence of a shock the disaster while the pre disaster phase represents the normal functioning of a territory the post disaster phase is characterized by i a short term period in which the emphasis is on making people and property safe and on implementing effective solutions to mitigate the damage caused by the shock and by ii a medium to a long term period in which the impacted urban system must be reconstructed the post disaster phase can thus be subdivided into a response sub phase and a recovery sub phase the response sub phase it takes place just after the occurrence of a disaster it includes all measures taken during or directly after a shock to save lives minimize physical damage or to improve the recovery process 7 24 the recovery sub phase it is the final stage in the disaster risk management cycle the recovery of an affected territory involves ensuring a rapid return to normality in the short term and a reduction of vulnerabilities in the medium and the long term 24 moreover it must be noted that there are two possible options for rebuilding a territory in the recovery sub phase the first variant consists of repairing the damaged facilities and infrastructures and restoring them to a level similar to the pre disaster level identical reconstruction which may lead to reproducing the same vulnerabilities in the territory the second variant of reconstruction on the other hand aims to improve the pre disaster conditions and to rebuild better by integrating measures for risk reduction and for integrating other considerations such as energy efficiency urban integration and sustainable development 14 in this second case we can then speak of build back better 2 3 bbb the need for ex ante planning and risk anticipation to avoid replicating the same vulnerabilities it is essential to plan the reconstruction process before a disaster occurs in order to identify the appropriate levers for the recovery of a territory this is why pre disaster recovery planning for reconstruction and recovery is a prerequisite and a logical step towards ensuring that communities build back better following a natural disaster 18 21 this proactive approach is aiming at identifying the relevant structural and non structural actions necessary for risk mitigation by analyzing different disaster scenarios to this end several governments and agencies have begun to develop ex ante recovery plans and guides to better prepare and anticipate the reconstruction phase the table 1 provides an overview of the recovery plans prepared by some territories the pre disaster planning approach can be applied theoretically at various scales to all aspects of post disaster recovery this being said we believe that another sine qua none condition for the effective operationalization of the bbb concept consists of an in depth analysis of the flood related risks for the urban territory as a whole and more specifically for the urban object under study the risk management strategies deployed to mitigate the risks should also be considered and evaluated in this regard being particularly interested in the resilience of the ile de france region s cis in the context of a major flooding event the following section of our paper recalls the challenges of a major flood in the ile de france region as well as its impacts on the territory and its infrastructures and the flood risk management strategies being considered by the cis managers the elements presented in the following section are mainly the findings of bibliographical research and interviews with some of ile de france s cis managers 3 a territorial approach for bbb ile de france region s cis in a flooding context 3 1 ile de france flooding context vulnerabilities of cis vs prevention and mitigation strategies the effect of a major flood in ile de france is one of the three most feared natural hazards in france a major flood of the seine and its tributaries could generate direct damage costing up to 30 billion euros according to the different flood scenarios 29 30 the cis in the ile de france region are particularly vulnerable to flooding and could suffer considerable damage 29 30 accordingly it is estimated that the indirect impacts of flooding particularly concerning the malfunctioning of these cis could reach 50 billion euros in this respect and to mitigate these potential damages the cis managers are deploying strategies aiming mainly at limiting the damage to their infrastructures to restore them to service as soon as possible after the flooding 38 these mitigation and protection strategies are justified by the fact that the proper functioning of cis relies on subsystems and components that are not adapted to submersion by water and even less to a long submersion as could be the case in a centennial flood scenario as an example the proper functioning of the power distribution network is highly dependent on the reliability of the feeder stations and the high voltage low voltage substations which are highly sensitive to water similarly the majority of railway infrastructures such as signaling and switching equipment are very sensitive to water contact which makes the ratp c c régie autonome des transport parisien metro system and sncf d d société nationale des chemins de fer français national railway network urban transport networks highly vulnerable in the event of flooding according to toubin 37 local regulations 12 require public transport network managers and fluid distributors water energy to analyse their vulnerability and integrate into their projects all suitable constructive provisions aimed at allowing normal operation of the lines or at the very least to withstand prolonged immersion for several days without structural damage and restarting activity as quickly as possible after the water has left these vulnerabilities alongside the corresponding protective measures determine the extent of the damage to the cis and highlight a possible way of operationalizing the bbb concept for these latter here we can see the concerns and contradictions raised by the injunctions to resilience and the bbb knowing that a major flood will occur sooner or later it may be important to have a tool that allows the best choices to be made for reconstruction in a context of great tension with the desire to rebuild as quickly as possible while reducing current vulnerabilities 3 2 the post flood reconstruction of cis in ile de france what operational reality the prevention and mitigation strategies mentioned above have led all cis managers to develop investment plans that aim to reduce the vulnerability of their critical assets in a preventive approach interviews with several of them one for each network mentioned allowed us to describe the nature of their plans in table 2 the interviewees were all engineers in charge of protecting a specific network from flood risk hydraulic project manager business manager and plan for flood protection responsible for security and risk management or head of mission flood impact assessment these investment plans are essentially self funded and are conducted over the long term between 5 and 15 years as part of a proactive and preventive logic that can be described as build better before building back better ile de france cis in a flooding context would rather be interpreted from the perspective of planning a better adaptation of the vulnerable sub systems and not a reconstruction in the strict sense of the term the damage to infrastructures would be very limited it would seem that only a small number of components in the floodplain are likely to require repair or replacement indeed the spatial extent of the feared floods generally covers only a small part of the network lines and given the slow rise of the water a large part of the most sensitive equipment can be dismantled 1 38 as a result cis managers do not primarily fear large scale structural ruin phenomena yet in addition to occasional structural disorders a large number of sensitive equipment could be impacted in fact instead of waiting for the occurrence of a major flood suffering damages and then thinking about how to better rebuild these infrastructures cis managers undertake preventing flood protection investments to the extent that this is technically and economically possible and prefer in the event of a major flood to implement dismantling dewatering and safeguard measures to restart rapidly after the recession of waters 3 3 conclusion a perspective of operationalizing the bbb concept for ile de france cis in a flooding context in view of the findings drawn up in the previous sections we question the priority of needs in terms of tools to improve the resilience of parisian critical infrastructures and the possible perspectives of operationalizing the bbb concept for the ile de france region cis in fact the term building back does not seem the most appropriate for the case of parisian critical infrastructures given the prevention and mitigation strategies deployed by their managers hence risk management in the post flooding phase and more specifically in the recovery sub phase will essentially consist of actions aiming at restoring rehabilitating and adapting the most vulnerable equipment it therefore appears to be a priority to propose an approach adapted to the reduction of ex ante vulnerabilities likely to provide elements that are also useful in the ex post reconstruction phase or even to be used in this context we will therefore use the term building back better in its broad understanding which will encompass any action or measure aiming at reducing vulnerabilities and improving the resilience of a ci strongly linked to the concept of build back better which is its starting point our approach can be assimilated to the build better before 40 in this respect the remainder of this paper will focus on developing an approach for ex ante planning of vulnerability reduction measures our approach is intended as a decision making tool for quantifying risks and optimizing investments that can be deployed in prevention and mitigation or if not possible during the recovery phase depending on the economic conjuncture and the decision makers preferences finally and for ease of reading this article is limited to a brief illustrated presentation of the implementation of our approach readers interested in these details as well as in practical applications can consult 8 9 4 a comprehensive framework for building back better ile de france s cis 4 1 overview of the methodological approach our proposed methodology has two building blocks i risk analysis and ii decision support for the multi criteria optimization of the investments required to mitigate the quantified risks fig 3 in the first building block risk analysis we propose to identify the failure modes of the components of a ci by carrying out a functional analysis followed by a failure mode and effects analysis fmea in addition since interdependencies between the components of a critical infrastructure are a key factor in the propagation of cascading failures we introduce the criticality index as a criterion to quantify each component s contribution to the set of all possible cascading failure scenarios moreover we also integrate other criteria that may be relevant in the risk management process and that may differ from one ci to another according to the nature of its subsystems components and the preferences of its managers subsequently we analyze the possible adaptation solutions for mitigating the quantified risks in the previous steps in this respect we present a generic typology of safety barriers that can be implemented for ile de france s cis table 3 the second building block of our approach multicriteria optimization provides decision making support concerning the optimal allocation of safety barriers to mitigating risks on the basis of the undertaken risk assessment we derive a utility function of each potential safety barrier which reflects its impact on risk reduction to this end a total aggregation method topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to derive the utility function of each safety barrier by combining the different criteria retained according to the preferences of the decision makers finally we combine the result of the multi criteria analysis with a mathematical optimization model in particular the knapsack model in order to take into account the different criteria related to risk mitigation the budgetary constraints faced by ci managers and the need to optimize the allocation of financial resources the methodological building blocks fig 3 of our approach are explained more in detail in the following sections 4 2 focus on the framework 4 2 1 functional analysis as a basis for risk analysis in our approach a functional analysis of the ci of interest is first carried out to identify its subsystems and components as well as the possible interactions between them this first step of functional analysis is a prerequisite for the development of the dysfunctional model of a ci in a flooding event 15 to this end we proceed in two phases we establish an exhaustive inventory of the critical infrastructure s subsystems and components and then we identify the elements of the external environment that could cause their failure subsequently functional dependencies between the subsystems under study are mapped in the form of an adjacency matrix according to the following formalism if there is a dependency relationship between the two components i and j cell i j takes the value 1 otherwise 0 4 2 2 risk analysis thanks to its exhaustiveness the established functional model helps to map the different interactions and interdependencies between the components of the ci by confronting these characteristics with the potential impacts of flooding both the causes and the direct and cascading effects of the failure of each component can be assessed the results of this analysis are compiled in an fmea listing the sub systems of the ci and their components the failures causes of each component and the effects of their failures see table 4 the results of the fmea are then used for the construction of cascading failures scenarios as developed in the following section 4 2 3 determination of the cascading failures profiles to overcome the limits of the fmea in explicitly considering the cascading failures caused by each component we propose in our framework to determine the behavioral profile of each component according to their role in the set of all possible cascading failures scenarios and quantifying their contribution through a criticality index hence we refer to the behavioral profiles proposed by 15 23 as follow aggressive profile component or subsystem that tends to be a cascade failure initiator diffuser profile component or subsystem that contributes to the propagation of cascade failures sensitive profile component or subsystem that suffers cascading failures at the end of the chain assuming that an aggressive profile is more critical than a diffuser profile which is itself more critical than a sensitive one each of the aforementioned categories is weighted using the rank sum weight formula proposed by 35 the criticality indexes for each behavioral profile are finally given as follows 1 i c agressive 0 5 n u m b er occurenc e aggressive 2 i c diffuser 0 33 n u m b er occurenc e diffuser 3 i c sensitive 0 17 n u m b er occurenc e sensitive finally the global criticality index of each component is given as 4 i c global i c agressive i c diffuser i c sensitive 4 2 4 additional relevant criteria for risk assessment in addition to risk quantification other criteria can be integrated to address different aspects of risk mitigation planning and operational preferences of the ci s managers see 8 9 for example the following criteria can be considered damage cost dc this criterion quantifies the financial loss that the ci manager would suffer if a component is damaged due to a major flood time to restore rebuild a damaged component tr this criterion estimates the time necessary to restore a damaged component to service or to rebuild it identically obviously it is worth noting that these criteria are not restrictive and can be adjusted according to the nature of the ci and the preferences of its managers 4 2 5 identification of relevant safety barriers following this first phase of multi criteria characterization of the relative criticality of the ci s components we proceed to the identification of the relevant safety barriers in this respect the risk management standards distinguish between different types of safety barriers 10 33 34 in our research we use the following typology see table 3 which is adapted to our object of study therefore we propose to identify the safety barriers for each component vulnerable to flooding as well as the cost required for their implementation a survey of the various possible safety barriers was conducted with the ratp s committee of experts in order to identify all the global and local safety barriers that could be implemented these barriers include mobile protections to prevent water ingress dismantling of sensitive equipment reinforcement of the tunnel s supporting structure against hydrostatic pressure etc innovative and complementary safety barriers to those identified by the committee of experts were also selected on the basis of feedback from the reconstructions in new york prague and tokyo 9 4 2 6 aggregation of the risk quantification criteria using the topsis method under this section we position ourselves as a ci s manager decision maker whose objective is to optimize the allocation of financial resources to reduce the overall vulnerability of the cis to flooding therefore the decision aid problem we are dealing with consists of identifying the best safety barriers for mitigating the quantified risks our objective is therefore to sort from the most useful to the least useful the different barriers according to the multi criteria characterization of the relative criticality of the ci s components carried out in the previous steps accordingly we use the topsis method 20 in order to derive a utility function by aggregating the retained criteria according to the preferences of the decision makers this method consists of identifying a compromise solution that is as close as possible to the ideal solution for which all the relevant criteria are optimal and as far as possible from the worst solution for which these latter criteria are the least optimal the interested reader can find more details on the application of the topsis method in 19 20 finally it should be pointed out that given the nature of the considered criteria the utility function derived by the topsis method is an aggregation of the individual risk level that will be reduced by the implementation of an identified safety barrier in the remainder of this paper we will note r i this utility function and r the overall decreased risk such as r r i 4 2 7 the optimal allocation of safety barriers considering budgetary constraints while the utility function r derived by the topsis method in the previous section allows us to establish a classification among the possible options in terms of reducing cis vulnerabilities to flooding it does not nevertheless provide insight into the best way to optimize the allocation of these options hence to take into account the utility of each safety barrier to maximize risk reduction and to respect budgetary constraints we combine the result of the multi criteria analysis with a mathematical optimization model we therefore formulate our problem as a mono objective knapsack to maximize risk reduction under the constraint of an available budget limit in this case each criterion is weighted according to its relative importance and then aggregated with the other criteria which makes it possible to transform the multi objective optimization problem into a single objective optimization proble the mathematical formulation of our problem is as follows 5 max r m a x x i r i 6 x i c i c x i 0 1 i 1 2 n x i t h e c a n d i d a t e s a f e t y b a r r i e r r i t h e d e c r e a s e d r i s k b y x i c i t h e c o s t o f i m p l e m e n t i n g x i c t h e a v a i l a b l e b u d g e t 5 application of the approach 5 1 functional analysis and cascading failure scenario we illustrate our approach via an implementation for an urban rail system such as ratp sncf exposed to the risk of flooding the studied system is composed of a station as well as two neighbouring half inter stations it is a generic system that can easily be transposed to more or less extended real cases the research was carried out with the help of several engineers specialized in rail infrastructure asset management the relevant granularity for our study being that of the component for each of the subsystems selected we identified all of these components and carried out the functional analysis for the sake of clarity we do not detail here the development of the functional analysis and the fmea and we content ourselves with explaining our approach for the low voltage power supply subsystem see table 5 the approach was applied in a similar way to the other subsystems based on the fmea we then build cascading failure scenarios table 6 these then enable cascading failure profiles 5 2 decision support for the selection of safety barriers the topsis method is then used to calculate the utility of each barrier aggregated risk avoided for all aggregated criteria except for the cost criterion table 7 in order to choose the best set of barriers we use the knapsack optimisation method which includes the cost necessary to implement each barrier the aim is to optimise the allocation of safety barriers while taking into account the usefulness of each barrier in reducing risk the cost of implementing it and the financial resources available for the reliability process we assume here that the urban rail network manager has a budget of 5 million euros after calculation the result of the optimisation proposes to retain 36 reliability solutions among the 73 solutions identified with an overall cost of 4 926 360 euros and a residual risk of 0 47 initial risk 5 078 ie residual risk of 9 fig 4 the reliability solutions selected for the low voltage power supply subsystem are highlighted in grey in table 7 the curve fig 4 of the cost function illustrates the cumulative investment costs relative to the deployment of each barrier this curve shows then the cumulative cost versus deployed safety barriers the curve risk fig 4 shows the reduction of the aggregated risk versus the cumulative investment cost in this figure there no direct link between the individual deployed barriers and the risk reduction this is why there is no match between the deployed barriers and the end of the curve 6 conclusions in this article we have proposed to study the prospects for operationalizing the concept of build back better for parisian critical infrastructures after defining and highlighting the interest of the build back better concept we conducted a survey of engineers specializing in the asset management of critical infrastructures at the end of these discussions it appeared that the post flood phase can be an opportunity to make significant improvements to damaged infrastructure and networks especially if the reconstruction process is anticipated and planned in advance nevertheless it was identified that it was a priority to have a tool to help reduce vulnerabilities that can also be used in the prevention phase and it is in this sense that our research was then oriented in this sense we have proposed a methodological approach combining risk analysis and multi criteria optimization methods with the aim of optimizing the allocation of safety barriers likely to reduce the vulnerability of cis faced with the risk of flooding the implementation of the proposed method makes it possible to plan the investments necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the infrastructures taking into account in particular the cost of the infrastructures likely to be damaged their criticality vis à vis the operation of the network the type of security barrier passive active etc the time required to restore the infrastructure to service and the manager s budget very promising the method could be implemented on an increasing number of case studies allowing its robustness to be tested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20093,water security has emerged as a leading framework for water governance that integrates socio politico economic and physical attributes and is readily operationalized yet in transboundary river basins it is unclear to what extent water security framings have any resonance we examine how water security has been employed in transboundary water research over the past decade we find a water security framing bolsters established governance approaches at the river basin scale but also advances new avenues that 1 re examine the scope of local national and non state governance capacity or 2 extend beyond river basin boundaries and outside the water sector we examine conceptual and scalar challenges and limitations for transboundary water security applications and highlight opportunities to expand beyond the river basin as the dominant focus for transboundary water governance keywords water security transboundary river basin scale governance securitization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water security where every person has access to enough safe water at affordable cost to lead a clean healthy and productive life while ensuring that the natural environment is protected and enhanced 48 integrates diverse socio politico economic and physical attributes to holistically represent the multidimensional challenges of water supply use and access for communities and countries the rise to prominence of water security as a leading paradigm for water governance reflects a broad shift toward soft path inclusive approaches 7 121 responding to this trend studies have examined how water security is utilized in research and practice 21 144 43 questioned its various uses and interpretations 144 122 21 and identified gaps in practical applications 8 68 however attention to its application in transboundary water contexts is limited yet the challenges of achieving water security are particularly salient in transboundary contexts where vulnerability and complexity are high 75 with more than 2 7 billion people worldwide who depend on resources from transboundary river basins 29 water security in transboundary contexts has far reaching impacts on individual and community livelihoods regional development and human environment relations however the nature of transboundary water challenges that contribute to water security can vary dramatically in different sociopolitical contexts and geographic locations 4 international development banks and ngos increasingly support cooperation among nations by funding the development of institutions to govern shared water resources in transboundary basins 54 which further shapes governance processes and how water is experienced and realized by individuals and communities given the relative human dependency on transboundary waters 1 1 by transboundary waters we are referring primarily to international river basins and cross border aquifers however we also acknowledge the importance of less traditional transboundary contexts such as interbasin transfers and virtual water exports by choosing to use this broad term and the growing investment in international basin scale water management this paper explores how water security is evoked and utilized in the transboundary water context and what this means for water governance practices more broadly although theoretically conceived as an approach that can be applied at many different geographic scales the utility and benefit of a water security framing at the transboundary scale remains unclear this paper asks amidst established discourse and practice of transboundary water governance how does a water security framing help us approach transboundary water challenges we are especially interested in how water security is used to frame problems and solutions to water management we use the term framing to refer to how an issue is defined including what is emphasized and de emphasized in its definition 30 in the context of transboundary water resources scholars have explored how framings either highlight or obscure the dynamics of state relations 146 147 or how they reinforce certain types of challenges 84 45 use of a particular framing has implications for how societal challenges are addressed through policy based solutions 115 the use of scale to frame problems and solutions also has implications for the range of actors involved and solutions available to address the problem 71 we begin by briefly tracing the evolution of water security and transboundary water governance to provide background and context to our analysis recent studies show despite a significant an overlap in the disciplinary reach of these topic areas limited work has been conducted that combines these fields 28 after exploring conceptual developments we examine case studies that explicitly utilize a water security framing in a transboundary context employing a geographical lens we investigate 1 how water security is conceived of and used to frame transboundary water challenges and solutions and 2 how water security framings address hydrologic and administrative scale 2 2 hydrologic scale refers to the geographic or spatial extent of a watershed or basin administrative scale refers to both the political level of administration e g municipal state national international and the geographic extent of these jurisdictions we discuss ways that a water security framing contributes to regional cooperative approaches to transboundary water governance and reveal how researchers are utilizing water security to advance broad perspectives related to scale cross sector linkages and non state actors after examining the implications of these evolving approaches for water security and transboundary water governance we highlight promising pathways toward transboundary water security 2 water security and transboundary waters 2 1 the rise of water security water security shares conceptual roots with security theory by the late 1980s realist foreign policy experts were linking state security to control over key water resources suggesting for example that limited freshwater resources would lead to conflict among nations 114 57 broader efforts by scholars to rethink and expand the concept of security to include social economic and natural resource issues led to approaches to securitize environmental issues and notions of wars being fought over water in the future 121 3 3 for a more complete chronology of the concept of water security readers might refer to 5 and 113 when securitized water resource issues are treated as an existential threat through issue framing and speech acts 125 in an international context securitization moves water out of the realm of normal politics where negotiation and cooperation are useful and instead promotes state centric zero sum approaches aimed at safeguarding national resources 16 extreme measures or strategic actions by high ranking officials are justified through narratives and discourse that create a sense of danger and urgency 1 9 such approaches can limit international cooperation by impeding negotiation and compromise 93 desecuritization or downgrading water from a threat to a valuable resource 17 is normatively considered more effective for transboundary resource governance because it favors building international institutional capacity enhanced cooperation and transparency 1 in some cases securitization can help motivate policy change by bringing water issues to the attention of decision makers and galvanizing public support or resources 36 overlaid on these conceptual roots a shift in global water governance toward soft path approaches participation and interconnectedness gave rise to a new post realist framing of water security over the past two decades as a leading paradigm for water governance 121 this broad notion of water security was influenced not only by notions of national security but of human security which emphasizes poverty reduction livelihoods and economic development and global security which highlights global interconnections among natural resources climate change and economic systems 25 scholars have debated its use contrasting narrow reductionist approaches with broad integrated applications 21 144 and critiqued its multiple ambiguous and sometimes conflicting definitions and usages 5 7 43 narrow framings of water security might employ for example fixed water allocations 144 quantitative tools to assess water availability versus demand 55 or water scarcity 34 or simplified indices to quantify water security at national 69 and regional levels 10 as an alternative to realist foreign policy approaches these approaches illustrate the lingering notion of how securing water supplies might invoke rigid metrics or hard path approaches to increasing water supplies e g via built infrastructure and the idea that water insecurities can be managed in a limited and targeted fashion 68 in transboundary basins water resources and security are more closely intertwined because actions by one nation such as pollution of waterways water overuse or border infrastructure that obstructs water systems can impact another nation s water resources 121 notions of water security in international contexts are often linked with traditional approaches to international relations that stress the role of the state in securing a nation s population from threat or vulnerability 60 in international law notions of conflict and tension continue to shape discussions of water security and state sovereignty has remained central to discussions of water security through the role of nation states as the main players in international water treaties and the positioning of international watercourses the primary scale of focus 23 but in shared river basins pursuing water security on a national basis may advance water security for some but not all riparian states involved this paradox can arise at multiple scales security for some can ultimately mean insecurity for others 31 increasingly researchers call for a broader approach to water security that is interdisciplinary and inclusive 21 144 heeding these calls recent research ascribes to broad notions of human and environmental security that integrate soft path approaches such as improved governance hydro diplomacy and community based strategies that go beyond procuring physical supplies 74 7 103 these approaches address multiple domains of water including equitable water access and ecosystem water needs 48 119 protection from floods and drought 51 sanitation 119 policy 97 global change and resilience 108 and cultural values 61 this breadth of approaches reflects how different contexts often require different paths to achieving water security 40 while calls for broad inclusive framings of water security pervade the literature it is unclear to what extent these framings have been adopted or have any resonance in transboundary contexts 2 2 transboundary water governance do transboundary water interactions result in conflict or cooperation this question has guided transboundary water research for decades early research linking water scarcity with international conflict led to the argument which was dominant for some time that water scarcity would lead to international conflict or water wars 47 by linking water to national security these studies highlight the role of the nation state in safeguarding water supplies such as protection of water resources infrastructure from acts of war vandalism securing specific water resources source locations using legal mechanisms to treat water as an object of absolute territorial sovereignty securing water supplies via entitlements or developing new supplies via technological approaches and innovation 109 78 in these cases state control of water resources is seen as necessary for national survival and threatened by the physical socio economic and political interdependencies of transboundary basins 36 in the late 1990s wolf and colleagues 132 offered an alternative view by cataloguing the occurrence of conflict and international agreements throughout history revealing that nations were more likely to cooperate over shared water resources than resort to militaristic or violent conflict after this studies of transboundary water focused on examining mechanisms and proponents of cooperation 88 133 and frames of resource securitization were less commonly used for a period of time other transboundary water research examines the rise in cooperative efforts and institutional development at the river basin scale over the past several decades aimed at promoting joint management and protection of international rivers 20 42 cooperation is marked by the signing of international water treaties and formation of river basin organizations both serve as mechanisms to share benefits develop and protect resources and share information 133 106 treaties and customary international norms also enable countries to manage conflicts with formal agreements 135 unsurprisingly these regional cooperative approaches focus on the scale of the river basin in much of the transboundary water literature the basin is considered the ideal scale for water management 90 it provides a tool for coordinating among multiple governance levels 97 and serves as a platform for joint monitoring stakeholder engagement and decision making 103 however integrated programs and goals designed at the river basin level can be difficult to implement if they conflict with national priorities or if local administrations lack necessary political authority or institutional capacity 116 128 moreover international relations and hydropolitical approaches offer only limited consideration of the role of scale in transboundary water governance 24 geographers and development scholars have raised concerns about the effectiveness of basin scale initiatives suggesting that they often fail to resolve conflicts do not adequately represent diverse values of constituent water users or rely too heavily on nation state actors 91 106 46 some critical geographers contend that the basin is not an appropriate unit for governance because political and administrative units that represent the reach of institutional capacity generally do not coincide with physical watershed boundaries 18 watershed boundaries become political because they delineate which water users and what hydrologic or economic processes are included and which are excluded 18 11 further basin boundaries exclude socially constructed water flows such as interbasin transfers virtual water or water market mechanisms that allow water supplies be used outside of the basin s boundaries 14 72 15 while proponents contend that basin scale governance aligns decision making with the scale of the hydrologic system and increases user participation in practice improved outcomes for communities and the environment are not always realized 95 instead countries and stakeholders in transboundary river basins tend to leverage the geographic and political scales that best advance their interests or goals 24 water security as a multi scalar concept can be easily employed at various geographic and administrative scales 8 23 yet few studies have considered how a water security framing influences which geographic and administrative scales are emphasized in transboundary contexts by whom and why and what impact this has on transboundary water governance our research attempts to fill this gap 3 the landscape of transboundary water security research we reviewed academic and grey literature including 51 papers with case study applications to examine how a water security framing has been employed at the transboundary scale transboundary water security case studies were identified via database searches and snowball sampling we searched the scopus database using keywords including water security or water insecurity in combination with transboundary cross border cross border transborder or international for articles published between 2008 and 2021 we combined these results with snowball sampling drawing on prior work 43 the initial set of more than 350 articles was culled based on the following criteria 1 is water security a dominant framing in the paper 2 does the study focus on a transboundary water context and 3 is a specific case study presented the last criteria dictated that we remove articles that were primarily conceptual in nature and review articles retaining only articles that present information regarding one or more specific case studies the final set of articles included 51 peer reviewed journal articles book chapters and ngo reports some case studies focus on large trans national regions such as the 12 country region of the hindu kush himalayas 75 while others examine international border communities 107 other studies address regions with well developed river basin institutions like the south african development committee 59 or basins that have been well studied like the nile 142 ganges and mekong river basins 85 86 researchers from a variety of disciplines including international law hydropolitics political economy and risk assessment draw on a water security framing 3 1 framing of transboundary water security challenges regardless of the regional focus transboundary water security challenges are often conceptualized as water availability or scarcity table 1 consistent with how water security has been applied at other geographic scales 43 in addition to an emphasis on physical water availability many studies include additional elements such as ecosystem protection protection from risk of hazard and economic development reflecting the multidimensional nature of water security described in recent literature 51 120 93 108 48 49 21 other studies frame water security challenges in terms of resource governance emphasizing a broad range of governance attributes including water access human well being long term sustainability and resilience table 1 regional geopolitical stability is also an important component of water security table 1 we find that many transboundary studies link water resources with national security drawing from hydro political theory or conflict and cooperation studies to examine the influence of transboundary water management on national water security and the role of nation states in securing water resources in transboundary contexts water security framings draw out socio political water challenges among riparian neighbors with a history of conflictual relations or resource securitization that impedes cooperation e g nile river basin see 142 israel and palestine see 12 some describe how reliance on transboundary water decreases national water security 27 others frame freshwater as a strategic resource examining acts of water related terrorism in transboundary basins 124 however securitization is also seen as a barrier to regional water security studies argue that this approach can contribute to perpetuating power asymmetries among riparians and prevent equitable benefits sharing 85 others shift the focus away from national security to examine how international cooperation contributes to a collective non zero sum approach to regional water security 75 or detracts from water security if insufficient 99 a lack of international legal regimes can be a pertinent water security challenge 137 studies that frame water security in terms of human security tend to emphasize individuals or a population as a security referent as opposed to the nation state this conceptualization may be accompanied by a regional geographic view 75 64 or emphasize incorporating local perspectives and experiences 107 63 3 2 themes in transboundary water security strategies and approaches a broad range of strategies approaches and actors are invoked to address water security challenges we uncover that while established approaches to transboundary water based on international cooperation and legal frameworks for basin wide governance are commonly recommended many studies explore expanded national local and non governmental governance capacity and bring in solutions that extend beyond the river basin s geographic and administrative scale table 2 in contrast we find far fewer studies that emphasize expanded infrastructure approaches to water security e g 41 79 and more militaristic security strategy where rules of war to prevent destruction of natural resources e g 143 124 3 2 1 international cooperation and legal frameworks for basin wide water governance a water security framing is often used to further established strategies and approaches to transboundary water governance which include riparian state cooperation basin scale institutions and international legal mechanisms such as treaties in many cases treaties or regional initiatives are coupled with supply side strategies including water reuse desalination and interbasin transfers 102 100 101 or rely on science based decision making and monitoring 12 ryabstev 102 notes that both inter state agreements and improved water use efficiency are needed to address water security in kazakhstan which relies on multiple watercourses originating in neighboring states brooks and trottier 12 design a joint water management framework for israelis and palestinians based not on quantified allocations but on shared principles and responsibilities the framework relies on a combination of sufficient information monitoring and effective mediation effective design of regional institutions matters agreements may be more effective if they involve a broad range of stakeholders while also respecting each nation s sovereignty 99 despite a broad framing of water security in the literature we found that the nation state is still heavily emphasized in transboundary water security for instance transboundary cooperation is promoted to support riparian nations in achieving national water security and national water security is seen as contributing to water security at the international transboundary river basin scale 111 142 for instance in case studies researchers suggest that water security for nations should be addressed on a regional scale in himalayan asia due to a high degree of interdependence with respect to water resources 75 according to the world economic forum 134 the security of water supplies plays a key role in a nation s economic development and thus national security suggesting that transboundary water cooperation can benefit a nation s individual water security others case studies explore how linking water security to national security impedes international cooperation a concern raised throughout water security literature 70 for example brooks and trottier 12 describe how nationalizing israeli water resources and using rigidly quantified water allocations would impede more equitable and sustainable management of water resources shared with palestinians securitization of water and framing of the resource as an existential threat to national security has limited cooperation in transboundary river basins in south asia p 31 in 104 similarly the introduction of the water security concept in negotiations on the nile basin initiative were unhelpful due to the ambiguous and non legal nature of the concept 81 alternatively enforcement of international water law at the transboundary scale may help de link water governance from national sovereignty 117 and provide an opportunity for enhanced hydro diplomacy 137 international water law offers a framework or operational system composed of multilateral treaties agreements and customary international norms for addressing water security at the transboundary level p 103 in 134 this framework helps to implement legal and institutional mechanisms such as data sharing requirements or other principles of good water governance this is demonstrated in multiple case studies e g 35 85 wouters and ziganshina 137 expand on this point arguing that international law plays an important role in transboundary water security via three avenues providing structure for international negotiation hydro diplomacy reifying a regional collective hydro solidarity and applying legal doctrines to transboundary water e g the doctrine of human rights however broad regional constructs negotiated in multinational forums can downplay the influence of power asymmetries among riparian nations and obscure local hydrologic realities 131 3 2 2 expanding national local and non governmental capacity while many water security studies focus on frameworks for basin wide governance we see an interesting trend in others that re examine the role of the nation state and subnational actors in transboundary water governance in addition to advancing national goals strong national governance capacity can help create an enabling environment for successful transboundary cooperation 120 to support transboundary water governance researchers suggest coordinating domestic policies with regional goals 85 86 138 and strengthening links between domestic and transboundary decision making 44 moreover international agreements are insufficient to promote effective transboundary water governance without national and local governance capacity to implement these measures at national and sub national levels 118 85 86 131 112 some authors argue for underpinning transboundary and national institutions with a shared common vision of regional water security 75 yet even when national policies are aligned with international agreements the nation state is often considered a homogenous entity 33 133 without sufficient consideration of local impacts and subnational dynamics that influence the regional environment 44 59 for instance community conflicts and ethnic divisions are often overlooked aspects that contribute to national and international water security 134 cities can also exert a strong influence on transboundary water allocations potentially exacerbating rural urban resource inequities due to their ability to leverage financial and political power to capture water resources from afar 33 jacobs 59 notes that while nations may adopt international norms at the state level local challenges of implementation infrastructure and inequity may persist in studying international rivers basins in the southern african development community jacobs finds that states often use the purpose of national security to justify actions despite persistent subnational inequities and power imbalances that affect water access and influence local conflicts 59 in other regions such as the syr darya basin historically water management has been implemented by subnational irrigation districts many of which themselves traverse international borders yet the subnational scale is often overlooked in strategies to address international water security challenges that instead focus on large scale water and energy supply infrastructure 127 another example is provided by schur 107 who uncovers local water security inequity in two neighboring but cross border communities that share a transboundary aquifer on the u s mexico border we also see growing attention in the literature to the expanding role of non state actors in decision making and resource management e g 85 86 59 44 62 the knowledge and experience of non state actors can significantly increase the legitimacy of decisions and improve implementation of resource policy 120 however in case studies researchers grapple with whether this can be accomplished at the state level 59 due in part to the challenges that an increasingly diverse set of actors present for effective negotiation and joint decision making 85 86 stakeholders in transboundary basins may have divergent views that represent upstream versus downstream perspectives various economic sectors or different political jurisdictions for example one case study describes how local stakeholders in mexico view water security as protection from flooding while the national government employs water security strategies primarily aimed at securing water supplies through hydraulic infrastructure 62 yet the value of including a diverse set of actors in water governance is highlighted in many water security studies non state actors such as environmental ngos can empower local voices to influence policy and guide the development of governance structures that reflect local needs 120 in some cases where international cooperation is limited such as the jordan river basin civil society initiatives may be able to advance water security focused on communities and the environment in a way that formal mechanisms cannot yet these efforts also face constraints regarding access inclusion and equity 83 providing for meaningful collaboration and engagement of non state actors at the transboundary level can contribute a diversity of values and perspectives representative of the range of stakeholders 128 3 2 3 solutions that stretch beyond the basin the final theme describes approaches to improve water security that extend beyond the boundaries of the basin and outside of the water sector many researchers highlight the link between water security and other resources e g energy food land ecosystems at transboundary basin and other scales e g 85 86 108 44 65 4 104 energy and food sectors are not geographically bound to the watershed and have disparate geographic footprints but are intimately linked with water resources through operational processes and material inputs such as crop irrigation and water for electrical plant cooling cross sector linkages can drive water insecurity or expand options for benefit sharing for instance electricity demands in cities may drive hydropower production in transboundary basins 33 addressing water security by leveraging interactions with other resource sectors has the potential to enhance transboundary cooperation and even open pathways through political obstacles 65 alternative water supply strategies such as inter basin transfers desalination and virtual water imports are also not confined to basin boundaries these strategies allow water to traverse hydrologic boundaries supplies from one watershed can be piped to cities in other watersheds 100 or allow unusable e g brackish water to be transformed into usable supply via technology 129 however trade offs such as increased energy use and externalities such as environmental impact may undermine transboundary benefit sharing arrangements 129 water can also be imported from outside the basin via end use products such as high water demand crops in the nile river basin limited freshwater supplies in egypt and sudan are effectively augmented via virtual water embedded in imported food products 142 the distribution and re distribution of resources particularly when resources are transferred between nations or between basins expands the geographic extent of resource systems multiple case studies recommend defining new boundaries to include sectoral and cross sectoral linkages that traverse basin boundaries the concept of problemsheds that delineate problem driven connections among multiple sectors and scales aims to represent challenges and help identify effective solutions more comprehensively 128 for example jacobs 59 critiques the south african development community sadc a management consortium that includes 21 international river basins among 15 countries for relying on state centric solutions that perpetuate power imbalances in the region jacobs 59 suggests that solutions could be driven by the extent of influence of the resource challenge not geographic or political boundaries water transfers can also create a spatial disconnect between enhanced water security and negative externalities for instance planned desalination facilities in mexico will export water for use in the u s providing positive benefits for water security in the u s while degrading water supplies and environmental quality in mexico a transboundary arrangement not bound by the hydrologic basin 129 a focus on water security as a multi scalar concept can help to highlight social and institutional interdependencies that extend beyond the hydrologic basin and linkages among multiple resource systems e g energy food 25 4 challenges and opportunities for transboundary water security we have highlighted three major themes uncovered in transboundary water security studies keeping these themes in mind we investigate how researchers employ a water security framing to achieve a variety of aims and leverage its flexible scope to link various concepts and notions next drawing on the framing of water security in prior studies we reflect on how transboundary water security approaches are difficult to categorize neatly and explore what linkages among geographic and administrative scales are implied by these approaches finally we examine challenges and opportunities for researchers leveraging water security to advance transboundary water governance research 4 1 categorizing transboundary water security framings as our findings demonstrate transboundary water security may refer to a nation local communities or the population of the transboundary region as a whole see table 3 common approaches to transboundary water governance such as river basin organizations and international treaties although operating at transboundary scale often reflect existing state to state relations although such approaches aim for regional security and incorporate some degree of interdependence among riparian nations many international agreements are asymmetric benefitting some nation s interests more than others 85 86 alternative conceptions of water security focus on the notion of a collective human security or a regional collective that transcends political boundaries and promotes a shared vision and collective action 75 recognizing how water security has been influenced by various concepts of security e g human environmental national global 25 scholars have attempted to better understand the various ways in which water security can be employed jepson p 108 in 60 identifies four domains for water security that map to different security referents or that which is to be secured the domain of human development involves water security for the individual family or household sustainability involves water security for ecological processes and systems geopolitics involves water security for the nation state and vulnerability and risk framings involve water security for human population and well being at large see table 1 in 60 these domains are indirectly linked to different geographic scales and methods of water security assessment household water security might be assessed at the community or local scale water resource sustainability at the basin scale geopolitical water security at the national scale and vulnerability to water insecurity at the regional scale however transboundary basins are inherently multi scalar socio ecological constructs they can be considered local in the sense that they can be used to engage relevant stakeholders based on shared resource systems but they are also international composed of land and water systems crossing multiple sovereign nation states that interact according to international law and diplomacy moreover as regional constructs transboundary basins constitute contiguous hydrologic landscapes that link human populations with a shared if locally unequal fate and the potential to inspire a shared sense of responsibility and collective action for human well being in some cases water scarcity is made visible by focusing on the regional scale 131 in others a basin wide view can obscure local e g upstream downstream water inequities 4 reflecting these multi scalar attributes transboundary water security studies often included more than one focus of security drawing on framings of both national security and human security studies most often framed transboundary water security as a result of individual riparian nations water security from the perspective of riparian nations in a transboundary basin via their interdependence on their neighbors or from the perspective of basin wide populations based on the human right to water for livelihoods health and well being some studies included an emphasis on environmental security more broadly implemented at various geographic scales and even fewer explicitly considered water security at a local scale focusing on households community populations or local stakeholder groups building upon the framework presented by jepson 60 our results demonstrate how security framings focus and scale are utilized in transboundary contexts table 3 displays examples that show how transboundary studies leverage multiple security foci and framings to address an overlapping array of referents and scales 4 1 1 scalar challenges for transboundary water governance the challenge of scale in water governance is not new while international relations theory tends to focus primarily on the nation state as both the geographic and administrative scale at which to address governance challenges 2 other approaches promote geographic scaling based on hydrologic boundaries and local decision making the former is known as the territorial trap which describes the assumptions that lead to prioritization of state centric approaches in international water management 2 conversely approaches that emphasize the local level or watershed scale follow the subsidiarity principle which suggests that decision making should take place at the lowest possible governance level while subsidiarity aims to promote more efficient effective and equitable governance many scholars have shown that in practice this is not necessary the case 94 13 this is the local trap the assumption that water management is inherently more effective appropriate and equitable when conducted at the local scale 13 the predominance of both national and basin wide scales in our results suggests that international water management approaches can fall into both traps a focus on international cooperation treaties and customary law reinforces the nation state as the primary actor in transboundary water security e g sadc see 37 and because transboundary basins can be geographically expansive an emphasis on the basin scale cannot guarantee inclusivity nor improved visibility of community specific challenges for numerous and diverse stakeholders and a variety of ecosystems within the same basin further basin scaling can be used by hegemonic nation states to shift risks to and claim water from upstream areas through the narrative of a scarcity across a shared hydrologic system 131 the entrenchment of the basin approach in transboundary water governance literature may be yet another trap a basin trap we suggest that approaches stuck in a basin trap fail to leverage subnational governance capacity and fall short of meaningfully coordinating among multiple governance levels to address the multiple scales framings and foci see table 3 relevant to transboundary water challenges consolidated basin scale governance in large international basins may not effectively address challenges experienced in local communities and resource linkages external to the basin prior research that challenges the notion of the hydrologic basin as an apolitical and self contained management unit supports this suggestion 89 90 14 4 2 limitations of water security in transboundary contexts the use of water security framings in transboundary contexts is challenged by both the concept s lack of clarity and lingering discursive overlap with securitization our results show that applications of a water security framing at the transboundary scale are varied and inconsistent while broad usage proves water security is a flexible and malleable concept diverse applications and inconsistent usage can make comparative analysis difficult and dilute its analytical value 7 69 this may lead to confusion about what transboundary water security means and how to operationalize it for example water security can be understood differently by different actors multiple studies we reviewed identified more than one interpretation of water security that was in play in international contexts efforts to address water security in the transboundary jordan river basin reflect four different interpretations of water security a militaristic interpretation is reflected in israeli efforts to safeguard water supplies through large scale infrastructure a technological interpretation through investments in desalination a sustainable transboundary interpretation through regional scientific collaboration and a water rights interpretation through efforts of civil society to address equitable water allocations for palestinians 83 in a case study on a transboundary river basin shared between mexico and guatemala kauffer 62 describes how different understandings of water security contribute to tensions among stakeholders in a transboundary basin the author describes how local stakeholders in mexico experience water abundance and view water security as protection from flooding which damages local infrastructure and agriculture in contrast the mexican state upholds a narrow definition of water security that focuses on sovereignty and national security and thus continues to promote solutions that involve hydraulic infrastructure the secure water supplies 62 the way that water security is employed can evolve over time prior to soviet independence irrigation districts in central asia viewed water security as multidimensional requiring integrated solutions however after gaining independence in the early 1990s water security strategies transitioned toward unilateral approaches that contributed to nation building and political independence 138 the use of a water security framing is also muddled by discursive overlap with securitization while recent post realist notions of water security eschew militaristic and nationalistic framings and instead promote cooperation inclusivity and integration 121 security discourses linger in transboundary water research 52 36 this discursive overlap is most apparent in transboundary contexts as opposed to other scales because state to state interactions depend on the notion of national sovereignty our review demonstrates that most transboundary water security studies promote cooperation yet maintain an emphasis on national water security either as a component of or a means to attaining transboundary water security 141 137 while securitizing natural resources can beneficially heighten political and public attention to resource issues 36 water security studies critique its detrimental impact on cooperation and equitable benefit sharing 12 85 mirumachi 85 describes how by framing water scarcity as a regional threat india successfully gained acceptance from nepal for construction of the transboundary tanakpur dam in the mahakali treaty an agreement that effectively codified power asymmetry between the two nations brooks and trottier 12 relate how linking water with national security in the jordan river basin can favor fixed allocations based on simple quantifications rather than more equitable and sustainable solutions the social and environmental interdependencies inherent in transboundary contexts challenge the view that national security must be achieved through independence and sovereignty 141 when water is considered a matter of national security strategies are likely to address water security via water sovereignty thus securing water for some nations in a transboundary river basin at the expense of others this contradicts the notion of a transboundary water security that is rooted in regional interdependence and cooperation 70 more consistent with this notion are trends toward desecuritization that promote transparent decision making and inclusion of a broad range of actors 22 with relatively few recent studies employing water security in transboundary contexts versus at other scales 43 our review suggests additional case studies would help refine the use of a water security framing in international contexts and distinguish it from securitization approaches 4 3 contributions of water security to multi scalar water governance in transboundary contexts recognizing that the geography of transboundary basins links issues across scales and local national and international levels of administration we see an opportunity for a multi level multi scalar approach to transboundary water security in combination with improved coordination among levels a multi level approach can leverage the unique capacities of individual administration levels and address disconnects between agreements made at the basin scale and the institutional capacity required to implement new practices and policies for example regional transboundary institutions may not only build collective capacity at the international level optimally they would also help align national policies with shared regional goals 85 86 furthermore national actors have legislative authority and the ability to both monitor and enforce policies capacities not readily present at other levels but necessary to implement regional plans 128 shifting the role of the state from a top down technocratic regulator to a facilitator of governance among multiple levels and actors is key to build national capacity that will effectively support multi level governance in transboundary basins aligning governance tasks with the appropriate scale and building capacity at multiple levels can promote engagement with a broader range of actors especially certain national and local actors that have historically been marginalized in transboundary water governance we argue this is crucial to achieving water security in a transboundary context this is in line with earlier calls for a more multi level governance approach to help resolve the historic disconnect between the regional and national decision making landscapes in transboundary water governance 105 116 while traditional approaches to transboundary water governance tend to primarily emphasize the basin scale and often insufficiently incorporate the diversity of local water needs multi level governance approaches address multiple scalar issues in environmental governance and emphasize an appropriate fit between governance tasks and administrative levels not restricted to pre existing hierarchies 92 58 building governance capacity at the river basin scale addresses problems of scalar fit where administrative units do not align with hydrologic boundaries here we emphasize the need to address institutional interactions across governance levels and issues of scale that relate to how water resource problems are understood and made legitimate scalar issues refer to how water resource challenges can be understood and made visible differentially based on what geographic scale they examine and what impact the act of defining spatial scale has on social and environmental externalities the choice of scale also affects the attention and support such as funding political will and coordinated effort that they receive multi level governance can allow issues to be addressed at multiple levels but will require enhanced coordination among levels 6 92 as noted by other scholars water security framings are conducive to multi level multi scalar approaches to water governance 8 25 that we argue are necessary particularly in transboundary contexts leveraging multiple scales and levels of governance may help transcend some of the effects of the persistent scalar mismatch between a hydrological focus on the boundaries of watersheds and a political focus on the borders of the nation state 7 and ease tensions between national and local levels which are particularly prevalent in transboundary contexts 94 more diverse and complex institutions at the transboundary level beyond technocratic rbos along with informal social networks such as communities of practice and informal cooperation such as among regional networks of scientists and technical experts are needed to strengthen inclusive participation in transboundary contexts however multi level governance is not a silver bullet the calls to shift the role of the state from a technocratic regulator to a facilitator of governance among multiple levels and to better connect national actors who have been marginalized in water governance processes may fail to appropriately consider the role of sovereignty and power in water governance in her study of norm convergence in south africa s orange senqu river jacobs 150 reveals how power asymmetries tend to disadvantage local level interests in the multi level context in addition a key challenge to the multi level approach remains to assess what should be governed at which level and what kind of cross level coordination is required to achieve effective management 53 similar to other water governance paradigms the multi level governance paradigm can be construed as vague and lacking in a consistent approach for example like the nexus concept where researchers have found a lack of systematic tools that could address all the trade offs involved in the nexus 73 3 multi level governance is characterized by uncertainty and complexity around interactions across sectors and levels 98 the work needed to restructure water governance into a multi level arrangement can also be a barrier to implementation 96 further as a concept that cuts across scale water security could be used to obscure water scarcity by adjusting the scale of analysis in the mekong river basin dore and lebel 32 describe how actors privilege different spatial scales and levels in order to advance their own interests in deliberations and decision making thus multi level governance strategies employed to advance transboundary water security should be approached with these caveats in mind 5 conclusions given the relative human dependency on transboundary waters and the growing investment in international basin scale water management in this paper we investigated how water security is evoked and utilized in the transboundary water context and what this means for water governance practices we find that the historic and longstanding approach to transboundary water management that emphasizes riparian state cooperation international legal frameworks and institution building at the river basin scale dominates approaches to water security in the transboundary context but we also observe a water security framing that may provide a vehicle to promote new viewpoints for transboundary water governance that leverage local national and non state capacity and highlight important cross sector and extra basin influences such as international trade or trans basin water infrastructure such emerging broad understandings of water security are inclusive of a diverse range of actors and introduce a range of security referents that extend from household water supplies and environment flows to the notion of a regional collective nonetheless we reveal some challenges associated with the framing of water security for transboundary water governance including a potentially problematic overlap with narrow perspectives of resource securitization that privilege the nation state and the dominant focus on the basin scale that in large international river basins can obscure the very local dynamics that a hydrologic scaling aims to highlight close attention might also be paid to refine and better leverage water security to reveal innovative and novel approaches that will advance the field of transboundary water governance while maintaining a rigorous and well defined approach the nature of transboundary water security as an inherently multi scalar endeavor provokes both a challenge in terms of divergent approaches but also an opportunity while we do not discount the importance of basin wide cooperation further research is needed to examine the role of local community city national and global scales in supporting transboundary water security in order to expand beyond the river basin as the dominant focus for transboundary water governance as researchers pursue studies of water security in a transboundary water context we first caution researchers to better leverage multiscalar aspects of water security while avoiding common pitfalls of rescaling environmental problems second we recommend the use of broad conceptualizations of water security in transboundary contexts to include more actors and sector linkages that could contribute to new approaches and perhaps the notion of collective regional security ultimately to enhance the utility of water security as a paradigm it must effectively bring meaning and engage actors external to the water sector and shine light on the diverse and multiple drivers institutions and actors beyond the water sphere who influence water governance activities and outcomes 25 only then can we realize the promise of transboundary water security that serves not only nations but communities and regional populations appropriately embraces local and

20093,water security has emerged as a leading framework for water governance that integrates socio politico economic and physical attributes and is readily operationalized yet in transboundary river basins it is unclear to what extent water security framings have any resonance we examine how water security has been employed in transboundary water research over the past decade we find a water security framing bolsters established governance approaches at the river basin scale but also advances new avenues that 1 re examine the scope of local national and non state governance capacity or 2 extend beyond river basin boundaries and outside the water sector we examine conceptual and scalar challenges and limitations for transboundary water security applications and highlight opportunities to expand beyond the river basin as the dominant focus for transboundary water governance keywords water security transboundary river basin scale governance securitization data availability no data

supply use and access for communities and countries the rise to prominence of water security as a leading paradigm for water governance reflects a broad shift toward soft path inclusive approaches 7 121 responding to this trend studies have examined how water security is utilized in research and practice 21 144 43 questioned its various uses and interpretations 144 122 21 and identified gaps in practical applications 8 68 however attention to its application in transboundary water contexts is limited yet the challenges of achieving water security are particularly salient in transboundary contexts where vulnerability and complexity are high 75 with more than 2 7 billion people worldwide who depend on resources from transboundary river basins 29 water security in transboundary contexts has far reaching impacts on individual and community livelihoods regional development and human environment relations however the nature of transboundary water challenges that contribute to water security can vary dramatically in different sociopolitical contexts and geographic locations 4 international development banks and ngos increasingly support cooperation among nations by funding the development of institutions to govern shared water resources in transboundary basins 54 which further shapes governance processes and how water is experienced and realized by individuals and communities given the relative human dependency on transboundary waters 1 1 by transboundary waters we are referring primarily to international river basins and cross border aquifers however we also acknowledge the importance of less traditional transboundary contexts such as interbasin transfers and virtual water exports by choosing to use this broad term and the growing investment in international basin scale water management this paper explores how water security is evoked and utilized in the transboundary water context and what this means for water governance practices more broadly although theoretically conceived as an approach that can be applied at many different geographic scales the utility and benefit of a water security framing at the transboundary scale remains unclear this paper asks amidst established discourse and practice of transboundary water governance how does a water security framing help us approach transboundary water challenges we are especially interested in how water security is used to frame problems and solutions to water management we use the term framing to refer to how an issue is defined including what is emphasized and de emphasized in its definition 30 in the context of transboundary water resources scholars have explored how framings either highlight or obscure the dynamics of state relations 146 147 or how they reinforce certain types of challenges 84 45 use of a particular framing has implications for how societal challenges are addressed through policy based solutions 115 the use of scale to frame problems and solutions also has implications for the range of actors involved and solutions available to address the problem 71 we begin by briefly tracing the evolution of water security and transboundary water governance to provide background and context to our analysis recent studies show despite a significant an overlap in the disciplinary reach of these topic areas limited work has been conducted that combines these fields 28 after exploring conceptual developments we examine case studies that explicitly utilize a water security framing in a transboundary context employing a geographical lens we investigate 1 how water security is conceived of and used to frame transboundary water challenges and solutions and 2 how water security framings address hydrologic and administrative scale 2 2 hydrologic scale refers to the geographic or spatial extent of a watershed or basin administrative scale refers to both the political level of administration e g municipal state national international and the geographic extent of these jurisdictions we discuss ways that a water security framing contributes to regional cooperative approaches to transboundary water governance and reveal how researchers are utilizing water security to advance broad perspectives related to scale cross sector linkages and non state actors after examining the implications of these evolving approaches for water security and transboundary water governance we highlight promising pathways toward transboundary water security 2 water security and transboundary waters 2 1 the rise of water security water security shares conceptual roots with security theory by the late 1980s realist foreign policy experts were linking state security to control over key water resources suggesting for example that limited freshwater resources would lead to conflict among nations 114 57 broader efforts by scholars to rethink and expand the concept of security to include social economic and natural resource issues led to approaches to securitize environmental issues and notions of wars being fought over water in the future 121 3 3 for a more complete chronology of the concept of water security readers might refer to 5 and 113 when securitized water resource issues are treated as an existential threat through issue framing and speech acts 125 in an international context securitization moves water out of the realm of normal politics where negotiation and cooperation are useful and instead promotes state centric zero sum approaches aimed at safeguarding national resources 16 extreme measures or strategic actions by high ranking officials are justified through narratives and discourse that create a sense of danger and urgency 1 9 such approaches can limit international cooperation by impeding negotiation and compromise 93 desecuritization or downgrading water from a threat to a valuable resource 17 is normatively considered more effective for transboundary resource governance because it favors building international institutional capacity enhanced cooperation and transparency 1 in some cases securitization can help motivate policy change by bringing water issues to the attention of decision makers and galvanizing public support or resources 36 overlaid on these conceptual roots a shift in global water governance toward soft path approaches participation and interconnectedness gave rise to a new post realist framing of water security over the past two decades as a leading paradigm for water governance 121 this broad notion of water security was influenced not only by notions of national security but of human security which emphasizes poverty reduction livelihoods and economic development and global security which highlights global interconnections among natural resources climate change and economic systems 25 scholars have debated its use contrasting narrow reductionist approaches with broad integrated applications 21 144 and critiqued its multiple ambiguous and sometimes conflicting definitions and usages 5 7 43 narrow framings of water security might employ for example fixed water allocations 144 quantitative tools to assess water availability versus demand 55 or water scarcity 34 or simplified indices to quantify water security at national 69 and regional levels 10 as an alternative to realist foreign policy approaches these approaches illustrate the lingering notion of how securing water supplies might invoke rigid metrics or hard path approaches to increasing water supplies e g via built infrastructure and the idea that water insecurities can be managed in a limited and targeted fashion 68 in transboundary basins water resources and security are more closely intertwined because actions by one nation such as pollution of waterways water overuse or border infrastructure that obstructs water systems can impact another nation s water resources 121 notions of water security in international contexts are often linked with traditional approaches to international relations that stress the role of the state in securing a nation s population from threat or vulnerability 60 in international law notions of conflict and tension continue to shape discussions of water security and state sovereignty has remained central to discussions of water security through the role of nation states as the main players in international water treaties and the positioning of international watercourses the primary scale of focus 23 but in shared river basins pursuing water security on a national basis may advance water security for some but not all riparian states involved this paradox can arise at multiple scales security for some can ultimately mean insecurity for others 31 increasingly researchers call for a broader approach to water security that is interdisciplinary and inclusive 21 144 heeding these calls recent research ascribes to broad notions of human and environmental security that integrate soft path approaches such as improved governance hydro diplomacy and community based strategies that go beyond procuring physical supplies 74 7 103 these approaches address multiple domains of water including equitable water access and ecosystem water needs 48 119 protection from floods and drought 51 sanitation 119 policy 97 global change and resilience 108 and cultural values 61 this breadth of approaches reflects how different contexts often require different paths to achieving water security 40 while calls for broad inclusive framings of water security pervade the literature it is unclear to what extent these framings have been adopted or have any resonance in transboundary contexts 2 2 transboundary water governance do transboundary water interactions result in conflict or cooperation this question has guided transboundary water research for decades early research linking water scarcity with international conflict led to the argument which was dominant for some time that water scarcity would lead to international conflict or water wars 47 by linking water to national security these studies highlight the role of the nation state in safeguarding water supplies such as protection of water resources infrastructure from acts of war vandalism securing specific water resources source locations using legal mechanisms to treat water as an object of absolute territorial sovereignty securing water supplies via entitlements or developing new supplies via technological approaches and innovation 109 78 in these cases state control of water resources is seen as necessary for national survival and threatened by the physical socio economic and political interdependencies of transboundary basins 36 in the late 1990s wolf and colleagues 132 offered an alternative view by cataloguing the occurrence of conflict and international agreements throughout history revealing that nations were more likely to cooperate over shared water resources than resort to militaristic or violent conflict after this studies of transboundary water focused on examining mechanisms and proponents of cooperation 88 133 and frames of resource securitization were less commonly used for a period of time other transboundary water research examines the rise in cooperative efforts and institutional development at the river basin scale over the past several decades aimed at promoting joint management and protection of international rivers 20 42 cooperation is marked by the signing of international water treaties and formation of river basin organizations both serve as mechanisms to share benefits develop and protect resources and share information 133 106 treaties and customary international norms also enable countries to manage conflicts with formal agreements 135 unsurprisingly these regional cooperative approaches focus on the scale of the river basin in much of the transboundary water literature the basin is considered the ideal scale for water management 90 it provides a tool for coordinating among multiple governance levels 97 and serves as a platform for joint monitoring stakeholder engagement and decision making 103 however integrated programs and goals designed at the river basin level can be difficult to implement if they conflict with national priorities or if local administrations lack necessary political authority or institutional capacity 116 128 moreover international relations and hydropolitical approaches offer only limited consideration of the role of scale in transboundary water governance 24 geographers and development scholars have raised concerns about the effectiveness of basin scale initiatives suggesting that they often fail to resolve conflicts do not adequately represent diverse values of constituent water users or rely too heavily on nation state actors 91 106 46 some critical geographers contend that the basin is not an appropriate unit for governance because political and administrative units that represent the reach of institutional capacity generally do not coincide with physical watershed boundaries 18 watershed boundaries become political because they delineate which water users and what hydrologic or economic processes are included and which are excluded 18 11 further basin boundaries exclude socially constructed water flows such as interbasin transfers virtual water or water market mechanisms that allow water supplies be used outside of the basin s boundaries 14 72 15 while proponents contend that basin scale governance aligns decision making with the scale of the hydrologic system and increases user participation in practice improved outcomes for communities and the environment are not always realized 95 instead countries and stakeholders in transboundary river basins tend to leverage the geographic and political scales that best advance their interests or goals 24 water security as a multi scalar concept can be easily employed at various geographic and administrative scales 8 23 yet few studies have considered how a water security framing influences which geographic and administrative scales are emphasized in transboundary contexts by whom and why and what impact this has on transboundary water governance our research attempts to fill this gap 3 the landscape of transboundary water security research we reviewed academic and grey literature including 51 papers with case study applications to examine how a water security framing has been employed at the transboundary scale transboundary water security case studies were identified via database searches and snowball sampling we searched the scopus database using keywords including water security or water insecurity in combination with transboundary cross border cross border transborder or international for articles published between 2008 and 2021 we combined these results with snowball sampling drawing on prior work 43 the initial set of more than 350 articles was culled based on the following criteria 1 is water security a dominant framing in the paper 2 does the study focus on a transboundary water context and 3 is a specific case study presented the last criteria dictated that we remove articles that were primarily conceptual in nature and review articles retaining only articles that present information regarding one or more specific case studies the final set of articles included 51 peer reviewed journal articles book chapters and ngo reports some case studies focus on large trans national regions such as the 12 country region of the hindu kush himalayas 75 while others examine international border communities 107 other studies address regions with well developed river basin institutions like the south african development committee 59 or basins that have been well studied like the nile 142 ganges and mekong river basins 85 86 researchers from a variety of disciplines including international law hydropolitics political economy and risk assessment draw on a water security framing 3 1 framing of transboundary water security challenges regardless of the regional focus transboundary water security challenges are often conceptualized as water availability or scarcity table 1 consistent with how water security has been applied at other geographic scales 43 in addition to an emphasis on physical water availability many studies include additional elements such as ecosystem protection protection from risk of hazard and economic development reflecting the multidimensional nature of water security described in recent literature 51 120 93 108 48 49 21 other studies frame water security challenges in terms of resource governance emphasizing a broad range of governance attributes including water access human well being long term sustainability and resilience table 1 regional geopolitical stability is also an important component of water security table 1 we find that many transboundary studies link water resources with national security drawing from hydro political theory or conflict and cooperation studies to examine the influence of transboundary water management on national water security and the role of nation states in securing water resources in transboundary contexts water security framings draw out socio political water challenges among riparian neighbors with a history of conflictual relations or resource securitization that impedes cooperation e g nile river basin see 142 israel and palestine see 12 some describe how reliance on transboundary water decreases national water security 27 others frame freshwater as a strategic resource examining acts of water related terrorism in transboundary basins 124 however securitization is also seen as a barrier to regional water security studies argue that this approach can contribute to perpetuating power asymmetries among riparians and prevent equitable benefits sharing 85 others shift the focus away from national security to examine how international cooperation contributes to a collective non zero sum approach to regional water security 75 or detracts from water security if insufficient 99 a lack of international legal regimes can be a pertinent water security challenge 137 studies that frame water security in terms of human security tend to emphasize individuals or a population as a security referent as opposed to the nation state this conceptualization may be accompanied by a regional geographic view 75 64 or emphasize incorporating local perspectives and experiences 107 63 3 2 themes in transboundary water security strategies and approaches a broad range of strategies approaches and actors are invoked to address water security challenges we uncover that while established approaches to transboundary water based on international cooperation and legal frameworks for basin wide governance are commonly recommended many studies explore expanded national local and non governmental governance capacity and bring in solutions that extend beyond the river basin s geographic and administrative scale table 2 in contrast we find far fewer studies that emphasize expanded infrastructure approaches to water security e g 41 79 and more militaristic security strategy where rules of war to prevent destruction of natural resources e g 143 124 3 2 1 international cooperation and legal frameworks for basin wide water governance a water security framing is often used to further established strategies and approaches to transboundary water governance which include riparian state cooperation basin scale institutions and international legal mechanisms such as treaties in many cases treaties or regional initiatives are coupled with supply side strategies including water reuse desalination and interbasin transfers 102 100 101 or rely on science based decision making and monitoring 12 ryabstev 102 notes that both inter state agreements and improved water use efficiency are needed to address water security in kazakhstan which relies on multiple watercourses originating in neighboring states brooks and trottier 12 design a joint water management framework for israelis and palestinians based not on quantified allocations but on shared principles and responsibilities the framework relies on a combination of sufficient information monitoring and effective mediation effective design of regional institutions matters agreements may be more effective if they involve a broad range of stakeholders while also respecting each nation s sovereignty 99 despite a broad framing of water security in the literature we found that the nation state is still heavily emphasized in transboundary water security for instance transboundary cooperation is promoted to support riparian nations in achieving national water security and national water security is seen as contributing to water security at the international transboundary river basin scale 111 142 for instance in case studies researchers suggest that water security for nations should be addressed on a regional scale in himalayan asia due to a high degree of interdependence with respect to water resources 75 according to the world economic forum 134 the security of water supplies plays a key role in a nation s economic development and thus national security suggesting that transboundary water cooperation can benefit a nation s individual water security others case studies explore how linking water security to national security impedes international cooperation a concern raised throughout water security literature 70 for example brooks and trottier 12 describe how nationalizing israeli water resources and using rigidly quantified water allocations would impede more equitable and sustainable management of water resources shared with palestinians securitization of water and framing of the resource as an existential threat to national security has limited cooperation in transboundary river basins in south asia p 31 in 104 similarly the introduction of the water security concept in negotiations on the nile basin initiative were unhelpful due to the ambiguous and non legal nature of the concept 81 alternatively enforcement of international water law at the transboundary scale may help de link water governance from national sovereignty 117 and provide an opportunity for enhanced hydro diplomacy 137 international water law offers a framework or operational system composed of multilateral treaties agreements and customary international norms for addressing water security at the transboundary level p 103 in 134 this framework helps to implement legal and institutional mechanisms such as data sharing requirements or other principles of good water governance this is demonstrated in multiple case studies e g 35 85 wouters and ziganshina 137 expand on this point arguing that international law plays an important role in transboundary water security via three avenues providing structure for international negotiation hydro diplomacy reifying a regional collective hydro solidarity and applying legal doctrines to transboundary water e g the doctrine of human rights however broad regional constructs negotiated in multinational forums can downplay the influence of power asymmetries among riparian nations and obscure local hydrologic realities 131 3 2 2 expanding national local and non governmental capacity while many water security studies focus on frameworks for basin wide governance we see an interesting trend in others that re examine the role of the nation state and subnational actors in transboundary water governance in addition to advancing national goals strong national governance capacity can help create an enabling environment for successful transboundary cooperation 120 to support transboundary water governance researchers suggest coordinating domestic policies with regional goals 85 86 138 and strengthening links between domestic and transboundary decision making 44 moreover international agreements are insufficient to promote effective transboundary water governance without national and local governance capacity to implement these measures at national and sub national levels 118 85 86 131 112 some authors argue for underpinning transboundary and national institutions with a shared common vision of regional water security 75 yet even when national policies are aligned with international agreements the nation state is often considered a homogenous entity 33 133 without sufficient consideration of local impacts and subnational dynamics that influence the regional environment 44 59 for instance community conflicts and ethnic divisions are often overlooked aspects that contribute to national and international water security 134 cities can also exert a strong influence on transboundary water allocations potentially exacerbating rural urban resource inequities due to their ability to leverage financial and political power to capture water resources from afar 33 jacobs 59 notes that while nations may adopt international norms at the state level local challenges of implementation infrastructure and inequity may persist in studying international rivers basins in the southern african development community jacobs finds that states often use the purpose of national security to justify actions despite persistent subnational inequities and power imbalances that affect water access and influence local conflicts 59 in other regions such as the syr darya basin historically water management has been implemented by subnational irrigation districts many of which themselves traverse international borders yet the subnational scale is often overlooked in strategies to address international water security challenges that instead focus on large scale water and energy supply infrastructure 127 another example is provided by schur 107 who uncovers local water security inequity in two neighboring but cross border communities that share a transboundary aquifer on the u s mexico border we also see growing attention in the literature to the expanding role of non state actors in decision making and resource management e g 85 86 59 44 62 the knowledge and experience of non state actors can significantly increase the legitimacy of decisions and improve implementation of resource policy 120 however in case studies researchers grapple with whether this can be accomplished at the state level 59 due in part to the challenges that an increasingly diverse set of actors present for effective negotiation and joint decision making 85 86 stakeholders in transboundary basins may have divergent views that represent upstream versus downstream perspectives various economic sectors or different political jurisdictions for example one case study describes how local stakeholders in mexico view water security as protection from flooding while the national government employs water security strategies primarily aimed at securing water supplies through hydraulic infrastructure 62 yet the value of including a diverse set of actors in water governance is highlighted in many water security studies non state actors such as environmental ngos can empower local voices to influence policy and guide the development of governance structures that reflect local needs 120 in some cases where international cooperation is limited such as the jordan river basin civil society initiatives may be able to advance water security focused on communities and the environment in a way that formal mechanisms cannot yet these efforts also face constraints regarding access inclusion and equity 83 providing for meaningful collaboration and engagement of non state actors at the transboundary level can contribute a diversity of values and perspectives representative of the range of stakeholders 128 3 2 3 solutions that stretch beyond the basin the final theme describes approaches to improve water security that extend beyond the boundaries of the basin and outside of the water sector many researchers highlight the link between water security and other resources e g energy food land ecosystems at transboundary basin and other scales e g 85 86 108 44 65 4 104 energy and food sectors are not geographically bound to the watershed and have disparate geographic footprints but are intimately linked with water resources through operational processes and material inputs such as crop irrigation and water for electrical plant cooling cross sector linkages can drive water insecurity or expand options for benefit sharing for instance electricity demands in cities may drive hydropower production in transboundary basins 33 addressing water security by leveraging interactions with other resource sectors has the potential to enhance transboundary cooperation and even open pathways through political obstacles 65 alternative water supply strategies such as inter basin transfers desalination and virtual water imports are also not confined to basin boundaries these strategies allow water to traverse hydrologic boundaries supplies from one watershed can be piped to cities in other watersheds 100 or allow unusable e g brackish water to be transformed into usable supply via technology 129 however trade offs such as increased energy use and externalities such as environmental impact may undermine transboundary benefit sharing arrangements 129 water can also be imported from outside the basin via end use products such as high water demand crops in the nile river basin limited freshwater supplies in egypt and sudan are effectively augmented via virtual water embedded in imported food products 142 the distribution and re distribution of resources particularly when resources are transferred between nations or between basins expands the geographic extent of resource systems multiple case studies recommend defining new boundaries to include sectoral and cross sectoral linkages that traverse basin boundaries the concept of problemsheds that delineate problem driven connections among multiple sectors and scales aims to represent challenges and help identify effective solutions more comprehensively 128 for example jacobs 59 critiques the south african development community sadc a management consortium that includes 21 international river basins among 15 countries for relying on state centric solutions that perpetuate power imbalances in the region jacobs 59 suggests that solutions could be driven by the extent of influence of the resource challenge not geographic or political boundaries water transfers can also create a spatial disconnect between enhanced water security and negative externalities for instance planned desalination facilities in mexico will export water for use in the u s providing positive benefits for water security in the u s while degrading water supplies and environmental quality in mexico a transboundary arrangement not bound by the hydrologic basin 129 a focus on water security as a multi scalar concept can help to highlight social and institutional interdependencies that extend beyond the hydrologic basin and linkages among multiple resource systems e g energy food 25 4 challenges and opportunities for transboundary water security we have highlighted three major themes uncovered in transboundary water security studies keeping these themes in mind we investigate how researchers employ a water security framing to achieve a variety of aims and leverage its flexible scope to link various concepts and notions next drawing on the framing of water security in prior studies we reflect on how transboundary water security approaches are difficult to categorize neatly and explore what linkages among geographic and administrative scales are implied by these approaches finally we examine challenges and opportunities for researchers leveraging water security to advance transboundary water governance research 4 1 categorizing transboundary water security framings as our findings demonstrate transboundary water security may refer to a nation local communities or the population of the transboundary region as a whole see table 3 common approaches to transboundary water governance such as river basin organizations and international treaties although operating at transboundary scale often reflect existing state to state relations although such approaches aim for regional security and incorporate some degree of interdependence among riparian nations many international agreements are asymmetric benefitting some nation s interests more than others 85 86 alternative conceptions of water security focus on the notion of a collective human security or a regional collective that transcends political boundaries and promotes a shared vision and collective action 75 recognizing how water security has been influenced by various concepts of security e g human environmental national global 25 scholars have attempted to better understand the various ways in which water security can be employed jepson p 108 in 60 identifies four domains for water security that map to different security referents or that which is to be secured the domain of human development involves water security for the individual family or household sustainability involves water security for ecological processes and systems geopolitics involves water security for the nation state and vulnerability and risk framings involve water security for human population and well being at large see table 1 in 60 these domains are indirectly linked to different geographic scales and methods of water security assessment household water security might be assessed at the community or local scale water resource sustainability at the basin scale geopolitical water security at the national scale and vulnerability to water insecurity at the regional scale however transboundary basins are inherently multi scalar socio ecological constructs they can be considered local in the sense that they can be used to engage relevant stakeholders based on shared resource systems but they are also international composed of land and water systems crossing multiple sovereign nation states that interact according to international law and diplomacy moreover as regional constructs transboundary basins constitute contiguous hydrologic landscapes that link human populations with a shared if locally unequal fate and the potential to inspire a shared sense of responsibility and collective action for human well being in some cases water scarcity is made visible by focusing on the regional scale 131 in others a basin wide view can obscure local e g upstream downstream water inequities 4 reflecting these multi scalar attributes transboundary water security studies often included more than one focus of security drawing on framings of both national security and human security studies most often framed transboundary water security as a result of individual riparian nations water security from the perspective of riparian nations in a transboundary basin via their interdependence on their neighbors or from the perspective of basin wide populations based on the human right to water for livelihoods health and well being some studies included an emphasis on environmental security more broadly implemented at various geographic scales and even fewer explicitly considered water security at a local scale focusing on households community populations or local stakeholder groups building upon the framework presented by jepson 60 our results demonstrate how security framings focus and scale are utilized in transboundary contexts table 3 displays examples that show how transboundary studies leverage multiple security foci and framings to address an overlapping array of referents and scales 4 1 1 scalar challenges for transboundary water governance the challenge of scale in water governance is not new while international relations theory tends to focus primarily on the nation state as both the geographic and administrative scale at which to address governance challenges 2 other approaches promote geographic scaling based on hydrologic boundaries and local decision making the former is known as the territorial trap which describes the assumptions that lead to prioritization of state centric approaches in international water management 2 conversely approaches that emphasize the local level or watershed scale follow the subsidiarity principle which suggests that decision making should take place at the lowest possible governance level while subsidiarity aims to promote more efficient effective and equitable governance many scholars have shown that in practice this is not necessary the case 94 13 this is the local trap the assumption that water management is inherently more effective appropriate and equitable when conducted at the local scale 13 the predominance of both national and basin wide scales in our results suggests that international water management approaches can fall into both traps a focus on international cooperation treaties and customary law reinforces the nation state as the primary actor in transboundary water security e g sadc see 37 and because transboundary basins can be geographically expansive an emphasis on the basin scale cannot guarantee inclusivity nor improved visibility of community specific challenges for numerous and diverse stakeholders and a variety of ecosystems within the same basin further basin scaling can be used by hegemonic nation states to shift risks to and claim water from upstream areas through the narrative of a scarcity across a shared hydrologic system 131 the entrenchment of the basin approach in transboundary water governance literature may be yet another trap a basin trap we suggest that approaches stuck in a basin trap fail to leverage subnational governance capacity and fall short of meaningfully coordinating among multiple governance levels to address the multiple scales framings and foci see table 3 relevant to transboundary water challenges consolidated basin scale governance in large international basins may not effectively address challenges experienced in local communities and resource linkages external to the basin prior research that challenges the notion of the hydrologic basin as an apolitical and self contained management unit supports this suggestion 89 90 14 4 2 limitations of water security in transboundary contexts the use of water security framings in transboundary contexts is challenged by both the concept s lack of clarity and lingering discursive overlap with securitization our results show that applications of a water security framing at the transboundary scale are varied and inconsistent while broad usage proves water security is a flexible and malleable concept diverse applications and inconsistent usage can make comparative analysis difficult and dilute its analytical value 7 69 this may lead to confusion about what transboundary water security means and how to operationalize it for example water security can be understood differently by different actors multiple studies we reviewed identified more than one interpretation of water security that was in play in international contexts efforts to address water security in the transboundary jordan river basin reflect four different interpretations of water security a militaristic interpretation is reflected in israeli efforts to safeguard water supplies through large scale infrastructure a technological interpretation through investments in desalination a sustainable transboundary interpretation through regional scientific collaboration and a water rights interpretation through efforts of civil society to address equitable water allocations for palestinians 83 in a case study on a transboundary river basin shared between mexico and guatemala kauffer 62 describes how different understandings of water security contribute to tensions among stakeholders in a transboundary basin the author describes how local stakeholders in mexico experience water abundance and view water security as protection from flooding which damages local infrastructure and agriculture in contrast the mexican state upholds a narrow definition of water security that focuses on sovereignty and national security and thus continues to promote solutions that involve hydraulic infrastructure the secure water supplies 62 the way that water security is employed can evolve over time prior to soviet independence irrigation districts in central asia viewed water security as multidimensional requiring integrated solutions however after gaining independence in the early 1990s water security strategies transitioned toward unilateral approaches that contributed to nation building and political independence 138 the use of a water security framing is also muddled by discursive overlap with securitization while recent post realist notions of water security eschew militaristic and nationalistic framings and instead promote cooperation inclusivity and integration 121 security discourses linger in transboundary water research 52 36 this discursive overlap is most apparent in transboundary contexts as opposed to other scales because state to state interactions depend on the notion of national sovereignty our review demonstrates that most transboundary water security studies promote cooperation yet maintain an emphasis on national water security either as a component of or a means to attaining transboundary water security 141 137 while securitizing natural resources can beneficially heighten political and public attention to resource issues 36 water security studies critique its detrimental impact on cooperation and equitable benefit sharing 12 85 mirumachi 85 describes how by framing water scarcity as a regional threat india successfully gained acceptance from nepal for construction of the transboundary tanakpur dam in the mahakali treaty an agreement that effectively codified power asymmetry between the two nations brooks and trottier 12 relate how linking water with national security in the jordan river basin can favor fixed allocations based on simple quantifications rather than more equitable and sustainable solutions the social and environmental interdependencies inherent in transboundary contexts challenge the view that national security must be achieved through independence and sovereignty 141 when water is considered a matter of national security strategies are likely to address water security via water sovereignty thus securing water for some nations in a transboundary river basin at the expense of others this contradicts the notion of a transboundary water security that is rooted in regional interdependence and cooperation 70 more consistent with this notion are trends toward desecuritization that promote transparent decision making and inclusion of a broad range of actors 22 with relatively few recent studies employing water security in transboundary contexts versus at other scales 43 our review suggests additional case studies would help refine the use of a water security framing in international contexts and distinguish it from securitization approaches 4 3 contributions of water security to multi scalar water governance in transboundary contexts recognizing that the geography of transboundary basins links issues across scales and local national and international levels of administration we see an opportunity for a multi level multi scalar approach to transboundary water security in combination with improved coordination among levels a multi level approach can leverage the unique capacities of individual administration levels and address disconnects between agreements made at the basin scale and the institutional capacity required to implement new practices and policies for example regional transboundary institutions may not only build collective capacity at the international level optimally they would also help align national policies with shared regional goals 85 86 furthermore national actors have legislative authority and the ability to both monitor and enforce policies capacities not readily present at other levels but necessary to implement regional plans 128 shifting the role of the state from a top down technocratic regulator to a facilitator of governance among multiple levels and actors is key to build national capacity that will effectively support multi level governance in transboundary basins aligning governance tasks with the appropriate scale and building capacity at multiple levels can promote engagement with a broader range of actors especially certain national and local actors that have historically been marginalized in transboundary water governance we argue this is crucial to achieving water security in a transboundary context this is in line with earlier calls for a more multi level governance approach to help resolve the historic disconnect between the regional and national decision making landscapes in transboundary water governance 105 116 while traditional approaches to transboundary water governance tend to primarily emphasize the basin scale and often insufficiently incorporate the diversity of local water needs multi level governance approaches address multiple scalar issues in environmental governance and emphasize an appropriate fit between governance tasks and administrative levels not restricted to pre existing hierarchies 92 58 building governance capacity at the river basin scale addresses problems of scalar fit where administrative units do not align with hydrologic boundaries here we emphasize the need to address institutional interactions across governance levels and issues of scale that relate to how water resource problems are understood and made legitimate scalar issues refer to how water resource challenges can be understood and made visible differentially based on what geographic scale they examine and what impact the act of defining spatial scale has on social and environmental externalities the choice of scale also affects the attention and support such as funding political will and coordinated effort that they receive multi level governance can allow issues to be addressed at multiple levels but will require enhanced coordination among levels 6 92 as noted by other scholars water security framings are conducive to multi level multi scalar approaches to water governance 8 25 that we argue are necessary particularly in transboundary contexts leveraging multiple scales and levels of governance may help transcend some of the effects of the persistent scalar mismatch between a hydrological focus on the boundaries of watersheds and a political focus on the borders of the nation state 7 and ease tensions between national and local levels which are particularly prevalent in transboundary contexts 94 more diverse and complex institutions at the transboundary level beyond technocratic rbos along with informal social networks such as communities of practice and informal cooperation such as among regional networks of scientists and technical experts are needed to strengthen inclusive participation in transboundary contexts however multi level governance is not a silver bullet the calls to shift the role of the state from a technocratic regulator to a facilitator of governance among multiple levels and to better connect national actors who have been marginalized in water governance processes may fail to appropriately consider the role of sovereignty and power in water governance in her study of norm convergence in south africa s orange senqu river jacobs 150 reveals how power asymmetries tend to disadvantage local level interests in the multi level context in addition a key challenge to the multi level approach remains to assess what should be governed at which level and what kind of cross level coordination is required to achieve effective management 53 similar to other water governance paradigms the multi level governance paradigm can be construed as vague and lacking in a consistent approach for example like the nexus concept where researchers have found a lack of systematic tools that could address all the trade offs involved in the nexus 73 3 multi level governance is characterized by uncertainty and complexity around interactions across sectors and levels 98 the work needed to restructure water governance into a multi level arrangement can also be a barrier to implementation 96 further as a concept that cuts across scale water security could be used to obscure water scarcity by adjusting the scale of analysis in the mekong river basin dore and lebel 32 describe how actors privilege different spatial scales and levels in order to advance their own interests in deliberations and decision making thus multi level governance strategies employed to advance transboundary water security should be approached with these caveats in mind 5 conclusions given the relative human dependency on transboundary waters and the growing investment in international basin scale water management in this paper we investigated how water security is evoked and utilized in the transboundary water context and what this means for water governance practices we find that the historic and longstanding approach to transboundary water management that emphasizes riparian state cooperation international legal frameworks and institution building at the river basin scale dominates approaches to water security in the transboundary context but we also observe a water security framing that may provide a vehicle to promote new viewpoints for transboundary water governance that leverage local national and non state capacity and highlight important cross sector and extra basin influences such as international trade or trans basin water infrastructure such emerging broad understandings of water security are inclusive of a diverse range of actors and introduce a range of security referents that extend from household water supplies and environment flows to the notion of a regional collective nonetheless we reveal some challenges associated with the framing of water security for transboundary water governance including a potentially problematic overlap with narrow perspectives of resource securitization that privilege the nation state and the dominant focus on the basin scale that in large international river basins can obscure the very local dynamics that a hydrologic scaling aims to highlight close attention might also be paid to refine and better leverage water security to reveal innovative and novel approaches that will advance the field of transboundary water governance while maintaining a rigorous and well defined approach the nature of transboundary water security as an inherently multi scalar endeavor provokes both a challenge in terms of divergent approaches but also an opportunity while we do not discount the importance of basin wide cooperation further research is needed to examine the role of local community city national and global scales in supporting transboundary water security in order to expand beyond the river basin as the dominant focus for transboundary water governance as researchers pursue studies of water security in a transboundary water context we first caution researchers to better leverage multiscalar aspects of water security while avoiding common pitfalls of rescaling environmental problems second we recommend the use of broad conceptualizations of water security in transboundary contexts to include more actors and sector linkages that could contribute to new approaches and perhaps the notion of collective regional security ultimately to enhance the utility of water security as a paradigm it must effectively bring meaning and engage actors external to the water sector and shine light on the diverse and multiple drivers institutions and actors beyond the water sphere who influence water governance activities and outcomes 25 only then can we realize the promise of transboundary water security that serves not only nations but communities and regional populations appropriately embraces local and

actively work together toward a socially and environmentally just space that considers the water and food needs of people the ecosystems that underpin our food systems and broader energy and equity concerns keywords water resilience food systems good governance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction 1 1 our food systems are in crisis despite recent setbacks from covid 19 and the war in ukraine significant progress has been made globally in the production of food to meet growing demand this is evidenced by per capita food availability increasing since the middle of the last century despite a more than doubling of the global population 31 with a concomitant decline in the share of people undernourished at the global level an important benefit of our ability to feed a growing population has been a significant decline in food prices until recently but this has come at the cost of detrimental environmental economic and social impacts 53 an increasing number of countries are facing growing levels of acute food insecurity due to climate shocks conflict and other disruptions reversing years of development gains 71 this has been further exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic 93 47 and more recently by food price increases due to the war in ukraine 30 notwithstanding the current impacts of the pandemic and the war in ukraine food and land use systems are in crisis 20 food systems include the related resources inputs production transport processing and manufacturing industries retailing and consumption of food as well as its impacts on the environment health and society at least four interlinked dimensions of systemic change are contributing to emerging food and nutrition insecurity namely 1 the climate crisis leading to an increasingly erratic water cycle and non stationary conditions around the world which is destabilizing agricultural and food systems as increased frequency and severity of extreme events elevated temperatures and floods and droughts take hold 42 43 2 an environmental crisis unfolding through exploitive resource use expansion and poor environmental management exacerbated by loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that impart vulnerability to food and livelihood systems 71 8 42 3 a health crisis driven by lack of access to affordable and healthy food and poor nutrition choices 90 and 4 a rural livelihoods crisis in many countries associated with gender inequality paucity of livelihood opportunities an aging agrarian population and limited engagement of youth whose aspirations lay beyond the farm gate 96 moreover while trade has been an enabler 64 of food and nutrition security and plays a growing role in ensuring national food security of low and middle income countries particularly in africa trade has at times worsened inequity and access to healthy nutritious food 9 20 whilst climate is a key driver of the challenges facing food systems its anthropocene origin and many other human induced environmental challenges and impacts need to be acknowledged we have built large conurbations in drought prone regions without water retaining and water saving features where populations continue to grow placing greater stresses on limited water resources we draw jurisdictional boundaries that cross catchments adding complexity to decision making we grow water intensive crops e g sugarcane and rice increasingly in areas where the water footprint of crops brings them into conflict with other water users irrigate staple grain crops in a manner that destroys riverine and coastal fisheries that supply foods critical for nutrition and we remain heavily reliant on rainfed agriculture these are examples of the low priority given to water in our decision making processes a core element of the un food systems summit was to raise awareness that achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs demands reforms in our food systems whilst recommendations supporting reform and needed transformation of food systems were proposed 89 the criticality of water in these processes did not receive due recognition in contrast the recently published ipcc sixth assessment report highlights current and future challenges associated with future climates and implications with respect to water and food security the report stresses the need to address systemic changes driving food and nutritional security and the need to build resilience into food systems to ensure the provision of healthy and affordable diets for all 43 disruption of the water system by climate change is creating risks across the food system the impacts on food systems will be far reaching from the loss of land in the mega delta food bowls of south east and west asia due to salt water intrusion 39 changed flow regimes of major river systems from the andes to the himalayas 72 40 shifts in precipitation patterns and snowpack glacier melt impacting irrigated agriculture in central asia 5 to abandonment of rainfed agriculture in regions of africa due to rainfall unpredictability and desertification 80 all of these shocks and stresses and often solutions to them are manifest in water 42 43 the climate crisis is a water resilience crisis the linkages between water and climate and complex and water and climate change are inextricably interlinked 46 water is the primary medium through which climate change manifests itself including in droughts floods water stress and by affecting water quality 84 water and sanitation systems produce significant carbon contributing to around 10 of global greenhouse gas emissions per annum and have shown to have limited resilience giz 2020 cited in 83 8 water resilience is therefore critical to addressing climate change to meet our aspirations for future food systems there is a need to transform governance systems relating to food and water to properly value water resources to cope with variability in frequency location and amplitude of water related extreme events as well as actively addressing justice and equity concerns the question arises what are the unique elements for governance of water resilient food systems whilst it could be argued that the innate complexity embedded in water spanning social economic and environmental domains makes identifying the constituents of water resilient food systems a tortuous and contestable task we are of the opinion that it is essential the objective must be to prepare for a resilient future that embraces water scarcity systemic changes in availability and competition water use in food systems has to be brought within the limits of sustainability and food systems need to be ready for a productive future with unpredictable water further change in food systems must respect the planetary boundaries for water resource use 78 and to reclaiming space of social and environmental justice in food and water systems it is also argued that given the context specific nature of water and that some river basins are already under stress production will need to increase elsewhere water is too often left out of the discourse around resilient and sustainable food systems and treated as an unlimited resource there is little to no consideration of structural barriers towards equality in access to water and its availability as well as quality is taken as a given 79 in the production and processing of food in the consumption of food and in equitably meeting demands from humans and nature 77 the reality is water has the power to break climate brittle food systems managing less and more variable water supplies will increasingly lead to access and supply failures through for example droughts and floods or water contamination contributing to unsafe drinking water malnutrition and associated disease in short water itself is a critical source of resilience or if mismanaged vulnerability across natural and social systems 21 and is reflected in the increasing adoption of new irrigation methods in such places as the mid west of north america important food producing areas in south america and several nile basin countries as mentioned above to catalyse a new dialogue on water resilient food systems there is a need to recognize the critical role that natural systems play in food systems as well as hydro social impacts to them and ensure that their integrity and functionality is not compromised whilst serving humanity with accessible affordable and nutritious food we argue that good governance is the key to this and propose six attributes that together provide a foundation for good governance to reduce current and future water risks to food systems the six attributes and their supporting references have been summarised in table 1 below much of the focus of this article emphasizes the role that participatory processes play in enabling the six governance attributes to evolve we take a wide view of participatory processes recognising that people and organizations can participate in financial markets politics rights based approaches and even in fiscal and planning in a myriad of ways and these multifaceted types of participation are key to how we discuss governance in relation to water resilience 91 76 these attributes are grounded in scientific evidence as well as our diverse collective experience and expertise working across the science policy practice interface they should not be seen as exhaustive or a road map to success but rather the foundations of the urgently needed discussion on how to transform and build water resilient of food systems 2 treating the food system as a system adopting interconnected systems thinking that embraces the complexity of how we produce distribute and add value to food the water resilience of food systems is influenced and impacted by the numerous sectors that are dependent on water at different scales creating feedback loops across the water cycle 75 4 66 water and food systems are constantly co evolving requiring continual assessment of decisions and adaptation for the sustainable management of food systems 11 by acknowledging these feedbacks connections and associated uncertainties continual adjustments synergies and trade offs can be evaluated and actions taken to achieve interconnected systems thinking new and innovative platforms and partnerships which include farmers need to be created and participatory processes used that share expertise among practitioners across the agricultural environment energy and land use domains along with other diverse groups that have an interest or stake in water and food systems evidence of the effectiveness of such approaches is found in innovation platforms that have emerged to address changes in small scale irrigation in southern and east africa for example and in participatory decision making processes that have been tested in vietnam 70 94 the complexity of water resilience is eloquently encapsulated in the paradox of irrigation efficiency simple interventions through policy reform and investments in infrastructure or modernization of irrigation systems have rarely achieved the desired goal of reduced water consumption 33 when scaled up from the farm to basin results from theoretical studies of behavioural responses to water conservation technologies suggest that increased physical irrigation efficiency is unlikely to conserve water under generally prevailing conditions but typically leads to increased water consumption by farms and reduced return flows which under prevalent recoverable return flow regimes will reduce water availability for other uses 19 by embracing complexity that is inclusive over a range of social ecological dimensions scales and time meaningful assessments can be undertaken of how to overcome the efficiency paradox 55 similarly the adoption of nature based solutions 58 36 and agroecological 38 approaches incorporate the complexity of natural systems in building water resilience into food systems 17 the benefits of complexity thinking including a shift in the mental models and cognitive processes of all actors involved to embrace uncertainty long term thinking feedback loops and understanding of food systems as social ecological systems with water a key leverage point for transforming them into resilient systems have been shown in crop systems and landscape management 65 56 54 embracing complexity provides the foundation for informed decision making that goes beyond sectorial silos whilst recognising the benefits of deep expertise building resilience for the vast challenges posed by global change and coupled complex systems is not without challenges however embracing complexity identifying the boundaries of a system and its dynamics may be beyond the capacity resources or time limits of a given project program or decision navigating the trade offs of what components of a system are more important than others is also complex modeling and improved data are making significant strides in helping with these challenges but access to them is still limited and often costly 3 adopting multi level inclusive governance and participation adopting polycentric governance with well defined responsibilities and communication fosters resilience across the interconnected social ecological systems that constitute water and food systems polycentric governance involves multiple overlapping centres of decision making which interact with an overarching set of rules 37 such an architecture for governance contributes to strengthening inclusion for women youth and marginalized people which is vital for resilience it recognizes the differences between varied stresses on water and food systems and enables tailored policymaking to adapt to local risks 21 institutions within polycentric systems have the capacity to act semi autonomously simultaneously which enables adaptable rapid and inclusive responses to local threats to water security that could rapidly escalate across agricultural supply chains 14 27 where different polycentric governance institutions have overlapping interests across these nested systems there is a need for effective platforms for negotiation that promote cooperation across the system as well as support robust conflict resolution mechanisms 14 the potential for novel polycentric governance systems at scale has been identified for groundwater usage in sub saharan africa 13 traditional participatory approaches provide concrete examples of polycentric approaches to water management at a local level the muang fai 62 and subak 95 irrigation systems of northern thailand and bali and the qanats 63 of iran provide examples of traditional communal management systems still in place that have undergone little change for generations cross coalition coordination in collaborative environmental governance processes that seek to manage water in the colorado river basin is a recent example of a polycentric approaches 50 these systems encapsulate elements of responsiveness flexibility and equitable water sharing and distribution mechanisms there are however lessons to be learnt in promoting polycentric governance structures all part of a continual learning process that allows for improvements and course adjustment the development of water user associations wuas as a means of democratizing irrigation management is emblematic of a polycentric approach to governance and inclusiveness with many different examples found in the developed world whilst this approach has been promoted in the process of irrigation reform in many developing and emerging economies its impact has been mixed due to challenges of developing effective and sustainable institutions and can compete with other formal and customary rules and mechanisms 1 polycentric governance structures would facilitate the emergence of viable water resource institutions that are more transparent accountable efficient responsive sustainable adequately resourced and geographically contextualized and would support improved governance where current arrangements are fragmented or weak however polycentric governance is also costly and subject to power dynamics 61 further since water risks under climate change fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable such an approach to water resilient food systems would encapsulate a strong lens on equity and local communities water resilient food systems should factor in the environmental and ethical costs associated with food systems 4 enabling continual innovation new knowledge learning and dissemination water resilient food systems have embedded within them an ethos of continual innovation and learning along with access to knowledge and the skills and capacity to utilize knowledge in managing dynamically changing risks they foster systems thinking knowledge sharing and continual learning that is used to inform decision making the development promotion and use of climate and water information systems and the implementation of robust monitoring systems supports and contributes to adaptive management across the entire food system to make use of information water resilient food systems need to incorporate the attributes of continual learning and associated feedback mechanisms that allow for improvements and course adjustment there is a range of information knowledge and technological innovations and tools that could be used in promoting water resilience in food systems for example the concept of follow the water through recent technological advances in real time monitoring of flows using earth observation tools 23 provides critical information required to build robust water accounting systems that can be used in decision making processes 86 demystification of hydrogeology combined with community norms and institutional reforms to manage groundwater as social ecological commons in maharashtra india has been shown to be effective in addressing over exploitation of groundwater resources 51 in addition traditional indicators used in the past such as water collection storage and infiltration with traditional rainwater harvesting will need to be re thought and expanded upon under climate change since efficiency is not necessarily an indicator of resilience particularly from the perspective of justice of marginalised peoples 25 whilst the information and communications technology ict revolution and the emergence of artificial intelligence ai will play a significant role in supporting water resilient food systems with baseline data and evidence for the effectiveness of different management interventions there is a need to ensure that indigenous solutions in water management are incorporated into the solutions mix rainwater harvesting systems step wells persian wheels etc have been shown to be effective solutions for managing water resources there is a need to revive and mainstream these approaches in the mix of options to be considered indigenous solutions often present a distinct diagnosis of water resilience water management technologies practices and water governance that sometimes clashes with global national and local systems of governance 59 28 ensuring that indigenous knowledge principles and values is given equal standing alongside other forms of knowledge will help address issues of environmental justice considerations when enabling continual innovation new knowledge learning and dissemination 59 innovation is not confined to technology but can include practices policies institutions and incentives advances in incentive based systems and financial instruments have provided the enabling environment to facilitate behaviour change adoption of improved practices and approaches that contribute to water resilient food systems occurs where there is a clear benefit to the individual these being primarily economic 70 however the adoption of practices and approaches that have a public and social good are often more difficult to achieve and less attractive due to perceived limited immediate benefits e g financial and in general require incentivization 16 innovations in incentive based approaches that include payment for ecosystem services pes and conditional transfer approaches have been key mechanisms in support of improved resource management that can have positive impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources generated in landscapes examples include conservation reserve program crp 85 in the usa the grain to green program gtgp and the grain to bamboo program gtbp in china 22 the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mgnrega in india 45 the combined actions under eu common agricultural policy and 3rd cycle ec water frame work directives 2022 2027 and the procurement and public distribution of millets in odisha 44 there are currently over 550 pes programs globally steadily increasing in number with total annual expenditures that could soon reach over us 40 billion 74 contrasting this 540bn in global subsidies are given to farmers every year of which 90 are viewed as harmful 89 despite their potential formal water markets and other incentive based approaches to water management have struggled to scale up beyond pilot initiatives due to political resistance financing shortfalls and data deficits while the limitations of water markets are important to recognise c f 34 recent advances in our understanding of incentives for sustainable water use can help to overcome persistent barriers that have hindered past efforts 26 emerging research on financial and investment instruments to support positive environmental outcomes 12 holds significant promise to support water resilience in food systems 5 incorporating diversity and redundancy living resilience achieving resilient water systems that support food systems requires maintaining diversity and redundancy amongst component parts from water landscapes to governance institutions 11 17 diversity and redundancy provide a range of options to respond and adapt to changing circumstances over both the short and long term 32 within most current food systems prioritization has promoted leanness and optimisation over system flexibility large scale production technologies and global trade of inputs have been successful at maximizing output by simplifying and centralizing agricultural techniques but have created narrow and brittle systems at the expense of risks associated with climate change and biodiversity loss 68 these technologies have also emphasised the power asymmetries between farmers who can command such investments and those who cannot by encouraging and embracing diversity and social ecological complexity agricultural production techniques can be made more flexible incorporating broad and nimble adaptive capacity ibid and building systemic resilience 73 58 evidence from the mediterranean on nature based solutions suggests that they have been effective in reducing water demand improving soil fertility and have reduced erosion through the use of cover crops and agroforestry based systems 82 the adoption of regenerative agricultural approaches can help address land degradation and biodiversity loss whilst supporting diverse productive and integrated farming systems it provides the opportunity to conserve and value ecological diversity and connectivity promote economic diversity and guard against maladaptive engineering 77 the lack of progress in reversing the global decline in biodiversity is partly due to a mismatch between how living nature is conceived and valued by the conservation movement on the one hand and by many different people including marginalized communities on the other requiring a pluralistic perspective on biodiversity 67 a challenge of incorporating diversity and redundancy is that many governance and economic models linked to food systems and water are built around a focus on optimization and short termism 18 88 24 optimization is often more cost effective than redundancy and diversity in the short term and communicating the long term and short term trade offs to decision makers is often a challenge c f 49 6 ensuring system preparedness achieving water resilient food systems will require prioritizing preparedness a fundamental shift away from the current reactionary responses 6 in a changing world where future shocks and stresses cannot be perfectly predicted resilience can be built by focusing more on preparedness and increasing the range of adaptive capacities 11 rather than trying to orchestrate precise response plans to specific predicted situations in preparing for extreme events there are a range of tools and approaches that would assist in reducing their impact these include long term climate forecasting and early warning systems tools that would allow producers water managers and other decision makers to make tactical decisions 3 continual mapping of temporal and spatial trends of emerging water scarcity establishing routine water accounting approaches at a national and sub national level and adapting agricultural water management to water scarcity and flooding and increasing water demand driven by rising temperatures proactive approaches to water management have also been evidenced to be cheaper than responding to eventual shocks 6 understanding and predicting how risks will cascade across water systems between regions and economies and understanding potential water agriculture tipping points and in some case opportunities that can assist in highlighting the myriad ways in which actors need to prepare 48 in order to support a preparedness agenda there is a need for transparency in data availability accountability in data management and collection a change in data governance and a shift in how investments for resilience are viewed there are significant gaps in data collection across water systems worldwide an increasingly important approach that can address this impasse is through citizen science and the citizen state interface in data collection crop water budgeting successes in parts of india 29 and africa 70 are evidence towards addressing this gap elsewhere there is an important opportunity in making existing data sets more accessible where presently they are not for such reasons as concerns over miss use of the information in disputes accessible data sets and open access platforms can also help promote cross sectoral engagement and collaboration around complex systems problems including water resilience 52 7 plan for the long term throughout the world we find water infrastructure that was built thousands of years ago from the aqueducts of ancient rome or the incans to the irrigation channels of mesopotamia or the khmer empire many investment decisions in water and food systems have long term consequences infrastructure in particular can shape development for decades or centuries a duration that often extends beyond infrastructure s lifetime because the economic system reorganizes itself around them 35 water resilient food systems must proactively plan for and adapt to system changes over both short and long timescales 71 climate change is making the water cycle increasingly erratic highlighting the lack of resilience in our current built infrastructure it is likely to increase the frequency of extreme weather that will negatively impact agricultural production capacity 7 one potential impact is multiple breadbasket failures if for example the jetstream stalls over key food producing regions causing prolonged droughts 92 earth has already been affected by two consecutive heatwaves across the entire northern hemisphere in 2018 and 2020 water resilient food systems should be built on a strong evidence base by potential long term stresses hard and soft infrastructure and governance systems should then be designed to meet tests to resilience over a long time horizon rather than focusing on present day stresses there is general agreement that many of the natural cycles and systems that must be maintained to promote resilience are not valued within financial models in accordance with their critical role in investment longevity there are continuing debates over the monetization of nature in theory and also persistent practical challenges due to the need to effectively monitor audit and compare impacts across biodiversity water and human rights as a transformational step greater value should be attributed to the role these essential natural processes including sustainable water management play and every effort should be made in incorporating the true value of nature into financial and investment models future proofing water and food systems will require a step change in approach by policy and decision makers that shifts to preparedness for the long term 58 this requires a change in commitment by political leadership and governmental responsibility that needs to be driven by new structures of incentives that reward long term value creation instead of short term crises management and returns human rights based approaches are being considered to identify and assess impacts of large scale agriculture and water use especially for countries actively importing high water footprint goods 60 previous studies of incentive take up have found that successful initiatives are designed with specific target stakeholders in mind rather than more generalized incentives 69 further current incentives within food systems tend to reward short term optimization for agricultural output 68 there is a need to shift incentive systems to enhance the resilience of our water and food systems longer term planning and approaches also cut across key dimensions of justice and ethics linked to water resilience for example when natural systems and water resilience are protected over the long term they can help to ensure the continuity of indigenous culture and they protect the myriad of core indigenous values that water connects with and this in turn can help direct water governance 10 shifting away from short term financially driven incentives and planning will require a transformational restructuring of what is seen as success across the finance world as well as across governance institutions there is the explicit requirement for agriculture to be profitable and provide short term returns however there is the need for incentives to transform to more sustainable and resilient systems this will require political will that is not currently present 8 concluding remarks building consensus around what sustainable transition pathways for food systems constitute is difficult due to the complexity of these systems in the many different contexts a lack of knowledge of the impacts of transitions across economies and the diverse and sometimes competing incentives present across the wide diversity of stakeholders mindsets and mental maps need to be challenged to break down the silos separating communities of practice in water and food sectors the table initiative is an example of a dialogue platform that attempts to overcome barriers by providing a space for inclusive debates on the future of food 81 instilling resilience will require building adaptive capacity across stakeholders so that there is a range of assets to draw upon flexibility to change strategies ability to organize and act collectively learning to recognize change and the agency to determine whether to change or not 15 as well as safeguards and means of recourse to address increased vulnerability polycentric governance offers one model to deliver these ways of building adaptive capacity through organized collective capacity and coalition building 21 enhancing stakeholders adaptive capacity requires collaboration between many different systems and policy departments which is complex and difficult to implement in practice and can result in trade offs 87 there are also complex structures of regulatory and legal institutions that can create barriers to responding in flexible ways to changing circumstances 15 finding new ways of managing water and food systems will need to support the transformation of current patterns of production and consumption towards more resilient practices this will require innovation ecosystems 41 whereby new approaches are funded evaluated and the results shared across governance structures that support scaling however there are numerous barriers to scaling innovation across water and food systems they include national and local regulatory restrictions concerns of possible risks of adopting new technologies and a lack of access to capital all of these stifle innovative and experimental approaches to water management 2 as uncertainty increases with climate change our ability to identify the most likely and credible future water regime among a wide range of possibilities recedes due to non stationarity it is becoming harder to assign probabilities of future events with confidence limits and to then weigh alternative decisions instead the best options for managing water are those that are robust because they show satisfactory performance across a wide range of possible futures 57 if such robustness can then be complemented by flexibility the ability to respond to unexpected future events changes in climatic and hydrological patterns and residual risk is retained 77 achieving the transformation to water resilient food systems will require difficult decisions negotiation of trade offs based on accurate transparent and accepted data significant investments across food and water systems and in the generation of new knowledge through research and its application it will also require an enabling environment building a compact between government communities producers and the private sector and the political will to stay the course further women youth and communities including large and smallholder farmers will need to be at the centre of

ukraine food and land use systems are in crisis 20 food systems include the related resources inputs production transport processing and manufacturing industries retailing and consumption of food as well as its impacts on the environment health and society at least four interlinked dimensions of systemic change are contributing to emerging food and nutrition insecurity namely 1 the climate crisis leading to an increasingly erratic water cycle and non stationary conditions around the world which is destabilizing agricultural and food systems as increased frequency and severity of extreme events elevated temperatures and floods and droughts take hold 42 43 2 an environmental crisis unfolding through exploitive resource use expansion and poor environmental management exacerbated by loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that impart vulnerability to food and livelihood systems 71 8 42 3 a health crisis driven by lack of access to affordable and healthy food and poor nutrition choices 90 and 4 a rural livelihoods crisis in many countries associated with gender inequality paucity of livelihood opportunities an aging agrarian population and limited engagement of youth whose aspirations lay beyond the farm gate 96 moreover while trade has been an enabler 64 of food and nutrition security and plays a growing role in ensuring national food security of low and middle income countries particularly in africa trade has at times worsened inequity and access to healthy nutritious food 9 20 whilst climate is a key driver of the challenges facing food systems its anthropocene origin and many other human induced environmental challenges and impacts need to be acknowledged we have built large conurbations in drought prone regions without water retaining and water saving features where populations continue to grow placing greater stresses on limited water resources we draw jurisdictional boundaries that cross catchments adding complexity to decision making we grow water intensive crops e g sugarcane and rice increasingly in areas where the water footprint of crops brings them into conflict with other water users irrigate staple grain crops in a manner that destroys riverine and coastal fisheries that supply foods critical for nutrition and we remain heavily reliant on rainfed agriculture these are examples of the low priority given to water in our decision making processes a core element of the un food systems summit was to raise awareness that achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs demands reforms in our food systems whilst recommendations supporting reform and needed transformation of food systems were proposed 89 the criticality of water in these processes did not receive due recognition in contrast the recently published ipcc sixth assessment report highlights current and future challenges associated with future climates and implications with respect to water and food security the report stresses the need to address systemic changes driving food and nutritional security and the need to build resilience into food systems to ensure the provision of healthy and affordable diets for all 43 disruption of the water system by climate change is creating risks across the food system the impacts on food systems will be far reaching from the loss of land in the mega delta food bowls of south east and west asia due to salt water intrusion 39 changed flow regimes of major river systems from the andes to the himalayas 72 40 shifts in precipitation patterns and snowpack glacier melt impacting irrigated agriculture in central asia 5 to abandonment of rainfed agriculture in regions of africa due to rainfall unpredictability and desertification 80 all of these shocks and stresses and often solutions to them are manifest in water 42 43 the climate crisis is a water resilience crisis the linkages between water and climate and complex and water and climate change are inextricably interlinked 46 water is the primary medium through which climate change manifests itself including in droughts floods water stress and by affecting water quality 84 water and sanitation systems produce significant carbon contributing to around 10 of global greenhouse gas emissions per annum and have shown to have limited resilience giz 2020 cited in 83 8 water resilience is therefore critical to addressing climate change to meet our aspirations for future food systems there is a need to transform governance systems relating to food and water to properly value water resources to cope with variability in frequency location and amplitude of water related extreme events as well as actively addressing justice and equity concerns the question arises what are the unique elements for governance of water resilient food systems whilst it could be argued that the innate complexity embedded in water spanning social economic and environmental domains makes identifying the constituents of water resilient food systems a tortuous and contestable task we are of the opinion that it is essential the objective must be to prepare for a resilient future that embraces water scarcity systemic changes in availability and competition water use in food systems has to be brought within the limits of sustainability and food systems need to be ready for a productive future with unpredictable water further change in food systems must respect the planetary boundaries for water resource use 78 and to reclaiming space of social and environmental justice in food and water systems it is also argued that given the context specific nature of water and that some river basins are already under stress production will need to increase elsewhere water is too often left out of the discourse around resilient and sustainable food systems and treated as an unlimited resource there is little to no consideration of structural barriers towards equality in access to water and its availability as well as quality is taken as a given 79 in the production and processing of food in the consumption of food and in equitably meeting demands from humans and nature 77 the reality is water has the power to break climate brittle food systems managing less and more variable water supplies will increasingly lead to access and supply failures through for example droughts and floods or water contamination contributing to unsafe drinking water malnutrition and associated disease in short water itself is a critical source of resilience or if mismanaged vulnerability across natural and social systems 21 and is reflected in the increasing adoption of new irrigation methods in such places as the mid west of north america important food producing areas in south america and several nile basin countries as mentioned above to catalyse a new dialogue on water resilient food systems there is a need to recognize the critical role that natural systems play in food systems as well as hydro social impacts to them and ensure that their integrity and functionality is not compromised whilst serving humanity with accessible affordable and nutritious food we argue that good governance is the key to this and propose six attributes that together provide a foundation for good governance to reduce current and future water risks to food systems the six attributes and their supporting references have been summarised in table 1 below much of the focus of this article emphasizes the role that participatory processes play in enabling the six governance attributes to evolve we take a wide view of participatory processes recognising that people and organizations can participate in financial markets politics rights based approaches and even in fiscal and planning in a myriad of ways and these multifaceted types of participation are key to how we discuss governance in relation to water resilience 91 76 these attributes are grounded in scientific evidence as well as our diverse collective experience and expertise working across the science policy practice interface they should not be seen as exhaustive or a road map to success but rather the foundations of the urgently needed discussion on how to transform and build water resilient of food systems 2 treating the food system as a system adopting interconnected systems thinking that embraces the complexity of how we produce distribute and add value to food the water resilience of food systems is influenced and impacted by the numerous sectors that are dependent on water at different scales creating feedback loops across the water cycle 75 4 66 water and food systems are constantly co evolving requiring continual assessment of decisions and adaptation for the sustainable management of food systems 11 by acknowledging these feedbacks connections and associated uncertainties continual adjustments synergies and trade offs can be evaluated and actions taken to achieve interconnected systems thinking new and innovative platforms and partnerships which include farmers need to be created and participatory processes used that share expertise among practitioners across the agricultural environment energy and land use domains along with other diverse groups that have an interest or stake in water and food systems evidence of the effectiveness of such approaches is found in innovation platforms that have emerged to address changes in small scale irrigation in southern and east africa for example and in participatory decision making processes that have been tested in vietnam 70 94 the complexity of water resilience is eloquently encapsulated in the paradox of irrigation efficiency simple interventions through policy reform and investments in infrastructure or modernization of irrigation systems have rarely achieved the desired goal of reduced water consumption 33 when scaled up from the farm to basin results from theoretical studies of behavioural responses to water conservation technologies suggest that increased physical irrigation efficiency is unlikely to conserve water under generally prevailing conditions but typically leads to increased water consumption by farms and reduced return flows which under prevalent recoverable return flow regimes will reduce water availability for other uses 19 by embracing complexity that is inclusive over a range of social ecological dimensions scales and time meaningful assessments can be undertaken of how to overcome the efficiency paradox 55 similarly the adoption of nature based solutions 58 36 and agroecological 38 approaches incorporate the complexity of natural systems in building water resilience into food systems 17 the benefits of complexity thinking including a shift in the mental models and cognitive processes of all actors involved to embrace uncertainty long term thinking feedback loops and understanding of food systems as social ecological systems with water a key leverage point for transforming them into resilient systems have been shown in crop systems and landscape management 65 56 54 embracing complexity provides the foundation for informed decision making that goes beyond sectorial silos whilst recognising the benefits of deep expertise building resilience for the vast challenges posed by global change and coupled complex systems is not without challenges however embracing complexity identifying the boundaries of a system and its dynamics may be beyond the capacity resources or time limits of a given project program or decision navigating the trade offs of what components of a system are more important than others is also complex modeling and improved data are making significant strides in helping with these challenges but access to them is still limited and often costly 3 adopting multi level inclusive governance and participation adopting polycentric governance with well defined responsibilities and communication fosters resilience across the interconnected social ecological systems that constitute water and food systems polycentric governance involves multiple overlapping centres of decision making which interact with an overarching set of rules 37 such an architecture for governance contributes to strengthening inclusion for women youth and marginalized people which is vital for resilience it recognizes the differences between varied stresses on water and food systems and enables tailored policymaking to adapt to local risks 21 institutions within polycentric systems have the capacity to act semi autonomously simultaneously which enables adaptable rapid and inclusive responses to local threats to water security that could rapidly escalate across agricultural supply chains 14 27 where different polycentric governance institutions have overlapping interests across these nested systems there is a need for effective platforms for negotiation that promote cooperation across the system as well as support robust conflict resolution mechanisms 14 the potential for novel polycentric governance systems at scale has been identified for groundwater usage in sub saharan africa 13 traditional participatory approaches provide concrete examples of polycentric approaches to water management at a local level the muang fai 62 and subak 95 irrigation systems of northern thailand and bali and the qanats 63 of iran provide examples of traditional communal management systems still in place that have undergone little change for generations cross coalition coordination in collaborative environmental governance processes that seek to manage water in the colorado river basin is a recent example of a polycentric approaches 50 these systems encapsulate elements of responsiveness flexibility and equitable water sharing and distribution mechanisms there are however lessons to be learnt in promoting polycentric governance structures all part of a continual learning process that allows for improvements and course adjustment the development of water user associations wuas as a means of democratizing irrigation management is emblematic of a polycentric approach to governance and inclusiveness with many different examples found in the developed world whilst this approach has been promoted in the process of irrigation reform in many developing and emerging economies its impact has been mixed due to challenges of developing effective and sustainable institutions and can compete with other formal and customary rules and mechanisms 1 polycentric governance structures would facilitate the emergence of viable water resource institutions that are more transparent accountable efficient responsive sustainable adequately resourced and geographically contextualized and would support improved governance where current arrangements are fragmented or weak however polycentric governance is also costly and subject to power dynamics 61 further since water risks under climate change fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable such an approach to water resilient food systems would encapsulate a strong lens on equity and local communities water resilient food systems should factor in the environmental and ethical costs associated with food systems 4 enabling continual innovation new knowledge learning and dissemination water resilient food systems have embedded within them an ethos of continual innovation and learning along with access to knowledge and the skills and capacity to utilize knowledge in managing dynamically changing risks they foster systems thinking knowledge sharing and continual learning that is used to inform decision making the development promotion and use of climate and water information systems and the implementation of robust monitoring systems supports and contributes to adaptive management across the entire food system to make use of information water resilient food systems need to incorporate the attributes of continual learning and associated feedback mechanisms that allow for improvements and course adjustment there is a range of information knowledge and technological innovations and tools that could be used in promoting water resilience in food systems for example the concept of follow the water through recent technological advances in real time monitoring of flows using earth observation tools 23 provides critical information required to build robust water accounting systems that can be used in decision making processes 86 demystification of hydrogeology combined with community norms and institutional reforms to manage groundwater as social ecological commons in maharashtra india has been shown to be effective in addressing over exploitation of groundwater resources 51 in addition traditional indicators used in the past such as water collection storage and infiltration with traditional rainwater harvesting will need to be re thought and expanded upon under climate change since efficiency is not necessarily an indicator of resilience particularly from the perspective of justice of marginalised peoples 25 whilst the information and communications technology ict revolution and the emergence of artificial intelligence ai will play a significant role in supporting water resilient food systems with baseline data and evidence for the effectiveness of different management interventions there is a need to ensure that indigenous solutions in water management are incorporated into the solutions mix rainwater harvesting systems step wells persian wheels etc have been shown to be effective solutions for managing water resources there is a need to revive and mainstream these approaches in the mix of options to be considered indigenous solutions often present a distinct diagnosis of water resilience water management technologies practices and water governance that sometimes clashes with global national and local systems of governance 59 28 ensuring that indigenous knowledge principles and values is given equal standing alongside other forms of knowledge will help address issues of environmental justice considerations when enabling continual innovation new knowledge learning and dissemination 59 innovation is not confined to technology but can include practices policies institutions and incentives advances in incentive based systems and financial instruments have provided the enabling environment to facilitate behaviour change adoption of improved practices and approaches that contribute to water resilient food systems occurs where there is a clear benefit to the individual these being primarily economic 70 however the adoption of practices and approaches that have a public and social good are often more difficult to achieve and less attractive due to perceived limited immediate benefits e g financial and in general require incentivization 16 innovations in incentive based approaches that include payment for ecosystem services pes and conditional transfer approaches have been key mechanisms in support of improved resource management that can have positive impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources generated in landscapes examples include conservation reserve program crp 85 in the usa the grain to green program gtgp and the grain to bamboo program gtbp in china 22 the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mgnrega in india 45 the combined actions under eu common agricultural policy and 3rd cycle ec water frame work directives 2022 2027 and the procurement and public distribution of millets in odisha 44 there are currently over 550 pes programs globally steadily increasing in number with total annual expenditures that could soon reach over us 40 billion 74 contrasting this 540bn in global subsidies are given to farmers every year of which 90 are viewed as harmful 89 despite their potential formal water markets and other incentive based approaches to water management have struggled to scale up beyond pilot initiatives due to political resistance financing shortfalls and data deficits while the limitations of water markets are important to recognise c f 34 recent advances in our understanding of incentives for sustainable water use can help to overcome persistent barriers that have hindered past efforts 26 emerging research on financial and investment instruments to support positive environmental outcomes 12 holds significant promise to support water resilience in food systems 5 incorporating diversity and redundancy living resilience achieving resilient water systems that support food systems requires maintaining diversity and redundancy amongst component parts from water landscapes to governance institutions 11 17 diversity and redundancy provide a range of options to respond and adapt to changing circumstances over both the short and long term 32 within most current food systems prioritization has promoted leanness and optimisation over system flexibility large scale production technologies and global trade of inputs have been successful at maximizing output by simplifying and centralizing agricultural techniques but have created narrow and brittle systems at the expense of risks associated with climate change and biodiversity loss 68 these technologies have also emphasised the power asymmetries between farmers who can command such investments and those who cannot by encouraging and embracing diversity and social ecological complexity agricultural production techniques can be made more flexible incorporating broad and nimble adaptive capacity ibid and building systemic resilience 73 58 evidence from the mediterranean on nature based solutions suggests that they have been effective in reducing water demand improving soil fertility and have reduced erosion through the use of cover crops and agroforestry based systems 82 the adoption of regenerative agricultural approaches can help address land degradation and biodiversity loss whilst supporting diverse productive and integrated farming systems it provides the opportunity to conserve and value ecological diversity and connectivity promote economic diversity and guard against maladaptive engineering 77 the lack of progress in reversing the global decline in biodiversity is partly due to a mismatch between how living nature is conceived and valued by the conservation movement on the one hand and by many different people including marginalized communities on the other requiring a pluralistic perspective on biodiversity 67 a challenge of incorporating diversity and redundancy is that many governance and economic models linked to food systems and water are built around a focus on optimization and short termism 18 88 24 optimization is often more cost effective than redundancy and diversity in the short term and communicating the long term and short term trade offs to decision makers is often a challenge c f 49 6 ensuring system preparedness achieving water resilient food systems will require prioritizing preparedness a fundamental shift away from the current reactionary responses 6 in a changing world where future shocks and stresses cannot be perfectly predicted resilience can be built by focusing more on preparedness and increasing the range of adaptive capacities 11 rather than trying to orchestrate precise response plans to specific predicted situations in preparing for extreme events there are a range of tools and approaches that would assist in reducing their impact these include long term climate forecasting and early warning systems tools that would allow producers water managers and other decision makers to make tactical decisions 3 continual mapping of temporal and spatial trends of emerging water scarcity establishing routine water accounting approaches at a national and sub national level and adapting agricultural water management to water scarcity and flooding and increasing water demand driven by rising temperatures proactive approaches to water management have also been evidenced to be cheaper than responding to eventual shocks 6 understanding and predicting how risks will cascade across water systems between regions and economies and understanding potential water agriculture tipping points and in some case opportunities that can assist in highlighting the myriad ways in which actors need to prepare 48 in order to support a preparedness agenda there is a need for transparency in data availability accountability in data management and collection a change in data governance and a shift in how investments for resilience are viewed there are significant gaps in data collection across water systems worldwide an increasingly important approach that can address this impasse is through citizen science and the citizen state interface in data collection crop water budgeting successes in parts of india 29 and africa 70 are evidence towards addressing this gap elsewhere there is an important opportunity in making existing data sets more accessible where presently they are not for such reasons as concerns over miss use of the information in disputes accessible data sets and open access platforms can also help promote cross sectoral engagement and collaboration around complex systems problems including water resilience 52 7 plan for the long term throughout the world we find water infrastructure that was built thousands of years ago from the aqueducts of ancient rome or the incans to the irrigation channels of mesopotamia or the khmer empire many investment decisions in water and food systems have long term consequences infrastructure in particular can shape development for decades or centuries a duration that often extends beyond infrastructure s lifetime because the economic system reorganizes itself around them 35 water resilient food systems must proactively plan for and adapt to system changes over both short and long timescales 71 climate change is making the water cycle increasingly erratic highlighting the lack of resilience in our current built infrastructure it is likely to increase the frequency of extreme weather that will negatively impact agricultural production capacity 7 one potential impact is multiple breadbasket failures if for example the jetstream stalls over key food producing regions causing prolonged droughts 92 earth has already been affected by two consecutive heatwaves across the entire northern hemisphere in 2018 and 2020 water resilient food systems should be built on a strong evidence base by potential long term stresses hard and soft infrastructure and governance systems should then be designed to meet tests to resilience over a long time horizon rather than focusing on present day stresses there is general agreement that many of the natural cycles and systems that must be maintained to promote resilience are not valued within financial models in accordance with their critical role in investment longevity there are continuing debates over the monetization of nature in theory and also persistent practical challenges due to the need to effectively monitor audit and compare impacts across biodiversity water and human rights as a transformational step greater value should be attributed to the role these essential natural processes including sustainable water management play and every effort should be made in incorporating the true value of nature into financial and investment models future proofing water and food systems will require a step change in approach by policy and decision makers that shifts to preparedness for the long term 58 this requires a change in commitment by political leadership and governmental responsibility that needs to be driven by new structures of incentives that reward long term value creation instead of short term crises management and returns human rights based approaches are being considered to identify and assess impacts of large scale agriculture and water use especially for countries actively importing high water footprint goods 60 previous studies of incentive take up have found that successful initiatives are designed with specific target stakeholders in mind rather than more generalized incentives 69 further current incentives within food systems tend to reward short term optimization for agricultural output 68 there is a need to shift incentive systems to enhance the resilience of our water and food systems longer term planning and approaches also cut across key dimensions of justice and ethics linked to water resilience for example when natural systems and water resilience are protected over the long term they can help to ensure the continuity of indigenous culture and they protect the myriad of core indigenous values that water connects with and this in turn can help direct water governance 10 shifting away from short term financially driven incentives and planning will require a transformational restructuring of what is seen as success across the finance world as well as across governance institutions there is the explicit requirement for agriculture to be profitable and provide short term returns however there is the need for incentives to transform to more sustainable and resilient systems this will require political will that is not currently present 8 concluding remarks building consensus around what sustainable transition pathways for food systems constitute is difficult due to the complexity of these systems in the many different contexts a lack of knowledge of the impacts of transitions across economies and the diverse and sometimes competing incentives present across the wide diversity of stakeholders mindsets and mental maps need to be challenged to break down the silos separating communities of practice in water and food sectors the table initiative is an example of a dialogue platform that attempts to overcome barriers by providing a space for inclusive debates on the future of food 81 instilling resilience will require building adaptive capacity across stakeholders so that there is a range of assets to draw upon flexibility to change strategies ability to organize and act collectively learning to recognize change and the agency to determine whether to change or not 15 as well as safeguards and means of recourse to address increased vulnerability polycentric governance offers one model to deliver these ways of building adaptive capacity through organized collective capacity and coalition building 21 enhancing stakeholders adaptive capacity requires collaboration between many different systems and policy departments which is complex and difficult to implement in practice and can result in trade offs 87 there are also complex structures of regulatory and legal institutions that can create barriers to responding in flexible ways to changing circumstances 15 finding new ways of managing water and food systems will need to support the transformation of current patterns of production and consumption towards more resilient practices this will require innovation ecosystems 41 whereby new approaches are funded evaluated and the results shared across governance structures that support scaling however there are numerous barriers to scaling innovation across water and food systems they include national and local regulatory restrictions concerns of possible risks of adopting new technologies and a lack of access to capital all of these stifle innovative and experimental approaches to water management 2 as uncertainty increases with climate change our ability to identify the most likely and credible future water regime among a wide range of possibilities recedes due to non stationarity it is becoming harder to assign probabilities of future events with confidence limits and to then weigh alternative decisions instead the best options for managing water are those that are robust because they show satisfactory performance across a wide range of possible futures 57 if such robustness can then be complemented by flexibility the ability to respond to unexpected future events changes in climatic and hydrological patterns and residual risk is retained 77 achieving the transformation to water resilient food systems will require difficult decisions negotiation of trade offs based on accurate transparent and accepted data significant investments across food and water systems and in the generation of new knowledge through research and its application it will also require an enabling environment building a compact between government communities producers and the private sector and the political will to stay the course further women youth and communities including large and smallholder farmers will need to be at the centre of decision making financial allocations for implementation and governance if transforming food systems are to be water resilient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
