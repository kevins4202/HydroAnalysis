5170,reservoir storage helps manage hydrological variability increasing predictability and productivity of water supply however there are inevitable tradeoffs with control of high frequency variability coming at the expense of robustness to low frequency variability tightly controlling variability can reduce incentives to maintain adaptive capacity needed during events that exceed design thresholds with multiple dimensions of change projected for many water supply systems globally increased knowledge on the role of design and operational choices in balancing short term control and long term adaptability is needed here we investigated how the scale of reservoir storage relative to demands and streamflow variability and reservoir operating rules interact to mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands to address these questions we examined three water supply systems that have faced changing conditions the colorado river in the western united states the melbourne water supply system in southeastern australia and the western cape water supply system in south africa moreover we parameterize a sociohydrological model of reservoir dynamics using time series from the three case studies above we then used the model to explore the impacts of storage and operational rules we found that larger storage volumes lead to a greater time before the shortage is observed but that this time is not consistently used for adaptation additionally our modeling results show that operating rules that trigger withdrawal decreases sooner tend to increase the probability of an adaptive response the findings from this model are bolstered by the three case studies while there are many factors influencing the response to water stress our results demonstrate the importance of i evaluating design and operational choices in concert and ii examining the role of information salience in adapting water supply systems to changing conditions keywords drought reservoir robustness fragility system dynamics sociohydrology 1 introduction a prolonged drought affected the western cape region south africa region from 2014 to 2017 and the city of cape town experienced an extreme water crisis approaching day zero i e when there would be no stored water to deliver otto et al 2018 a couple of years before between 2014 and 2015 extended areas of sao paolo brazil received water only two days per week during a severe but not unprecedented drought muller 2018 otto et al 2015 in both cases extensive systems of reservoirs aqueducts canals and pumps engineered to reliably supply water along with the organizations responsible for management and operation were unable to meet water demands during extreme drought conditions otto et al 2015 2018 increasing variability of streamflow and growing water consumption intensify the risk of water stress and shortage georgakakos et al 2012a georgakakos et al 2012b rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2000 since reservoirs are typically designed based on historic conditions their ability to buffer streamflow variability is expected to decline in the coming decades georgakakos et al 2012a georgakakos et al 2012b in addition to reducing the impacts of streamflow variability the buffer provided by reservoirs can maintain stability in water supply as conditions change for example as demands increase stored water mitigates the risk of water shortage and allows time for adaptive actions such as demand management or acquisition of new supplies similarly they can provide a buffer as changes in climate or upstream developments increase the variability of streamflow or reduce average streamflow the performance of reservoir systems is influenced not only by the designed characteristics of the physical infrastructure but also by the reservoir operating rules that guide reservoir managers in balancing multiple objectives including maximizing present benefits while minimizing future risks you and cai 2008a under conditions of low streamflow or high demand reservoir operators must determine how to balance present and future impacts of water shortage there are multiple ways of formulating this decision problem bower et al 1962 developed one approach known as standard operating policy sop under sop the releases are made as close to the quantity demanded as feasible you and cai 2008a sop is the optimal policy to minimize the expected cost of water shortages when the cost function is linear however the cost of water shortage often increases non linearly draper and lund 2004 gal 1979 hedging policy responds to the fact that large shortages have disproportionate impacts by accepting a small reduction in releases to reduce the risk of a severe shortage later bower et al 1962 sop results in lower shortage frequency while hedging results in a lower maximum shortage magnitude cancelliere et al 1998 there are many forms of hedging which vary in both complexity and goals including policies developed for multi reservoir systems and to meet ecosystem goals adams et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 simply put both sop and hedging identify conditions which trigger a reduction in releases and specify the degree of reduction as a function of the system state serving as a feedback controller for the system controlling variability aims to increase predictability and productivity anderies 2015 reservoirs combine two approaches for controlling variability a modification of system structure i e the addition of storage and feedback control which acts to reduce variability i e the operational rules fig 1 in particular the combination of structural and feedback approaches such as those applied in reservoir systems is very effective at reducing high frequency variability however there are inevitable tradeoffs with control of high frequency variability coming at the expense of robustness to low frequency variability bode 1945 csete and doyle 2002 examples of tradeoffs that have been identified in water systems are the levee effects and other safe development paradoxes burton et al 1968 di baldassarre et al 2018 viglione et al 2014 research in social ecological systems suggests that tightly controlling short term variability generates fragilities in the long term by suppressing information needed for adaptation carpenter et al 2015 ecological systems are not a perfect analogy for heavily engineered human dominated systems in contrast to ecological systems in engineered systems information can be deliberately collected and directed to key decision makers or archived for later use information on the state of the system is necessary but insufficient to inform response to changing conditions just as a thermostat senses the temperature and compares it to the goal temperature to determine when to heat or cool a space operators use information on the state of water supply system e g current demands volume of stored water forecasted inflows to inform actions such as water withdrawals and opening spillways however when it comes to changing the rules e g enacting new demand management policies altering reservoir operating rules the availability of information is insufficient as rule change requires aligning attention and resources in a policy making environment with competing priorities and limited resources adaptive action can be both financially and politically costly creating incentives to delay response to changing conditions even in cases where the need for change is acknowledged e g tenney 2018 it can be challenging to act because substantial policy change requires political and financial support as well as a technical motivation garcia et al 2019 treuer et al 2017 in other words to overcome policy making inertia the information must be both available and salient eshbaugh soha 2006 salience refers to the observation that when attention is directed to one part of the environment that part is given disproportionate weight in decision making kahneman and tversky 1979 the concept of salience is valuable in understanding the link between a change in water demand or supply and policy action because increasing the salience of an issue can change policy makers and consumers cost benefit calculations under risk bordalo et al 2012 research on stochastic environmental processes such as flooding or wildfire shows that the occurrence of extreme events redirects attention increasing the weigh these risks are given in decision making dessaint and matray 2015 hand et al 2015 in the water supply sector increased water issue salience is positively correlated with the implementation of demand management policies and lower per capita water demand garcia and islam 2019 quesnel and ajami 2017 water supply systems are multi level systems within a nested hierarchical structure with multiple subsystems operating at a range of scales ostrom and janssen 2005 pahl wostl 2009 intervention at one level in the system to control the variability of key flows reduces the incentives for investment in adaptive capacity elsewhere in the system burton et al 1968 white 1945 though information related rules and norms influence these decisions adaptive capacity in water supply systems takes many forms across system levels from household storage tanks and farm grain stores to regional levee and reservoir systems large scale reservoirs decrease the variability of streamflow enabling lower variability in agriculture industrial production and domestic water service altering the incentives to invest in and maintain adaptive capacity at other levels di baldassarre et al 2018 in other words reservoirs are embedded in ecological and social systems that become fine tuned for efficiency at a low level of variability carlson and doyle 2002 under changing conditions many reservoir systems will reach a threshold beyond which they can no longer attenuate as much variability and will pass along greater variability to other levels of the system reservoirs as intended decrease the frequency of drought impacts on water usage and can temporarily mask reductions in reliability by providing a buffer as the ratio of demands to supplies rises or variability increases by delaying impact even when information on supply and or demand change is available to decision makers it may have lower salience as impacts are differed and delay adaptive action this delay increases the scale of corrective action needed further both infrastructure expansion and demand management policy can generate substantial opposition feldman 2009 muller 2018 slowing and sometimes halting action delays are fundamental features of dynamical systems with storage and can have either positive or negative effects on system dynamics delays can cause oscillation overshooting of system capacity and subsequent overcorrection and instability or moderate variability and allow decision makers time to respond to change sterman 2000 in sum reservoirs both buffer variability and postpone response by delaying information and impact garcia et al 2016 importantly the rules and norms on information collection information processing and decision making shape these tradeoffs and how environmental variability shapes policy change anderies et al 2018 reservoir operating rules are one example of the set of rules and norms shaping this relationship the tradeoffs in tightly controlling hydrological variability with reservoirs combined with the role of rules in shaping those tradeoffs motivates this analysis and raises questions about how decisions made in designing the reservoir and its operating rules influence this phenomenon in this paper we address two specific questions 1 how does the scale of reservoir storage relative to demands and streamflow variability affect long term reliability 2 how do reservoir operating rules in place mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands we address these questions by applying a sociohydrological model to three cases of reservoir operation under change after evaluating model adequacy through case application we explore the model state space through a sensitivity analysis in order to address both questions in more general terms this paper is organized as follows first we describe three cases to illustrate delay effects associated with reservoirs the colorado river reservoir system the western cape water supply system and the melbourne water supply reservoir system second we present a simple model of reservoir operations which is applied to each case to analyze the effects of reservoir capacity and operation on long term performance patterns then we use the model to explore the state space through a sensitivity analysis lastly we discuss the results and limitations of the study and summarize our conclusions 2 case studies we address the research questions in the context of three cases the colorado river reservoir system in the western united states western cape water supply system in cape town south africa and the melbourne water supply reservoir system in southeastern australia we have selected these cases to explore how infrastructure design i e capacity and policy choices i e operational rules interact in a range of scales hydro climatic regimes and governance contexts using a sociohydrological model 2 1 colorado river reservoir system western united states the colorado river watershed spans 630 000 km2 including seven u s states and mexico and supplies water to 40 million people irrigates 22 000 km2 and provides 4200 megawatts of electricity generation capacity usbr 2012 the watershed is predominately semi arid with average precipitation around 400 mm year christensen and lettenmaier 2007 there are numerous reservoirs on the main stem of the colorado river with an approximate total capacity of 74 000 gl 60 million acre foot maf or four times the average annual flow rajagopalan et al 2009 lake mead 34 000 gl 27 6 maf and lake powell 32 000 gl 26 2 maf are multipurpose reservoirs providing water supply flood control and hydropower that together account for 89 of the main stem storage capacity the maximum surface area of these two reservoirs ares is 1298 km2 the partitioning use and management of the colorado river is governed by a collection of federal and state statutes interstate compacts international treaties court decisions and contracts with the federal government known as the law of the river morris et al 1997 water allocations to each of the basin states were set by the 1922 colorado river compact usbr 1922 and the 1928 boulder canyon project act and mexico s allocation was set by the 1944 mexican water treaty these allocations totaling 20 300 gl 16 5 maf were based average annual flow at lees ferry arizona of around 21 000 gl 17 0 maf which was computing using the early 20th century streamflow data available at the time and ignoring inconvenient evidence of historic droughts kuhn and fleck 2019 macdonald 2010 in the years since it has become clear that the estimation of the long term average flow was based on a historically wet period the long term average flow is currently estimated around 20 200 gl 16 4 maf which is less than the allocated quantity usbr 2012 for many years this structural deficit was not obvious as some states were not using their full allocation growing demand brought the structural deficit to light especially during drought note water use in fig 1c does include mexico s water use as the population data was not available between 2000 and 2014 river flows have been 19 below the 1906 1999 average fig 2 a udall and overpeck 2017 in response the basin states negotiated the 2007 interim guidelines for lower basin shortages which allocated shortages among the basin states and incentivized conservation grant 2008 the shortage guidelines effectively reduced water use but reservoir levels continued to fall as the drought persisted by the beginning of 2018 lakes mead and powell were collectively 35 full compared to 70 full in 2000 fig 2b the u s bureau of reclamation responsible for operating the river s water supply reservoirs has warned that without action the lake mead could drop to dead storage by the mid 2020 s james 2018 the basin states negotiated a temporary drought contingency plan in 2019 sullivan et al 2019 however an estimated 1 6 1 2 of the decrease in streamflow during the 2000 s drought is due to above average temperatures and projections of a continued rise in temperature increase the possibility of long term streamflow decline or aridification in the basin udall and overpeck 2017 given this potential and the structural deficit more than a temporary drought plan is needed to restore stability to the basin in the long term 2 2 melbourne water supply reservoir system southeastern australia melbourne is the capital of the state of victoria in south eastern australia the city is located beside the large port philip bay approximately 60 km from the sea it extends toward the dandenong and the macedon ranges the mornington peninsula and the yarra valleyrise the annual rainfall is about 660 mm evenly distributed through the year with a slight maximum in october zhou et al 2000 water for consumption in victoria is withdrawn from reservoirs streams and aquifers under entitlements issued by the victorian government and authorized under the water act 1989 victoria state government 1989 fig 3 a b the water supply system for melbourne relies on 10 storage reservoirs with a total capacity of 1812 gl the maximum surface area of these reservoirs ares is 241 km2 there are two types of storage reservoirs i on stream reservoirs and ii off stream reservoirs which receive water transferred from on stream reservoirs or other sources melbourne is the second most populous city of australia and its water supply history is an example of how reservoir expansions can enable increased water consumptions di baldassarre et al 2018 fig 3d the thomson reservoir is the most recent and was built to drought proof melbourne after a period of drought occurred in the years 1982 1983 by increasing storage capacity of 250 the millennium drought occurred in the period 2001 2009 fig 2a and it was the worst drought on record for southeast australia van dijk et al 2013 the river ecosystems and irrigated dryland agriculture in victoria and the murray darling were especially hard hit leblanc et al 2012 the drought contributed to compulsory water restrictions increased electricity prices and major bushfires the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics and science estimated that annual drought losses exceeded a 5 billion from 2006 to 2007 in terms of the gross value of agricultural production australian bureau of agricultural resource economics 2008 the drought also had a social cost e g 6000 jobs were lost and farmers were increasingly suffering from depression and exhaustion sherval et al 2014 in the melbourne metropolitan area different strategies to decrease demand and increase the supply were pursued for instance desalination and water recycling plants were built fig 3c water use restrictions included banning consumptive activities e g car washing and promoting more efficient water use e g requirements for shutoff valves on hoses besides these temporary restrictions the victoria uniform drought water restrictions guidelines outlined permanent restrictions low et al 2015 2 3 western cape water supply system south africa the metropolitan area of cape town is located on the cape peninsula within the cape floristic region of south africa most of cape town s suburbs are within the large flat plain that joins the cape peninsula with the mainland i e the cape flats neighborhood the geology of the region consists of a rising marine plain the climate is mediterranean characterized by warm dry summers and cool wet winters with strong winds the nearby table mountain creates multiple local microclimates with average annual rainfall ranging from about 400 mm in the wind swept cape flats to up to 1000 mm in the nearby mountain slopes in and around constantia brown and magoba 2009 the metropolitan area of cape town includes over 40 towns in south africa the population increased by approximately 64 since 1996 koopman and de buys 2018 it is estimated that about 14 of the total population lives in informal settlements either integrated in high income suburbs or on the periphery of the city currie et al 2017 the city s water is supplied by the western cape water supply system which includes six major reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 898 gl 99 6 of the total the largest one is the theewaterskloof dam on the sonderend river with a storage capacity of 480 gl equal to 41 of the total storage the berg river dam the most recent addition completed in 2009 increased storage from 768 gl to the present capacity the maximum surface area of these reservoirs ares is 67 km2 some dams are managed by the national department of water and sanitation dws and some by the city of cape town cct the 2015 2017 drought was the worst on record fig 4 a otto et al 2018 the drought threatened to cut off tap water to around 4 million people fig 4c as the water stress prompted the dramatic day zero narrative attracting attention at the national and international level the drought was caused by the lowest rainfall since the 1880s wolski 2018 the lack of rainfall caused a sharp drop of reservoir storage fig 4b to get through the drought the dws introduced restrictions to maintain dam levels above 15 though water can be extracted to 10 in 2016 the dws initially imposed a 20 restriction on domestic and agriculture water use domestic water restriction was increased to 40 in october 2017 and then to 45 in december 2017 day zero was estimated to be in april 2018 and the campaign to avoid it began in january 2018 in february 2018 the water supply was limited to 50 l per capita per day leading people to queue to get water from sources drill private boreholes and buy bottled water in march 2018 the mayor declared the cct a disaster area the reduction in water consumption fig 3c prevented reservoir depletion then the occurrence of rainfall replenished the dams allowing to cancel the day zero campaign the economic impact was estimated around us 200 million muller 2018 3 methodology the methodology is presented in three steps model development model scaling and model application 3 1 model description the model described here is adapted from garcia et al 2016 minor modifications are made to the withdrawal and population modules the model can be applied with a range of time steps and is here applied with an annual time step streamflow q l3 t 1 is modeled using a first order autoregressive model ar1 parameterized by mean μh l3 t 1 standard deviation σh l3 t 1 and lag one autocorrelation ρh unitless eq 1 the final term at unitless is a normally distributed random variable with a mean zero and a standard deviation of one for three cases studies observed streamflow is used in place of modeled streamflow and the streamflow model would be adapted and adjusted as needed to reflect local streamflow patterns to explore projections or counterfactuals 1 q t ρ h q t 1 μ h σ h 1 ρ h 2 0 5 a t μ h at each time step the amount of water in storage v l3 in the reservoir is specified by a water balance equation where w is water withdrawal l3 t 1 eq 2 dam reservoir evaporation in volume is given multiplying the evaporation in depth l t 1 which is specific for each dam and the maximum area of the corresponding reservoirs ares l2 kohli and frenken 2015 for simplicity the use of water for irrigation purposes is not considered separately i e all water uses are lumped and there is a single water user on the river i e no competition or interaction amongst users 2 dv dt q t w t e t a res the evaporation in depth e is estimated as 3 e t f p e t where f is a weighting factor unitless which is 1 for open water surfaces and pet l t 1 is the monthly average potential evapotranspiration l t 1 in turn estimated from the saturated water pressure esat l 1 m t 2 mbar for this empirical equation dingman 2015 4 pet t 0 00409 e sat t 0 00409 6 11 exp 17 3 t t 237 3 t t t is the monthly average air temperature c for this empirical equation estimated for each site applying the inverse distance weighted approach to all temperature stations in the proximity of the site a modified logistic growth model is used to simulate population change in absence of significant demand change the population p persons nears the carrying capacity as growth occurs eq 5 however the impact of this approach to carrying capacity per capita demand d l3 t 1 multiplied by p and divided by μh does not have a continuous influence on growth rates rather the proximity to carrying capacity is not reflected in population time series during wet periods or when stored water is available for use however when shortages are occurring or have recently occurred this effect is hypothesized to be significant to capture the effect the carrying capacity term is multiplied by the shortage salience mt δng t 1 is the average population growth rate 5 dp dt δ ng 1 m t p t d t μ h p t water withdrawals w are determined by the reservoir operating policy in use eq 6 as there is only one source water withdrawn is equivalent to the quantity supplied we determine the withdrawal by employing linear hedging where kp is the slope of the release function for further background and illustrations see shih and revelle 1994 you and cai 2008a while simple linear hedging is found to be effective under realistic approximations of the utility function draper and lund 2004 when the hedging slope kp unitless is 1 equivalent to standard operating policy water withdrawals are equivalent to demands except if the available water is insufficient to meet demands in the latter case all water available is withdrawn when kp 1 reductions in withdrawals begin when available water is less than kpdp if streamflow plus stored water exceeds reservoir capacity excess water is discharged t t is the reference time here 1

quantity demanded by the users a shortage s l3 t 1 occurs 7 s t d t p t w t for d t p t w t 0 otherwise there are three terms in the shortage salience m unitless equation eq 8 the first term is the shortage impact which is a convex function of the shortage volume this term assumes that the least costly options to manage demand will be undertaken first and that the contribution of an event to shortage salience is proportional to the shortage cost this portion of the equation includes d l3 t 1 person 1 per capita demand at high levels of shortage salience only a large shortage will lead to a significant increase the adaptation cost is multiplied by one minus the current shortage awareness to account for this effect the third term in the equation incorporates the decay of shortage salience μs t 1 i e the decrease in attention to water shortage risk and its relevance to decision making that occurs over time di baldassarre et al 2013 m has a range from 0 to 1 8 dm dt s t d t p t 2 1 m t μ s m t the last equation is the change in per capita water demand eq 9 here per capita water demand is the total demand in the reservoir system service area divided by population it is inclusive of residential industrial and agricultural water usage there are two parts to the per capita equation demand change equation shock stimulated logistic decay with a maximum rate of α t 1 and a background decay rate β t 1 the decrease of per capita water demand accelerates in a time interval if water users are motivated by recent personal experience with water shortage i e m 0 as a certain amount of water is required for basic health and hygiene there is ultimately a floor to water efficiencies specified here as dmin l3t 1 reductions in per capita water usage become more challenging as this floor is approached a logistic decay function is used to capture this effect the background decay rate captures the increasing water efficiency observed in both urban and agricultural settings coomes et al 2010 international water management institute 2007 note that the background decay is context specific and in some cases it would not be relevant such as a developing region with expanding per capita water use 9 dd dt d t m t α 1 d min d t β 3 2 model scaling scaling is a technique to express a model in an equivalent dimensionless form anderies et al 2002 the key advantage of scaling analysis is that it reveals where combinations or ratios of parameters rather than single parameters control model behavior socio hydrological systems of the same class vary widely for example reservoir based water supply systems are present around the world but vary significantly in scale e g reservoir capacity population size total demand and variability e g streamflow and demand temporal variation scaled or dimensionless models of these systems can help to highlight the drivers of common or divergent dynamics additionally this technique decreases the amount of model input as a reduced number of parameter ratios rather than individual parameters must be specified the model presented above is scaled using the following relationships where x is used to indicate the non dimensional version of x 10 σ h σ h μ h 11 v max v max σ h t 12 d min d min μ h 13 e v e a res μ h the first relationship normalizes streamflow standard deviation by mean streamflow eq 10 the second normalizes reservoir capacity by the streamflow standard deviation and the reference time eq 11 the third normalizes the minimum demand by the mean streamflow eq 12 and the forth relationship normalizes the reservoir evaporation by the streamflow mean eq 13 note that d min μh is also equal to one over the carrying capacity of the system initial conditions can also be specified in non dimensional terms 14 p 0 p 0 d min μ h 15 v 0 v 0 v max 16 d 0 d 0 d min 3 3 model application the scaled model was applied to each of the three cases initial conditions were set based on the time series data and simulation start date historic streamflow was used for these cases in place of the autoregressive streamflow model parameters were informed by both quantitative and qualitative case data sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of parameter values selected on model output and interpretation lastly the scaled model was used to simulate a generic system to directly explore the influence of reservoir volume and operating rule choice on water supply reliability and the interactions between these two choices the hedging parameter kp was varied between 1 sop and 3 conservative hedging and the scaled reservoir volume storage volume relative to streamflow standard deviation was varied between 2 and 12 five hundred streamflow traces were generated using the lag 1 autoregressive model and the same five hundred traces were used with each parameter set to ensure comparability across the sensitivity analysis normalized values of parameters are reported in table 1 4 results 4 1 case results the socio hydrological model was run for the three case studies of the colorado river basin melbourne and the city of cape town the modeled water use reservoir storage issue salience and shortage volume are described below and compared to case data as the model is highly stylized the aim is not to fit observations precisely rather the aim is to assess the model s ability to qualitatively reproduce patterns sterman 2000 in three distinct hydrological and operational environments in the colorado river case multi years droughts occurred in the late 1970 s late 1980 s and the 2000 s fig 5 a the impact of drought on stored water is clear in both the reservoir storage observations fig 2b and the modeled storage fig 5b the model reproduced key features including the period of high storage from mid 1970 s to mid 1980 s a decline in the late 1980 s recovery in the late 1990 s and decline followed by stabilization in the 2000 s the model is parameterized for conservative hedging policy kp 3 this triggers water conservation well in anticipation of physical limits and is consistent with the case history over the study period basin wide water use increases before reaching a peak in 2001 fig 2c the increase in water use is driven by an increasing population fig 2d with higher water efficiency working against this trend coomes et al 2010 weather driven variation in demand as well as the ability of water users to substitute groundwater or alternative surface water sources increases the variability of water use e g porse et al 2017 while this simple stylized model cannot reproduce all observed variability in water use it does simulate increasing water use until the early 2000 s followed by a period of decrease and stabilization fig 5e further the model captures the trend in decreased demand per capita fig 5c we have no observational data on salience at the basin scale however since the early 2000 s there has been increased interest in demand management and development of alternate sources at the local level e g garcia and islam 2019 porse et al 2017 and increased inter state policy developed addressing shortage allocation department of the interior 2007 us bureau of reclamation 2018 the modeled salience shows a small increase in response to the late 1980 s drought and a sharp rise in the early 2000 s at the onset of intense drought fig 5d consistent with these local and regional patterns the shortage volume is representative of the variability in water availability fig 5f the model was then used to simulate reservoir management in melbourne in response to droughts fig 6 the streamflow shows two drought events occurring at the beginning of the 1980 s and in the late 1990 s into the 2000 s fig 3a the drought beginning in the late 1990 s known as the millennium drought stressed the water supply system leading to falling reservoir storage and decreased water use fig 3a b the model reproduced the key features including a period of above average storage from late 1980 s to mid 1990 s followed by rapidly falling storage from the late 1990 s into the first decade of the 2000 s fig 6b the hedging parameter kp 3 simulates a conservative policy and thus water conservation is employed in advance to reduce the risk of severe shortage this parameterization is consistent with the case history however the model simulation shows the minimum storage value at years 2005 2006 fig 6b three years before the actual minimum was observed fig 3b after a drop due to the first drought the water usage increases as the population increases before decreasing during the millennium drought fig 3d c the model captures the declining water use during the millennium drought but cannot reproduce water use patterns prior to the drought fig 6e as in the colorado river case salience is modeled but is not directly observed the first drought triggers a small increase in salience which fades as memory of the drought weakens then the more severe millennium drought prompts a larger increase in salience fig 6d high levels of salience persist throughout the drought though consistent with empirical studies of long drought peak levels are not maintained garcia et al 2019 the modeled pattern of salience is consistent with the case history including the implementation of water use restrictions during the early 1980 s drought only stage 1 water restriction were used the second drought was longer and more severe requiring a series of water restrictions first in 2002 the stage 1 water restriction was imposed then in january 2007 and in april 2007 water stage 3 and 3a restrictions were launched reflecting the rising interest in demand management the shortage volume represents the gap between supply and demand fig 6f in the city of cape town two drought events occurred a minor one in 2002 2003 and a major one in 2015 2017 fig 4a the impact in terms of water storage is evident for these droughts in both observations fig 4b and model results fig 7 b the model reproduces the observed reductions in storage in 2002 2003 2010 and 2015 2017 while it does not capture the moderate drop in 2005 figs 4b 7b the model is parameterized for a moderate hedging policy kp 1 5 this implies that water conservation is triggered in advance but not far in advance of physical limits this is confirmed by observed data as the reservoirs were nearly drained before water restrictions were issued observed water use follows an increasing trend until 2015 which tracks population growth however this trend is interrupted by periods of temporarily high use likely driven by climatic and economic variability fig 4c d while the model is not able to reproduce all features of the observed water use simulation results do reproduce the temporary decrease seen around 2005 and peak water use in 2015 followed by a decrease fig 7e there are no direct observations of salience in the area however the case history includes events likely to be correlated with increased salience of water issues treuer et al 2017 level 2 water restrictions were implemented in january 1 2005 later in the 2015 2017 drought the first restriction 20 was launched in 2016 then in october 2017 a 40 reduction was further launched up to the dramatic day in january 2018 when the day zero was estimated to occur in april of the same year the model simulates an increase in salience at around 2002 driven by the first drought salience from this event fades over time with moderate increase from subsequent droughts until rising sharply in 2014 with severe drought fig 7d 4 2 sensitivity analysis having gained confidence about the ability of the model to qualitatively simulate patterns in various hydrological and operational environments we apply the model to further address our research questions 1 how does the scale of reservoir storage affect long term reliability 2 how do reservoir operating rules in place mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands to explore the interaction of ratio between vmax and σh and the hedging factor kp we performed a sensitivity analysis running simulations of all combinations of these two parameters five hundred traces of stochastic streamflow generated by a lag 1 autoregressive model are used to understand performance across a range of streamflow patterns fig 8 shows the ratio of shortage volume to total demand over time across these simulations moving from left to right we can see the effect of increasing reservoir volume relative to the variability of streamflow fig 8 shows that the larger the reservoir the more shortage is delayed and the higher the maximum shortage moving from top to bottom we can examine the effects of changing operations from reactive sop or kp 1 to proactive kp 3 fig 8 shows that at higher values of kp shortages relative to total demand occur earlier but are lower in magnitude examining the full set of plots we can see an interesting phenomenon as we move diagonally from top left to bottom right along the diagonals in fig 8 the period of time before shortage occurs is constant but the magnitude increases additionally we see decreasing variability across the simulations as we move diagonally from top left to bottom right fig 9 a b summarizes the relationships between the two parameters kp and the ratio between vmax and σh and the mean and maximum shortage volumes over the simulation period first kp was sampled at 0 05 intervals and the ratio was sampled at 0 25 intervals to better assess changes across the range second mean and maximum shortage were computed for each simulation run finally local regression loess was applied to describe the relationship fig 9a shows a decrease in maximum shortage with a slight increase in mean shortage as kp increases this is consistent with the evidence that kp 1 is most effective at reducing average shortage volumes in the short term cancelliere et al 1998 garcia et al 2016 fig 9b shows that maximum shortage increases substantially and mean shortage slightly increases as the ratio between vmax and σh increases fig 9c d illustrate the relationship between kp and ratio between vmax and σh and the lag between demand surpassing average supply and the first occurrence of shortage note that in some cases the first shortage occurs before demand surpassing average supply when low flows coincide with low storage resulting in a negative lag a negative lag is evidence of reduced demand in anticipation of demand overshooting average supply or a proactive response a positive lag implies a demand reduction after overshoot or a reactive response fig 9c shows that as kp increases the lag decreases with negative lags occurring with kp 1 75 fig 9d illustrates an increasing lag with a higher vmax and σh ratio examined together fig 8 and fig 9 demonstrate that the choice of more conservative hedging policy for reservoir operation can mitigate the unintended consequences of larger reservoir storage volumes 5 discussion and conclusions reservoir storage is intended to protect water users from the variability inherent in streamflow in each of the three cases we see that the ability of reservoir systems to buffer drought effects decreases as demand increases and or streamflow patterns shift this is of course to be expected however the impact is not felt immediately as the stored water intended to meet demands during drought can be used to fill the gap between supply and demand temporarily when kp is equal to one reductions in water use are not made until physically necessary i e insufficient water in inflow and storage to meet the full demand eq 6 when kp is increased reductions in withdrawals are triggered sooner raising salience and subsequently leading to reductions in per capita demand figs 8 and 9 the magnitude of both reductions in withdrawals and increases in salience are lower when kp is higher therefore the rate of change in demand is slower but importantly it starts sooner reducing demand sooner both slows the decline in and eventually stabilizes the volume of stored water making future abrupt reductions in water use less likely to be needed additionally the rate of demand change is important a rapid shift in water available for use would be a significant shock to economic and public health which water managers and reservoir operators would seek to avoid reservoir storage provides a buffer of time to adapt to changing conditions the sensitivity analysis illustrates this as larger storage volumes lead to a greater time before the shortage is observed figs 8 and 9 decision makers do not always use this time for adaptation as illustrated in the three cases in melbourne the response to intense drought and growing demand was fast and effective low et al 2015 and was accomplished via strict water restrictions which were launched during the millennium drought to avoid day zero while in cape town the response to growing demands only occurred late into a historic drought leading to water delivery reductions muller 2018 in the colorado river basin the story is more nuanced and not yet complete as stored water declined in the 2000 s lower basin states developed a collaborative agreement to reduce use as reservoir levels declined department of the interior 2007 while this agreement reduced the risk of draining the reservoir it proved to be insufficient prompting an addendum in 2018 the drought contingency plan sullivan et al 2019 further renegotiations to set operational rules beyond this are in process reservoir storage can help manage hydrological variability e g coping wamsler and brink 2014 as it dampens its effects but if not paired with appropriate operating rules and water management policy it has the potential to delay the actions and the countermeasures necessary to adapt to changing conditions we hypothesize that the ability of stored water to delay impacts reduces the salience of the problem increasing the challenge of major infrastructure or policy change and leading to delays in adaptation this delay is particularly problematic when external forces drive increases in demand or population increased streamflow variability or decreased streamflow di baldassarre et al 2018 additionally the salience of water stress information rather than just the presence of such information is important in understanding response garcia et al 2019 quesnel and ajami 2017 the absence of salient information on the limits of water supply means that the potential negative feedback loops that could drive corrective action remains un activated however water supply management consists of more than just physical infrastructure the rules used to operate reservoirs sometimes referred to as soft infrastructure anderies et al 2016 shape their performance by testing alternate values of the operating parameter kp we observe the effects of operational rules the relationship between increases in kp and decreasing shortage magnitude and increased frequency of shortages shown in figs 8 and 9 is the expected result of hedging policy you and cai 2008a you and cai 2008b what is novel here is how the storage volume and operating rules interact with each other and the broader system of water supply and use under hedging policy kp 1 water managers decrease withdrawals before it is physically required thus increasing the salience of water shortage risk at higher volumes of stored water this increases the probability of a timely adaptive response further figs 8 and 9 illustrate that the choice of operating rule can either exacerbate or alleviate the tendency to delay response with increased reservoir capacity in other words the advantages of large supply reservoirs such as the ability to buffer variability and thus alleviate the effects of drought can be achieved while minimizing the risk of delayed response to change by pairing large reservoirs with conservative hedging to create salience and prompt adaptive action while this is not the only way to drive increases in problem saliency through policy these results can inspire further investigation of policy design aimed at reducing delays in response to changing conditions particularly in contexts where changing environmental conditions significantly impacts the ability to meet societal goals while these analyses demonstrated the importance of storage volume and operating rules in explaining long term reservoir performance under changing conditions it is clear from the diversity of three cases that storage and operating rules alone do not determine the response a variety of other factors including institutional arrangements garcia et al 2019 financial resources hughes et al 2013 leadership skill pahl wostl et al 2007 the presence of motivated actors porter et al 2015 and risk perception dobbie and brown 2014 ridolfi et al 2019 all influence the nature and speed of policy response to changing conditions the three cases demonstrate the model s ability to reproduce key features though not all patterns in water use and storage the model presented here is unavoidably simplified leaving several opportunities for future improvements it does not account for the large number of options for water management from more sophisticated and time varying operating rules to source substitution further data collection covering both a broader range of variables and cases could inform such model refinements additionally the operational strategies of the reservoir are considered constant across time while in practice they often change in response to new knowledge performance and changing conditions though the operational strategy modeled here linear hedging policy is only an approximation it does offer insights into the effect of storage capacity and operational choices under changing conditions further this analysis highlights when a change in operation policies would be advantageous in sum the case applications and sensitivity analysis presented here illustrate how infrastructure and policy design choices combine in some cases non linearly to impact system performance credit authorship

5170,reservoir storage helps manage hydrological variability increasing predictability and productivity of water supply however there are inevitable tradeoffs with control of high frequency variability coming at the expense of robustness to low frequency variability tightly controlling variability can reduce incentives to maintain adaptive capacity needed during events that exceed design thresholds with multiple dimensions of change projected for many water supply systems globally increased knowledge on the role of design and operational choices in balancing short term control and long term adaptability is needed here we investigated how the scale of reservoir storage relative to demands and streamflow variability and reservoir operating rules interact to mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands to address these questions we examined three water supply systems that have faced changing conditions the colorado river in the western united states the melbourne water supply system in southeastern australia and the western cape water supply system in south africa moreover we parameterize a sociohydrological model of reservoir dynamics using time series from the three case studies above we then used the model to explore the impacts of storage and operational rules we found that larger storage volumes lead to a greater time before the shortage is observed but that this time is not consistently used for adaptation additionally our modeling results show that operating rules that trigger withdrawal decreases sooner tend to increase the probability of an adaptive response the findings from this model are bolstered by the three case studies while there are many factors influencing the response to water stress our results demonstrate the importance of i evaluating design and operational choices in concert and ii examining the role of information salience in adapting water supply systems to changing conditions keywords drought reservoir robustness fragility system dynamics sociohydrology 1 introduction a prolonged drought affected the western cape region south africa region from 2014 to 2017 and the city of cape town experienced an extreme water crisis approaching day zero i e when there would be no stored water to deliver otto et al 2018 a couple of years before between 2014 and 2015 extended areas of sao paolo brazil received water only two days per week during a severe but not unprecedented drought muller 2018 otto et al 2015 in both cases extensive systems of reservoirs aqueducts canals and pumps engineered to reliably supply water along with the organizations responsible for management and operation were unable to meet water demands during extreme drought conditions otto et al 2015 2018 increasing variability of streamflow and growing water consumption intensify the risk of water stress and shortage georgakakos et al 2012a georgakakos et al 2012b rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2000 since reservoirs are typically designed based on historic conditions their ability to buffer streamflow variability is expected to decline in the coming decades georgakakos et al 2012a georgakakos et al 2012b in addition to reducing the impacts of streamflow variability the buffer provided by reservoirs can maintain stability in water supply as conditions change for example as demands increase stored water mitigates the risk of water shortage and allows time for adaptive actions such as demand management or acquisition of new supplies similarly they can provide a buffer as changes in climate or upstream developments increase the variability of streamflow or reduce average streamflow the performance of reservoir systems is influenced not only by the designed characteristics of the physical infrastructure but also by the reservoir operating rules that guide reservoir managers in balancing multiple objectives including maximizing present benefits while minimizing future risks you and cai 2008a under conditions of low streamflow or high demand reservoir operators must determine how to balance present and future impacts of water shortage there are multiple ways of formulating this decision problem bower et al 1962 developed one approach known as standard operating policy sop under sop the releases are made as close to the quantity demanded as feasible you and cai 2008a sop is the optimal policy to minimize the expected cost of water shortages when the cost function is linear however the cost of water shortage often increases non linearly draper and lund 2004 gal 1979 hedging policy responds to the fact that large shortages have disproportionate impacts by accepting a small reduction in releases to reduce the risk of a severe shortage later bower et al 1962 sop results in lower shortage frequency while hedging results in a lower maximum shortage magnitude cancelliere et al 1998 there are many forms of hedging which vary in both complexity and goals including policies developed for multi reservoir systems and to meet ecosystem goals adams et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 simply put both sop and hedging identify conditions which trigger a reduction in releases and specify the degree of reduction as a function of the system state serving as a feedback controller for the system controlling variability aims to increase predictability and productivity anderies 2015 reservoirs combine two approaches for controlling variability a modification of system structure i e the addition of storage and feedback control which acts to reduce variability i e the operational rules fig 1 in particular the combination of structural and feedback approaches such as those applied in reservoir systems is very effective at reducing high frequency variability however there are inevitable tradeoffs with control of high frequency variability coming at the expense of robustness to low frequency variability bode 1945 csete and doyle 2002 examples of tradeoffs that have been identified in water systems are the levee effects and other safe development paradoxes burton et al 1968 di baldassarre et al 2018 viglione et al 2014 research in social ecological systems suggests that tightly controlling short term variability generates fragilities in the long term by suppressing information needed for adaptation carpenter et al 2015 ecological systems are not a perfect analogy for heavily engineered human dominated systems in contrast to ecological systems in engineered systems information can be deliberately collected and directed to key decision makers or archived for later use information on the state of the system is necessary but insufficient to inform response to changing conditions just as a thermostat senses the temperature and compares it to the goal temperature to determine when to heat or cool a space operators use information on the state of water supply system e g current demands volume of stored water forecasted inflows to inform actions such as water withdrawals and opening spillways however when it comes to changing the rules e g enacting new demand management policies altering reservoir operating rules the availability of information is insufficient as rule change requires aligning attention and resources in a policy making environment with competing priorities and limited resources adaptive action can be both financially and politically costly creating incentives to delay response to changing conditions even in cases where the need for change is acknowledged e g tenney 2018 it can be challenging to act because substantial policy change requires political and financial support as well as a technical motivation garcia et al 2019 treuer et al 2017 in other words to overcome policy making inertia the information must be both available and salient eshbaugh soha 2006 salience refers to the observation that when attention is directed to one part of the environment that part is given disproportionate weight in decision making kahneman and tversky 1979 the concept of salience is valuable in understanding the link between a change in water demand or supply and policy action because increasing the salience of an issue can change policy makers and consumers cost benefit calculations under risk bordalo et al 2012 research on stochastic environmental processes such as flooding or wildfire shows that the occurrence of extreme events redirects attention increasing the weigh these risks are given in decision making dessaint and matray 2015 hand et al 2015 in the water supply sector increased water issue salience is positively correlated with the implementation of demand management policies and lower per capita water demand garcia and islam 2019 quesnel and ajami 2017 water supply systems are multi level systems within a nested hierarchical structure with multiple subsystems operating at a range of scales ostrom and janssen 2005 pahl wostl 2009 intervention at one level in the system to control the variability of key flows reduces the incentives for investment in adaptive capacity elsewhere in the system burton et al 1968 white 1945 though information related rules and norms influence these decisions adaptive capacity in water supply systems takes many forms across system levels from household storage tanks and farm grain stores to regional levee and reservoir systems large scale reservoirs decrease the variability of streamflow enabling lower variability in agriculture industrial production and domestic water service altering the incentives to invest in and maintain adaptive capacity at other levels di baldassarre et al 2018 in other words reservoirs are embedded in ecological and social systems that become fine tuned for efficiency at a low level of variability carlson and doyle 2002 under changing conditions many reservoir systems will reach a threshold beyond which they can no longer attenuate as much variability and will pass along greater variability to other levels of the system reservoirs as intended decrease the frequency of drought impacts on water usage and can temporarily mask reductions in reliability by providing a buffer as the ratio of demands to supplies rises or variability increases by delaying impact even when information on supply and or demand change is available to decision makers it may have lower salience as impacts are differed and delay adaptive action this delay increases the scale of corrective action needed further both infrastructure expansion and demand management policy can generate substantial opposition feldman 2009 muller 2018 slowing and sometimes halting action delays are fundamental features of dynamical systems with storage and can have either positive or negative effects on system dynamics delays can cause oscillation overshooting of system capacity and subsequent overcorrection and instability or moderate variability and allow decision makers time to respond to change sterman 2000 in sum reservoirs both buffer variability and postpone response by delaying information and impact garcia et al 2016 importantly the rules and norms on information collection information processing and decision making shape these tradeoffs and how environmental variability shapes policy change anderies et al 2018 reservoir operating rules are one example of the set of rules and norms shaping this relationship the tradeoffs in tightly controlling hydrological variability with reservoirs combined with the role of rules in shaping those tradeoffs motivates this analysis and raises questions about how decisions made in designing the reservoir and its operating rules influence this phenomenon in this paper we address two specific questions 1 how does the scale of reservoir storage relative to demands and streamflow variability affect long term reliability 2 how do reservoir operating rules in place mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands we address these questions by applying a sociohydrological model to three cases of reservoir operation under change after evaluating model adequacy through case application we explore the model state space through a sensitivity analysis in order to address both questions in more general terms this paper is organized as follows first we describe three cases to illustrate delay effects associated with reservoirs the colorado river reservoir system the western cape water supply system and the melbourne water supply reservoir system second we present a simple model of reservoir operations which is applied to each case to analyze the effects of reservoir capacity and operation on long term performance patterns then we use the model to explore the state space through a sensitivity analysis lastly we discuss the results and limitations of the study and summarize our conclusions 2 case studies we address the research questions in the context of three cases the colorado river reservoir system in the western united states western cape water supply system in cape town south africa and the melbourne water supply reservoir system in southeastern australia we have selected these cases to explore how infrastructure design i e capacity and policy choices i e operational rules interact in a range of scales hydro climatic regimes and governance contexts using a sociohydrological model 2 1 colorado river reservoir system western united states the colorado river watershed spans 630 000 km2 including seven u s states and mexico and supplies water to 40 million people irrigates 22 000 km2 and provides 4200 megawatts of electricity generation capacity usbr 2012 the watershed is predominately semi arid with average precipitation around 400 mm year christensen and lettenmaier 2007 there are numerous reservoirs on the main stem of the colorado river with an approximate total capacity of 74 000 gl 60 million acre foot maf or four times the average annual flow rajagopalan et al 2009 lake mead 34 000 gl 27 6 maf and lake powell 32 000 gl 26 2 maf are multipurpose reservoirs providing water supply flood control and hydropower that together account for 89 of the main stem storage capacity the maximum surface area of these two reservoirs ares is 1298 km2 the partitioning use and management of the colorado river is governed by a collection of federal and state statutes interstate compacts international treaties court decisions and contracts with the federal government known as the law of the river morris et al 1997 water allocations to each of the basin states were set by the 1922 colorado river compact usbr 1922 and the 1928 boulder canyon project act and mexico s allocation was set by the 1944 mexican water treaty these allocations totaling 20 300 gl 16 5 maf were based average annual flow at lees ferry arizona of around 21 000 gl 17 0 maf which was computing using the early 20th century streamflow data available at the time and ignoring inconvenient evidence of historic droughts kuhn and fleck 2019 macdonald 2010 in the years since it has become clear that the estimation of the long term average flow was based on a historically wet period the long term average flow is currently estimated around 20 200 gl 16 4 maf which is less than the allocated quantity usbr 2012 for many years this structural deficit was not obvious as some states were not using their full allocation growing demand brought the structural deficit to light especially during drought note water use in fig 1c does include mexico s water use as the population data was not available between 2000 and 2014 river flows have been 19 below the 1906 1999 average fig 2 a udall and overpeck 2017 in response the basin states negotiated the 2007 interim guidelines for lower basin shortages which allocated shortages among the basin states and incentivized conservation grant 2008 the shortage guidelines effectively reduced water use but reservoir levels continued to fall as the drought persisted by the beginning of 2018 lakes mead and powell were collectively 35 full compared to 70 full in 2000 fig 2b the u s bureau of reclamation responsible for operating the river s water supply reservoirs has warned that without action the lake mead could drop to dead storage by the mid 2020 s james 2018 the basin states negotiated a temporary drought contingency plan in 2019 sullivan et al 2019 however an estimated 1 6 1 2 of the decrease in streamflow during the 2000 s drought is due to above average temperatures and projections of a continued rise in temperature increase the possibility of long term streamflow decline or aridification in the basin udall and overpeck 2017 given this potential and the structural deficit more than a temporary drought plan is needed to restore stability to the basin in the long term 2 2 melbourne water supply reservoir system southeastern australia melbourne is the capital of the state of victoria in south eastern australia the city is located beside the large port philip bay approximately 60 km from the sea it extends toward the dandenong and the macedon ranges the mornington peninsula and the yarra valleyrise the annual rainfall is about 660 mm evenly distributed through the year with a slight maximum in october zhou et al 2000 water for consumption in victoria is withdrawn from reservoirs streams and aquifers under entitlements issued by the victorian government and authorized under the water act 1989 victoria state government 1989 fig 3 a b the water supply system for melbourne relies on 10 storage reservoirs with a total capacity of 1812 gl the maximum surface area of these reservoirs ares is 241 km2 there are two types of storage reservoirs i on stream reservoirs and ii off stream reservoirs which receive water transferred from on stream reservoirs or other sources melbourne is the second most populous city of australia and its water supply history is an example of how reservoir expansions can enable increased water consumptions di baldassarre et al 2018 fig 3d the thomson reservoir is the most recent and was built to drought proof melbourne after a period of drought occurred in the years 1982 1983 by increasing storage capacity of 250 the millennium drought occurred in the period 2001 2009 fig 2a and it was the worst drought on record for southeast australia van dijk et al 2013 the river ecosystems and irrigated dryland agriculture in victoria and the murray darling were especially hard hit leblanc et al 2012 the drought contributed to compulsory water restrictions increased electricity prices and major bushfires the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics and science estimated that annual drought losses exceeded a 5 billion from 2006 to 2007 in terms of the gross value of agricultural production australian bureau of agricultural resource economics 2008 the drought also had a social cost e g 6000 jobs were lost and farmers were increasingly suffering from depression and exhaustion sherval et al 2014 in the melbourne metropolitan area different strategies to decrease demand and increase the supply were pursued for instance desalination and water recycling plants were built fig 3c water use restrictions included banning consumptive activities e g car washing and promoting more efficient water use e g requirements for shutoff valves on hoses besides these temporary restrictions the victoria uniform drought water restrictions guidelines outlined permanent restrictions low et al 2015 2 3 western cape water supply system south africa the metropolitan area of cape town is located on the cape peninsula within the cape floristic region of south africa most of cape town s suburbs are within the large flat plain that joins the cape peninsula with the mainland i e the cape flats neighborhood the geology of the region consists of a rising marine plain the climate is mediterranean characterized by warm dry summers and cool wet winters with strong winds the nearby table mountain creates multiple local microclimates with average annual rainfall ranging from about 400 mm in the wind swept cape flats to up to 1000 mm in the nearby mountain slopes in and around constantia brown and magoba 2009 the metropolitan area of cape town includes over 40 towns in south africa the population increased by approximately 64 since 1996 koopman and de buys 2018 it is estimated that about 14 of the total population lives in informal settlements either integrated in high income suburbs or on the periphery of the city currie et al 2017 the city s water is supplied by the western cape water supply system which includes six major reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 898 gl 99 6 of the total the largest one is the theewaterskloof dam on the sonderend river with a storage capacity of 480 gl equal to 41 of the total storage the berg river dam the most recent addition completed in 2009 increased storage from 768 gl to the present capacity the maximum surface area of these reservoirs ares is 67 km2 some dams are managed by the national department of water and sanitation dws and some by the city of cape town cct the 2015 2017 drought was the worst on record fig 4 a otto et al 2018 the drought threatened to cut off tap water to around 4 million people fig 4c as the water stress prompted the dramatic day zero narrative attracting attention at the national and international level the drought was caused by the lowest rainfall since the 1880s wolski 2018 the lack of rainfall caused a sharp drop of reservoir storage fig 4b to get through the drought the dws introduced restrictions to maintain dam levels above 15 though water can be extracted to 10 in 2016 the dws initially imposed a 20 restriction on domestic and agriculture water use domestic water restriction was increased to 40 in october 2017 and then to 45 in december 2017 day zero was estimated to be in april 2018 and the campaign to avoid it began in january 2018 in february 2018 the water supply was limited to 50 l per capita per day leading people to queue to get water from sources drill private boreholes and buy bottled water in march 2018 the mayor declared the cct a disaster area the reduction in water consumption fig 3c prevented reservoir depletion then the occurrence of rainfall replenished the dams allowing to cancel the day zero campaign the economic impact was estimated around us 200 million muller 2018 3 methodology the methodology is presented in three steps model development model scaling and model application 3 1 model description the model described here is adapted from garcia et al 2016 minor modifications are made to the withdrawal and population modules the model can be applied with a range of time steps and is here applied with an annual time step streamflow q l3 t 1 is modeled using a first order autoregressive model ar1 parameterized by mean μh l3 t 1 standard deviation σh l3 t 1 and lag one autocorrelation ρh unitless eq 1 the final term at unitless is a normally distributed random variable with a mean zero and a standard deviation of one for three cases studies observed streamflow is used in place of modeled streamflow and the streamflow model would be adapted and adjusted as needed to reflect local streamflow patterns to explore projections or counterfactuals 1 q t ρ h q t 1 μ h σ h 1 ρ h 2 0 5 a t μ h at each time step the amount of water in storage v l3 in the reservoir is specified by a water

weighted approach to all temperature stations in the proximity of the site a modified logistic growth model is used to simulate population change in absence of significant demand change the population p persons nears the carrying capacity as growth occurs eq 5 however the impact of this approach to carrying capacity per capita demand d l3 t 1 multiplied by p and divided by μh does not have a continuous influence on growth rates rather the proximity to carrying capacity is not reflected in population time series during wet periods or when stored water is available for use however when shortages are occurring or have recently occurred this effect is hypothesized to be significant to capture the effect the carrying capacity term is multiplied by the shortage salience mt δng t 1 is the average population growth rate 5 dp dt δ ng 1 m t p t d t μ h p t water withdrawals w are determined by the reservoir operating policy in use eq 6 as there is only one source water withdrawn is equivalent to the quantity supplied we determine the withdrawal by employing linear hedging where kp is the slope of the release function for further background and illustrations see shih and revelle 1994 you and cai 2008a while simple linear hedging is found to be effective under realistic approximations of the utility function draper and lund 2004 when the hedging slope kp unitless is 1 equivalent to standard operating policy water withdrawals are equivalent to demands except if the available water is insufficient to meet demands in the latter case all water available is withdrawn

quantity demanded by the users a shortage s l3 t 1 occurs 7 s t d t p t w t for d t p t w t 0 otherwise there are three terms in the shortage salience m unitless equation eq 8 the first term is the shortage impact which is a convex function of the shortage volume this term assumes that the least costly options to manage demand will be undertaken first and that the contribution of an event to shortage salience is proportional to the shortage cost this portion of the equation includes d l3 t 1 person 1 per capita demand at high levels of shortage salience only a large shortage will lead to a significant increase the adaptation cost is multiplied by one minus the current shortage awareness to account for this effect the third term in the equation incorporates the decay of shortage salience μs t 1 i e the decrease in attention to water shortage risk and its relevance to decision making that occurs over time di baldassarre et al 2013 m has a range from 0 to 1 8 dm dt s t d t p t 2 1 m t μ s m t the last equation is the change in per capita water demand eq 9 here per capita water demand is the total demand in the reservoir system service area divided by population it is inclusive of residential industrial and agricultural water usage there are two parts to the per capita equation demand change equation shock stimulated logistic decay with a maximum rate of α t 1 and a background decay rate β t 1 the decrease of per capita water demand accelerates in a time interval if water users are motivated by recent personal experience with water shortage i e m 0 as a certain amount of water is required for basic health and hygiene there is ultimately a floor to water efficiencies specified here as dmin l3t 1 reductions in per capita water usage become more challenging as this floor is approached a logistic decay function is used to capture this effect the background decay rate captures the increasing water efficiency observed in both urban and agricultural settings coomes et al 2010 international water management institute 2007 note that the background decay is context specific and in some cases it would not be relevant such as a developing region with expanding

analysis is that it reveals where combinations or ratios of parameters rather than single parameters control model behavior socio hydrological systems of the same class vary widely for example reservoir based water supply systems are present around the world but vary significantly in scale e g reservoir capacity population size total demand and variability e g streamflow and demand temporal variation scaled or dimensionless models of these systems can help to highlight the drivers of common or divergent dynamics additionally this technique decreases the amount of model input as a reduced number of parameter ratios rather than individual parameters must be specified the model presented above is scaled using the following relationships where x is used to indicate the non dimensional version of x 10 σ h σ h μ h 11 v max v max σ h t 12 d min d min μ h 13 e v e a res μ h the first relationship normalizes streamflow standard deviation by mean streamflow eq 10 the second normalizes reservoir capacity by the streamflow standard deviation and the reference time eq 11 the third normalizes the minimum demand by the mean streamflow eq 12 and the forth relationship normalizes the reservoir evaporation by the streamflow mean eq 13 note that d min μh is also equal to one over the carrying capacity of the system initial conditions can also be specified in non dimensional terms 14

simulation start date historic streamflow was used for these cases in place of the autoregressive streamflow model parameters were informed by both quantitative and qualitative case data sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of parameter values selected on model output and interpretation lastly the scaled model was used to simulate a generic system to directly explore the influence of reservoir volume and operating rule choice on water supply reliability and the interactions between these two choices the hedging parameter kp was varied between 1 sop and 3 conservative hedging and the scaled reservoir volume storage volume relative to streamflow standard deviation was varied between 2 and 12 five hundred streamflow traces were generated using the lag 1 autoregressive model and the same five hundred traces were used with each parameter set to ensure comparability across the sensitivity analysis normalized values of parameters are reported in table 1 4 results 4 1 case results the socio hydrological model was run for the three case studies of the colorado river basin melbourne and the city of cape town the modeled water use reservoir storage issue salience and shortage volume are described below and compared to case data as the model is highly stylized the aim is not to fit observations precisely rather the aim is to assess the model s ability to qualitatively reproduce patterns sterman 2000 in three distinct hydrological and operational environments in the colorado river case multi years droughts occurred in the late 1970 s late 1980 s and the 2000 s fig 5 a the impact of drought on stored water is clear in both the reservoir storage observations fig 2b and the modeled storage fig 5b the model reproduced key features including the period of high storage from mid 1970 s to mid 1980 s a decline in the late 1980 s recovery in the late 1990 s and decline followed by stabilization in the 2000 s the model is parameterized for conservative hedging policy kp 3 this triggers water conservation well in anticipation of physical limits and is consistent with the case history over the study period basin wide water use increases before reaching a peak in 2001 fig 2c the increase in water use is driven by an increasing population fig 2d with higher water efficiency working against this trend coomes et al 2010 weather driven variation in demand as well as the ability of water users to substitute groundwater or alternative surface water sources increases the variability of water use e g porse et al 2017 while this simple stylized model cannot reproduce all observed variability in water use it does simulate increasing water use until the early 2000 s followed by a period of decrease and stabilization fig 5e further the model captures the trend in decreased demand per capita fig 5c we have no observational data on salience at the basin scale however since the early 2000 s there has been increased interest in demand management and development of alternate sources at the local level e g garcia and islam 2019 porse et al 2017 and increased inter state policy developed addressing shortage allocation department of the interior 2007 us bureau of reclamation 2018 the modeled salience shows a small increase in response to the late 1980 s drought and a sharp rise in the early 2000 s at the onset of intense drought fig 5d consistent with these local and regional patterns the shortage volume is representative of the variability in water availability fig 5f the model was then used to simulate reservoir management in melbourne in response to droughts fig 6 the streamflow shows two drought events occurring at the beginning of the 1980 s and in the late 1990 s into the 2000 s fig 3a the drought beginning in the late 1990 s known as the millennium drought stressed the water supply system leading to falling reservoir storage and decreased water use fig 3a b the model reproduced the key features including a period of above average storage from late 1980 s to mid 1990 s followed by rapidly falling storage from the late 1990 s into the first decade of the 2000 s fig 6b the hedging parameter kp 3 simulates a conservative policy and thus water conservation is employed in advance to reduce the risk of severe shortage this parameterization is consistent with the case history however the model simulation shows the minimum storage value at years 2005 2006 fig 6b three years before the actual minimum was observed fig 3b after a drop due to the first drought the water usage increases as the population increases before decreasing during the millennium drought fig 3d c the model captures the declining water use during the millennium drought but cannot reproduce water use patterns prior to the drought fig 6e as in the colorado river case salience is modeled but is not directly observed the first drought triggers a small increase in salience which fades as memory of the drought weakens then the more severe millennium drought prompts a larger increase in salience fig 6d high levels of salience persist throughout the drought though consistent with empirical studies of long drought peak levels are not maintained garcia et al 2019 the modeled pattern of salience is consistent with the case history including the implementation of water use restrictions during the early 1980 s drought only stage 1 water restriction were used the second drought was longer and more severe requiring a series of water restrictions first in 2002 the stage 1 water restriction was imposed then in january 2007 and in april 2007 water stage 3 and 3a restrictions were launched reflecting the rising interest in demand management the shortage volume represents the gap between supply and demand fig 6f in the city of cape town two drought events occurred a minor one in 2002 2003 and a major one in 2015 2017 fig 4a the impact in terms of water storage is evident for these droughts in both observations fig 4b and model results fig 7 b the model reproduces the observed reductions in storage in 2002 2003 2010 and 2015 2017 while it does not capture the moderate drop in 2005 figs 4b 7b the model is parameterized for a moderate hedging policy kp 1 5 this implies that water conservation is triggered in advance but not far in advance of physical limits this is confirmed by observed data as the reservoirs were nearly drained before water restrictions were issued observed water use follows an increasing trend until 2015 which tracks population growth however this trend is interrupted by periods of temporarily high use likely driven by climatic and economic variability fig 4c d while the model is not able to reproduce all features of the observed water use simulation results do reproduce the temporary decrease seen around 2005 and peak water use in 2015 followed by a decrease fig 7e there are no direct observations of salience in the area however the case history includes events likely to be correlated with increased salience of water issues treuer et al 2017 level 2 water restrictions were implemented in january 1 2005 later in the 2015 2017 drought the first restriction 20 was launched in 2016 then in october 2017 a 40 reduction was further launched up to the dramatic day in january 2018 when the day zero was estimated to occur in april of the same year the model simulates an increase in salience at around 2002 driven by the first drought salience from this event fades over time with moderate increase from subsequent droughts until rising sharply in 2014 with severe drought fig 7d 4 2 sensitivity analysis having gained confidence about the ability of the model to qualitatively simulate patterns in various hydrological and operational environments we apply the model to further address our research questions 1 how does the scale of reservoir storage affect long term reliability 2 how do reservoir operating rules in place mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and or demands to explore the interaction of ratio between vmax and σh and the hedging factor kp we performed a sensitivity analysis running simulations of all combinations of these two parameters five hundred traces of stochastic streamflow generated by a lag 1 autoregressive model are used to understand performance across a range of streamflow patterns fig 8 shows the ratio of shortage volume to total demand over time across these simulations moving from left to right we can see the effect of increasing reservoir volume relative to the variability of streamflow fig 8 shows that the larger the reservoir the more shortage is delayed and the higher the maximum shortage moving from top to bottom we can examine the effects of changing operations from reactive sop or kp 1 to proactive kp 3 fig 8 shows that at higher values of kp shortages relative to total demand occur earlier but are lower in magnitude examining the full set of plots we can see an interesting phenomenon as we move diagonally from top left to bottom right along the diagonals in fig 8 the period of time before shortage occurs is constant but the magnitude increases additionally we see decreasing variability across the simulations as we move diagonally from top left to bottom right fig 9 a b summarizes the relationships between the two parameters kp and the ratio between vmax and σh and the mean and maximum shortage volumes over the simulation period first kp was sampled at 0 05 intervals and the ratio was sampled at 0 25 intervals to better assess changes across the range second mean and maximum shortage were computed for each simulation run finally local regression loess was applied to describe the relationship fig 9a shows a decrease in maximum shortage with a slight increase in mean shortage as kp increases this is consistent with the evidence that kp 1 is most effective at reducing average shortage volumes in the short term cancelliere et al 1998 garcia et al 2016 fig 9b shows that maximum shortage increases substantially and mean shortage slightly increases as the ratio between vmax and σh increases fig 9c d illustrate the relationship between kp and ratio between vmax and σh and the lag between demand surpassing average supply and the first occurrence of shortage note that in some cases the first shortage occurs before demand surpassing average supply when low flows coincide with low storage resulting in a negative lag a negative lag is evidence of reduced demand in anticipation of demand overshooting average supply or a proactive response a positive lag implies a demand reduction after overshoot or a reactive response fig 9c shows that as kp increases the lag decreases with negative lags occurring with kp 1 75 fig 9d illustrates an increasing lag with a higher vmax and σh ratio examined together fig 8 and fig 9 demonstrate that the choice of more conservative hedging policy for reservoir operation can mitigate the unintended consequences of larger reservoir storage volumes 5 discussion and conclusions reservoir storage is intended to protect water users from the variability inherent in streamflow in each of the three cases we see that the ability of reservoir systems to buffer drought effects decreases as demand increases and or streamflow patterns shift this is of course to be expected however the impact is not felt immediately as the stored water intended to meet demands during drought can be used to fill the gap between supply and demand temporarily when kp is equal to one reductions in water use are not made until physically necessary i e insufficient water in inflow and storage to meet the full demand eq 6 when kp is increased reductions in withdrawals are triggered sooner raising salience and subsequently leading to reductions in per capita demand figs 8 and 9 the magnitude of both reductions in withdrawals and increases in salience are lower when kp is higher therefore the rate of change in demand is slower but importantly it starts sooner reducing demand sooner both slows the decline in and eventually stabilizes the volume of stored water making future abrupt reductions in water use less likely to be needed additionally the rate of demand change is important a rapid shift in water available for use would be a significant shock to economic and public health which water managers and reservoir operators would seek to avoid reservoir storage provides a buffer of time to adapt to changing conditions the sensitivity analysis illustrates this as larger storage volumes lead to a greater time before the shortage is observed figs 8 and 9 decision makers do not always use this time for adaptation as illustrated in the three cases in melbourne the response to intense drought and growing demand was fast and effective low et al 2015 and was accomplished via strict water restrictions which were launched during the millennium drought to avoid day zero while in cape town the response to growing demands only occurred late into a historic drought leading to water delivery reductions muller 2018 in the colorado river basin the story is more nuanced and not yet complete as stored water declined in the 2000 s lower basin states developed a collaborative agreement to reduce use as reservoir levels declined department of the interior 2007 while this agreement reduced the risk of draining the reservoir it proved to be insufficient prompting an addendum in 2018 the drought contingency plan sullivan et al 2019 further renegotiations to set operational rules beyond this are in process reservoir storage can help manage hydrological variability e g coping wamsler and brink 2014 as it dampens its effects but if not paired with appropriate operating rules and water management policy it has the potential to delay the actions and the countermeasures necessary to adapt to changing conditions we hypothesize that the ability of stored water to delay impacts reduces the salience of the problem increasing the challenge of major infrastructure or policy change and leading to delays in adaptation this delay is particularly problematic when external forces drive increases in demand or population increased streamflow variability or decreased streamflow di baldassarre et al 2018 additionally the salience of water stress information rather than just the presence of such information is important in understanding response garcia et al 2019 quesnel and ajami 2017 the absence of salient information on the limits of water supply means that the potential negative feedback loops that could drive corrective action remains un activated however water supply management consists of more than just physical infrastructure the rules used to operate reservoirs sometimes referred to as soft infrastructure anderies et al 2016 shape their performance by testing alternate values of the operating parameter kp we observe the effects of operational rules the relationship between increases in kp and decreasing shortage magnitude and increased frequency of shortages shown in figs 8 and 9 is the expected result of hedging policy you and cai 2008a you and cai 2008b what is novel here is how the storage volume and operating rules interact with each other and the broader system of water supply and use under hedging policy kp 1 water managers decrease withdrawals before it is physically required thus increasing the salience of water shortage risk at higher volumes of stored water this increases the probability of a timely adaptive response further figs 8 and 9 illustrate that the choice of operating rule can either exacerbate or alleviate the tendency to delay response with increased reservoir capacity in other words the advantages of large supply reservoirs such as the ability to buffer variability and thus alleviate the effects of drought can be achieved while minimizing the risk of delayed response to change by pairing large reservoirs with conservative hedging to create salience and prompt adaptive action while this is not the only way to drive increases in problem saliency through policy these results can inspire further investigation of policy design aimed at reducing delays in response to changing conditions particularly in contexts where changing environmental conditions significantly impacts the ability to meet societal goals while these analyses demonstrated the importance of storage volume and operating rules in explaining long term reservoir performance under changing conditions it is clear from the diversity of three cases that storage and operating rules alone do not determine the response a variety of other factors including institutional arrangements garcia et al 2019 financial resources hughes et al 2013 leadership skill pahl wostl et al 2007 the presence of motivated actors porter et al 2015 and risk perception dobbie and brown 2014 ridolfi et al 2019 all influence the nature and speed of policy response to changing conditions the three cases demonstrate the model s ability to reproduce key features though not all patterns in water use and storage the model presented here is unavoidably simplified leaving several opportunities for future improvements it does not account for the large number of options for water management from more sophisticated and time varying operating rules to source substitution further data collection covering both a broader range of variables and cases could inform such model refinements additionally the operational strategies of the reservoir are considered constant across time while in practice they often change in response to new knowledge performance and changing conditions though the operational strategy modeled here linear hedging policy is only an approximation it does offer insights into the effect of storage capacity and operational choices under changing conditions further this analysis highlights when a change in operation policies would be advantageous in sum the case applications and sensitivity analysis presented here illustrate how infrastructure and policy design choices combine in some cases non linearly to impact system performance credit authorship

et al 2019 and remote sensing rs algorithms liu 2018 zhang et al 2016 because et is affected by various environmental and biophysical factors sun et al 2020 teuling et al 2019 uncertainties can also result from poor accuracy in gridded vegetation and soil data due to the complexity heterogeneity of terrestrial ecosystems thus arguably presenting themselves as the key drivers of errors in the current parameter rich et models boisier et al 2014 polhamus et al 2013 cai et al 2019 for example recently reported that the elmv1 i e the land component of the energy exascale earth system model of the u s department of energy still failed to simulate a reasonable response of et to deforestation due mainly to inappropriate soil water and plant related model parameters the latter ones may be more

zhu et al 2013 and the terrestrial climate data record claverie et al 2016 were neither intraconsistent over time nor interconsistent with each other due possibly to national oceanic and atmospheric

employing an additional asymmetry coefficient typically dependent on how wet environment et w and potential evapotranspiration et p rates are represented found in some linear cr models kahler and brutsaert 2006 szilagyi 2007 ma et al 2015 while brutsaert 2015 nonlinear cr model has been widely used to estimate et over a diverse range of ecosystems the stumbling block of applying it across large spatial scales has been the optimization of its key model parameter the priestley taylor pt coefficient α priestley and taylor 1972 via ground truth et data typically by eddy covariance ec bowen ratio measurements or water balance derived values even simple water balances may be difficult to derive on a continental scale because of the presence of basins that are either ungauged or poorly gauged hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan 2003 for precipitation and or discharge lately brutsaert et al 2020 presented another version of the nonlinear cr with the help of seven globally calibrated fitting parameters including the pt α coefficient szilagyi et al 2017 however had already proposed an alternative and efficient scheme for deriving the α value without employing any additional parameters or measured water balance derived et data in their calibration free and upgraded version of the nonlinear cr of brutsaert 2015 via the application of estimated temperature and humidity gradients between the wet surface and the air by inverting the priestley taylor equation over wet areas that are automatically identified within a given and possibly large spatial domain this novel version of the nonlinear cr thus avoids any prior information of ground truth et for the usual calibration of α a definite advantage for large scale et estimation applications a recent assessment by ma and szilagyi 2019 demonstrated that this calibration free cr model performs better than the mainstream at least those selected lsms rs models and atmospheric reanalyses in estimating large scale et and is on a par with the fluxnet model tree ensemble fluxnet mte product which represents a spatial upscaling of ec measurements using a machine learning ml approach indeed the fluxnet mte et product jung et al 2010 has been extensively used in not only the evaluations of et rates produced by lsms ma et al 2017 rs models velpuri et al 2013 and atmospheric reanalyses draper et al 2018 but also in the investigations of long term dynamics in global terrestrial water and ecosystems feng et al 2017 sun et al 2016 nevertheless because fluxnet mte only used one ml algorithm for upscaling uncertainty still exists since different ml methods may have different responses during the training processes tramontana et al 2016 to reduce multiple sources of uncertainties in empirical upscaling of ec measurements jung et al 2019 recently produced global energy flux products net radiation sensible and latent heat called fluxcom employing an ensemble of multiple ml approaches however the fluxcom et i e latent heat products were only compared with the global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 landflux eval mueller et al 2013 and fluxnet mte jung et al 2010 model data but have not yet been evaluated against ground truth et results such as derived by a water balance approach which is often considered the most accurate way to validate any large scale et products liu 2018 rodell 2004 in this context the accuracy of the fluxcom et products remains unknown at the same time while the above mentioned and water balance verified calibration free cr model may serve as a benchmarking tool for large scale et simulation ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 and has been further employed for not only detecting long term regional et trends szilagyi 2018a szilagyi and jozsa 2018 but also providing the baseline et data for nation wide drought monitoring kim et al 2019 kyatengerwa et al 2020 it is yet unclear how the fluxcom et estimates compare with those of the cr the specific objective of the present study this way is a simultaneous assessment of the annual et rates of the calibration free cr and the latest ml based et product fluxcom against the water balance results of 18 first level two digit hydrological unit code i e huc2 and 327 third level six digit huc i e huc6 basins across the conterminous united states conus by aiming at this goal we also expand the previous work of ma and szilagyi 2019 the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the cr and fluxcom et products as well as the water balance method within the planned evaluations section

of the typical drying environment t szilagyi 2014 by making use of a mild vertical air temperature gradient szilagyi 2014 observable in wet environments as r n is consumed predominantly by the latent heat flux t w can be approximated by the wet surface temperature t ws note also that t ws may still be larger than t when the drying environment air is near saturation but not t w due to the cooling effect of evaporation and in such cases t w should be capped by t szilagyi and jozsa 2018 szilagyi and schepers 2014 demonstrated that the wet surface temperature is independent of areal extent thus t

applied to create the rs meteo products include i watch forcing data era interim wfdei for 1979 2013 weedon et al 2015 ii global soil wetness project 3 forcing gswp3 for 1950 2014 kim 2017 and iii a fused forcing of the climate research unit and national centers for environmental prediction cruncep for 1950 2016 wei et al 2014 there is also a short rs meteo product driven by radiation from the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system and precipitation from the global precipitation climatology project jung et al 2019 but was excluded in the present study since it only covers 2001 2014 readers are suggested to refer to jung et al 2019 for a thorough introduction on the fluxcom et products in the present study the 0 0833 rs ensemble et product during 2003 2015 generated from 27 members involving nine ml methods and three energy balance closure correction methods was used for the longer period three 0 5 rs meteo forcing specific ensemble et products driven by i wfdei ii gswp3 and iii cruncep during the overlap period of 1979 2013 were applied for each meteorological forcing the ensemble product is based on nine members involving three ml methods and three energy balance closure correction methods all fluxcom products were aggregated into annual sums for further evaluations 2 3 water balance derived huc2 and huc6 et wb rates all et products were evaluated against the water balance based evapotranspiration rates et wb at 18 huc2 and 327 huc6 basins across conus fig 1 which were obtained as 11 et wb p q δ s in which p q and δs are basin wide annual precipitation runoff and the change in terrestrial water storage respectively these basins are characterized by various hydroclimatic regimes including sub tropical humid in the south eastern conus continental in the middle oceanic in the north western and semi arid in the south western part fig 1 which are appropriate for addressing the models skill in estimating et under diverse environmental conditions the mean area of the huc2 and huc6 basins are 430 000 km2 and 23 000 km2 respectively representing large to medium watersheds in the present study annual precipitation from prism daly et al 1994 and huc2 as well as huc6 runoff data from united states geological survey during 1979 2015 were used for equation 11 considering the common temporal coverage of the fluxcom and cr products the present evaluations concentrate on two periods i e the longer period of 1979 2013 and the shorter one of 2003 2015 over the longer one the cr and three rs meteo products of fluxcom while over the shorter one the rs product of fluxcom and the cr were evaluated for the 2003 2015 period δs values derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 available only after 2002 were applied when calculating huc2 and huc6 averaged et wb specifically the annual δs was calculated as the difference in terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa of successive decembers in two continuous years in which twsa is the arithmetic mean value of three grace products processed by geoforschungszentrum potsdam the center for space research at the university of texas austin and by the jet propulsion laboratory with further consideration to the gain factors proposed by landerer and swenson 2012 for the 1979 2013 period that grace cannot fully cover we used the 0 5 monthly twsa data from the grace rec humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in which twsa was reconstructed using a statistical model with inputs of precipitation and temperature at each global land grid for the past century a series of evaluations against the sea level budget and streamflow datasets by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 suggested that the grace rec is a state of the art long term twsa product which is especially useful for the pre grace era the development of grace rec involved two kinds of grace products for training purpose and three kinds of climate forcing thus leading to six different versions of grace rec see table 3 in humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 for detailed information about every version of grace rec in the present study to calculate annual δs for 1979 2013 we used the version based on the gswp3 precipitation and temperature data that were calibrated with twsa from the jet propulsion laboratory mascons due to differences in the spatial resolutions between prism p grace and grace rec δs cr and the fluxcom et products we first used the nearest neighbor method to resample all products into the common 0 125 grid then we calculated the basin wide et rates by spatial averaging over each huc2 or huc6 basin using the 0 125 river mask for the corresponding basins the multiyear mean et wb rates of the huc2 and huc6 basins are shown in fig s1 note that seven out of the original 334 huc6 basins were excluded see fig 1b in all evaluations because of outlier et wb and or q data in comparison with their neighbors to evaluate a given et product against et wb we focused on three aspects i the multiyear mean ii the temporal variation in the annual values and iii the linear trends in annual et rates over the given period the employed statistical metrics either spatial for the mean and trend or temporal for the annual time series included the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse relative bias rb and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between et wb and basin averaged et rates of every product note that in the assessment of the trends rb is not an effective measure thus was excluded because the denominator may be very small if et wb had little change over a given period for the time series of basin wide et the ratio of the interannual variability iav in modeled et to that in et wb i e riav was also calculated to assess how well models capture the iav in annual et wb for the given period 3 results 3 1 spatial assessment of the multiyear mean annual et rates the cr displays the best performance with the highest nse 0 94 and r 0 977 and the lowest rmse 50 2 mm yr 1 and rb 0 84 values in comparison with the multiyear 1979 2013 mean et wb rates over the 18 huc2 basins fig 2 table 1 this is closely followed by the rs meteo product driven by gswp3 with the nse value dropping to 0 89 and the rmse and rb values jumping to 67 2 mm yr 1 and 7 75 respectively the other two rs meteo products forced by wfdei and cruncep exhibit weaker performances with similar nse 0 79 and 0 77 respectively rmse both more than 90 mm yr 1 and rb both roughly 14 values among them based on the spatial pattern of the ratio of et to et wb both cr and gswp3 have errors within 10 over most huc2 basins fig 2a c except for i an underestimation by 39 over the lower colorado basin in the cr and ii an overestimation by roughly 37 over the great basin and northwest basins in the gswp3 see fig 1a for huc2 basin identification wfdei and cruncep fig 2b d tend to overestimate et in the majority of huc2 basins especially noticeable for the western conus the most significant positive bias occurred in the great basin for both wfdei and cruncep by 55 and 41 respectively the cr continues to yield the smallest rmse 89 0 mm yr 1 and rb 0 45 values fig 3 for the 35 year average of the et rates among the much smaller huc6 catchments for the nse value cr and gswp3 are comparable with an identical value of 0 86 table 1 which is higher than other products both wfdei and gswp3 display larger rmse and rb values while producing better r values 0 954 and 0 951 respectively than cr 0 933 cruncep still performs the weakest with the largest rmse and the lowest nse and r values spatially widespread positive biases occur in all three rs meteo products of fluxcom fig 3b c d with a reduced range as can also be seen from their fitted slopes significantly smaller than unity fig 3f g h in contrast cr appears to have a balanced performance across conus with a slope 0 97 close to identity fig 3e the rs product of fluxcom over the shorter temporal coverage of 2003 2015 performs similarly to the cr at the huc2 scale in describing the multiyear mean et fig 4 as was evidenced by comparable statistical metrics in table 1 however at the huc6 scale during the same 13 year period fig 5 the rs product of fluxcom improves a bit upon the cr due probably to benefitting from direct ec measurements at this smaller scale as can be seen from the higher nse 0 88 vs 0 85 and smaller rmse 82 3 vs 91 2 mm yr 1 values table 1 note also that a significant underestimation of et in partial regions of arizona and nevada exists in the cr model which to a large extent is mitigated in the rs product of fluxcom partly due to a flatter slope in those values i e 0 87 vs 1 02 for cr fig 5 the reason for underestimation of the cr in these arid catchments is not yet clear but if et rates are patchy in time and in space as well meaning very high rates during and shortly after relatively few precipitation events and more persistently from phreatophyte vegetation and low rates otherwise due to the water conserving behavior of semi arid vegetation then the monthly mean input values e g air humidity of the cr may miss or significantly smooth out such sudden spikes this effect is not so severe over the larger huc2 basins c f fig 4 as they would contain mountainous regions where precipitation is more abundant of course the daily ec measurements employed by fluxcom would not be so affected 3 2 assessing the trends in annual et the cr is particularly robust in estimating trends in huc2 averaged annual et rates during 1979 2013 as evidenced by the highest nse 0 79 and the lowest rmse 0 7 mm yr 1 values in fig 6 and table 2 however all three rs meteo products of fluxcom tend to predict very narrow ranges seen in reduced slope values for the increasing decreasing trends when compared to et wb values of the 18 huc2 basins fig 6b c d thus underestimating long term tendencies the spatial distributions of the trends in annual et rates corroborates this gswp3 and cruncep produce much milder ones than et wb at most huc2 basins such a discrepancy is especially true for i the southwestern conus where et wb decreased obviously fig 6i but only slight corresponding changes are found in these two products fig 6g h and ii the southeastern conus where trends are opposite between et wb and these two products see fig 6g h i while the biases in trends diminish to some extent in the wfdei product fig 6b table 2 it still underestimates the decreasing trend of et wb in the southwestern us fig 6f on the whole cr accurately describes the trends in annual et rates over most huc2 basins exceptthe missouri basin with a trend opposite to the one in et wb see fig 6e i at the huc6 scale where et wb is more uncertain e g due to possible i differences in catchment boundaries between surface and groundwater ii enhanced role of interannual reservoir storage changes in the water balance the skills of all models estimating the trends in et rates during this 35 year period appear inferior to similar measures found at huc2 as can be seen from the decreased nse and increased rmse values table 2 the highest nse 0 31 and r 0 632 values are provided by wfdei yielding an rmse value 1 7 mm yr 1 identical to that of the cr the latter also producing the largest slope value 0 37 fig 7 table 2 in a spatial manner however none of the rs meteo products of fluxcom could well capture the significant decreasing trend in et wb over western texas southern arizona and new mexico fig 7i during 1979 2013 while the cr was the only one showing magnitudes of change similar to those in et wb fig 7e note again that the trends from all three rs meteo products of fluxcom seem much milder than those from et wb due possibly to their underestimated iav of annual et rates see section 3 3 as can be seen from the milder fitted slopes ranging from 0 13 to 0 22 fig 7b c d in general gswp3 and cruncep exhibit poorer performance for the trends at the huc6 scale with nse values of about 0 2 fig 7c d consistent with their results at the huc2 scale during the short period of 2003 2015 the cr s ability nse 0 08 and rmse 2 4 mm yr 1 in estimating the et trends at the huc2 scale is again better than that of the rs product of fluxcom table 2 the latter producing a negative 0 79 nse value fig 8 b moreover the spatial pattern of trends by the cr fig 8c generally follows that in et wb fig 8e the latter exhibiting overall increasing trends for most huc2 basins in the eastern conus however the rs product of fluxcom yields decreasing trends for most parts of the eastern conus fig 8d the performance of the cr in estimating trends in annual et rates during 2003 2015 does not change much at the huc6 scale with nse and rmse values of 0 14 and 5 4 mm yr 1 respectively fig 9 a the rs product displays again weaker performance with a negative 0 19 nse value fig 9b table 2 due mainly to its large errors in the eastern conus see fig 9d e similar to above mentioned contrasting trends for the huc2 basins 3 3 assessing the temporal variations in annual et the arithmetic averages of the statistical metrics of the cr and fluxcom performance in simulating the annual et time series of the 18 huc2 or 327 huc6 basins were used for assessing the temporal variations in annual et the only exception is the nse value where the median was computed due to the occasional large negative values for basins where the difference in multiyear modeled and water balance et averages is large for capturing temporal variations in annual et rates during 1979 2013 the cr and fluxcom exhibit overall similar performances in terms of rmse rb and nse values for both huc2 fig 10 and huc6 fig s2 scales the iav in et wb was unanimously underestimated the strongest in the three rs meteo products of fluxcom with riav values less than 50 while cr achieves about 80 fig 10d over the period of 2003 2015 figs 10f j s2f j the cr also yields better performance in riav 60 and 30 for cr and rs products respectively while in the nse rb and rmse values the cr again performs similar to the rs product of fluxcom in both spatial scales 4 discussions and conclusion 4 1 uncertainties in model validation using the water balance method it must be recognized that the reported model performances may be confounded by possible errors embedded in et wb carter et al 2018 liu 2018 while δs has been considered for both short 2003 2015 and long 1979 2013 periods the coarse spatial resolutions of grace and grace rec would probably cause biases in et wb of small watersheds which may be particularly true for the huc6 basins besides while prism p is one of the most thoroughly validated land measured precipitation dataset for conus because it considers the effects of elevation rain shadows and coastal proximity in the interpolation process daly et al 2008 the ubiquitous underestimation in precipitation measurements due to e g wind induced undercatch as well as wetting and evaporation losses yang et al 2005 sieck et al 2007 could lead to uncertainties in any gridded precipitation data lundquist et al 2019 however the errors found in the prism p estimates are mostly within 5 to 15 of the recorded ground station values jeton et al 2005 daly et al 2008 2017 while quantifying the errors in the et wb values emerging from precipitation and or δs is beyond the scope of the present study a detailed analysis of such uncertainties in the water balance approach would certainly benefit the overall validation of large scale et products 4 2 relative merits of fluxcom and cr the recently available powerful ml techniques have stimulated substantial advances in hydrological research such as the estimation of precipitation tang et al 2018 soil moisture kolassa et al 2018 snow water equivalent bair et al 2018 runoff yaseen et al 2019 and drought forecasting deo et al 2017 in particular the ml based upscaling of ec flux measurements to regional e g fang et al 2020 or global scales e g jung et al 2019 has greatly boosted our understanding of et at extended spatial and temporal dimensions although the low density of ec towers in certain areas e g africa south america west and south asia may not be sufficient to exploit the capability of ml to extract relevant characteristics of space structure note also that while the rs product of flxucom takes full advantage of remotely sensed data and exhibits excellent skills in representing the spatial pattern of the multiyear mean et rates it performs poorly for the trends in annual et see figs 8 9 due possibly to the calibration degradation of modis collection 5 data wang et al 2012 in which the enhanced vegetation index a key variant used for training the rs product of fluxcom has not been well calibrated lyapustin et al 2014 this indicates that incorporating further advanced satellite observations may benefit rs based machine learning of et in the future in addition the uncertainty in any et models can also result from the uncertainty in the meteorological forcing for example the evaluation by tang et al 2017 suggested that cruncep still has obvious biases in its temperature and precipitation data when compared with the station measured results of 90 cities in united states though cruncep has improved a little bit upon the ncep i and ncep ii reanalyses which might be the reason why cruncep based rs meteo product of fluxcom exhibits larger biases in et estimates across conus see tables 1 2 while the cr performs comparably to for the trends better than fluxcom in the estimation of et across the conus it is worthwhile to highlight that fluxcom produced not only et but also net radiation and sensible heat fluxes jung et al 2019 as well as carbon fluxes including gross primary production and net ecosystem exchange jung et al 2020 with a worldwide coverage over the last few decades this way fluxcom complements a holistic view of land atmosphere energy water and carbon exchanges at a global scale that may not be otherwise possible from any other single dataset which is particularly vital for the developing countries where ec flux towers are spatially sparser and temporally shorter than in developed ones chu et al 2017 the present validations suggest that the gswp3 drived rs meteo product and the rs product of fluxcom perform well in representing the multiyear mean et c f figs 2 4 we therefore believe that fluxcom is certainly valuable for not only lsms and rs model evaluations but also provides fundamental constraints of global energy and carbon cycling the most important merit of cr is that it relies solely on standard atmospheric forcing han and tian 2020 to estimate et without any precipitation data the latter being the most uncertain meteorological variable to predict e g in climate models besides cr avoids the possible uncertainties in any gridded vegetation and soil data which are usually key inputs for most lsm and rs based et models however a weakness of the present calibration free cr as a benchmark for calibration verification of other large scale et models is that it is not recommended to be employed on a daily or sub daily bases in fact morton 1983 suggested not using the cr for periods shorter than five days because large scale weather fronts may bring air masses over the land with a moisture signature decoupled from the underlying surface which thus may temporarily disrupt the dynamic equilibrium of air humidity and surface fluxes in the land atmosphere system hence an additional temporal aggregation of model simulations is necessary for models that are driven by daily or sub daily forcing before validating them against the cr note also that the cr is not able to predict et in a prognostic mode i e et rates at a future time of t dt from the soil moisture and vegetation status obtained at time t since it estimates the cause et from the effect moisture content and temperature of the air ma and szilagyi 2019 however the cr can be employed for reality checks of the climate models future scenarios to see whether the projected state of the atmosphere is indeed in balance via the cr with the assumed et rates produced by the climate models in conclusion it can be stated that the cr is on a par with the fluxcom et products no matter which meteorological forcing and or satellite data are used in the latter the cr however performs somewhat better in representing the long term et trends than fluxcom while uncertainties exist in the cr based et results over certain regions the cr could still serve as a benchmarking tool for verifications of the lsms rs and ml based large scale et estimates due to its robust performance minimal data requirement and calibration free nature however it should be emphasized again that fluxcom contains not only et but also other energy and carbon fluxes with a global coverage and thus continues to provide the community with a valuable reference dataset for studies associated with large scale terrestrial energy water and carbon cycles credit authorship contribution statement ning ma conceptualization methodology formal analysis software investigation resources data curation

5171,accurately quantifying large scale terrestrial evapotranspiration et remains hampered by poor parameterization of the physical processes that relate to et previous studies suggested that the calibration free complementary relationship cr method that requires only routine meteorological data performed better than main stream atmospheric reanalyses land surface or remote sensing models in estimating large scale et here we simultaneously evaluate the latest machine learning based upscaling of eddy covariance measurements fluxcom and the cr estimates against the water balance derived et rates of 18 large hydrologic unit code 2 huc2 and 327 medium huc6 basins across the conterminous united states overall cr and fluxcom perform comparably in representing the multiyear mean and temporal variations in annual et at both huc2 and huc6 scales for the 1979 2013 period such equally good skills also hold true for the 2003 2015 period during which fluxcom was driven solely by remote sensing data however the cr generally captures the long term linear tendencies in annual et rates somewhat better than fluxcom because of its minimal data requirement the calibration free version of the cr

temporally explicit representation of land surface evapotranspiration et at regional global scales is essential to understanding the earth s energy water and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 lemordant et al 2018 miralles et al 2019 however estimation of large scale et remains saddled by difficulties in parameterizing the physical processes that control et in land surface models lsms ma et al 2017 stoy et al 2019 and remote sensing rs algorithms liu 2018 zhang et al 2016 because et is affected by various environmental and biophysical factors sun et al 2020 teuling et al 2019 uncertainties can also result from poor accuracy in gridded vegetation and soil data due to the complexity heterogeneity of terrestrial ecosystems thus arguably presenting themselves as the key drivers of errors in the current parameter rich et models boisier et al 2014 polhamus et al 2013 cai et al 2019 for example recently reported that the elmv1 i e the land component of the energy exascale earth system model of the u s department of energy still failed to simulate a reasonable response of et to deforestation due mainly to inappropriate soil water and plant related model parameters the latter ones may be more intractable in large scale et modeling because current widely used leaf area index lai products e g the global land surface satellite xiao et al 2016 the global mapping lai liu et al 2012 the lai3g zhu et al 2013 and the terrestrial climate data record claverie et al 2016 were neither intraconsistent over time nor interconsistent with each other due possibly to national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellite orbit changes or moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor degradation as was pointed out by jiang et al 2017 as an alternative of the data demanding lsms and rs models that require not only meteorological forcing but also vegetation and soil information for et estimation the complementary relationship cr bouchet 1963 of evapotranspiration inherently accounts for the integrated effects of the soil vegetation interface thus making itself rely solely on standard atmospheric variables i e air and dew point temperature wind speed and net radiation to estimate et after more than three decades of working with linear cr models e g the advection aridity model of brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert 2015 inspired by the work of han et al 2012 proposed a state of the art nonlinear cr framework by introducing additional boundary conditions with physical constraints lately han and tian 2018 re derived their own boundary conditions proposing a sigmoid cr model that considers han et al 2012 s model and the advection aridity model as two special cases these remarkably improved the cr s skill in estimating et and simultaneously avoid the need of employing an additional asymmetry coefficient typically dependent on how wet environment et w and potential evapotranspiration et p rates are represented found in some linear cr models kahler and brutsaert 2006 szilagyi 2007 ma et al 2015 while brutsaert 2015 nonlinear cr model has been widely used to estimate et over a diverse range of ecosystems the stumbling block of applying it across large spatial scales has been the optimization of its key model parameter the priestley taylor pt coefficient α priestley and taylor 1972 via ground truth et data typically by eddy covariance ec bowen ratio measurements or water balance derived values even simple water balances may be difficult to derive on a continental scale because of the presence of basins that are either ungauged or poorly gauged hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan 2003 for precipitation and or discharge lately brutsaert et al 2020 presented another version of the nonlinear cr with the help of seven globally calibrated fitting parameters including the pt α coefficient szilagyi et al 2017 however had already proposed an alternative and efficient scheme for deriving the α value without employing any additional parameters or measured water balance derived et data in their calibration free and upgraded version of the nonlinear cr of brutsaert 2015 via the application of estimated temperature and humidity gradients between the wet surface and the air by inverting the priestley taylor equation over wet areas that are automatically identified within a given and possibly large spatial domain this novel version of the nonlinear cr thus avoids any prior information of ground truth et for the usual calibration of α a definite advantage for large scale et estimation applications a recent assessment by ma and szilagyi 2019 demonstrated that this calibration free cr model performs better than the mainstream at least those selected lsms rs models and atmospheric reanalyses in estimating large scale et and is on a par with the fluxnet model tree ensemble fluxnet mte product which represents a spatial upscaling of ec measurements using a machine learning ml approach indeed the fluxnet mte et product jung et al 2010 has been extensively used in not only the evaluations of et rates produced by lsms ma et al 2017 rs models velpuri et al 2013 and atmospheric reanalyses draper et al 2018 but also in the investigations of long term dynamics in global terrestrial water and ecosystems feng et al 2017 sun et al 2016 nevertheless because fluxnet mte only used one ml algorithm for upscaling uncertainty still exists since different ml methods may have different responses during the training processes tramontana et al 2016 to reduce multiple sources of uncertainties in empirical upscaling of ec measurements jung et al 2019 recently produced global energy flux products net radiation sensible and latent heat called fluxcom employing an ensemble of multiple ml approaches however the fluxcom et i e latent heat products were only compared with the global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 landflux eval mueller et al 2013 and fluxnet mte jung et al 2010 model data but have not yet been evaluated against ground truth et results such as derived by a water balance approach which is often considered the most accurate way to validate any large scale et products liu 2018 rodell 2004 in this context the accuracy of the fluxcom et products remains unknown at the same time while the above mentioned and water balance verified calibration free cr model may serve as a benchmarking tool for large scale et simulation ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 and has been further employed for not only detecting long term regional et trends szilagyi 2018a szilagyi and jozsa 2018 but also providing the baseline et data for nation wide drought monitoring kim et al 2019 kyatengerwa et al 2020 it is yet unclear how the fluxcom et estimates compare with those of the cr the specific objective of the present study this way is a simultaneous assessment of the annual et rates of the calibration free cr and the latest ml based et product fluxcom against the water balance results of 18 first level two digit hydrological unit code i e huc2 and 327 third level six digit huc i e huc6 basins across the conterminous united states conus by aiming at this goal we also expand the previous work of ma and szilagyi 2019 the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the cr and fluxcom et products as well as the water balance method within the planned evaluations section 3 considers the evaluation results with regard to the multi year mean long term trends and temporal variations in annual et section 4 presents discussions and the conclusion 2 data and methods 2 1

continuous monthly simulation over the 37 year period of 1979 2015 across the conus employing the 4 km spatial resolution parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism t and t d

sums for further evaluations 2 2 fluxcom et products fluxcom jung et al 2019 represents a state of the art ml based upscaling of ec measured surface fluxes where data from 224 flux towers around the world were used to train multiple i e three to nine ml methods for details of the ml algorithms and their training plus cross validations of the results refer to tramontana et al 2016 briefly fluxcom comprises of two groups of et products i e rs at 0 0833 spatial and 8 day temporal resolutions and rs meteo at 0 5 spatial and 1 day temporal resolutions the rs product employed only remote sensing data i e modis to estimate et for the period of 2001 2015 while the rs meteo products used both gridded meteorological forcing and modis data for extended temporal coverages the meteorological forcing applied to create the rs meteo products include i watch forcing data era interim wfdei for 1979 2013 weedon et al 2015 ii global soil wetness project 3 forcing gswp3 for 1950 2014 kim 2017 and iii a fused forcing of the climate research unit and national centers for environmental prediction cruncep for 1950 2016 wei et al 2014 there is also a short rs meteo product driven by radiation from the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system and precipitation from the global precipitation climatology project jung et al 2019 but was excluded in the present study since it only covers 2001 2014 readers are suggested to refer to jung et al 2019 for a thorough introduction on the fluxcom et products in the present study the 0 0833 rs ensemble et product during 2003 2015 generated from 27 members involving nine ml methods and three energy balance closure correction methods was used for the longer period three 0 5 rs meteo forcing specific ensemble et products driven by i wfdei ii gswp3 and iii cruncep during the overlap period of 1979 2013 were applied for each meteorological forcing the ensemble product is based on nine members involving three ml methods and three energy balance closure correction methods all fluxcom products were aggregated into annual sums for further evaluations 2 3 water balance derived huc2 and huc6 et wb rates all et products were evaluated against the water balance based evapotranspiration rates et wb at 18 huc2 and 327 huc6 basins across conus fig 1 which were obtained as 11 et wb p q δ s in which p q and δs are basin wide annual precipitation runoff and the change in terrestrial water storage respectively these basins are characterized by various hydroclimatic regimes including sub tropical humid in the south eastern conus continental in the middle oceanic in the north western and semi arid in the south western part fig 1 which are appropriate for addressing the models skill in estimating et under diverse environmental conditions the mean area of the huc2 and huc6 basins are 430 000 km2 and 23 000 km2 respectively representing large to medium watersheds in the present study annual precipitation from prism daly et al 1994 and huc2 as well as huc6 runoff data from united states geological survey during 1979 2015 were used for equation 11 considering the common temporal coverage of the fluxcom and cr products the present evaluations concentrate on two periods i e the longer period of 1979 2013 and the shorter one of 2003 2015 over the longer one the cr and three rs meteo products of fluxcom while over the shorter one the rs product of fluxcom and the cr were evaluated for the 2003 2015 period δs values derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 available only after 2002 were applied when calculating huc2 and huc6 averaged et wb specifically the annual δs was calculated as the difference in terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa of successive decembers in two continuous years in which twsa is the arithmetic mean value of three grace products processed by geoforschungszentrum potsdam the center for space research at the university of texas austin and by the jet propulsion laboratory with further consideration to the gain factors proposed by landerer and swenson 2012 for the 1979 2013 period that grace cannot fully cover we used the 0 5 monthly twsa data from the grace rec humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in which twsa was reconstructed using a statistical model with inputs of precipitation and temperature at each global land grid for the past century a series of evaluations against the sea level budget and streamflow datasets by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 suggested that the grace rec is a state of the art long term twsa product which is especially useful for the pre grace era the development of grace rec involved two kinds of grace products for training purpose and three kinds of climate forcing thus leading to six different versions of grace rec see table 3 in humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 for detailed information about every version of grace rec in the present study to calculate annual δs for 1979 2013 we used the version based on the gswp3 precipitation and temperature data that were calibrated with twsa from the jet propulsion laboratory mascons due to differences in the spatial resolutions between prism p grace and grace rec δs cr and the fluxcom et products we first used the nearest neighbor method to resample all products into the common 0 125 grid then we calculated the basin wide et rates by spatial averaging over each huc2 or huc6 basin using the 0 125 river mask for the corresponding basins the multiyear mean et wb rates of the huc2 and huc6 basins are shown in fig s1 note that seven out of the original 334 huc6 basins were excluded see fig 1b in all evaluations because of outlier et wb and or q data in comparison with their neighbors to evaluate a given et product against et wb we focused on three aspects i the multiyear mean ii the temporal variation in the annual values and iii the linear trends in annual et rates over the given period the employed statistical metrics either spatial for the mean and trend or temporal for the annual time series included the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse relative bias rb and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between et wb and basin averaged et rates of every product note that in the assessment of the trends rb is not an effective measure thus was excluded because the denominator may be very small if et wb had little change over a given period for the time series of basin wide et the ratio of the interannual variability iav in modeled et to that in et wb i e riav was also calculated to assess how well models capture the iav in annual et wb for the given period 3 results 3 1 spatial assessment of the multiyear mean annual et rates the cr displays the best performance with the highest nse 0 94 and r 0 977 and the lowest rmse 50 2 mm yr 1 and rb 0 84 values in comparison with the multiyear 1979 2013 mean et wb rates over the 18 huc2 basins fig 2 table 1 this is closely followed by the rs meteo product driven by gswp3 with the nse value dropping to 0 89 and the rmse and rb values jumping to 67 2 mm yr 1 and 7 75 respectively the other two rs meteo products forced by wfdei and cruncep exhibit weaker performances with similar nse 0 79 and 0 77 respectively rmse both more than 90 mm yr 1 and rb both roughly 14 values among them based on the spatial pattern of the ratio of et to et wb both cr and gswp3 have errors within 10 over most huc2 basins fig 2a c except for i an underestimation by 39 over the lower colorado basin in the cr and ii an overestimation by roughly 37 over the great basin and northwest basins in the gswp3 see fig 1a for huc2 basin identification wfdei and cruncep fig 2b d tend to overestimate et in the majority of huc2 basins especially noticeable for the western conus the most significant positive bias occurred in the great basin for both wfdei and cruncep by 55 and 41 respectively the cr continues to yield the smallest rmse 89 0 mm yr 1 and rb 0 45 values fig 3 for the 35 year average of the et rates among the much smaller huc6 catchments for the nse value cr and gswp3 are comparable with an identical value of 0 86 table 1 which is higher than other products both wfdei and gswp3 display larger rmse and rb values while producing better r values 0 954 and 0 951 respectively than cr 0 933 cruncep still performs the weakest with the largest rmse and the lowest nse and r values spatially widespread positive biases occur in all three rs meteo products of fluxcom fig 3b c d with a reduced range as can also be seen from their fitted slopes significantly smaller than unity fig 3f g h in contrast cr appears to have a balanced performance across conus with a slope 0 97 close to identity fig 3e the rs product of fluxcom over the shorter temporal coverage of 2003 2015 performs similarly to the cr at the huc2 scale in describing the multiyear mean et fig 4 as was evidenced by comparable statistical metrics in table 1 however at the huc6 scale during the same 13 year period fig 5 the rs product of fluxcom improves a bit upon the cr due probably to benefitting from direct ec measurements at this smaller scale as can be seen from the higher nse 0 88 vs 0 85 and smaller rmse 82 3 vs 91 2 mm yr 1 values table 1 note also that a significant underestimation of et in partial regions of arizona and nevada exists in the cr model which to a large extent is mitigated in the rs product of fluxcom partly due to a flatter slope in those values i e 0 87 vs 1 02 for cr fig 5 the reason for underestimation of the cr in these arid catchments is not yet clear but if et rates are patchy in time and in space as well meaning very high rates during and shortly after relatively few precipitation events and more persistently from phreatophyte vegetation and low rates otherwise due to the water conserving behavior of semi arid vegetation then the monthly mean input values e g air humidity of the cr may miss or significantly smooth out such sudden spikes this effect is not so severe over the larger huc2 basins c f fig 4 as they would contain mountainous regions where precipitation is more abundant of course the daily ec measurements employed by fluxcom would not be so affected 3 2 assessing the trends in annual et the cr is particularly robust in estimating trends in huc2 averaged annual et rates during 1979 2013 as evidenced by the highest nse 0 79 and the lowest rmse 0 7 mm yr 1 values in fig 6 and table 2 however all three rs meteo products of fluxcom tend to predict very narrow ranges seen in reduced slope values for the increasing decreasing trends when compared to et wb values of the 18 huc2 basins fig 6b c d thus underestimating long term tendencies the spatial distributions of the trends in annual et rates corroborates this gswp3 and cruncep produce much milder ones than et wb at most huc2 basins such a discrepancy is especially true for i the southwestern conus where et wb decreased obviously fig 6i but only slight corresponding changes are found in these two products fig 6g h and ii the southeastern conus where trends are opposite between et wb and these two products see fig 6g h i while the biases in trends diminish to some extent in the wfdei product fig 6b table 2 it still underestimates the decreasing trend of et wb in the southwestern us fig 6f on the whole cr accurately describes the trends in annual et rates over most huc2 basins exceptthe missouri basin with a trend opposite to the one in et wb see fig 6e i at the huc6 scale where et wb is more uncertain e g due to possible i differences in catchment boundaries between surface and groundwater ii enhanced role of interannual reservoir storage changes in the water balance the skills of all models estimating the trends in et rates during this 35 year period appear inferior to similar measures found at huc2 as can be seen from the decreased nse and increased rmse values table 2 the highest nse 0 31 and r 0 632 values are provided by wfdei yielding an rmse value 1 7 mm yr 1 identical to that of the cr the latter also producing the largest slope value 0 37 fig 7 table 2 in a spatial manner however none of the rs meteo products of fluxcom could well capture the significant decreasing trend in et wb over western texas southern arizona and new mexico fig 7i during 1979 2013 while the cr was the only one showing magnitudes of change similar to those in et wb fig 7e note again that the trends from all three rs meteo products of fluxcom seem much milder than those from et wb due possibly to their underestimated iav of annual et rates see section 3 3 as can be seen from the milder fitted slopes ranging from 0 13 to 0 22 fig 7b c d in general gswp3 and cruncep exhibit poorer performance for the trends at the huc6 scale with nse values of about 0 2 fig 7c d consistent with their results at the huc2 scale during the short period of 2003 2015 the cr s ability nse 0 08 and rmse 2 4 mm yr 1 in estimating the et trends at the huc2 scale is again better than that of the rs product of fluxcom table 2 the latter producing a negative 0 79 nse value fig 8 b moreover the spatial pattern of trends by the cr fig 8c generally follows that in et wb fig 8e the latter exhibiting overall increasing trends for most huc2 basins in the eastern conus however the rs product of fluxcom yields decreasing trends for most parts of the eastern conus fig 8d the performance of the cr in estimating trends in annual et rates during 2003 2015 does not change much at the huc6 scale with nse and rmse values of 0 14 and 5 4 mm yr 1 respectively fig 9 a the rs product displays again weaker performance with a negative 0 19 nse value fig 9b table 2 due mainly to its large errors in the eastern conus see fig 9d e similar to above mentioned contrasting trends for the huc2 basins 3 3 assessing the temporal variations in annual et the arithmetic averages of the statistical metrics of the cr and fluxcom performance in simulating the annual et time series of the 18 huc2 or 327 huc6 basins were used for assessing the temporal variations in annual et the only exception is the nse value where the median was computed due to the occasional large negative values for basins where the difference in multiyear modeled and water balance et averages is large for capturing temporal variations in annual et rates during 1979 2013 the cr and fluxcom exhibit overall similar performances in terms of rmse rb and nse values for both huc2 fig 10 and huc6 fig s2 scales the iav in et wb was unanimously underestimated the strongest in the three rs meteo products of fluxcom with riav values less than 50 while cr achieves about 80 fig 10d over the period of 2003 2015 figs 10f j s2f j the cr also yields better performance in riav 60 and 30 for cr and rs products respectively while in the nse rb and rmse values the cr again performs similar to the rs product of fluxcom in both spatial scales 4 discussions and conclusion 4 1 uncertainties in model validation using the water balance method it must be recognized that the reported model performances may be confounded by possible errors embedded in et wb carter et al 2018 liu 2018 while δs has been considered for both short 2003 2015 and long 1979 2013 periods the coarse spatial resolutions of grace and grace rec would probably cause biases in et wb of small watersheds which may be particularly true for the huc6 basins besides while prism p is one of the most thoroughly validated land measured precipitation dataset for conus because it considers the effects of elevation rain shadows and coastal proximity in the interpolation process daly et al 2008 the ubiquitous underestimation in precipitation measurements due to e g wind induced undercatch as well as wetting and evaporation losses yang et al 2005 sieck et al 2007 could lead to uncertainties in any gridded precipitation data lundquist et al 2019 however the errors found in the prism p estimates are mostly within 5 to 15 of the recorded ground station values jeton et al 2005 daly et al 2008 2017 while quantifying the errors in the et wb values emerging from precipitation and or δs is beyond the scope of the present study a detailed analysis of such uncertainties in the water balance approach would certainly benefit the overall validation of large scale et products 4 2 relative merits of fluxcom and cr the recently available powerful ml techniques have stimulated substantial advances in hydrological research such as the estimation of precipitation tang et al 2018 soil moisture kolassa et al 2018 snow water equivalent bair et al 2018 runoff yaseen et al 2019 and drought forecasting deo et al 2017 in particular the ml based upscaling of ec flux measurements to regional e g fang et al 2020 or global scales e g jung et al 2019 has greatly boosted our understanding of et at extended spatial and temporal dimensions although the low density of ec towers in certain areas e g africa south america west and south asia may not be sufficient to exploit the capability of ml to extract relevant characteristics of space structure note also that while the rs product of flxucom takes full advantage of remotely sensed data and exhibits excellent skills in representing the spatial pattern of the multiyear mean et rates it performs poorly for the trends in annual et see figs 8 9 due possibly to the calibration degradation of modis collection 5 data wang et al 2012 in which the enhanced vegetation index a key variant used for training the rs product of fluxcom has not been well calibrated lyapustin et al 2014 this indicates that incorporating further advanced satellite observations may benefit rs based machine learning of et in the future in addition the uncertainty in any et models can also result from the uncertainty in the meteorological forcing for example the evaluation by tang et al 2017 suggested that cruncep still has obvious biases in its temperature and precipitation data when compared with the station measured results of 90 cities in united states though cruncep has improved a little bit upon the ncep i and ncep ii reanalyses which might be the reason why cruncep based rs meteo product of fluxcom exhibits larger biases in et estimates across conus see tables 1 2 while the cr performs comparably to for the trends better than fluxcom in the estimation of et across the conus it is worthwhile to highlight that fluxcom produced not only et but also net radiation and sensible heat fluxes jung et al 2019 as well as carbon fluxes including gross primary production and net ecosystem exchange jung et al 2020 with a worldwide coverage over the last few decades this way fluxcom complements a holistic view of land atmosphere energy water and carbon exchanges at a global scale that may not be otherwise possible from any other single dataset which is particularly vital for the developing countries where ec flux towers are spatially sparser and temporally shorter than in developed ones chu et al 2017 the present validations suggest that the gswp3 drived rs meteo product and the rs product of fluxcom perform well in representing the multiyear mean et c f figs 2 4 we therefore believe that fluxcom is certainly valuable for not only lsms and rs model evaluations but also provides fundamental constraints of global energy and carbon cycling the most important merit of cr is that it relies solely on standard atmospheric forcing han and tian 2020 to estimate et without any precipitation data the latter being the most uncertain meteorological variable to predict e g in climate models besides cr avoids the possible uncertainties in any gridded vegetation and soil data which are usually key inputs for most lsm and rs based et models however a weakness of the present calibration free cr as a benchmark for calibration verification of other large scale et models is that it is not recommended to be employed on a daily or sub daily bases in fact morton 1983 suggested not using the cr for periods shorter than five days because large scale weather fronts may bring air masses over the land with a moisture signature decoupled from the underlying surface which thus may temporarily disrupt the dynamic equilibrium of air humidity and surface fluxes in the land atmosphere system hence an additional temporal aggregation of model simulations is necessary for models that are driven by daily or sub daily forcing before validating them against the cr note also that the cr is not able to predict et in a prognostic mode i e et rates at a future time of t dt from the soil moisture and vegetation status obtained at time t since it estimates the cause et from the effect moisture content and temperature of the air ma and szilagyi 2019 however the cr can be employed for reality checks of the climate models future scenarios to see whether the projected state of the atmosphere is indeed in balance via the cr with the assumed et rates produced by the climate models in conclusion it can be stated that the cr is on a par with the fluxcom et products no matter which meteorological forcing and or satellite data are used in the latter the cr however performs somewhat better in representing the long term et trends than fluxcom while uncertainties exist in the cr based et results over certain regions the cr could still serve as a benchmarking tool for verifications of the lsms rs and ml based large scale et estimates due to its robust performance minimal data requirement and calibration free nature however it should be emphasized again that fluxcom contains not only et but also other energy and carbon fluxes with a global coverage and thus continues to provide the community with a valuable reference dataset for studies associated with large scale terrestrial energy water and carbon cycles credit authorship contribution statement ning ma conceptualization methodology formal analysis software investigation resources data curation

5172,fissures and conduits are main void of karstic aquifer karst aquifers are highly vulnerable to contamination as water exchange between fissuresystem andconduitsystem greatly influences the karstification of limestone terrains heterogeneity of karstic aquifer and spring flow regime a two dimensional tank model was constructed and a corresponding numerical model modflow 2005 conduit flow process mode 1 cfpm1 was developed to explore the effects of rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter on conduit matrix water exchange nine different scenarios were designed to quantitatively simulate the spatial and temporal variability of water exchange between the fissures and conduits the study reproduced the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone and the area of fissure water moving laterally transport zone in both physical model and numerical model the results from rainfall scenarios show a relatively stable ratio of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone with increasing rainfall intensity indicating that conduit matrix water exchange is not sensitive to rainfall intensity and conduit water discharging to fissure water is just a short term phenomenon it is also found that an increase in hydraulic conductivity of fissure system enhances extensiveness of water transport but restrains conduit matrix water exchange however the enlargement of conduit can prompt the extent of conduit matrix water exchange a positive feedback between the extent of conduit matrix water exchanges and karstification can be confirmed these findings might be essential for better understanding groundwater flow dynamics in karst aquifers keywords water exchange laboratory experiments numerical modeling rainfall intensity fissure hydraulic conductivity conduit diameter 1 introduction the world s largest springs are fed by water flowing through fissure and conduit in the karstic aquifers with heterogenous media karst conduits are developed when the pathways in the soluble minerals are enlarged de rooij et al 2013 gabrovšek and dreybrodt 2001 martin and dean 2001 the enlargement of originally small fissures by dissolution results in highly heterogeneous distribution of permeability within karst aquifers fischer et al 2018 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hubinger and birk 2011 kaufmann 2003 moore et al 2010 the typical coexistence of fissure matrix and conduit systems allows extensive mixture and exchange between these two systems which exhibits great influence on the karstification of limestone terrains especially in a young karst aquifer bauer et al 2003 birk et al 2003 halihan and wicks 1998 the interaction makes karst system highly vulnerable to contaminated surface water particularly when conduits are hydraulically connected to ground berkowitz 2002 narasimhan 1982 the fissure system includes the matrix and fissure porosity and the conduit system is composed of the conduit porosity bauer et al 2000 hartmann et al 2013 kaufmann and braun 2000 this dual character of karst flow system has long been widely accepted and confirmed in florida martin and dean 2001 schilling and helmers 2008 karst aquifers exhibit a dual flow system characterized by interacting conduit and matrix domains with different porosities and permeabilities ford and williams 1989 saller et al 2013 worthington 2009 laminar flow predominately exists in the equivalent porous medium fissure domain which is characterized as a low hydraulic conductivity but high storage capacity on the other hand flow along the conduits always tends to be turbulent flow and is characterized by a high hydraulic conductivity but a low storage capacity arfib and de marsily 2004 martin and dean 2001 shoemaker et al 2008 compared to its surrounding fissures the conduit system has higher hydraulic conductivity and becomes the main drainage passage connecting directly to the spring chang et al 2015 perne et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 as the fissures and conduit systems are connected water exchanges between the interface of the two domains driven by hydraulic gradient head differences within conduits and the permeability difference between conduits and the surrounding aquifer bauer et al 2003 binet et al 2017 cholet et al 2017 during dry seasons the conduits will act as a drainage passage from the surrounding fissures fig 1 a during wet seasons the gradients may reverse particularly where conduits are rapidly recharged by water infiltration through sinkholes in this case water flows from the conduits to the fissures as the head within the conduit is greater than the head of the surrounding fissures fig 1b fig 1c the water exchange is considered as a transient process binet et al 2017 schmidt et al 2014 shuster and white 1971 contaminants can transport from a conduit to the adjacent matrix and subsequently flow back again thus increasing their residence times and significantly altering the breakthrough curves this process in contaminant transport is called sequestration li et al 2008 it has been long recognized that conduit water can gain or lose water from matrix and the amount can be as large as 50 of spring discharge newson 1971 atkinson 1977 however early researches on karst system focus on either geomorphic features and their hydrologic functions or singular element of karst flow dynamics with emphasis on spring hydrograph faulkner et al 2009 kordilla et al 2012 some studies divide spring hydrograph into quick flow conduit water and diffuse flow fissure water by variations in spring discharge using artificial dye tracing cholet et al 2017 li 2012 lauber et al 2014 luhmann et al 2015 spring hydrographs especially the recession curves are also employed to estimate parameters of karst flow and transport with hypothesis that the breakthrough curves infer physical properties of the karst aquifers massei et al 2006 liu et al 2010a bailly comte et al 2009 2010 concluded that water exchange between conduits and matrix controls the flow regime at the spring when conduits are filled with water without delayed infiltration and conduit matrix exchange is low a linear decrease is observed in the spring discharge reimann et al 2011 theoretically proved the significance of turbulent conduit flow on the exchanges between conduits and matrix and implemented the conduit flow capacity in numerical modeling binet et al 2017 investigated spatial distribution of water exchange along the conduit suggesting that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity chang et al 2015 also found flow characteristics greatly influence the shape of the spring hydrograph the turbulent conduit flow could strongly influence the early spring hydrograph from the point recharge while the late spring hydrograph is mainly controlled by diffuse recharge and the influence from the turbulent conduit may disappear worthington and soley 2017 xu et al 2018 used local and global sensitivity to evaluate the impacts of hydrological characteristics and boundary conditions on modeling groundwater contamination in a karst aquifer and found the conduit parameters and boundary conditions are important to the simulations in the porous medium because of the dynamical exchanges between the two systems it is difficult to monitor groundwater heads in fissure conduit aquifer in the field and quantitatively analyze water exchange between fissure water and conduit water these findings reinforce the need to quantitatively analyze water exchange between fissure water and conduit water the physical and laboratory scale modeling of karst aquifers is an effective approach to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling karst groundwater flow a small scale column of packed fractured media is usually employed to study colloidal transport and solute transport toran and palumbo 1992 palmer 1991 introduced five types of conduit patterns branchwork network ramiform anastomotic and single conduit florea and wicks 2001 constructed laboratory scale models of branchwork and of network karstic aquifers to investigate the flow characteristics with breakthrough curves and found the flow regime is laminar and advective processes dominated transport processes li et al 2008 used a porous walled pipe chamber of closely packed glass beads and salt to simulate a conduit porous limestone matrix and conservative contaminant respectively active and passive transfer of water between conduit and matrix have been identified as the mechanisms involved in sequestration faulkner et al 2009 conducted multiple experiments to measure hydraulic head distribution and contaminant transport and to simulate exchange between the matrix and the conduit system mohammadi et al 2019 investigated the effect of hydraulic gradient and pattern of conduit systems on tracing tests in a bench scale modeling and found as hydraulic gradient increases both one half the time for peak concentration and one fifth the time for peak concentration decrease numerical simulations have also been applied to karst researches modflow cfp is a relatively new modeling program that accounts for flow in conduits within an aquifer and can achieve better results compared to equivalent modflow 2000 2005 models gallegos et al 2013 the cfp has the ability to simulate turbulent ground water flow conditions by coupling the traditional ground water flow equation with formulations for a discrete network of cylindrical pipes several new subroutines were written specifically for cfpm1 including subroutines that 1 compute flow in partially filled pipes 2 account for changes in pipe storage when pipes are partially filled 3 compute ground water exchange between the conduit pipes and porous media based on the pipe conductance specified for a model cell and 4 correct ground water exchange between partially filled conduit pipes and porous media in modflow cfp matrix and fissured porosities are regarded as equivalent porous medium with a united hydraulic conductivity difrenna et al 2008 calculated the hydrodynamic threshold between laminar and non laminar flow within conduits of key largo limestone with modflow cfp giese et al 2018 used modflow cfp to study the effects of different conduit flow regimes on drawdown in conduit and matrix and found that the impacts depended on the hydraulic properties of the conduit system i e conduit diameter and relative roughness cfp mode 1 cfpm1 is in essence a hybrid model which couples the laminar flow in equivalent porous medium with the non laminar flow in the discrete pipe network previous results are encouraging however these studies typically only consider the influence of water exchange on recession curves but lack for quantitative observations of water exchange between matrix and conduit spatially and temporally loper and chicken 2011 comprehensive understanding of karst aquifers requires a systematic approach in which the fissures and conduit are considered as an integrated part of the whole system faulkner et al 2009 more researches will be needed to better understand the exchange mechanisms between the fissure water and conduit water wu and hunkeler 2013 the primary purpose of this research was to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of water exchange between the fissure and conduit in response to rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter unique aspects of this study include construction of a physical model and the development of a numerical model by modflow cfp the laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the conduit matrix water exchanges for a variety of rainfall intensities further numerical simulations were extendedly conducted to simulate the laboratory experiments to assess the effects of intrinsic structure of karst system on conduit matrix water exchanges under different conditions the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone and the area of fissure water moving laterally transport zone were calculated the evolution of exchange coefficient was also used to quantify the conduit matrix water exchanges 2 methods 2 1 physical model a conceptual model of a karst aquifer is used in this study the flow system of a karst aquifer is assumed to consist of a single conduit embedded in a fissure system the laboratory system had a shape that grossly resembled the common elements of a karst conduit liu et al 2010b wu and hunkeler 2013 to study water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system of a karst aquifer a simplified two dimensional physical model was constructed as shown in fig 2 the perspex made model was 5 m long 3 m wide and 0 5 m thick the model consists of four parts the rainfall system the karst fissure system the conduit system and the data monitoring and acquisition system the physical model was rectangular with a height of 5 cm and varying diameters to simulate conduit system located at the bottom of the model and a matrix domain composed of aerated concrete blocks overlying the conduit permeability of the concrete block was estimated by simply constant head permeability tests hydraulic conductivity of the concrete block is around 3 5 10 7 m s a relatively small part left side of the main system was covered by waterproof materials as a confining layer to represent the confined area the rest of the system was to simulate the unconfined aquifer groundwater flow in the conduit is confined or unconfined which connects the spring the physical model allowed water flow and water exchange under a complex situation and is a conceptualization of hydrogeological conditions of the karst aquifer a detailed description of the construction process is available in wu et al 2019 a single conduit was placed within the bottom of the fissure system the conduit 5 m long was divided into 50 tubes with 0 1 m for each tube the conduit represented a percolating pathway in this karstic aquifer the fissures and conduit areas were separated by distance spacers with different thickness that is fissure distance spacers including horizontal fissures and vertical fissures in the experiments were 0 7 mm a fixed head of 0 m at the end of the conduit was used to represent the karst spring the height of the spring opening was set to be 0 05 m above the bottom of the tank to ensure that the downstream area is a confined aquifer the initial head in the tank was also set to be 0 05 m boundary conditions for the fissured system were a no flux boundary set at the upper end the right side and at the lower end the left side and the bottom the rainfall system was made of plastic pipe networks 0 65 m above the karst fissure and the conduit system and connected to the tap water the choose of 0 65 m height can ensure an even distribution of precipitation on the unconfined aquifer without falling out of the physical model fig 3 a total of seventeen high sensitivity ae t by nanjing ae sensor technology co ltd nanjing china deflated pressure transducers pts were buried into the bottom of the physical model to measure hydraulic heads these pts were connected to a time synchronized data logger that collected measurements once per second fig 2 the physical model served as dual purposes to explore the impacts of rainfall intensity on water exchange between the fissures and conduit and to benchmark the parameters used in numerical models for further studies of intrinsic structure hydraulic conductivity of the fissures medium and conduit diameter on water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system 2 2 numerical model numerical models have been used successfully to gain insights into the complex hydrodynamic functioning of hydrogeological systems de rooij et al 2013 the applied numerical method to

outlet and modeled using a drain cell thus a modeled conduit system extends upgradient from the spring all recharge was applied to fissure system rather than directly into conduit sensitive parameters adjusted during the calibration included the drain conductance of the spring and the united hydraulic conductivity of equivalent porous medium fissures and matrix model development also revealed that in addition to the matrix properties results are sensitive to the conduit diameter and roughness the roughness coefficient for the conduit was set to 0 01 cm which reflects a relatively smooth conduit wall a conduit tortuosity of 1 was used as the conduit is straight in each finite difference cell the measured hydraulic head data were used to calibrate the model in particular the values of the roughness the specific storage and the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix were calibrated using the trial and error method table 1 conduit surface area dependent exchange in the model settings was active with conduit wall permeability set equivalent to the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix the calibration results obtained in this study shows a strong qualitative agreement between simulated and observed hydraulic heads and spring discharge demonstrating the cfp model s ability to represent the physical model fig 4 in addition all of the experimentally measured hydraulic heads increased with rainfall duration but declined in response to the end of rainfall the discharge rate remained relatively stable even when the rainfall stopped only after certain volume of water was passed through the karst aquifer did the discharge rate begin to drop significantly there was a time lag in the spring discharge due to the high storage of the fissure system 2 4 scenarios one group of experiments were carried out in three scenarios with different average rainfall intensities ari in the rainfall system a well calibrated numerical model was employed to further study the effects of intrinsic structure hydraulic conductivity of the fissures medium conduit diameter on water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system another two groups of experiments were also carried out in three scenarios respectively with different hydraulic conductivities of the fissure medium and different conduit diameters as summarized in table 2 based on the physical model a numerical model was built to study interaction between fissure and conduit waters for intrinsic structure the coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit was used to evaluate the magnitude of influence of various factors on water exchange between fissures and conduit the coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit can be calculated by using the following formula 8 δ α e x j i t α e x j i t α e x j i t where δ is coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit α e x j i t is exchange coefficient between fissures and conduit and can be obtained by modflow cfpm1 from formula 6 α e x j i t is exchange coefficient with the consideration of an influence factor such as rainfall intensity increases when δ is a positive value the coefficient of water exchange increases when δ is a negative value the coefficient of water exchange decreases 3 results there is complex interaction between fissures and conduits in the karstic aquifer the exchange flux between the fissures and the conduit is affected by rainfall hydraulic conductivity of the fissures conduit diameter etc the spatial and temporal water exchange between the fissures and the conduit for different scenarios was studied by constructing a group of physical experiments and the corresponding numerical models based on modflow cfp the water exchange is regarded as a transient process in the next sections zone a recharge zone is referred to the area where the fissure water is recharging to the conduit while zone b discharge zone is referred to the area where the conduit water is discharging to the fissure and zone c transport zone is referred to the area where there is no water exchange between fissures and the conduit water is laterally moving 3 1 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different rainfall intensities water exchange between fissures and the conduit was studied for three different rainfall intensities table 2 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 5 groundwater heads were increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity while flow net was changed for different scenarios 3 1 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when rainfall intensity is 0 0018 mm s the area and its ratio zone a divided by the whole area of the physical model of zone a red increased from 84 645 02 cm2 and 56 43 at 200 s to 95 736 74 cm2 and 63 82 at 900 s and then to 135 344 26 cm2 and 90 23 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 with continuing rainfall the flow fields were gradually controlled by rainfall this trend shows that the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone increased with time on the contrary the area and the ratio of zone b blue decreased from 5588 71 cm2 and 3 73 at 200 s to 1952 94 cm2 and 1 31 at 900 s and then to 0 cm2 and 0 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 this trend shows that the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to the fissure after the rainfall similarly the area and the ratio of zone c yellow decreased from 59 766 27 cm2 and 39 84 at 200 s to 52 310 32 cm2 and 34 87 at 900 s and then to 14 655 74 cm2 and 9 77 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 it means that the area of fissure water laterally moving transport zone decreased with time 3 1 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the early stage at the early stage of 200 s as rainfall intensity is increased from 0 0018 mm s to 0 0036 mm s the ratio of zone a decreased from 56 43 to 50 91 indicating that the area of recharge slightly decreased with the rainfall intensity increase table 3 fig 5a similarly the area of discharge zone slightly increased with the rainfall intensity increase however the ratio of zone c fluctuates around 40 implying that the area of transport zone is relatively stable with increasing rainfall intensities 3 1 3 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the middle stage at the middle stage of 900 s the areas and the ratios of all the three zones are relatively stable even if rainfall intensity is increased the ratio of zone a is around 64 and the ratio of zone b is around 1 and the transport zone occupies about 35 of physical model area table 3 fig 5b 3 1 4 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the end stage at the end stage of 1200 s the ratio of zone a ranged from 90 17 to 90 68 table 3 fig 5c it means that the area of fissure water discharging to conduit nearly stayed constant with the rainfall intensity increase and fissure water discharging to conduit accounts for more than 90 of physical model area it is noted that the discharge zone decreased to 0 at the end stage for three rainfall scenarios which means that no conduit water discharging to fissure with the rainfall intensity increase the ratio of zone c ranged from 9 32 to 9 83 table 3 fig 5c it means that the area of transport zone also stayed constant 3 2 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different fissure medium conductivities the hydraulic conductivity of the fissure medium kf is also the major influence factor on matrix conduit water exchanges three different hydraulic conductivity kf 1 cm s 5 cm s 10 cm s were applied three scenarios for different k of fissure medium were shown in table 4 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 6 3 2 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when kf 1 cm s the area and the ratio of zone a decreased from 83 329 76 cm2 and 55 56 at 200 s to 97 616 14 cm2 and 65 07 at 900 s and to 143 441 16 cm2 and 95 63 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 it means that the area of recharge zone greatly increased with time however the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at 1200 s as the area and the ratio of zone b decreased from 18 422 92 cm2 and 12 28 at 220 s to 4 540 25 cm2 and 3 03 at 900 s and to 0 cm2 and 0 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 the area and the ratio of zone c decreased from 48 247 32 cm2 and 32 16 at 200 s to 47 843 61 cm2 and 31 90 at 900 s and 6 558 84 cm2 and 4 37 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 the results showed the area of transport zone decreased sharply with time 3 2 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at different stages at the early stage the area of recharge zone slightly decreased with the increasing kf and the ratio of zone a were decreased from 55 56 to 48 60 table 4 fig 6a also the ratio of zone b decreased from 12 28 to 5 09 table 4 fig 6b in contrast the ratio of zone c increased from 32 16 to 46 31 indicating that the area of transport zone increased with the increasing kf variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at the middle stage and the end stage exhibited a same trend as that of the early stage with decreased zone a and zone b but increased zone c though the kf increased from 1 cm s to 5 cm s and to 10 cm s it is also noted that the discharge zone diminished to 0 at the end stage for three scenarios 3 3 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different conduit diameters the potential impact of conduit diameter cd on water exchange between fissures and conduit was analyzed by increasing conduit diameter from 3 cm to 4 cm and to 5 cm table 5 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 7 3 3 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when cd 3 cm the area of recharge zone greatly increased but both the areas of discharge zone and transport zone decreased with time the ratio of zone a increased from 47 87 at 200 s to 90 13 at 1200 s and the ratio of zone b decreased from 4 56 at 200 s to 0 at 1200 s table 5 fig 7 it indicates that the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at 1200 s the area of transport zone also undergoes great decrease as the ratio decreased from 47 57 at 200 s to 9 87 at 1200 s table 5 fig 7 3 3 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing cd at different stages at different stage the area of recharge zone increased with the increasing kf the ratio of zone a accounted for 50 of the whole area especially at the end stage more than 90 area of the physical model were recharge zone table 5 fig 7 in contrast the ratio of zone c showed a trend of decrease and the ratio of zone b accounted for less than 10 of the physical model area and showed a fluctuation at different stages variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at the middle stage and the end stage exhibited a same trend as that of the early stage with decreased zone a and zone b but increased zone c though the kf increased from 1 cm s to 5 cm s and to 10 cm s the discharge zone decreased to 0 at the end stage for three scenarios 4 discussions this study developed a physical sand tank model and a corresponding numerical simulation model to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of conduit fissure water exchange in response to rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system the area of recharge zone the area of discharge zone and the area of transport zone were calculated based on contour of hydraulic heads from seventeen high sensitivity deflated pressure transducers the spatial and temporal variability of conduit fissure water exchange were characterized by the area variations of recharge zone discharge zone and transport zone at different stages for different scenarios 4 1 the sensitivity of rainfall intensity with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges a distinctive feature of the three rainfall scenarios is that the area of transport zone almost stayed constant at the early stage for different rainfall intensities the area of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone almost stayed the same about 60 and the area of transport zone also stayed the same about 40 the area of exchange zone increased slightly and stayed about 65 area of the physical model at the middle stage but the area of transport zone decreased slightly and stayed about the same about 35 similarly the area of exchange zone increased greatly and stayed about 90 area of the physical model but the area of transport zone decreased greatly and stayed about the same about 10 at the end stage and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 8 for different rainfall intensities the water exchange between fissures and the conduit exhibited a similar trend the ration of exchange zone increases with time the results for different rainfall intensities at different stages show a relatively low effect of the rainfall intensity on water exchanges between fissures and the conduit the area of recharge zone increased with time at the cost of the areas of discharge zone and transport zone the results from the physical model suggest that the amounts of conduit water coming from the surrounding fissure are significant especially during the post rainfall drainage because fast conduit flow results in fast decrease in pressure when the pressure decreases the local gradient between the matrix conduit interface maximized and the experimentally observed exchanges increased the rapid pressure decreases in the conduit after the rainfall intensified the extent of water exchanges binet et al 2017 the increase of recharge zone is also due to the slow flow and larger storage of the aquifer discharge of the conduit toward the fissure was also observed during the early rainfall stage when the discharge is limited by the spring interface properties and confined area a rapid increasing pressure head in the conduit creates the discharge zone but the water head in the fissure increases as rainfall continues the head differences between the two domains decline and then reverse and the area of discharge zone decreases finally the discharge zone diminishes the co existence of zone a and zone b implies the fissure water recharged to the conduit upstream but late returned to the fissure downstream thus increasing their residence time in the karst aquifer the extent of this exchange is critical to management of water supplies as most water is stored in the fissure porosity martin and dean 2001 the absence of discharge zone indicates water discharges rapidly through the conduit system and have little effects on the quality of surrounding fissure water however the extensive exchange of water between conduit and fissure could affect the water quality in fissure porosity coefficient variation ratio δ of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different rainfall intensities was calculated for cell 6 of conduit fig 2 from left to right as cell 6 experienced losing water to the fissures and gaining water from the fissure rainfall intensity had negligible impact on water exchange during the rainfall drainage but the impact began to increasingly appear during post rainfall stage fig 9 the ratio gradually increased with time and exhibited a positive correlation with rainfall intensity the ratio increased greatly with rainfall intensity especially during post rainfall stage suggesting more rapid and extensive of water exchanges during this stage 4 2 the sensitivity of fissure medium conductivity with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges for different k of fissure medium the area of recharge zone greatly increased but the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure during post rainfall drainage the area of transport zone greatly decreased with time at the early stage for different kf the area of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone decreased and the area of transport zone increased at the middle stage when kf is increased the areas of exchange zone decreased and the area of transport zone increased at the end stage when kf is increased the area of exchange zone decreased while the area of transport zone increased and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 10 water exchanges between a karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer are driven by hydraulic head gradient at the interface between these two domains the hydraulic conductivity has a negative significant impact on these exchanges but allows for more extensive of water transport exchange flow is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured system which determines the order of magnitude for the value of the exchange coefficient bauer et al 2003 coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different kf was calculated and found to change with time fig 11 the variation ratio for different kf was similar to variation ratio for different rainfall intensity scenarios the impact of different kf on water exchange between fissure and conduit differed from the early stage to the end stage of spring flow fig 11 the ratio was positive with increasing kf the greater the hydraulic conductivity the bigger the ratio was obtained especially during the spring discharge recession the ratio gradually increased with time which means that the extent of water exchange between fissure and conduit gradually increased 4 3 the sensitivity of conduit diameter with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges for different cd the area of recharge zone greatly increased and the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at the end stage the area of transport zone greatly decreased with the time at the early stage when cd increased the extent of exchange zone increased because the areas of recharge zone and discharge zone both increased and the area of transport zone decreased at the middle stage both the areas of recharge zone and discharge zone increased with an increase in cd and the area of transport zone slightly decreased at the end stage when cd increased the area of recharge zone slightly increased and the area of transport zone decreased and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 12 the extent of the exchange zone increases with conduit diameter for different stages the extent of this exchange is also critical to the understanding of karst hydrodynamics and of fluid solid reactions within the aquifer as the exchange of water between conduit and fissure could disturb chemical equilibrium established between the water and surrounding rock martin and dean 2001 a positive feedback can be inferred if the karstification of the conduit is considered as conduit enlargement causes more extensive exchange between the conduit and surrounding matrix which in turn leads to lower calcium concentrations in the conduit and thus enhances further dissolution growth exchange flow is a powerful mechanism that can enhance karstification of limestone terrains bauer et al 2003 coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different conduit diameters was calculated and found to change with time fig 13 the processes can be divided into three stages during the rainfall stage and late recession stage the ratio was negative value and decreased absolute value increased indicating that the coefficient decreased with the increasing conduit diameter during the early recession stage the ratio was positive value and increased indicating that the coefficient increased with the increasing conduit diameter 5 conclusions a detailed study of effects of rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter on conduit fissure are very difficult to assess at the field scale this study quantitatively analyzes water exchange between fissure water and conduit water in a physical model a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the impacts of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of fissure medium conduit diameter on spatial and temporal water exchange between the fissures and conduit in a karstic aquifer the results indicated that the numerical models successfully simulated groundwater heads observed in the physical tank karstic aquifer this study demonstrated several important conclusions 1 conduit water discharged to fissure water is just a transitory phenomenon as it occurs during rainfall event and the discharge zone diminishes during the post rainfall drainage for all scenarios the matrix conduit water exchange is not sensitive to rainfall intensity because the aera of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone almost stay the same with increasing rainfall intensity for different stages 2 the hydraulic conductivity of fissure system has a negative significant impact on conduit matrix water exchanges higher permeable fissure enhances more extensive of water transport as the transport zone increases with hydraulic conductivity for different stages but the corresponding exchange zone decreases 3 the enlargement of conduit diameter can increase the extent of conduit matrix water exchange as the extent of exchange zone increases with the increasing conduit diameter for different stages this process also confirms a positive feedback exists if the karstification of the conduit is considered conduit development causes more extensive conduit matrix exchange which in turn takes lower calcium concentrations into the conduit and thus enhances further karstification notably due to the scale effect some of the derived results are unusual for example the single conduit with uniform diameter is not common in nature and branchwork is more common palmer 1991 the limitation however does not affect the main purpose of this study conduit matrix water exchange have great effects on contaminate sequestration which can be modeled by tracer and this deserves further researches nevertheless these understandings provide enhanced and improved insights into the impact of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of fissure medium and conduit diameter on water exchange between fissure water and conduit water in a karstic aquifer further these findings might be essential for better understanding groundwater flow dynamics

5172,fissures and conduits are main void of karstic aquifer karst aquifers are highly vulnerable to contamination as water exchange between fissuresystem andconduitsystem greatly influences the karstification of limestone terrains heterogeneity of karstic aquifer and spring flow regime a two dimensional tank model was constructed and a corresponding numerical model modflow 2005 conduit flow process mode 1 cfpm1 was developed to explore the effects of rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter on conduit matrix water exchange nine different scenarios were designed to quantitatively simulate the spatial and temporal variability of water exchange between the fissures and conduits the study reproduced the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone and the area of fissure water moving laterally transport zone in both physical model and numerical model the results from rainfall scenarios show a relatively stable ratio of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone with increasing rainfall intensity indicating that conduit matrix water exchange is not sensitive to rainfall intensity and conduit water discharging to fissure water is just a short term phenomenon it is also found that an increase in hydraulic conductivity of fissure system enhances extensiveness of water transport but restrains conduit matrix water exchange however the enlargement of conduit can prompt the extent of conduit matrix water exchange a positive feedback between the extent of conduit matrix water exchanges and karstification can be confirmed these findings might be essential for better understanding groundwater flow dynamics in karst aquifers keywords water exchange laboratory experiments numerical modeling rainfall intensity fissure hydraulic conductivity conduit diameter 1 introduction the world s largest springs are fed by water flowing through fissure and conduit in the karstic aquifers with heterogenous media karst conduits are developed when the pathways in the soluble minerals are enlarged de rooij et al 2013 gabrovšek and dreybrodt 2001 martin and dean 2001 the enlargement of originally small fissures by dissolution results in highly heterogeneous distribution of permeability within karst aquifers fischer et al 2018 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hubinger and birk 2011 kaufmann 2003 moore et al 2010 the typical coexistence of fissure matrix and conduit systems allows extensive mixture and exchange between these two systems which exhibits great influence on the karstification of limestone terrains especially in a young karst aquifer bauer et al 2003 birk et al 2003 halihan and wicks 1998 the interaction makes karst system highly vulnerable to contaminated surface water particularly when conduits are hydraulically connected to ground berkowitz 2002 narasimhan 1982 the fissure system includes the matrix and fissure porosity and the conduit system is composed of the conduit porosity bauer et al 2000 hartmann et al 2013 kaufmann and braun 2000 this dual character of karst flow system has long been widely accepted and confirmed in florida martin and dean 2001 schilling and helmers 2008 karst aquifers exhibit a dual flow system characterized by interacting conduit and matrix domains with different porosities and permeabilities ford and williams 1989 saller et al 2013 worthington 2009 laminar flow predominately exists in the equivalent porous medium fissure domain which is characterized as a low hydraulic conductivity but high storage capacity on the other hand flow along the conduits always tends to be turbulent flow and is characterized by a high hydraulic conductivity but a low storage capacity arfib and de marsily 2004 martin and dean 2001 shoemaker et al 2008 compared to its surrounding fissures the conduit system has higher hydraulic conductivity and becomes the main drainage passage connecting directly to the spring chang et al 2015 perne et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 as the fissures and conduit systems are connected water exchanges between the interface of the two domains driven by hydraulic gradient head differences within conduits and the permeability difference between conduits and the surrounding aquifer bauer et al 2003 binet et al 2017 cholet et al 2017 during dry seasons the conduits will act as a drainage passage from the surrounding fissures fig 1 a during wet seasons the gradients may reverse particularly where conduits are rapidly recharged by water infiltration through sinkholes in this case water flows from the conduits to the fissures as the head within the conduit is greater than the head of the surrounding fissures fig 1b fig 1c the water exchange is considered as a transient process binet et al 2017 schmidt et al 2014 shuster and white 1971 contaminants can transport from a conduit to the adjacent matrix and subsequently flow back again thus increasing their residence times and significantly altering the breakthrough curves this process in contaminant transport is called sequestration li et al 2008 it has been long recognized that conduit water can gain or lose water from matrix and the amount can be as large as 50 of spring discharge newson 1971 atkinson 1977 however early researches on karst system focus on either geomorphic features and their hydrologic functions or singular element of karst flow dynamics with emphasis on spring hydrograph faulkner et al 2009 kordilla et al 2012 some studies divide spring hydrograph into quick flow conduit water and diffuse flow fissure water by variations in spring discharge using artificial dye tracing cholet et al 2017 li 2012 lauber et al 2014 luhmann et al 2015 spring hydrographs especially the recession curves are also employed to estimate parameters of karst flow and transport with hypothesis that the breakthrough curves infer physical properties of the karst aquifers massei et al 2006 liu et al 2010a bailly comte et al 2009 2010 concluded that water exchange between conduits and matrix controls the flow regime at the spring when conduits are filled with water without delayed infiltration and conduit matrix exchange is low a linear decrease is observed in the spring discharge reimann et al 2011 theoretically proved the significance of turbulent conduit flow on the exchanges between conduits and matrix and implemented the conduit flow capacity in numerical modeling binet et al 2017 investigated spatial distribution of water exchange along the conduit suggesting that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity chang et al 2015 also found flow characteristics greatly influence the shape of the spring hydrograph the turbulent conduit flow could strongly influence the early spring hydrograph from the point recharge while the late spring hydrograph is mainly controlled by diffuse recharge and the influence from the turbulent conduit may disappear worthington and soley 2017 xu et al 2018 used local and global sensitivity to evaluate the impacts of hydrological characteristics and boundary conditions on modeling groundwater contamination in a karst aquifer and found the conduit parameters and boundary conditions are important to the simulations in the porous medium because of the dynamical exchanges between the two systems it is difficult to monitor groundwater heads in fissure conduit aquifer in the field and quantitatively analyze water exchange between fissure water and conduit water these findings reinforce the need to quantitatively analyze water exchange between fissure water and conduit water the physical and laboratory scale modeling of karst aquifers is an effective approach to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling karst groundwater flow a small scale column of packed fractured media is usually employed to study colloidal transport and solute transport toran and palumbo 1992 palmer 1991 introduced five types of conduit patterns branchwork network ramiform anastomotic and single conduit florea and wicks 2001 constructed laboratory scale models of branchwork and of network karstic aquifers to investigate the flow characteristics with breakthrough curves and found the flow regime is laminar and advective processes dominated transport processes li et al 2008 used a porous walled pipe chamber of closely packed glass beads and salt to simulate a conduit porous limestone matrix and conservative contaminant respectively active and passive transfer of water between conduit and matrix have been identified as the mechanisms involved in sequestration faulkner et al 2009 conducted multiple experiments to measure hydraulic head distribution and contaminant transport and to simulate exchange between the matrix and the conduit system mohammadi et al 2019 investigated the effect of hydraulic gradient and pattern of conduit systems on tracing tests in a bench scale modeling and found as hydraulic gradient increases both one half the time for peak concentration and one fifth the time for peak concentration decrease numerical simulations have also been applied to karst researches modflow cfp is a relatively new modeling program that accounts for flow in conduits within an aquifer and can achieve better results compared to equivalent modflow 2000 2005 models gallegos et al 2013 the cfp has the ability to simulate turbulent ground water flow conditions by coupling the traditional ground water flow equation with formulations for a discrete network of cylindrical pipes several new subroutines were written specifically for cfpm1 including subroutines that 1 compute flow in partially filled pipes 2 account for changes in pipe storage when pipes are partially filled 3 compute ground water exchange between the conduit pipes and porous media based on the pipe conductance specified for a model cell and 4 correct ground water exchange between partially filled conduit pipes and porous media in modflow cfp matrix and fissured porosities are regarded as equivalent porous medium with a united hydraulic conductivity difrenna et al 2008 calculated the hydrodynamic threshold between laminar and non laminar flow within conduits of key largo limestone with modflow cfp giese et al 2018 used modflow cfp to study the effects of different conduit flow regimes on drawdown in conduit and matrix and found that the impacts depended on the hydraulic properties of the conduit system i e conduit diameter and relative roughness cfp mode 1 cfpm1 is in essence a hybrid model which couples the laminar flow in equivalent porous medium with the non laminar flow in the discrete pipe network previous results are encouraging however these studies typically only consider the influence of water exchange on recession curves but lack for quantitative observations of water exchange between matrix and conduit spatially and temporally loper and chicken 2011 comprehensive understanding of karst aquifers requires a systematic approach in which the fissures and conduit are considered as an integrated part of the whole system faulkner et al 2009 more researches will be needed to better understand the exchange mechanisms between the fissure water and conduit water wu and hunkeler 2013 the primary purpose of this research was to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of water exchange between the fissure and conduit in response to rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter unique aspects of this study include construction of a physical model and the development of a numerical model by modflow cfp the laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the conduit matrix water exchanges for a variety of rainfall intensities further numerical simulations were extendedly conducted to simulate the laboratory experiments to assess the effects of intrinsic structure of karst system on conduit matrix water exchanges under different conditions the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone and the area of fissure water moving laterally transport zone were calculated the evolution of exchange coefficient was also used to quantify the conduit matrix water exchanges 2 methods 2 1 physical model a conceptual model of a karst aquifer is used in this study the flow system of a karst aquifer is assumed to consist of a single conduit embedded in a fissure system the laboratory system had a shape that grossly resembled the common elements of a karst conduit liu et al 2010b wu and hunkeler 2013 to study water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system of a karst aquifer a simplified two dimensional physical model was constructed as shown in fig 2 the perspex made model was 5 m long 3 m wide and 0 5 m thick the model consists of four parts the rainfall system the karst fissure system the conduit system and the data monitoring and acquisition system the physical model was rectangular with a height of 5 cm and varying diameters to simulate conduit system located at the bottom of the model and a matrix domain composed of aerated concrete blocks overlying the conduit permeability of the concrete block was estimated by simply constant head permeability tests hydraulic conductivity of the concrete block is around 3 5 10 7 m s a relatively small part left side of the main system was covered by waterproof materials as a confining layer to represent the confined area the rest of the system was to simulate the unconfined aquifer groundwater flow in the conduit is confined or unconfined which connects the spring the physical model allowed water flow and water exchange under a complex situation and is a conceptualization of hydrogeological conditions of the karst aquifer a detailed description of the construction process is available in wu et al 2019 a single conduit was placed within the bottom of the fissure system the conduit 5 m long was divided into 50 tubes with 0 1 m for each tube the conduit represented a percolating pathway in this karstic aquifer the fissures and conduit areas were separated by distance spacers with different thickness that is fissure distance spacers including horizontal fissures and vertical fissures in the experiments were 0 7 mm a fixed head of 0 m at the end of the conduit was used to represent the karst spring the height of the spring opening was set to be 0 05 m above the bottom of the tank to ensure that the downstream area is a confined aquifer the initial head in the tank was also set to be 0 05 m boundary conditions for the fissured system were a no flux boundary set at the upper end the right side and at the lower end the left side and the bottom the rainfall system was made of plastic pipe networks 0 65 m above the karst fissure and the conduit system and connected to the tap water the choose of 0 65 m height can ensure an even distribution of precipitation on the unconfined aquifer without falling out of the physical model fig 3 a total of seventeen high sensitivity ae t by nanjing ae sensor technology co ltd nanjing china deflated pressure transducers pts were buried into the bottom of the physical model to measure hydraulic heads these pts were connected to a time synchronized data logger that collected measurements once per second fig 2 the physical model served as dual purposes to explore the impacts of rainfall intensity on water exchange between the fissures and conduit and to benchmark the parameters used in numerical models for further studies of intrinsic structure hydraulic conductivity of the fissures medium and conduit diameter on water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system 2 2 numerical model numerical models have been used successfully to gain insights into the complex hydrodynamic functioning of hydrogeological systems de rooij et al 2013 the applied numerical method to

outlet and modeled using a drain cell thus a modeled conduit system extends upgradient from the spring all recharge was applied to fissure system rather than directly into conduit sensitive parameters adjusted during the calibration included the drain conductance of the spring and the united hydraulic conductivity of equivalent porous medium fissures and matrix model development also revealed that in addition to the matrix properties results are sensitive to the conduit diameter and roughness the roughness coefficient for the conduit was set to 0 01 cm which reflects a relatively smooth conduit wall a conduit tortuosity of 1 was used as the conduit is straight in each finite difference cell the measured hydraulic head data were used to calibrate the model in particular the values of the roughness the specific storage and the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix were calibrated using the trial and error method table 1 conduit surface area dependent exchange in the model settings was active with conduit wall permeability set equivalent to the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix the calibration results obtained in this study shows a strong qualitative agreement between simulated and observed hydraulic heads and spring discharge demonstrating the cfp model s ability to represent the physical model fig 4 in addition all of the experimentally measured hydraulic heads increased with rainfall duration but declined in response to the end of rainfall the discharge rate remained relatively stable even when the rainfall stopped only after certain volume of water was passed through the karst aquifer did the discharge rate begin to drop significantly there was a time lag in the spring discharge due to the high storage of the fissure system 2 4 scenarios one group of experiments were carried out in three scenarios with different average rainfall intensities ari in the rainfall system a well calibrated numerical model was employed to further study the effects of intrinsic structure hydraulic conductivity of the fissures medium conduit diameter on water exchange between the conduit and the fissure system another two groups of experiments were also carried out in three scenarios respectively with different hydraulic conductivities of the fissure medium and different conduit diameters as summarized in table 2 based on the physical model a numerical model was built to study interaction between fissure and conduit waters for intrinsic structure the coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit was used to evaluate the magnitude of influence of various factors on water exchange between fissures and conduit the coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit can be calculated by using the following formula 8 δ α e x j i t α e x j i t α e x j i t where δ is coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissures and conduit α e x j i t is exchange coefficient between fissures and conduit and can be obtained by modflow cfpm1 from formula 6 α e x j i t is exchange coefficient with the consideration of an influence factor such as rainfall intensity increases when δ is a positive value the coefficient of water exchange increases when δ is a negative value the coefficient of water exchange decreases 3 results there is complex interaction between fissures and conduits in the karstic aquifer the exchange flux between the fissures and the conduit is affected by rainfall hydraulic conductivity of the fissures conduit diameter etc the spatial and temporal water exchange between the fissures and the conduit for different scenarios was studied by constructing a group of physical experiments and the corresponding numerical models based on modflow cfp the water exchange is regarded as a transient process in the next sections zone a recharge zone is referred to the area where the fissure water is recharging to the conduit while zone b discharge zone is referred to the area where the conduit water is discharging to the fissure and zone c transport zone is referred to the area where there is no water exchange between fissures and the conduit water is laterally moving 3 1 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different rainfall intensities water exchange between fissures and the conduit was studied for three different rainfall intensities table 2 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 5 groundwater heads were increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity while flow net was changed for different scenarios 3 1 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when rainfall intensity is 0 0018 mm s the area and its ratio zone a divided by the whole area of the physical model of zone a red increased from 84 645 02 cm2 and 56 43 at 200 s to 95 736 74 cm2 and 63 82 at 900 s and then to 135 344 26 cm2 and 90 23 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 with continuing rainfall the flow fields were gradually controlled by rainfall this trend shows that the area of fissure water recharging to conduit recharge zone increased with time on the contrary the area and the ratio of zone b blue decreased from 5588 71 cm2 and 3 73 at 200 s to 1952 94 cm2 and 1 31 at 900 s and then to 0 cm2 and 0 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 this trend shows that the area of conduit water discharging to fissure water discharge zone decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to the fissure after the rainfall similarly the area and the ratio of zone c yellow decreased from 59 766 27 cm2 and 39 84 at 200 s to 52 310 32 cm2 and 34 87 at 900 s and then to 14 655 74 cm2 and 9 77 at 1200 s respectively table 3 fig 5 it means that the area of fissure water laterally moving transport zone decreased with time 3 1 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the early stage at the early stage of 200 s as rainfall intensity is increased from 0 0018 mm s to 0 0036 mm s the ratio of zone a decreased from 56 43 to 50 91 indicating that the area of recharge slightly decreased with the rainfall intensity increase table 3 fig 5a similarly the area of discharge zone slightly increased with the rainfall intensity increase however the ratio of zone c fluctuates around 40 implying that the area of transport zone is relatively stable with increasing rainfall intensities 3 1 3 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the middle stage at the middle stage of 900 s the areas and the ratios of all the three zones are relatively stable even if rainfall intensity is increased the ratio of zone a is around 64 and the ratio of zone b is around 1 and the transport zone occupies about 35 of physical model area table 3 fig 5b 3 1 4 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with different rainfall intensities at the end stage at the end stage of 1200 s the ratio of zone a ranged from 90 17 to 90 68 table 3 fig 5c it means that the area of fissure water discharging to conduit nearly stayed constant with the rainfall intensity increase and fissure water discharging to conduit accounts for more than 90 of physical model area it is noted that the discharge zone decreased to 0 at the end stage for three rainfall scenarios which means that no conduit water discharging to fissure with the rainfall intensity increase the ratio of zone c ranged from 9 32 to 9 83 table 3 fig 5c it means that the area of transport zone also stayed constant 3 2 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different fissure medium conductivities the hydraulic conductivity of the fissure medium kf is also the major influence factor on matrix conduit water exchanges three different hydraulic conductivity kf 1 cm s 5 cm s 10 cm s were applied three scenarios for different k of fissure medium were shown in table 4 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 6 3 2 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when kf 1 cm s the area and the ratio of zone a decreased from 83 329 76 cm2 and 55 56 at 200 s to 97 616 14 cm2 and 65 07 at 900 s and to 143 441 16 cm2 and 95 63 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 it means that the area of recharge zone greatly increased with time however the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at 1200 s as the area and the ratio of zone b decreased from 18 422 92 cm2 and 12 28 at 220 s to 4 540 25 cm2 and 3 03 at 900 s and to 0 cm2 and 0 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 the area and the ratio of zone c decreased from 48 247 32 cm2 and 32 16 at 200 s to 47 843 61 cm2 and 31 90 at 900 s and 6 558 84 cm2 and 4 37 at 1200 s respectively table 4 fig 6 the results showed the area of transport zone decreased sharply with time 3 2 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at different stages at the early stage the area of recharge zone slightly decreased with the increasing kf and the ratio of zone a were decreased from 55 56 to 48 60 table 4 fig 6a also the ratio of zone b decreased from 12 28 to 5 09 table 4 fig 6b in contrast the ratio of zone c increased from 32 16 to 46 31 indicating that the area of transport zone increased with the increasing kf variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at the middle stage and the end stage exhibited a same trend as that of the early stage with decreased zone a and zone b but increased zone c though the kf increased from 1 cm s to 5 cm s and to 10 cm s it is also noted that the discharge zone diminished to 0 at the end stage for three scenarios 3 3 the spatio temporal variability of conduit matrix water exchanges under different conduit diameters the potential impact of conduit diameter cd on water exchange between fissures and conduit was analyzed by increasing conduit diameter from 3 cm to 4 cm and to 5 cm table 5 the contours of groundwater level and flow net at different times were shown in fig 7 3 3 1 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with time when cd 3 cm the area of recharge zone greatly increased but both the areas of discharge zone and transport zone decreased with time the ratio of zone a increased from 47 87 at 200 s to 90 13 at 1200 s and the ratio of zone b decreased from 4 56 at 200 s to 0 at 1200 s table 5 fig 7 it indicates that the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at 1200 s the area of transport zone also undergoes great decrease as the ratio decreased from 47 57 at 200 s to 9 87 at 1200 s table 5 fig 7 3 3 2 variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing cd at different stages at different stage the area of recharge zone increased with the increasing kf the ratio of zone a accounted for 50 of the whole area especially at the end stage more than 90 area of the physical model were recharge zone table 5 fig 7 in contrast the ratio of zone c showed a trend of decrease and the ratio of zone b accounted for less than 10 of the physical model area and showed a fluctuation at different stages variation of areas of zone a zone b and zone c with increasing kf at the middle stage and the end stage exhibited a same trend as that of the early stage with decreased zone a and zone b but increased zone c though the kf increased from 1 cm s to 5 cm s and to 10 cm s the discharge zone decreased to 0 at the end stage for three scenarios 4 discussions this study developed a physical sand tank model and a corresponding numerical simulation model to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of conduit fissure water exchange in response to rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system the area of recharge zone the area of discharge zone and the area of transport zone were calculated based on contour of hydraulic heads from seventeen high sensitivity deflated pressure transducers the spatial and temporal variability of conduit fissure water exchange were characterized by the area variations of recharge zone discharge zone and transport zone at different stages for different scenarios 4 1 the sensitivity of rainfall intensity with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges a distinctive feature of the three rainfall scenarios is that the area of transport zone almost stayed constant at the early stage for different rainfall intensities the area of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone almost stayed the same about 60 and the area of transport zone also stayed the same about 40 the area of exchange zone increased slightly and stayed about 65 area of the physical model at the middle stage but the area of transport zone decreased slightly and stayed about the same about 35 similarly the area of exchange zone increased greatly and stayed about 90 area of the physical model but the area of transport zone decreased greatly and stayed about the same about 10 at the end stage and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 8 for different rainfall intensities the water exchange between fissures and the conduit exhibited a similar trend the ration of exchange zone increases with time the results for different rainfall intensities at different stages show a relatively low effect of the rainfall intensity on water exchanges between fissures and the conduit the area of recharge zone increased with time at the cost of the areas of discharge zone and transport zone the results from the physical model suggest that the amounts of conduit water coming from the surrounding fissure are significant especially during the post rainfall drainage because fast conduit flow results in fast decrease in pressure when the pressure decreases the local gradient between the matrix conduit interface maximized and the experimentally observed exchanges increased the rapid pressure decreases in the conduit after the rainfall intensified the extent of water exchanges binet et al 2017 the increase of recharge zone is also due to the slow flow and larger storage of the aquifer discharge of the conduit toward the fissure was also observed during the early rainfall stage when the discharge is limited by the spring interface properties and confined area a rapid increasing pressure head in the conduit creates the discharge zone but the water head in the fissure increases as rainfall continues the head differences between the two domains decline and then reverse and the area of discharge zone decreases finally the discharge zone diminishes the co existence of zone a and zone b implies the fissure water recharged to the conduit upstream but late returned to the fissure downstream thus increasing their residence time in the karst aquifer the extent of this exchange is critical to management of water supplies as most water is stored in the fissure porosity martin and dean 2001 the absence of discharge zone indicates water discharges rapidly through the conduit system and have little effects on the quality of surrounding fissure water however the extensive exchange of water between conduit and fissure could affect the water quality in fissure porosity coefficient variation ratio δ of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different rainfall intensities was calculated for cell 6 of conduit fig 2 from left to right as cell 6 experienced losing water to the fissures and gaining water from the fissure rainfall intensity had negligible impact on water exchange during the rainfall drainage but the impact began to increasingly appear during post rainfall stage fig 9 the ratio gradually increased with time and exhibited a positive correlation with rainfall intensity the ratio increased greatly with rainfall intensity especially during post rainfall stage suggesting more rapid and extensive of water exchanges during this stage 4 2 the sensitivity of fissure medium conductivity with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges for different k of fissure medium the area of recharge zone greatly increased but the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure during post rainfall drainage the area of transport zone greatly decreased with time at the early stage for different kf the area of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone decreased and the area of transport zone increased at the middle stage when kf is increased the areas of exchange zone decreased and the area of transport zone increased at the end stage when kf is increased the area of exchange zone decreased while the area of transport zone increased and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 10 water exchanges between a karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer are driven by hydraulic head gradient at the interface between these two domains the hydraulic conductivity has a negative significant impact on these exchanges but allows for more extensive of water transport exchange flow is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured system which determines the order of magnitude for the value of the exchange coefficient bauer et al 2003 coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different kf was calculated and found to change with time fig 11 the variation ratio for different kf was similar to variation ratio for different rainfall intensity scenarios the impact of different kf on water exchange between fissure and conduit differed from the early stage to the end stage of spring flow fig 11 the ratio was positive with increasing kf the greater the hydraulic conductivity the bigger the ratio was obtained especially during the spring discharge recession the ratio gradually increased with time which means that the extent of water exchange between fissure and conduit gradually increased 4 3 the sensitivity of conduit diameter with respect to conduit matrix water exchanges for different cd the area of recharge zone greatly increased and the area of discharge zone greatly decreased with time and no conduit water discharging to fissure at the end stage the area of transport zone greatly decreased with the time at the early stage when cd increased the extent of exchange zone increased because the areas of recharge zone and discharge zone both increased and the area of transport zone decreased at the middle stage both the areas of recharge zone and discharge zone increased with an increase in cd and the area of transport zone slightly decreased at the end stage when cd increased the area of recharge zone slightly increased and the area of transport zone decreased and there was no conduit water discharging to the fissures fig 12 the extent of the exchange zone increases with conduit diameter for different stages the extent of this exchange is also critical to the understanding of karst hydrodynamics and of fluid solid reactions within the aquifer as the exchange of water between conduit and fissure could disturb chemical equilibrium established between the water and surrounding rock martin and dean 2001 a positive feedback can be inferred if the karstification of the conduit is considered as conduit enlargement causes more extensive exchange between the conduit and surrounding matrix which in turn leads to lower calcium concentrations in the conduit and thus enhances further dissolution growth exchange flow is a powerful mechanism that can enhance karstification of limestone terrains bauer et al 2003 coefficient variation ratio of water exchange between fissure and conduit for different conduit diameters was calculated and found to change with time fig 13 the processes can be divided into three stages during the rainfall stage and late recession stage the ratio was negative value and decreased absolute value increased indicating that the coefficient decreased with the increasing conduit diameter during the early recession stage the ratio was positive value and increased indicating that the coefficient increased with the increasing conduit diameter 5 conclusions a detailed study of effects of rainfall intensity and intrinsic structure of karst system hydraulic conductivity of fissures and conduit diameter on conduit fissure are very difficult to assess at the field scale this study quantitatively analyzes water exchange between fissure water and conduit water in a physical model a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the impacts of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of fissure medium conduit diameter on spatial and temporal water exchange between the fissures and conduit in a karstic aquifer the results indicated that the numerical models successfully simulated groundwater heads observed in the physical tank karstic aquifer this study demonstrated several important conclusions 1 conduit water discharged to fissure water is just a transitory phenomenon as it occurs during rainfall event and the discharge zone diminishes during the post rainfall drainage for all scenarios the matrix conduit water exchange is not sensitive to rainfall intensity because the aera of exchange zone recharge zone and discharge zone almost stay the same with increasing rainfall intensity for different stages 2 the hydraulic conductivity of fissure system has a negative significant impact on conduit matrix water exchanges higher permeable fissure enhances more extensive of water transport as the transport zone increases with hydraulic conductivity for different stages but the corresponding exchange zone decreases 3 the enlargement of conduit diameter can increase the extent of conduit matrix water exchange as the extent of exchange zone increases with the increasing conduit diameter for different stages this process also confirms a positive feedback exists if the karstification of the conduit is considered conduit development causes more extensive conduit matrix exchange which in turn takes lower calcium concentrations into the conduit and thus enhances further karstification notably due to the scale effect some of the derived results are unusual for example the single conduit with uniform diameter is not common in nature and branchwork is more common palmer 1991 the limitation however does not affect the main purpose of this study conduit matrix water exchange have great effects on contaminate sequestration which can be modeled by tracer and this deserves further researches nevertheless these understandings provide enhanced and improved insights into the impact of rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of fissure medium and conduit diameter on water exchange between fissure water and conduit water in a karstic aquifer further these findings might be essential for better understanding groundwater flow dynamics

scarce region with relatively arid and hot weather multiple studies have focused on water budget analysis in the ubn basin but water cycle analyses are missing at high spatiotemporal resolution yield from a fully distributed hydrological model that closes water and energy budgets in this paper we describe the simulation of evapotranspiration et and discharge at fine spatiotemporal resolution 500 m and 3 hourly from 1979 to 2014 using the coupled routing and excess storage soil vegetation atmosphere snow crest svas distributed hydrological model which physically maintains water and energy balance we also present a comparison of et and discharge as derived from crest with those simulated by other existing global models our results show that where the global models perform well for specific hydrological components et and discharge crest can simulate et at 500 m resolution with 0 93 correlation coefficient 0 81 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and 4 75 bias for daily scale and discharge at different basin scales with nse values ranging from 0 46 to 0 75 we performed cascade calibration for discharge and tested the optimized parameters on noncalibrated sites the good model performance at the noncalibrated sites nse 0 6 bias within 15 indicated the calibrated parameters can be used for ungauged locations finally the terrestrial water storage change twsc from crest was also consistent with reference data and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the hyper resolution accurate hydrological components from crest will enable effective prediction of water budget helpful for initiating local and large scale sustainable development plans that address social and policy requirements as well as extreme climatic conditions keywords hydrological model crest svas upper blue nile ethiopia water budget evapotranspiration 1 introduction a major global concern affecting sustainable development from social economic and environmental perspectives is a scarcity of freshwater that constitutes a world water crisis by quantifying the movement of water and changes in its storage in the environment water budget analysis can aid decision making for water resources management such analysis is hampered however by insufficiency of hydroclimatic data resulting from the inadequacy of the meteorological stations currently in use in the upper blue nile ubn basin in ethiopia temperatures and levels of solar radiation are high and conditions relatively arid the basin contributes approximately 50 km3 of water per year to the nile river and serves as a lifeline for some 250 millionpeople dile et al 2018 the highlands of ethiopia especially the steep canyons of the blue nile offer some of the best hydropower development sites in the world which could be exploited by increasing upstream withdrawals and constructing water storage infrastructure blackmore and whittington 2008 moreover hydropower dams in ubn can improve water conservation and flow regulation appelgren et al 2000 through management that involves storing water during the rainy season and releasing it for irrigation during the dry season agricultural production can be expanded for a second growing cycle where rainfed farming now predominates the urgency of such infrastructure development is growing according to coffel et al 2019 increasingly hot and dry conditions in ubn will exacerbate water scarcity even a projected rise in precipitation will not significantly improve the water supply because of the increasing water stress on the per capita runoff supply exerted by the rapidly growing population coffel et al 2019 food security will also be threatened since crop yields from rainfed agriculture are more vulnerable to a hot and dry climate valverde et al 2015 overcoming these harmful effects of future climate extremes calls for the provision of additional water sources through the construction of water storage dams groundwater withdrawals and the inter basin groundwater transfer by channeling recharged water from the middle blue nile to upper awash basins azagegn et al 2015 these initiatives must be undertaken however while maintaining hydrological and ecological balance as well as ensuring the sustainability of the groundwater footprint under such development gleeson et al 2012 a water budget analysis in ubn will help with planning the establishment and management of these water resources an undertaking that in addition to its technical challenges requires agreement among the transboundary nations to address controversies disputes and contrasting interests with regard to water egypt for example depends on the nile for 97 of its water supply and currently accounts for water withdrawals from the river of 55 5 km3 annually out of its total annual flow of 84 km3 johnston 2013 while ethiopia contributes 85 of the nile flow measured at aswan it has little storage and withdraws only about 3 km3 of water annually or 3 4 of the total from the river jeuland et al 2017 as part of its development goals the ethiopian government in 2011 began construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd at the outlet of the ubn basin at the border of sudan and ethiopia which will be one of the largest dams in africa while ethiopia expects to meet its increasing demand for domestic electricity through gerd allam and eltahir 2019 egypt fears the project will result in reduced water flows into the high aswan dam and a loss of hydropower accurate knowledge and quantification of hydrological processes in this region can help resolve the transboundary negotiations that will be essential to further development determine policies for cooperative river management strategies and ensure the development is sustainable hall et al 2014 by predicting hydrological processes at the fine spatiotemporal resolution hydrological models can aid water resources management including planning for efficient water use under extreme climatic conditions a lack of in situ hydrometeorological data and an effective modeling framework however has limited the ability of previous studies in ubn to quantify hydrological components and support management strategies most studies in ubn have applied simple water balance models at a large scale to analyze flow at the outlet of the ethiopian sudanese border where sub catchment analysis for spatial variation is missing johnson and curtis 1994 mishra and hata 2006 steenhuis et al 2009 some studies have been conducted in the data rich lake tana sub basin kebede et al 2006 rientjes et al 2011 setegn et al 2008 wale et al 2009 while others have focused on the more local sub basin to assess the catchment dynamics uhlenbrook et al 2010 the effects of climate change abdo et al 2009 and land use patterns tekleab et al 2014 prior studies in ubn have also focused on specific water cycle components such as precipitation variability block and rajagopalan 2007 rientjes et al 2012 abtew et al 2009 evapotranspiration allam et al 2016 nooni et al 2019 and sensitivity of runoff conway 1997 lemann et al 2018 and some analysis of the water cycle has been conducted at coarse temporal monthly resolution kim and kaluarachchi 2008 tekleab et al 2011 tegegne and kim 2018 have simulated streamflow at ungauged sites using a modeling framework validated at a similar gauged basin however analysis of a single water cycle component cannot assure consistently well model performance in terms of closing the water budget other studies have focused on assessing the effectiveness of lumped conceptual semi distributed and distributed physical models for at catchment scale even at coarser resolution or with relatively simple physics distributed models demonstrate advantages over lumped models tegegne et al 2017 conclude that conceptual models performed well in smaller watersheds gummera ribb whereas a physical model could perform better in a larger basin gilgel abbay abera et al 2017 have conducted a semi distributed water budget analysis in ubn by subdividing the basin into 402 hydrological response units hrus with a mean area of 430 339 km2 by comparing distributed 2 5 or 278 km and daily and lumped conceptual models in the ubn basin elsanabary and gan 2015 conclude that with accurate and detailed forcing a physically based water energy balance model could be appropriate for the hydrologically diverse ubn region lakew et al 2020 have evaluated satellite precipitation in the ubn basin through a distributed model crest v2 1 shen et al 2014 an earlier version of the model used in this study at 1 km and 3 hourly resolution without closing the energy balance or parameterizing the complex heterogeneity of the land surface and the soil property eldardiry and hossain 2019 have developed a macroscale distributed 10 km and daily hydrological model using satellite hydrometeorological observations to analyze reservoir operation in the nile river for a data scarce region like the ubn basin water resources management at the local scale requires however fine spatiotemporal characterization of the physically coupled water and energy components et and discharge rather than coarse resolution models with simple physics in recent years remote sensing products have provided opportunities to overcome the data scarcity problem and become a basis for quantifying water budget closures sheffield et al 2009 distributed satellite land surface products have enabled the design of more reliable realistic complex hydrological modeling frameworks although the advancement of remote sensing products has paved the way for the development of various global land surface and hydrological models however errors in different satellite products propagate to the model simulated water cycle component consequently the performance consistency of all vital water cycle components is disrupted bhuiyan et al 2019 abera et al 2017 have developed a methodology to compute water cycle components from satellite products although the systematic bias in terms of et restricted the water budget closure in short as hornberger and boyer 1995 mentioned the combined use of representative data and modeling framework can be a key to improve the estimation of water cycle components in this study we aim to resolve the issues of quantifying consistently well performing vital water cycle components et and discharge for the ubn basin at fine spatiotemporal resolution by using a physically distributed hydrological model crest soil vegetation atmosphere snow crest svas developed by shen and anagnostou 2017 crest svas is designed to represent water cycle components accurately by physically coupling the energy and water balances at hyper spatiotemporal resolution moreover to simulate consistently good river runoff at multiple basin scales we have performed cascade calibration with a fully distributed routing scheme which can further help with computing discharge at ungauged sites in addition to carrying out the direct validation of the simulated water cycle components we have evaluated the model s performance comparing it against other global hydrological models the performance analysis and evaluation results discussed in this paper show the model can be used for water budget closure and to provide reliable information for planning water resources management at the local scale 2 study area ubn shown in fig 1 is the largest river basin in ethiopia in terms of volume of discharge and the second largest in terms of area extending from the lake tana highlands to the sudanese border at eldiem conway 2000 it is the largest tributary of the nile river and has a drainage area of around 176 000 km2 contributing 60 of the discharge to the main nile basin it is referred to as the water tower of northeastern africa conway and hulme 1993 the ethiopian highlands in ubn are inhabited by almost 20 million people central statistical agency 2013 where the economy mainly depends on agriculture abera et al 2017 thus water demands on ubn are high for irrigation and domestic uses moreover as the principal contributor of the nile basin it is the economic mainstay for the downstream countries egypt and sudan the spatial pattern of climate and topography in ubn is heterogeneous and complex fig 1 shows relatively high terrain elevations from 1500 m to 4000 m in the eastern part of the basin and low elevation from 500 m to 1500 m in the western part its climatology varies from arid to semiarid with mean annual precipitation from 925 mm to 1845 mm conway 1997 2000 the mean annual temperature is about 18 5 c kim et al 2008 and the annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 1100 mm kim and hogue 2008 3 methodology in this section we provide a brief overview of the runoff generation components in crest svas that couple water and energy balances the fully distributed routing scheme the calibration method the input and observation datasets and the error metrics as well as the global models we have used for comparison 3 1 crest overview we have simulated the water cycle components using coupled routing and excess storage crest which is a fully distributed hydrological model the computationally efficient new version of crest can simulate the soil vegetation atmosphere snow svas process and strictly maintain the water and energy balance it can simulate for a large basin nearly 106 km2 at high spatiotemporal resolution 30 m to 1 km spatially and hourly time steps over a long period a few decades shen and anagnostou 2017 for any given layer crest svas can simultaneously solve the water balance for water availability and the thermal balance for temperature change as the amount of temperature change indicates the energy used for the phase change of water its runoff generation module can physically solve a coupled water and energy balance 3 1 1 runoff generation the water cycle processes in the rainfall runoff generation module include interception of the rainfall evapotranspiration and infiltration of the through rainfall and finally the generation of surface and subsurface direct runoff at each grid during the process of achieving a thermal balance within the vegetation and three soil layers and their boundaries the available water content in each layer greatly affects the thermal properties and the transferrable water amount dictates the consumable latent heat on the other hand the available energy components regulate the water phase change loss and gain within each soil layer in this study we have tested crest svas for the no snow condition so the different components of terrestrial evaporation included transpiration from the canopy layer and small vegetation and bare soil evaporation through the coupled water and energy balance in the corresponding layers fig 2 depicts the water and energy balance mechanism in the model for the detailed process in each phase the reader is referred to shen and anagnostou 2017 3 1 2 discharge the surface and subsurface direct runoff are input to a fully distributed linear reservoir routing fdlrr module built into crest svas to compute channel discharge shen et al 2014 2017 the fdlrr can only represent the natural routing process in ubn however we regulate the lake release that greatly affects the outflow downstream to lake tana to compute the flow at any channel point downstream to the lake we have removed the contribution from the drainage area upstream of the lake outlet and added the downstream contribution of the basin and the lake outflow with a time delay and a loss factor as formulated by eq 1 1 q dl t q d l o t q l t t d 1 l where for a given time step t q d l t stands for the discharge at the observatory point q d l o t is the discharge contributed by the drainage area downstream to the lake l is the loss factor of the lake outflow due to evaporation and q l t t d is the discharge at the lake outlet at time t t d where t d is the time delay the time delay is computed as the traveling distance from the lake outlet to the observatory point over the water flow velocity in the channel coer shen et al 2014 2017 similar to kohli and frenken 2015 we apply a 10 evaporative loss factor l during the flow in the channel represented by the delayed time we used observed lake outflow available from 1979 to 2002 as q l and beyond that period we used the model simulated lake outflow for the routing of the downstream outlets the computed stream path distances from the lake outlets to kessie and eldiem are 319 and 927 km respectively at eldiem the contribution of lake outflow can be less significant compared to kessie due to the significantly further distance from the lake 927 vs 319 km and the larger drainage area to verify this we also simulate total flow at downstream outlets by assuming that the lake contributes as a natural reservoir with no regulation 3 1 3 calibration scheme for the optimized routing parameters we have used multisite cascading calibration built into crest svas most hydrological models are calibrated against flow observations at a single station then the calibrated parameters are applied to the entire upstream sub basins the single site calibration strategy may result in degraded performance at locations far away from the reference station due to the spatial heterogeneity of geomorphologic characteristics of a large basin choi et al 2015 ricard et al 2013 a multi site cascade calibration on the other hand can improve the overall performance xue et al 2016 since the topography of ubn is complex with high spatial variation in elevation and precipitation we believe a single site calibration at the outlet eldiem may not provide satisfactory discharge elsewhere in the basin we therefore perform multisite calibration against four cascaded sites gilgel lake tana kessie and eldiem we first calibrate at gilgel and lake tana we have simulated the lake outflow by significantly reducing the amount of surface and sub surface runoffs fexcs and fexci in table 1 and calibrating with the observed lake outflow using the lake outflow as inflow we then calibrate the downstream sub watersheds against the kessie and eldiem stations consecutively the calibration parameters are described in table 1 value 1 of fexcs and fexci indicate all excess runoffs will join channel flow we use the slope and the parameters coem and expm to compute the overland flow velocity coer and coes are respectively the factor to scale overland flow velocity to channel velocity and the factor to scale surface flow velocity to subsurface velocity ks and ki are surface and subsurface linear reservoir coefficients to determine the water release of given water storage 3 2 terrestrial water storage change twsc terrestrial water storage tws refers to water that remains above or below the land surface it incorporates the water in snow or ice soil moisture surface water and groundwater and the water contained in the biomass rodell and famiglietti 1999 in the terrestrial hydrological cycle precipitation p over a basin is balanced by evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage change twsc güntner et al 2007 güntner 2008a meng et al 2019 twsc is therefore determined for a basin by subtracting the total et and total runoff from the total precipitation twsc p et r for a specified period in this case annually in this study we first compute the et and discharge in crest svas and determine the twsc at different basin scales 3 3 data in this section we describe the reference observed data and the data we used as inputs in the model 3 3 1 reference water cycle components the reference precipitation is generated by spatially interpolating 153 in situ rain gauge observations provided by the ethiopian national meteorological agency sahlu et al 2017 into regular grids of 0 25 resolution using the ordinary kriging ok algorithm we use the mswep precipitation to drive the crest svas simulations because after evaluating the different satellite precipitation products with respect to this reference gridded precipitation sahlu et al 2017 conclude that mswep outperforms both unadjusted and gauge adjusted era interim estimates and captures as well the equivalent spatial patterns with the gauge adjusted values during the wet season lakew et al 2020 also conclude that mswep performs better than other precipitation products fig 3 presents the spatial variation of the mean annual precipitation 1984 2014 from mswep and the reference observed precipitation the nse correlation coefficient and pbias of the monthly basin averaged mswep and observed precipitation are 0 93 0 94 and 10 13 respectively to validate the crest svas simulated actual evapotranspiration aet we use the aet from gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 1a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011b gleam v 3a computes aet using satellite retrieved soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent reanalysis air temperature and radiation and a multisource a combination of gauge based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation product spanning the 36 years from 1980 to 2015 martens et al 2017 gleam evapotranspiration is available at 0 25 spatial resolution 27 km and daily temporal resolution different studies have used gleam as reference et mccabe et al 2016 miralles et al 2011a the most recent version is validated globally over 64 fluxnet sites martens et al 2017 with satisfactory results gleam is used by abera et al 2017 as reference et in the ubn basin moreover nooni et al 2019 have validated gleam et with respect to fluxnet data in the nile basin and conclude its accuracy is reasonable which gives us the confidence to use gleam as a reference in ethiopia to evaluate the simulated discharge we use the daily in situ streamflow observations provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy and the abbay basin authority as reference the observed discharge data sites and temporal extent are shown in fig 6 the change in terrestrial water storage the twsc cannot be directly observed it can be estimated globally however using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data rodell et al 2007 güntner 2008a landerer and swenson 2012 at large scale and it has been used as reference in different parts of the world for water budget analysis meng et al 2019 schmidt et al 2006 shamsudduha et al 2017 solander et al 2017 yoon et al 2019 we have used the monthly grace data from 2002 to 2012 available from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl ftp podaac ftp jpl nasa gov alldata tellus l3 landmass rl05 to represent the anomalies of twsc according to landerer and swenson 2012 leakage error correction and scaling factors have been applied before comparing these data with the simulated twsc the minimum scale detectable by grace however ranges from 200 000 km2 at low latitudes to 90 000 km2 near the poles rodell et al 2018 similar to koukoula et al 2020 we have considered that the grace data can represent the eldiem basin and kessie basin with larger uncertainty of the latter whereas it cannot represent basins as small as gilgel since the good estimation of twsc can affect the accurate modeling of the other fluxes discharge q and et döll et al 2014 we can infer that accurate estimation of q and et might also be indicative of accurate twsc in this study we used the in situ precipitation p and flow q data with reference et gleam to compute the reference twsc for a basin where 2 t w s c o b s p o b s e t g l e a m q o b s since grace data does not work at all basin scales we consider t w s c o b s as reference we have also compared the model derived tws with grace at kessie and eldiem to compare the tws we calculate the anomalies of tws by averaging the monthly tws for all grids from 2002 to 2012 and subtract that mean value for each time step 3 3 2 input data and model parameters table 2 lists all input parameters used in the model in this study we run the land surface simulation from 1979 to 2014 at 500 m spatial and 3 hourly temporal resolution driven by meteorological variables in the reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 blended precipitation product along with precipitation the meteorological forcing variables used in this model include air temperature downward shortwave and longwave radiation air pressure specific humidity and wind speed prior studies lakew et al 2020 elsanabary and gan 2015 siam et al 2013 zeleke et al 2016 have used era reanalysis forcing variables to drive the hydrological model in the ubn basin we have extended the model from 2015 with global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2015 precipitation datasets for consistency with the historical simulation 1979 2014 we have temporally aggregated the meteorological variables from gdas and imerg precipitation to 3 hourly from the original resolution hourly and half hourly respectively while keeping the original spatial resolution 0 200 and 0 10 respectively sahlu et al 2016 have evaluated the imerg dataset in the ubn region and concluded it has a good correlation with gauge precipitation and acceptable bias we have obtained the dynamic remote sensing product leaf area index lai from glass lai at 8 day intervals and we have used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 to represent the land cover we compute soil hydraulic properties using the model developed by saxton and rawls 2006 which converts the 0 2 m six layered soil characteristics from africa soilgrids hengl et al 2015 the hydrographic variables i e the digital elevation model dem the flow direction fdr and the stream network are collected from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds at 15 arc second resolution lehner et al 2008 we resample the coarser resolution forcing data to 500 m grids using bilinear interpolation to consider the heterogeneous water cycle dominated by different land cover and soil types and to yield a more accurate discharge estimation at this resolution 3 4 error metrics the error metrics we have used to evaluate the model performances comprise percentage bias pbias nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and relative error nse pbias and relative errors are determined by the following equations 3 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 4 n s e 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 re s i o i o i where oi is observed data si is simulated data and o is mean observed data according to stehr et al 2008 an absolute value for pbias of less than 20 is considered good values between 20 and 40 are considered satisfactory and those greater than 40 are considered not satisfactory an nse index value greater than 0 75 is considered good while values between 0 75 and 0 36 are considered satisfactory and values below 0 36 are considered not satisfactory 3 5 existing global models in this study we have compared the crest svas simulated daily et and discharge with those simulated by several global models whose results are available from 1981 to 2014 at 0 25

rainfall runoff model that can simulate the hydrological processes that occur in a catchment lisflood has been developed by the floods group of the natural hazards project of the joint research centre

spatial computational unit is the irregularly shaped hydrologicalcatchment although the model can also be run on grid cells 4 results in this section we describe the validation of crest svas simulated et and discharge and the comparison of the error metrics of these hydrological components to those of existing global models 4 1 validation of evapotranspiration we have compared the aet from crest svas and gleam at eldiem basin to compare the temporal variation of et in the two models we have evaluated the basin averaged et at daily and monthly scales fig 4 for daily basin averaged et from 1984 to 2013 the correlation coefficient r is 0 93 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 81 and pbias is 4 75 for monthly et the correlation coefficient nse and pbias increased to 0 96 0 88 and 4 61 respectively to show the spatial distribution of et in both models we have evaluated the mean annual et from 1984 to 2014 shown in the map in fig 5 as the figure indicates the spatial variation in crest svas derived et agrees quite well with the gleam et moreover crest provides hyper resolution et at 500 m resolution whereas gleam et is at 0 25 27 km overall we have found that crest svas captures the spatial variability of aet at hyper resolution 500 m and the aggregated magnitude is comparable to that of the reference aet product from gleam 4 2 discharge calibration optimized routing parameters are obtained using a cascade calibration procedure built into crest svas the semi distributed multisite cascading calibration parameters are listed in table 1 and the calibrated hydrographs with error statistics are shown in fig 6 taking into consideration the computational expenses and time required to calibrate the routing parameters we use five years for calibration from the most upstream site gilgel abbay to the downstream lake tana kessie and eldiem sites fig 6 and validated the calibration parameters for the remaining periods the simulated discharge at the corresponding outlets agrees well with observations with high values of nse and correlation coefficient and low values of pbias the discharge at all the outlets is highly correlated with the observed flow above 0 80 at the gilgel abbay nse is high 0 77 and the 10 pbias indicates slight underestimation at the smaller scale basins the error metrics worsen slightly but remain within acceptable performance values for lake tana nse 0 57 and pbias 12 for kessie nse 0 46 and pbias 2 5 the low values of fexcs 0 32 and fexci 0 43 at lake tana indicate most of the runoffs are confined to the lake at eldiem for the validation period the pbias 35 indicates model overestimation at eldiem there can be unknown substantial traditional surface irrigation hagosa et al 2011 which may cause additional loss from the surface runoff moreover in small scale traditional irrigation water diversion structures are made of temporary local materials and water is diverted from the river by gravity through furrow irrigation haile 2015 because the traditional irrigation scheme is inefficient a significant amount of water diverted from the river is lost before it reaches the field teshome et al 2018 we can attribute the higher loss of the river water and reduced observed flow to this traditional surface irrigation at eldiem to check the sensitivity of the lake outflow to the downstream outlets we run the routing by considering the lake as a natural reservoir without adding the lake outflow at kessie and eldiem at kessie the model performance deteriorates with nse 0 37 pbias 11 4 and correlation coefficient 0 63 on the other hand in the case of eldiem the flow improves nse 0 56 pbias 30 and correlation coefficient 0 90 as a result of compensation for errors we have also tested the calibrated parameters in the corresponding noncalibrated sites the performance in all the noncalibrated sites gumara neshi didessa and gilgel beles at different basin scales shows satisfactory values of nse pbias and correlation coefficients fig 6 4 3 multi model comparison in this section we report the performance comparison of crest svas simulated et discharge and twsc to those of the global models at three basin scales at gilgel abbay 1664 km2 kessie 65 784 km2 and eldiem 177 643 km2 4 3 1 comparison in terms of et and discharge since more than 60 70 of the annual precipitation in the upper blue nile basin occurs during the wet season june september abera et al 2017 we compare et and streamflow during this period for all the models we compute the relative error of the basin averaged et from 1984 to 2014 at a monthly scale with respect to gleam for the relative error of discharge at the corresponding outlets we use gauge observed flow as fig 7 indicates crest svas outperforms the global models at all basin scales in terms of both et and discharge error metrics watergap performs better in terms of discharge at eldiem although for et it exhibited significantly higher relative error at all basin scales so does noah mp jules performs well in terms of et but for discharge at large basins it provides overestimated flow htessel gives a comparatively lower relative error in terms of both et and discharge but shows a larger relative bias of et than crest clsm performs well for discharge at larger basins but exhibits a higher relative error of et 4 3 2 comparison of terrestrial water storage change since grace provides the anomalies of twsc for comparison we compute the anomalies for all the models anomalies of twsc p et q are calculated as the monthly deviation from the mean twsc during the period shown in fig 8 from the multi model comparison of et and streamflow fig 7 we have found crest svas htessel ca ma jules and clsm are comparable as the performance of these models is relatively good for both et and discharge so we present monthly time series of the twsc anomalies from these four models for comparison to grace and t w s c o b s defined in section 3 3 2 in fig 8 because of the low spatial resolution we do not use grace data for the small gilgel basin fig 8 indicates that with respect to t w s c o b s all models capture the change in tws although each exhibits some bias grace and t w s c o b s show very similar results which gives us the confidence to use t w s c o b s as reference in the case of small basins like gilgel basin fig 9 shows the monthly time series of each component of twsc precipitation et and flow from the corresponding models at the different basin scales here the figure shows the precipitation datasets agree quite well with the observed precipitation for all three basins although the biases in et and flow eventually result in biased twsc htessel shows slight overestimation for et and discharge at gilgel fig 9 as a result twsc is underestimated negative anomalies in fig 8 for the larger basins kessie and eldiem slight overestimation in et and discharge fig 9 result in lower twsc than t w s c o b s in contrast jules by providing good et and good discharge for gilgel represent very consistent twsc anomalies with respect to t w s c o b s but due to overestimation for discharge at eldiem fig 9 jules shows slightly lower peaks of twsc anomalies than t w s c o b s although close to grace clms exhibits overestimation for et for gilgel which is neutralized by the underestimation for discharge fig 9 and results in good agreement in terms of twsc fig 8 on the other hand crest by simulating good et and discharge overall at all basin scales provides twsc anomalies consistent with t w s c o b s across the three basins examined in this study table 3 presents the error statistics for all the models with respect to t w s c o b s crest svas performs well at all three basin scales with low rmse and high correlation coefficients for the small gilgel basin jules shows relatively low rmse although high rmse for kessie and eldiem on the contrary clms vic and htessel represent low rmse for kessie and eldiem but are inconsistent for gilgel all other models show high rmse and low correlation at all basin scales 4 4 long term annual water budget analysis from crest svas in this section we present the long term trends of the validated basin averaged et twsc and flow from crest svas at gilgel abbay kessie and eldiem fig 10 shows the annual variability of water budget components and the total length of the bar represents annual total precipitation twsc can be positive or negative based on the available precipitation and the amount of et and runoff loss as fig 10 shows for all three basins the interannual variability of discharge is the highest among all components gilgel shows the highest twsc variability and lowest mean annual twsc in comparison to kessie and eldiem variability of basin averaged annual et is similar for all three basins although the spatial variability of et is high fig 5 moreover fig 10 indicates that the model captures the extreme climatic conditions drought or wet with the low level of each component at different basin scales during the dry years 1984 and 2009 and high values during the wet years 1998 and 2006 viste et al 2013 4 5 application of model derived flows a case study in koga reservoir in this section we present a local application of model derived flow for koga reservoir operation koga dam was built in 2010 at the tributary of the gilgel abbay river upstream of lake tana fig 11 with a storage capacity of 83 1 mm3 at full supply level 2015 25 m amsl ayele et al 2017 the reservoir serves a total command area of 70 km2 reynolds 2013 the reservoir supplies water for irrigated agriculture during the dry season november may and refills during the wet season june october the reservoir storage volume at the end of the wet season varies depending on the interannual variability of the water cycle components alexander et al 2019 in this study we compute the total inflow volume during the reservoir refilling period by simulating flow at the upstream of the dam which comprises a basin area of 210 km2 fig 11 right in this regard we extend the model from 2015 with gdas and imerg datasets we have compared reservoir inflow volume simulated by crest svas and existing global models with the available observation observed inflow during the refilling period is calculated by subtracting the observed reservoir volume in may from the volume at the beginning of november during the refilling period when the reservoir level reaches the full supply level 2012 25 m amsl the spillway is activated to discharge the extra water accordingly we subtract the observed discharge through the spillway from the models inflow volume to compare with the observed inflow when it reaches the full supply level during june october fig 11 left shows that for most years the crest svas simulated inflow agrees well with the observation it also captures the low reservoir inflow during the dry year 2015 when the reservoir was not full in the case of the existing global models jules and noah mp provide comparatively overestimated inflow for the available years whereas the watergap underestimates the inflow clsm derived inflows are closer to the observation although underestimated in 2014 the performance of htessel also shows inconsistency with the available records 5 discussions and model limitations in this study we have developed a model for simulating high spatiotemporal water budget components in the data scarce ubn basin and evaluated its performance with respect to observed and reference remote sensing products we have also performed a multi model comparison for the water cycle components to understand the significance of deploying a high resolution distributed hydrological model in the area in our analysis crest svas derived et agrees well with the reference gleam model at different basin scales moreover crest provides the et at 500 m resolution whereas the gleam et is available at 25 27 km resolution observed et which is an indicator of irrigation demand is however not available at field scale although high spatial resolution remote sensing et has been able to provide more details in recent years cloud conditions scanning error and low temporal resolution have made the et estimates less effective in operational applications krishna 2019 liou and kar 2014 in this regard crest svas simulated high spatiotemporal resolution et can be a valuable source of information for aiding local irrigation and water resources management the fully distributed routing with cascading calibration scheme in crest svas simulates consistent discharge at different outlets in the ubn basin the calibration parameters of daily discharge work satisfactorily with nse greater than 0 36 and pbias within 40 for the validation period as well as for the noncalibrated sites indicating these parameters can be used to predict flows for any ungauged site in the ubn basin moreover the comparison of crest svas simulated inflow with observation in koga reservoir during the wet season indicates that the model can predict the storage volume with acceptable accuracy whereas the existing coarse resolution global models exhibit biased results thus for a data scarce region like the ubn basin crest svas can provide realistic flow estimation at ungauged locations as a useful tool for water management at local scale we also expand the crest svas modeling capacity to account for discharge regulation in lakes to the simulated flow contributed by the downstream portion of the basin using the observed and the calibrated lake outflow as input to simulate downstream flow has resulted in a good discharge performance at the downstream kessie in the multi model comparison we see that almost all the other models overestimate the flow at kessie while the crest svas derived flow is the most consistent with the observed data we observe some overestimation for discharge at eldiem and speculate that unknown additional small scale irrigation of the basin could be a reason for the reduced observed flow the flow at eldiem improves considering no lake outflow which indicates a significant amount of the lake outflow may be lost due to surface irrigation before it reaches the distant outlet at eldiem although crest svas performs better relative to the existing global models the proposed modeling framework has some limitations as we do not consider the groundwater contribution in the model we cannot estimate the base flow a principal component of the river discharge during the dry season november april as a result we observe underestimated flows at the small scale catchments since base flow occurs during the dry period we believe the most reliable discharge from the crest svas can be obtained during the wet season may october moreover we cannot estimate the water extraction amount from the surface runoff due to agricultural and household activities without coupling an irrigation and a groundwater model since we do not have regulation records we cannot consider the flow of the controlled structures in the lake tana basin such as koga reservoir upstream or tana beles hydropower downstream which has affected the lake downstream flow since the inauguration in 2010 dessie et al 2015 we also do not consider the land cover changes over time which can be integrated in the modeling framework as our future development 6 conclusion and future works in this study we simulate water cycle components at high spatiotemporal resolution by maintaining water and energy balance in crest svas our results indicate that the crest svas simulated hyper resolution et is consistent with the reference et from gleam moreover simulated lake outflow and cascade calibration provide overall satisfactory discharges additionally the calibrated parameters can be used to predict discharge for ungauged sites crest svas simulated inflows to koga reservoir supporting a 70 km2 irrigation scheme satisfactorily represent the actual observed reservoir inflows during the wet season in the performance comparison against global models crest svas performs more consistently in terms of both et and discharge simulation accuracy consequently by simulating accurate hydrological components crest svas is able to predict the terrestrial water storage change that agrees with reference data and grace the water budget analysis of crest svas derived hydrological components can therefore be useful for analyzing past trends and regional climate projections despite the limitations discussed in section 5 the accurate and high resolution hydrological components from crest svas will improve the representation of spatial variability and provide effective predictions for watershed management specifically for the local small scale basins and irrigation schemes of ubn the land surface variables such as infiltration et and soil moisture can be used as input to a combination of sectoral models for example groundwater level estimation khadim et al 2020 and crop yield predictions yang et al 2020 along with seasonal forecasts crest svas can predict the season end reservoir storage volume ahead of the end of the wet season which can be useful for planning reservoir operations for irrigation during the dry season moreover the use of this calibrated distributed hydrological modeling framework can be expanded for future research that includes i evaluation of ubn water cycle changes by integrating regional climate projections ii food security by predicting crop yields from predictions of soil moisture and iii developments for water food energy nexus e g renewables driven irrigated agriculture credit authorship contribution statement rehenuma lazin writing original draft

5173,freshwater scarcity is a major global concern that is being exacerbated by the increasing population and changing climate while close estimates of water cycle components and water budget analysis can help with planning for sustainable water resources management limited hydroclimatic data have made such analysis challenging the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia is such a hydroclimatic data scarce region with relatively arid and hot weather multiple studies have focused on water budget analysis in the ubn basin but water cycle analyses are missing at high spatiotemporal resolution yield from a fully distributed hydrological model that closes water and energy budgets in this paper we describe the simulation of evapotranspiration et and discharge at fine spatiotemporal resolution 500 m and 3 hourly from 1979 to 2014 using the coupled routing and excess storage soil vegetation atmosphere snow crest svas distributed hydrological model which physically maintains water and energy balance we also present a comparison of et and discharge as derived from crest with those simulated by other existing global models our results show that where the global models perform well for specific hydrological components et and discharge crest can simulate et at 500 m resolution with 0 93 correlation coefficient 0 81 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and 4 75 bias for daily scale and discharge at different basin scales with nse values ranging from 0 46 to 0 75 we performed cascade calibration for discharge and tested the optimized parameters on noncalibrated sites the good model performance at the noncalibrated sites nse 0 6 bias within 15 indicated the calibrated parameters can be used for ungauged locations finally the terrestrial water storage change twsc from crest was also consistent with reference data and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the hyper resolution accurate hydrological components from crest will enable effective prediction of water budget helpful for initiating local and large scale sustainable development plans that address social and policy requirements as well as extreme climatic conditions keywords hydrological model crest svas upper blue nile ethiopia water budget evapotranspiration 1 introduction a major global concern affecting sustainable development from social economic and environmental perspectives is a scarcity of freshwater that constitutes a world water crisis by quantifying the movement of water and changes in its storage in the environment water budget analysis can aid decision making for water resources management such analysis is hampered however by insufficiency of hydroclimatic data resulting from the inadequacy of the meteorological stations currently in use in the upper blue nile ubn basin in ethiopia temperatures and levels of solar radiation are high and conditions relatively arid the basin contributes approximately 50 km3 of water per year to the nile river and serves as a lifeline for some 250 millionpeople dile et al 2018 the highlands of ethiopia especially the steep canyons of the blue nile offer some of the best hydropower development sites in the world which could be exploited by increasing upstream withdrawals and constructing water storage infrastructure blackmore and whittington 2008 moreover hydropower dams in ubn can improve water conservation and flow regulation appelgren et al 2000 through management that involves storing water during the rainy season and releasing it for irrigation during the dry season agricultural production can be expanded for a second growing cycle where rainfed farming now predominates the urgency of such infrastructure development is growing according to coffel et al 2019 increasingly hot and dry conditions in ubn will exacerbate water scarcity even a projected rise in precipitation will not significantly improve the water supply because of the increasing water stress on the per capita runoff supply exerted by the rapidly growing population coffel et al 2019 food security will also be threatened since crop yields from rainfed agriculture are more vulnerable to a hot and dry climate valverde et al 2015 overcoming these harmful effects of future climate extremes calls for the provision of additional water sources through the construction of water storage dams groundwater withdrawals and the inter basin groundwater transfer by channeling recharged water from the middle blue nile to upper awash basins azagegn et al 2015 these initiatives must be undertaken however while maintaining hydrological and ecological balance as well as ensuring the sustainability of the groundwater footprint under such development gleeson et al 2012 a water budget analysis in ubn will help with planning the establishment and management of these water resources an undertaking that in addition to its technical challenges requires agreement among the transboundary nations to address controversies disputes and contrasting interests with regard to water egypt for example depends on the nile for 97 of its water supply and currently accounts for water withdrawals from the river of 55 5 km3 annually out of its total annual flow of 84 km3 johnston 2013 while ethiopia contributes 85 of the nile flow measured at aswan it has little storage and withdraws only about 3 km3 of water annually or 3 4 of the total from the river jeuland et al 2017 as part of its development goals the ethiopian government in 2011 began construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd at the outlet of the ubn basin at the border of sudan and ethiopia which will be one of the largest dams in africa while ethiopia expects to meet its increasing demand for domestic electricity through gerd allam and eltahir 2019 egypt fears the project will result in reduced water flows into the high aswan dam and a loss of hydropower accurate knowledge and quantification of hydrological processes in this region can help resolve the transboundary negotiations that will be essential to further development determine policies for cooperative river management strategies and ensure the development is sustainable hall et al 2014 by predicting hydrological processes at the fine spatiotemporal resolution hydrological models can aid water resources management including planning for efficient water use under extreme climatic conditions a lack of in situ hydrometeorological data and an effective modeling framework however has limited the ability of previous studies in ubn to quantify hydrological components and support management strategies most studies in ubn have applied simple water balance models at a large scale to analyze flow at the outlet of the ethiopian sudanese border where sub catchment analysis for spatial variation is missing johnson and curtis 1994 mishra and hata 2006 steenhuis et al 2009 some studies have been conducted in the data rich lake tana sub basin kebede et al 2006 rientjes et al 2011 setegn et al 2008 wale et al 2009 while others have focused on the more local sub basin to assess the catchment dynamics uhlenbrook et al 2010 the effects of climate change abdo et al 2009 and land use patterns tekleab et al 2014 prior studies in ubn have also focused on specific water cycle components such as precipitation variability block and rajagopalan 2007 rientjes et al 2012 abtew et al 2009 evapotranspiration allam et al 2016 nooni et al 2019 and sensitivity of runoff conway 1997 lemann et al 2018 and some analysis of the water cycle has been conducted at coarse temporal monthly resolution kim and kaluarachchi 2008 tekleab et al 2011 tegegne and kim 2018 have simulated streamflow at ungauged sites using a modeling framework validated at a similar gauged basin however analysis of a single water cycle component cannot assure consistently well model performance in terms of closing the water budget other studies have focused on assessing the effectiveness of lumped conceptual semi distributed and distributed physical models for at catchment scale even at coarser resolution or with relatively simple physics distributed models demonstrate advantages over lumped models tegegne et al 2017 conclude that conceptual models performed well in smaller watersheds gummera ribb whereas a physical model could perform better in a larger basin gilgel abbay abera et al 2017 have conducted a semi distributed water budget analysis in ubn by subdividing the basin into 402 hydrological response units hrus with a mean area of 430 339 km2 by comparing distributed 2 5 or 278 km and daily and lumped conceptual models in the ubn basin elsanabary and gan 2015 conclude that with accurate and detailed forcing a physically based water energy balance model could be appropriate for the hydrologically diverse ubn region lakew et al 2020 have evaluated satellite precipitation in the ubn basin through a distributed model crest v2 1 shen et al 2014 an earlier version of the model used in this study at 1 km and 3 hourly resolution without closing the energy balance or parameterizing the complex heterogeneity of the land surface and the soil property eldardiry and hossain 2019 have developed a macroscale distributed 10 km and daily hydrological model using satellite hydrometeorological observations to analyze reservoir operation in the nile river for a data scarce region like the ubn basin water resources management at the local scale requires however fine spatiotemporal characterization of the physically coupled water and energy components et and discharge rather than coarse resolution models with simple physics in recent years remote sensing products have provided opportunities to overcome the data scarcity problem and become a basis for quantifying water budget closures sheffield et al 2009 distributed satellite land surface products have enabled the design of more reliable realistic complex hydrological modeling frameworks although the advancement of remote sensing products has paved the way for the development of various global land surface and hydrological models however errors in different satellite products propagate to the model simulated water cycle component consequently the performance consistency of all vital water cycle components is disrupted bhuiyan et al 2019 abera et al 2017 have developed a methodology to compute water cycle components from satellite products although the systematic bias in terms of et restricted the water budget closure in short as hornberger and boyer 1995 mentioned the combined use of representative data and modeling framework can be a key to improve the estimation of water cycle components in this study we aim to resolve the issues of quantifying consistently well performing vital water cycle components et and discharge for the ubn basin at fine spatiotemporal resolution by using a physically distributed hydrological model crest soil vegetation atmosphere snow crest svas developed by shen and anagnostou 2017 crest svas is designed to represent water cycle components accurately by physically coupling the energy and water balances at hyper spatiotemporal resolution moreover to simulate consistently good river runoff at multiple basin scales we have performed cascade calibration with a fully distributed routing scheme which can further help with computing discharge at ungauged sites in addition to carrying out the direct validation of the simulated water cycle components we have evaluated the model s performance comparing it against other global hydrological models the performance analysis and evaluation results discussed in this paper show the model can be used for water budget closure and to provide reliable information for planning water resources management at the local scale 2 study area ubn shown in fig 1 is the largest river basin in ethiopia in terms of volume of discharge and the second largest in terms of area extending from the lake tana highlands to the sudanese border at eldiem conway 2000 it is the largest tributary of the nile river and has a drainage area of around 176 000 km2 contributing 60 of the discharge to the main nile basin it is referred to as the water tower of northeastern africa conway and hulme 1993 the ethiopian highlands in ubn are inhabited by almost 20 million people central statistical agency 2013 where the economy mainly depends on agriculture abera et al 2017 thus water demands on ubn are high for irrigation and domestic uses moreover as the principal contributor of the nile basin it is the economic mainstay for the downstream countries egypt and sudan the spatial pattern of climate and topography in ubn is heterogeneous and complex fig 1 shows relatively high terrain elevations from 1500 m to 4000 m in the eastern part of the basin and low elevation from 500 m to 1500 m in the western part its climatology varies from arid to semiarid with mean annual precipitation from 925 mm to 1845 mm conway 1997 2000 the mean annual temperature is about 18 5 c kim et al 2008 and the annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 1100 mm kim and hogue 2008 3 methodology in this section we provide a brief overview of the runoff generation components in crest svas that couple water and energy balances the fully distributed routing scheme the calibration method the input and observation datasets and the error metrics as well as the global models we have used for comparison 3 1 crest overview we have simulated the water cycle components using coupled routing and excess storage crest which is a fully distributed hydrological model the computationally efficient new version of crest can simulate the soil vegetation atmosphere snow svas process and strictly maintain the water and energy balance it can simulate for a large basin nearly 106 km2 at high spatiotemporal resolution 30 m to 1 km spatially and hourly time steps over a long period a few decades shen and anagnostou 2017 for any given layer crest svas can simultaneously solve the water balance for water availability and the thermal balance for temperature change as the amount of temperature change indicates the energy used for the phase change of water its runoff generation module can physically solve a coupled water and energy balance 3 1 1 runoff generation the water cycle processes in the rainfall runoff generation module include interception of the rainfall evapotranspiration and infiltration of the through rainfall and finally the generation of surface and subsurface direct runoff at each grid during the process of achieving a thermal balance within the vegetation and three soil layers and their boundaries the available water content in each layer greatly affects the thermal properties and the transferrable water amount dictates the consumable latent heat on the other hand the available energy components regulate the water phase change loss and gain within each soil layer in this study we have tested crest svas for the no snow condition so the different components of terrestrial evaporation included transpiration from the canopy layer and small vegetation and bare soil evaporation through the coupled water and energy balance in the corresponding layers fig 2 depicts the water and energy balance mechanism in the model for the detailed process in each phase the reader is referred to shen and anagnostou 2017 3 1 2 discharge the surface and subsurface direct runoff are input to a fully distributed linear reservoir routing fdlrr module built into crest svas to compute channel discharge shen et al 2014 2017 the fdlrr can only represent the natural routing process in ubn however we regulate the lake release that greatly affects the outflow downstream to lake tana to compute the flow at any channel point downstream to the lake we have removed the contribution from the drainage area upstream of the lake outlet and added the downstream contribution of the basin and the lake outflow with a time delay and a loss factor as formulated by eq 1 1 q dl t q d l o t q l t t d 1 l where for a given time step t q d l t stands for the discharge at the observatory point q d l o t is the discharge contributed by the drainage area downstream to the lake l is the loss factor of the lake outflow due to evaporation and q l t t d is the discharge at the lake outlet at time t t d where t d is the time delay the time delay is computed as the traveling distance from the lake outlet to the observatory point over the water flow velocity in the channel coer shen et al 2014 2017 similar to kohli and frenken 2015 we apply a 10 evaporative loss factor l during the flow in the channel represented by the delayed time we used observed lake outflow available from 1979 to 2002 as q l and beyond that period we used the model simulated lake outflow for the routing of the downstream outlets the computed stream path distances from the lake outlets to kessie and eldiem are 319 and 927 km respectively at eldiem the contribution of lake outflow can be less significant compared to kessie due to the significantly further distance from the lake 927 vs 319 km and the larger drainage area to verify this we also simulate total flow at downstream outlets by assuming that the lake contributes as a natural reservoir with no regulation 3 1 3 calibration scheme for the optimized routing parameters we have used multisite cascading calibration built into crest svas most hydrological models are calibrated against flow observations at a single station then the calibrated parameters are applied to the entire upstream sub basins the single site calibration strategy may result in degraded performance at locations far away from the reference station due to the spatial heterogeneity of geomorphologic characteristics of a large basin choi et al 2015 ricard et al 2013 a multi site cascade calibration on the other hand can improve the overall performance xue et al 2016 since the topography of ubn is complex with high spatial variation in elevation and precipitation we believe a single site calibration at the outlet eldiem may not provide satisfactory discharge elsewhere in the basin we therefore perform multisite calibration against four cascaded sites gilgel lake tana kessie and eldiem we first calibrate at gilgel and lake tana we have simulated the lake outflow by significantly reducing the amount of surface and sub surface runoffs fexcs and fexci in table 1 and calibrating with the observed lake outflow using the lake outflow as inflow we then calibrate the downstream sub watersheds against the kessie and eldiem stations consecutively the calibration parameters are described in table 1 value 1 of fexcs and fexci indicate all excess runoffs will join channel flow we use the slope and the parameters coem and expm to compute the overland flow velocity coer and coes are respectively the factor to scale overland flow velocity to channel velocity and the factor to scale surface flow velocity to subsurface velocity ks and ki are surface and subsurface linear reservoir coefficients to determine the water release of given water storage 3 2 terrestrial water storage change twsc terrestrial water storage tws refers to water that remains above or below the land surface it incorporates the water in snow or ice soil moisture surface water and groundwater and the water contained in the biomass rodell and famiglietti 1999 in the terrestrial hydrological cycle precipitation p over a basin is balanced by evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage change twsc güntner et al 2007 güntner 2008a meng et al 2019 twsc is therefore determined for a basin by subtracting the total et and total runoff from the total precipitation twsc p et r for a specified period in this case annually in this study we first compute the et and discharge in crest svas and determine the twsc at different basin scales 3 3 data in this section we describe the reference observed data and the data we used as inputs in the model 3 3 1 reference water cycle components the reference precipitation is generated by spatially interpolating 153 in situ rain gauge observations provided by the ethiopian national meteorological agency sahlu et al 2017 into regular grids of 0 25 resolution using the ordinary kriging ok algorithm we use the mswep precipitation to drive the crest svas simulations because after evaluating the different satellite precipitation products with respect to this reference gridded precipitation sahlu et al 2017 conclude that mswep outperforms both unadjusted and gauge adjusted era interim estimates and captures as well the equivalent spatial patterns with the gauge adjusted values during the wet season lakew et al 2020 also conclude that mswep performs better than other precipitation products fig 3 presents the spatial variation of the mean annual precipitation 1984 2014 from mswep and the reference observed precipitation the nse correlation coefficient and pbias of the monthly basin averaged mswep and observed precipitation are 0 93 0 94 and 10 13 respectively to validate the crest svas simulated actual evapotranspiration aet we use the aet from gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 1a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011b gleam v 3a computes aet using satellite retrieved soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent reanalysis air temperature and radiation and a multisource a combination of gauge based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation product spanning the 36 years from 1980 to 2015 martens et al 2017 gleam evapotranspiration is available at 0 25 spatial resolution 27 km and daily temporal resolution different studies have used gleam as reference et mccabe et al 2016 miralles et al 2011a the most recent version is validated globally over 64 fluxnet sites martens et al 2017 with satisfactory results gleam is used by abera et al 2017 as reference et in the ubn basin moreover nooni et al 2019 have validated gleam et with respect to fluxnet data in the nile basin and conclude its accuracy is reasonable which gives us the confidence to use gleam as a reference in ethiopia to evaluate the simulated discharge we use the daily in situ streamflow observations provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy and the abbay basin authority as reference the observed discharge data sites and temporal extent are shown in fig 6 the change in terrestrial water storage the twsc cannot be directly observed it can be estimated globally however using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data rodell et al 2007 güntner 2008a landerer and swenson 2012 at large scale and it has been used as reference in different parts of the world for water budget analysis meng et al 2019 schmidt et al 2006 shamsudduha et al 2017 solander et al 2017 yoon et al 2019 we have used the monthly grace data from 2002 to 2012 available from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl ftp podaac ftp jpl nasa gov alldata tellus l3 landmass rl05 to represent the anomalies of twsc according to landerer and swenson 2012 leakage error correction and scaling factors have been applied before comparing these data with the simulated twsc the minimum scale detectable by grace however ranges from 200 000 km2 at low latitudes to 90 000 km2 near the poles rodell et al 2018 similar to koukoula et al 2020 we have considered that the grace data can represent the eldiem basin and kessie basin with larger uncertainty of the latter whereas it cannot represent basins as small as gilgel since the good estimation of twsc can affect the accurate modeling of the other fluxes discharge q and et döll et al 2014 we can infer that accurate estimation of q and et might also be indicative of accurate twsc in this study we used the in situ precipitation p and flow q data with reference et gleam to compute the reference twsc for a basin where 2 t w s c o b s p o b s e t g l e a m q o b s since grace data does not work at all basin scales we consider t w s c o b s as reference we have also compared the model derived tws with grace at kessie and eldiem to compare the tws we calculate the anomalies of tws by averaging the monthly tws for all grids from 2002 to 2012 and subtract that mean value for each time step 3 3 2 input data and model parameters table 2 lists all input parameters used in the model in this study we run the land surface simulation from 1979 to 2014 at 500 m spatial and 3 hourly temporal resolution driven by meteorological variables in the reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 blended precipitation product along with precipitation the meteorological forcing variables used in this model include air temperature downward shortwave and longwave radiation air pressure specific humidity and wind speed prior studies lakew et al 2020 elsanabary and gan 2015 siam et al 2013 zeleke et al 2016 have used era reanalysis forcing variables to drive the hydrological model in the ubn basin we have extended the model from 2015 with global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2015 precipitation datasets for consistency with the historical simulation 1979 2014 we have temporally aggregated the meteorological variables from gdas and imerg precipitation to 3 hourly from the original resolution hourly and half hourly respectively while keeping the original spatial resolution 0 200 and 0 10 respectively sahlu et al 2016 have evaluated the imerg dataset in the ubn region and concluded it has a good correlation with gauge precipitation and acceptable bias we have obtained the dynamic remote sensing product leaf area index lai from glass lai at 8 day intervals and we have used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 to represent the land cover we compute soil hydraulic properties using the model developed by saxton and rawls 2006 which converts the 0 2 m six layered soil characteristics from

et and discharge and the comparison of the error metrics of these hydrological components to those of existing global models 4 1 validation of evapotranspiration we have compared the aet from crest svas and gleam at eldiem basin to compare the temporal variation of et in the two models we have evaluated the basin averaged et at daily and monthly scales fig 4 for daily basin averaged et from 1984 to 2013 the correlation coefficient r is 0 93 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 81 and pbias is 4 75 for monthly et the correlation coefficient nse and pbias increased to 0 96 0 88 and 4 61 respectively to show the spatial distribution of et in both models we have evaluated the mean annual et from 1984 to 2014 shown in the map in fig 5 as the figure indicates the spatial variation in crest svas derived et agrees quite well with the gleam et moreover crest provides hyper resolution et at 500 m resolution whereas gleam et is at 0 25 27 km overall we have found that crest svas captures the spatial variability of aet at hyper resolution 500 m and the aggregated magnitude is comparable to that of the reference aet product from gleam 4 2 discharge calibration optimized routing parameters are obtained using a cascade calibration procedure built into crest svas the semi distributed multisite cascading calibration parameters are listed in table 1 and the calibrated hydrographs with error statistics are shown in fig 6 taking into consideration the computational expenses and time required to calibrate the routing parameters we use five years for calibration from the most upstream site gilgel abbay to the downstream lake tana kessie and eldiem sites fig 6 and validated the calibration parameters for the remaining periods the simulated discharge at the corresponding outlets agrees well with observations with high values of nse and correlation coefficient and low values of pbias the discharge at all the outlets is highly correlated with the observed flow above 0 80 at the gilgel abbay nse is high 0 77 and the 10 pbias indicates slight underestimation at the smaller scale basins the error metrics worsen slightly but remain within acceptable performance values for lake tana nse 0 57 and pbias 12 for kessie nse 0 46 and pbias 2 5 the low values of fexcs 0 32 and fexci 0 43 at lake tana indicate most of the runoffs are confined to the lake at eldiem for the validation period the pbias 35 indicates model overestimation at eldiem there can be unknown substantial traditional surface irrigation hagosa et al 2011 which may cause additional loss from the surface runoff moreover in small scale traditional irrigation water diversion structures are made of temporary local materials and water is diverted from the river by gravity through furrow irrigation haile 2015 because the traditional irrigation scheme is inefficient a significant amount of water diverted from the river is lost before it reaches the field teshome et al 2018 we can attribute the higher loss of the river water and reduced observed flow to this traditional surface irrigation at eldiem to check the sensitivity of the lake outflow to the downstream outlets we run the routing by considering the lake as a natural reservoir without adding the lake outflow at kessie and eldiem at kessie the model performance deteriorates with nse 0 37 pbias 11 4 and correlation coefficient 0 63 on the other hand in the case of eldiem the flow improves nse 0 56 pbias 30 and correlation coefficient 0 90 as a result of compensation for errors we have also tested the calibrated parameters in the corresponding noncalibrated sites the performance in all the noncalibrated sites gumara neshi didessa and gilgel beles at different basin scales shows satisfactory values of nse pbias and correlation coefficients fig 6 4 3 multi model comparison in this section we report the performance comparison of crest svas simulated et discharge and twsc to those of the global models at three basin scales at gilgel abbay 1664 km2 kessie 65 784 km2 and eldiem 177 643 km2 4 3 1 comparison in terms of et and discharge since more than 60 70 of the annual precipitation in the upper blue nile basin occurs during the wet season june september abera et al 2017 we compare et and streamflow during this period for all the models we compute the relative error of the basin averaged et from 1984 to 2014 at a monthly scale with respect to gleam for the relative error of discharge at the corresponding outlets we use gauge observed flow as fig 7 indicates crest svas outperforms the global models at all basin scales in terms of both et and discharge error metrics watergap performs better in terms of discharge at eldiem although for et it exhibited significantly higher relative error at all basin scales so does noah mp jules performs well in terms of et but for discharge at large basins it provides overestimated flow htessel gives a comparatively lower relative error in terms of both et and discharge but shows a larger relative bias of et than crest clsm performs well for discharge at larger basins but exhibits a higher relative error of et 4 3 2 comparison of terrestrial water storage change since grace provides the anomalies of twsc for comparison we compute the anomalies for all the models anomalies of twsc p et q are calculated as the monthly deviation from the mean twsc during the period shown in fig 8 from the multi model comparison of et and streamflow fig 7 we have found crest svas htessel ca ma jules and clsm are comparable as the performance of these models is relatively good for both et and discharge so we present monthly time series of the twsc anomalies from these four models for comparison to grace and t w s c o b s defined in section 3 3 2 in fig 8 because of the low spatial resolution we do not use grace data for the small gilgel basin fig 8 indicates that with respect to t w s c o b s all models capture the change in tws although each exhibits some bias grace and t w s c o b s show very similar results which gives us the confidence to use t w s c o b s as reference in the case of small basins like gilgel basin fig 9 shows the monthly time series of each component of twsc precipitation et and flow from the corresponding models at the different basin scales here the figure shows the precipitation datasets agree quite well with the observed precipitation for all three basins although the biases in et and flow eventually result in biased twsc htessel shows slight overestimation for et and discharge at gilgel fig 9 as a result twsc is underestimated negative anomalies in fig 8 for the larger basins kessie and eldiem slight overestimation in et and discharge fig 9 result in lower twsc than t w s c o b s in contrast jules by providing good et and good discharge for gilgel represent very consistent twsc anomalies with respect to t w s c o b s but due to overestimation for discharge at eldiem fig 9 jules shows slightly lower peaks of twsc anomalies than t w s c o b s although close to grace clms exhibits overestimation for et for gilgel which is neutralized by the underestimation for discharge fig 9 and results in good agreement in terms of twsc fig 8 on the other hand crest by simulating good et and discharge overall at all basin scales provides twsc anomalies consistent with t w s c o b s across the three basins examined in this study table 3 presents the error statistics for all the models with respect to t w s c o b s crest svas performs well at all three basin scales with low rmse and high correlation coefficients for the small gilgel basin jules shows relatively low rmse although high rmse for kessie and eldiem on the contrary clms vic and htessel represent low rmse for kessie and eldiem but are inconsistent for gilgel all other models show high rmse and low correlation at all basin scales 4 4 long term annual water budget analysis from crest svas in this section we present the long term trends of the validated basin averaged et twsc and flow from crest svas at gilgel abbay kessie and eldiem fig 10 shows the annual variability of water budget components and the total length of the bar represents annual total precipitation twsc can be positive or negative based on the available precipitation and the amount of et and runoff loss as fig 10 shows for all three basins the interannual variability of discharge is the highest among all components gilgel shows the highest twsc variability and lowest mean annual twsc in comparison to kessie and eldiem variability of basin averaged annual et is similar for all three basins although the spatial variability of et is high fig 5 moreover fig 10 indicates that the model captures the extreme climatic conditions drought or wet with the low level of each component at different basin scales during the dry years 1984 and 2009 and high values during the wet years 1998 and 2006 viste et al 2013 4 5 application of model derived flows a case study in koga reservoir in this section we present a local application of model derived flow for koga reservoir operation koga dam was built in 2010 at the tributary of the gilgel abbay river upstream of lake tana fig 11 with a storage capacity of 83 1 mm3 at full supply level 2015 25 m amsl ayele et al 2017 the reservoir serves a total command area of 70 km2 reynolds 2013 the reservoir supplies water for irrigated agriculture during the dry season november may and refills during the wet season june october the reservoir storage volume at the end of the wet season varies depending on the interannual variability of the water cycle components alexander et al 2019 in this study we compute the total inflow volume during the reservoir refilling period by simulating flow at the upstream of the dam which comprises a basin area of 210 km2 fig 11 right in this regard we extend the model from 2015 with gdas and imerg datasets we have compared reservoir inflow volume simulated by crest svas and existing global models with the available observation observed inflow during the refilling period is calculated by subtracting the observed reservoir volume in may from the volume at the beginning of november during the refilling period when the reservoir level reaches the full supply level 2012 25 m amsl the spillway is activated to discharge the extra water accordingly we subtract the observed discharge through the spillway from the models inflow volume to compare with the observed inflow when it reaches the full supply level during june october fig 11 left shows that for most years the crest svas simulated inflow agrees well with the observation it also captures the low reservoir inflow during the dry year 2015 when the reservoir was not full in the case of the existing global models jules and noah mp provide comparatively overestimated inflow for the available years whereas the watergap underestimates the inflow clsm derived inflows are closer to the observation although underestimated in 2014 the performance of htessel also shows inconsistency with the available records 5 discussions and model limitations in this study we have developed a model for simulating high spatiotemporal water budget components in the data scarce ubn basin and evaluated its performance with respect to observed and reference remote sensing products we have also performed a multi model comparison for the water cycle components to understand the significance of deploying a high resolution distributed hydrological model in the area in our analysis crest svas derived et agrees well with the reference gleam model at different basin scales moreover crest provides the et at 500 m resolution whereas the gleam et is available at 25 27 km resolution observed et which is an indicator of irrigation demand is however not available at field scale although high spatial resolution remote sensing et has been able to provide more details in recent years cloud conditions scanning error and low temporal resolution have made the et estimates less effective in operational applications krishna 2019 liou and kar 2014 in this regard crest svas simulated high spatiotemporal resolution et can be a valuable source of information for aiding local irrigation and water resources management the fully distributed routing with cascading calibration scheme in crest svas simulates consistent discharge at different outlets in the ubn basin the calibration parameters of daily discharge work satisfactorily with nse greater than 0 36 and pbias within 40 for the validation period as well as for the noncalibrated sites indicating these parameters can be used to predict flows for any ungauged site in the ubn basin moreover the comparison of crest svas simulated inflow with observation in koga reservoir during the wet season indicates that the model can predict the storage volume with acceptable accuracy whereas the existing coarse resolution global models exhibit biased results thus for a data scarce region like the ubn basin crest svas can provide realistic flow estimation at ungauged locations as a useful tool for water management at local scale we also expand the crest svas modeling capacity to account for discharge regulation in lakes to the simulated flow contributed by the downstream portion of the basin using the observed and the calibrated lake outflow as input to simulate downstream flow has resulted in a good discharge performance at the downstream kessie in the multi model comparison we see that almost all the other models overestimate the flow at kessie while the crest svas derived flow is the most consistent with the observed data we observe some overestimation for discharge at eldiem and speculate that unknown additional small scale irrigation of the basin could be a reason for the reduced observed flow the flow at eldiem improves considering no lake outflow which indicates a significant amount of the lake outflow may be lost due to surface irrigation before it reaches the distant outlet at eldiem although crest svas performs better relative to the existing global models the proposed modeling framework has some limitations as we do not consider the groundwater contribution in the model we cannot estimate the base flow a principal component of the river discharge during the dry season november april as a result we observe underestimated flows at the small scale catchments since base flow occurs during the dry period we believe the most reliable discharge from the crest svas can be obtained during the wet season may october moreover we cannot estimate the water extraction amount from the surface runoff due to agricultural and household activities without coupling an irrigation and a groundwater model since we do not have regulation records we cannot consider the flow of the controlled structures in the lake tana basin such as koga reservoir upstream or tana beles hydropower downstream which has affected the lake downstream flow since the inauguration in 2010 dessie et al 2015 we also do not consider the land cover changes over time which can be integrated in the modeling framework as our future development 6 conclusion and future works in this study we simulate water cycle components at high spatiotemporal resolution by maintaining water and energy balance in crest svas our results indicate that the crest svas simulated hyper resolution et is consistent with the reference et from gleam moreover simulated lake outflow and cascade calibration provide overall satisfactory discharges additionally the calibrated parameters can be used to predict discharge for ungauged sites crest svas simulated inflows to koga reservoir supporting a 70 km2 irrigation scheme satisfactorily represent the actual observed reservoir inflows during the wet season in the performance comparison against global models crest svas performs more consistently in terms of both et and discharge simulation accuracy consequently by simulating accurate hydrological components crest svas is able to predict the terrestrial water storage change that agrees with reference data and grace the water budget analysis of crest svas derived hydrological components can therefore be useful for analyzing past trends and regional climate projections despite the limitations discussed in section 5 the accurate and high resolution hydrological components from crest svas will improve the representation of spatial variability and provide effective predictions for watershed management specifically for the local small scale basins and irrigation schemes of ubn the land surface variables such as infiltration et and soil moisture can be used as input to a combination of sectoral models for example groundwater level estimation khadim et al 2020 and crop yield predictions yang et al 2020 along with seasonal forecasts crest svas can predict the season end reservoir storage volume ahead of the end of the wet season which can be useful for planning reservoir operations for irrigation during the dry season moreover the use of this calibrated distributed hydrological modeling framework can be expanded for future research that includes i evaluation of ubn water cycle changes by integrating regional climate projections ii food security by predicting crop yields from predictions of soil moisture and iii developments for water food energy nexus e g renewables driven irrigated agriculture credit authorship contribution statement rehenuma lazin writing original draft

5174,recently data driven machine learning techniques has been widely applied for modeling reference evapotranspiration eto values under various climatic conditions taking into account the different number of sites and available data length a major issue with applying those models is the proper selection of training testing data sets although some spatial generalization approaches have been recommended for this purpose there are no specified recommended local temporal data partitioning strategies for machine learning based eto estimation the present study evaluates different hold out and k fold validation temporal data partitioning strategies when using gene expression programming gep technique to estimate daily eto in arid regions the k fold validation strategies considered annual monthly and growing season period patterns as test data sets although commonly used partitioning of the available patterns into training and testing sets gave accurate results statistical analysis showed that the results obtained through k fold validation assessment were more reliable a two block partitioning strategy with chronologic data selection for training and testing provided the most accurate results among the hold out procedures mean scatter index si value of 0 162 fixing the extreme eto values as training data set in hold out procedures provided the less accurate results with considerable over underestimation of the eto values mean si value was 0 506 results on the basis of hold out approaches can be biased or only partially valid depending on selection of the test data from the time series k fold validation yielded the lowest over underestimations of eto values further considering monthly patterns as minimum affordable test size produced higher error magnitudes among k fold validation strategies while considering the complete patterns of one growing season provided more accurate results among k fold validation strategies keywords evapotranspiration gene expression programming hold out k fold validation 1 introduction accurate simulation of reference evapotranspiration eto is very important in many disciplines including hydrology and water resources management agricultural activities irrigation scheduling environmental assessment and land drainage and reclamation issues although lysimeters can provide in situ measurements of this parameter their construction necessities should be precisely followed to get reliable eto values which is very difficult in many situations on the other hand physically based or empirical eto models relying on meteorological input variables are good alternatives to experimental measurements among the large diversity of the existing empirical physical models the penman monteith model adopted by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao pmf is commonly used as the standard model for calculating eto values in a wide range of climatologic contexts allen et al 1998 however a major downside of this model is the necessity to use lots of meteorological data that are not easily measured in most regions meanwhile empirical models that consider fewer meteorological inputs can be applied for calculating eto but they tend to be site specific and have not been verified universally under all different climatic conditions trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 even if they have been evaluated under different climatic conditions at regional scales e g tabari 2010 on the other hand the application of machine learning approaches has been widely reported in the literature as a valid and even preferable substitute to the empirical models adnan et al 2019 there are many such applications that have demonstrated promising outcomes of machine learning models for eto simulation under various climatic contexts and data availability conditions e g kisi 2016 kiafar et al 2017 granata 2019 wu et al 2019 a crucial task in machine learning based eto simulation beside defining their proper input variables is to carry out a suitable partition of the data set into training testing and validation sets for making a thorough assessment of these models although analysis of residuals errors in the training period can give some relative information to judge among different models it is not necessarily representative of performance with the unseen data data not used by the models in training phase so it is a commonly accepted approach in literature that a type of cross validation approach should be adopted in developing the machine learning methods in simulation prediction issues to divide the available patterns into training for model selection and validation testing for model assessment periods however there is no fixed rule for defining such partitions as it generally depends on the signal to noise ratio in the patterns as well as the training sample size hastie et al 2017 typically cross validation might be categorized into exhaustive and non exhaustive groups among the first group the leave p out and leave one out methods can be considered these approaches usually evaluate all possible ways for partitioning the available data into training and testing portions given the high computational cost involved in the exhaustive cross validation methods their practical applications are limited but instead theoretical background of these methods has informed development of simpler cross validation methods e g non exhaustive validation methods as hold out k fold validation and repeated random sub sampling validation in the eto simulation context most studies have dealt with this issue using a single partitioning of the data or hold out where a part of available patterns usually around 70 75 are used for training the applied models while the models are tested using the remaining patterns the error values of the models are computed evaluated on the basis of the testing results this approach is exclusively suitable for data rich situations other studies include an additional validation set used before testing to avoid overtraining pour alibaba et al 2012 with these hold out methods the testing validation data are usually selected from the end of the time series although these are straightforward methods of data partitioning for data driven models applications a major drawback rises from the absence of a complete testing scan of the dataset that eliminates the temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies among the used data bergmeir and benitez 2012 therefore the obtained results may be biased or only partially valid with relatively higher variances as the model does not experience all possible events encountered in the applied patterns shiri et al 2019a this reduces the model generalization ability for future unseen data nonetheless when the utilized time series is non stationary a major difficulty would be the choice of testing patterns because this will obviously affect the models assessment from both the bias and variance viewpoints further information on over underestimation trends of the models is incomplete since the test patterns belongs to a specified time period rather than examining all the events potentially with atypical extreme values this can cause issues with eto estimation and irrigation scheduling during a growing season which depends on accurate estimation of crop water requirements digging deeper into k fold validation the available patterns are divided into k equal blocks and then the models are trained each time using the patterns from k 1 blocks and tested using the pattern from the remaining k th block the model error is computed based on the observed simulated pairs of all k stages the higher the number of blocks k the lower the variance magnitudes and the risk of over fitting shao 1993 the accuracy of the simulations obtained through k fold assessment is mainly dependent on the fold numbers the number of patterns per each fold the level of averaging and the repetition of k fold validation wong 2015 to assess the local temporal performance at one station k in eto studies is commonly defined as the number of available years accordingly the data of a single year are reserved as testing patterns each time and the models are trained using the data for the remaining years the procedure is repeated until all the available patterns participate in both training and testing stages averaging level might be set as both fold based and data set based calculating the bias for all available patterns marti et al 2011 suggested a complete local data scanning procedure for neural networks based eto estimation later other researchers e g shiri et al 2014 2015 feng et al 2017 adopted temporal and spatial data scanning procedures k fold testing to assess eto estimation under various climatic contexts using different data lengths recently antonopolous and antonopolous 2017 applied neural networks technique for simulating daily eto using five years weather data from a single station in greece they introduced the patterns of a single year each time as training matrix and tested the models in remaining four years separately their outcomes revealed that the way the training data length is defined seriously affects the neural networks results however no specific recommendation could be given for properly defining the training testing data lengths when dealing with local eto simulations nevertheless defining such fixed length data sub set as testing data through k fold validation of local temporal assessment might be misleading and inconsistent when the applied input target pairs have chronologic dependency as in eto data defining a rough fixed block e g a single year data as testing patterns would be inappropriate due to the inherent stochastic structure of the models in chronologic data racine 2000 one way of tackling this issue includes generalizations of data driven models proposed for spatial interpolations of eto using ancillary data supply strategies e g kumar et al 2009 marti and gasque 2010 kisi et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 shiri et al 2019b proposed new spatial data splitting strategies for enhancing the performance accuracy of the machine learning techniques through supply of ancillary data in sum the literature review by the authors showed that most of the existing studies in temporal local eto simulation context have been carried out using limited station numbers data periods through simple data assignment strategies hold out strategy on the other hand most of the works dealing with k fold validation have considered one year patterns as the minimum affordable test size defining this time spell as test size invalidates the fundamental theoretical problems of time series dependency e g auto correlation further no general conclusions have been obtained for precisely defining the most suitable temporal test size when applying data driven models for eto estimation the assessment of supervised machine learning approaches is very sensitive to the data partitioning adopted therefore the aim of this work is to propose new methodological criteria for partitioning the data set when dealing with data driven machine learning approaches in particular this work will focus on a local assessment of gene expression programming gep models in arid regions a similar analysis has been performed for the temperature based hargreaves samani equation too the methodologies developed here for assessing soft computing models can be translated into other regions with the same data domain further the procedures involved require high computational costs so a higher number of stations are not affordable a further step might revise the most promising strategies with a higher number of stations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data set daily meteorological records of seven weather stations in iran covering a period of 10 years 2008 2017 were utilized in the present research the available variables included maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin respectively rainfall amount p solar radiation rs relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface ws table1 summarizes general information about the studied locations and used data sets according to unep 1997 climatic context can be assessed using the aridity index the ratio between the annual eto and precipitation values eto p based on the aridity index ia values all the stations are arid except ilam ia 0 25 which is semi arid other aridity indices e g de martonne and willmott feddema may give different classifications e g tabari and hosseinzadehtalaee 2013 tabari et al 2014 analysis of the statistical parameters of the used data set table1 shows that the used meteorological variables presented considerable variations in their time series in terms of standard deviation sx and coefficient of variation cv values the maximum and minimum cv values of eto are observed in bojnurd 0 64 and birjand 0 51 respectively further except khorramabad the air temperature and solar radiation records showed left skewed negative skewness distributions the maximum skewness coefficient values are observed for ws and rh parameters both right skewed distribution hence the statistical distributions of the utilized meteorological records beside high cv values differ from the normal distribution fig 1 shows the whisker range plot of the monthly eto amounts for the stations the plots clearly present considerable eto variation during each month and through the year with larger variations for birjand station the presented variations distances between the minimum and maximum eto values are relatively larger during the warm periods than the cold seasons temporal analysis of the rainfall amount in all the stations showed that the maximum rainfall occurred during december and january while the minimum rainfall amounts correspond to the hot seasons between may and september the diversity of stations provides a reasonable initial test of partitioning methods in an arid region further dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss kwiatkowski et al 1992 tests were performed at the significance level of 0 05 to check if the eto time series are stationary by using adf test the null hypothesis h0 is that the time series has unit root while the alternative hypothesis h1 is that there is no root for the series series is stationary on the other hand the null hypothesis h0 by the kpss test is that the series is stationary while the alternative hypothesis h1 considers the series as non stationary both the tests revealed that the eto series of the studied stations have unit root that means the series are not stationary and their statistical parameters e g mean or variance change over the time this would be exclusively important here as the testing patterns are different for the adopted strategies a major step when applying machine learning models is the proper selection of the input variables here in accordance to the most commonly used empirical equations three input configurations were defined as can be seen in table2 regarding the partition of the data set different temporal train test definition strategies were defined table2 the first and second strategies are commonly used methods of data splitting in most of the machine learning applications in eto modeling they differ in the way the testing patterns were selected from all available patterns while the first strategy works chronologically the second selects the testing data randomly from the available data matrix the third and fourth strategies are similar to strategies1 2 but the sizes of the training testing data are not predefined fixed values e g 30 for testing etc by using these strategies the extreme eto values and their corresponding meteorological events are divided by lower or higher than mean eto criterion and the models trained and tested accordingly these strategies have been developed on a hypothesis that the higher the numbers of extreme values both minima and maxima domains in training matrix the lower the modeling error and higher the performance accuracy shiri and kisi 2012 in the fifth strategy strategy5 a stratified sample was defined based on using both high and low eto values in training phase randomly where 30 of patterns selected from lower and higher quartiles were reserved for testing and the models were trained with the rest of the patterns so strategies 1 to 5 correspond to different hold out validations another possibility with these strategies 1 5 might be repeating the procedure with different random splits i e repetitive hold out monte carlo cross validation dudoit and van der laan 2005 however the computational costs were considered prohibitive given the data length ten years daily patterns at each location the strategies 6 8 are based on k fold cross validation as mentioned previously this data partitioning method involves dividing all available patterns observations into k blocks and the training testing stages will be repeated k times until all available blocks k blocks participate in both of these phases let s assume we have a data matrix with total n observations rows and numerous predictors if these events rows were divided by k then nc will be the number of events per block then we assume that z y x is the matrix of these observations one may assume here that these observations are stationary time series where the covariance of successive observations events tends to be zero when the distance time steps between the events approaches infinity racine 2000 with a total of n observations rows the model will be fitted using n nc events each time while it is tested using the remaining nc observations and this will be performed for all ncnc possible test sets hence the k fold cross validation function cvc can be given as shao 1993 racine 2000 1 c v c 1 n c nc n c allc k y c y c c 2 since the values of k might be defined in different ways three possible alternatives are defined namely considering respectively a single year a single month and a complete growing season as mentioned since the utilized variables have time series nature defining one year strategy6 would carry the problems of data dependency because the eto and related meteorological variables show significant time series variation dependency during a year racine 2000 and bergmeir and benitez 2012 stated that when dealing with time series issues rather than selecting a fixed block of available patterns as testing data all the related patterns that show dependency with test patterns should be moved to the training matrix therefore to avoid such dependencies a data partitioning approach based on leave one out might be the proper case for data management in this study boora and ciaccio 2010 however reported that when using leave one out strategy for large data the probability of selecting a model with the most accurate simulation ability does not converge to unity while incurring substantial computational costs here by adopting strategies 7 8 the dependency between time series events is reduced to some extent 3 penman fao monteith model pfm due to the lack of measured eto records the pfm model was applied to provide the

gene expression programming gep genetic programming gp koza 1992 applies the fundamentals of the genetic algorithm ga goldberg 1989 by employing a parse tree structure to search for solutions gene expression programming gep is similar to gas and gp in that it selects the parse trees based on fitness values and introduces genetic variation by utilizing one or more genetic operators ferreira 2006 two major advantages of gep when compared to gp are simplicity of the chromosomes they are linear compact small size and easy to manipulate genetically and the ability of the expression trees to be modified according to fitness values ferreira 2001 this is because the expression trees are the representations of their related chromosomes five major steps for implementation of gep are as follows 1 selection of fitness function based on previous sensitivity analysis e g shiri et al 2012 in this field root mean square error rmse is the best fitness function for gep based modeling of eto values 2 selection of terminal and function set meteorological variables e g tmax tmin rh etc formed the terminal set input variables the function set usually consists of four basic operators as well as other basic functions based on previous studies 3 ln x e x x 2 x 3 were added to the four basic functions as suggested by shiri 2019 3 defining the chromosomal architecture based on the suggestions of ferreira 2001 length of head that determines the complexity of each term in the model was 8 and three genes were used per chromosome 4 application of linking function addition linking function was used to link sub trees as it has been often used in practical algebraic problems 5 defining gep based operators the parameters utilized with each run were those recommended in literature for these kinds of studies number of chromosomes 30 one point recombination rate 0 3 two point recombination rate 0 3 gene recombination rate 0 1 gene transposition rate 0 1 fitness function error type rmse mutation rate 0 044 and root insertion sequence transposition 0 1 the genexpro program was applied for simulation of eto in the present research ferreira 2006 more details about gep application in eto modeling can be found e g in shiri et al 2012 5 hargreaves samani equation the gep models were compared with the widely used hargreaves samani hs equation the hs equation for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration eto hs mm day is according to hargreaves and samani 1982 3 e t o hs a h c r a t mean 17 8 δ t where r a is the water equivalent of extraterrestrial radiation mm day δt is the daily temperature range c tmean is the mean daily air temperature c ahc is the adjusted hargreaves coefficient equal to 0 0023 in the original hs equation allen et al 1998 6 evaluation criteria hyndman and koehler 2006 and bergmeir and benitez 2012 argued that a set of statistical performance evaluation criteria should be used for assessing the performance of statistical machine learning techniques used for estimating different variables established through different cross validation methods those indices included scale based i e rmse percentage error based i e si mape and relative error i e ns indices here four statistical evaluation criteria viz determination coefficient r 2 the scatter index si the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and the coefficient of residual mass crm were applied 4 si rmse e t o pfm 1 n i 1 n e t io pfm e t io gep 2 e t o pfm 5 ns 1 i 1 n e t io pfm e t io gep 2 i 1 n e t io pfm e t o pfm 2 6 crm i 1 n e t io pfm i 1 n e t io gep i 1 n e t io pfm here e t io pfm and e t io gep stand for the target calculated by pfm model and simulated obtained by gep eto values at the i th time step respectively e t 0 pfm shows the corresponding mean pfmeto values n denotes the number of time steps available patterns for the hs model the gep superscript will be replaced by hs in these equations the scatter index is the normalized rmse value assigning more weight to larger errors this is a good measure of modeling performance accuracy especially when the variation domains of the target parameters of available cases here stations are different therefore si can be successfully applied for comparative analysis of the models accuracy among different locations time periods with different eto variations the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns assesses the residual variance in term of the observed patterns variance its optimal value is unity presenting the perfect fit legates and mccabe 1999 finally crm is a measure for assessing the models over underestimation trends positive crm values indicate underestimation of the target values by the model and vice versa for the traditional common strategies strategies 1 5 these indices were simply computed for the evaluation periods in the case of the k fold testing strategies however these were computed individually per test stage as well as for the all available patterns per test year per test month and per test season for strategies 6 7 and 8 respectively when calculated for the entire period instead of averaging these indices for calculating the averaged indicators of 10 years a global estimation matrix was build comprising the patterns target simulated of complete period and was used to calculate the indicators of each model it should be noted that the si and ns are weighted statistical indices where the magnitudes of the target parameter eto is used to make these indices dimensionless so the effect of eto values variations in any test stage is eliminated and they can be used for comparing the performance of data partitioning strategies 7 results and discussions 7 1 general statements table3 provides global performance indicators of the applied strategies averaging the results of the seven sites from the table the third input configuration gep3 provides the most accurate results except for strategies 1 2 and 8 where gep2 and gep1 showed better performance respectively from the crm indicator viewpoint the lowest over underestimations were observed for strategies 2 5 and 6 correlation analysis per station values not shown showed that both rs and rh have considerable positive and negative correlations with eto respectively so their impact on evapotranspiration phenomenon is significant but leads to small differences in the performance accuracy of gep2 and gep3 models for both the strategies hs equation gave less accurate results than the gep models next the strategies 3 4 presented higher si error and negative ns values for gep models that made their outcomes unacceptable this clearly shows that the effect of including extreme values in this way in training testing phases is negligible in eto estimation by using gep did not improve modeling performance this highlights the importance of developing further data scanning tools too this partial conclusion might be extended to other locations because the stations used in this study showed higher variations of eto values in terms of standard deviation or cv and skewness kurtosis values as well as differences between the maximum and minimum eto so the differences between the eto events and their mean values at each location are considerable and provided sufficient variations of this parameter in the training and testing stages hence simulating eto in other locations with considerable variations of this parameter might show the same trend of performance accuracy even though using two block partitioning with random data selection strategy2 might not be suitable for eto time series modeling due to chronologic trend of this parameter as well as significant auto correlation values as mentioned before it presented higher performance accuracy than the third and fourth strategies which are supposed to provide acceptable results due to including extreme events in their training matrix further stratgey5 could improve the performance accuracy of these strategies to some extent that might be linked to inclusion of both low and high values in its training matrix although it couldn t outperformed the commonly used strategies 1 2 the outcomes for the third and fourth strategies might be anticipated on the other hand because the lower eto values might not be good predictive of higher eto values and vice versa the fifth strategy including both low and high values in training matrix also couldn t surpass the commonly used hold out procedures strategies 1 2 however previous studies has shown that supervised machine learning techniques are capable of simulating eto values in target stations using data from completely different locations from climatic context viewpoint with considerable eto differences between the training and testing sites e g shiri et al 2013 kiafar et al 2017 hence as the eto time series are highly auto correlated a possible reason for lower performance accuracy of the strategies 3 5 would be the interruption disturbance of their time series in both the training and testing stages another possibility with strategies 3 4 would be to include extreme values of the input parameters e g rs rh etc in training testing matrix however this might provide similar results because the extreme values of input variables have affected the eto magnitudes directly adversely e g the higher the rh the lower the eto negative correlation etc in case of the hs equation performance although it presented more accurate results by strategies 1 2 its general performance when assessed by strategies 3 5 was better than the gep models this performance improvement might be explained through analyzing the training matrix of strategies3 5 where the time dependency has been disturbed and gep couldn t learn such series well to discover the relations between the input meteorological variables and target eto parameters instead the results presented for hs belonged to its calibrated version that fits a linear relation between the pfm and hs eto values which is actually simpler than the previous case nevertheless the total performance of hs in spite of its ranking with respect to gep models was poor as can be seen from statistical indicators values finally an overall evaluation of the strategies in table 3 revealed that the first strategy surpassed the others except for gep1 where strategy8 showed promising results however it should be noted that this strategy used two blocks for training and testing patterns assigned chronologically so the model does not learn all available events it is not clear whether the models performances will be further improved if the other three years of data were used for training so a hold out validation might provide only partially valid conclusions in comparison to a k fold validation e g marti et al 2011 8 evaluation per station fig 2 displays the global si values of the gep models evaluated by all adopted strategies for each station strategies 3 and 4 showed the least accurate outcomes in all the stations for all applied input configurations while strategy8 presented the lowest si in most of the studied cases general assessment of the applied input configurations showed that gep3 comprising temperature and radiation variables outperformed both the gep1 and gep2 models in all cases next the differences between performance accuracy of the models assessed by the adopted strategies are different among the stations for instance while si difference between the most accurate and less accurate strategies of temperature based models δsi of gep1 for birjand was very high 1 249 such difference cannot be observed for the rest of the locations for gep1 model in bojnurd and shahrekord this difference was smaller δsi of gep1 0 511 and 0 454 respectively regarding the gep2 and gep3 models the highest si differences were observed in bojnurd δsi 1 264 and 1 584 for gep2 and gep3 respectively fig 3 shows the cumulative eto ratios of the gep models during the test periods of each adopted strategy cumulative eto amount is an essential factor for optimal planning of water allocation and irrigation scheduling obvious over and under estimations of the gep models assessed using strategies 3 4 occur in all locations so the inclusion of lower eto values lower than mean as training patterns might have led to large overestimations during the test period strategy3 while introducing higher eto values than the mean as training patterns strategy4 might have led to underestimations for the test stage with some exceptions other strategies yielded values of this ratio around unity with the minimum values corresponding to strategies 6 7 moreover the average values of this ratio were respectively 1 0009 1 002 and 0 999 for gep1 gep2 and gep3 models when assessed by strategy6 similarities between the si and ns values of the models assessed by commonly used strategies 1 2 and the k fold cross validation might be due to global performance accuracy calculation for k fold cross validation using all available patterns so it might be stated that even by using traditional two block partitioning method the outcomes would be promising in terms of bias lower errors would be achieved although it is highly affected by the portion of data selected for training and or testing blocks this is mainly due to the non stationarity of the eto values applied the key point would be assessing the models performance stability as well as analyzing the variance of the simulated values across the entire patterns that cannot be fulfilled through hold out approaches the values of variances for the simulated values of the models have been illustrated in fig 2 the variance values of strategies 3 4 are always low but instead their bias error values are high for the rest of the strategies it is obviously seen that the variance of k fold validation are lower than hold out meanwhile the variance obtained by strategy8 is the lowest among all adopted strategies that accompanied by its lower error values and confirms the stability of the results obtained through assessing the models by this strategy it should be however noted that the performances of k fold testing cross validation in these sections have been set at data set where the variance of point estimators might be dependent on the sample proportion wong 2015 argued that the performance accuracy of the models assessed by k fold cross validation should be calculated fold by fold so such evaluations are made and discussed in the next sections for better assessing the results stability 9 temporal analysis of k fold test figs 4 6 display the temporal variations of the error index si of the applied models for the defined test stages of the last three strategies using k fold testing methods from fig 4 it is clear that there are minor variations of si values among the test years for all stations and gep models but the variations are generally low with δsi difference between maximum and minimum si values around 0 1 except in khorramabad where δsi 0 17 for gep3 model similar trends were also observed for ns variations in all stations not presented here regarding strategy 7 fig 5 however the si variations are considerable among different months with relatively higher si values for winter autumn seasons cold period of the year for the warm periods differences between the si and ns values of the gep models are negligible and all temperature temperature humidity and radiation based gep models gep1 gep2 and gep3 respectively presented similar si and ns values this shows that the effect of inclusion of additional meteorological parameters in the temperature based models i e rh and rs was not significant during warm periods comparing with strategy6 the values of both si and δsi are higher for this strategy finally in case of the strategy8 δsi values are lower than strategy7 using this strategy all gep models provided similar si and ns values in birjand and shahrekord for all test stages while in khorramabad differences between the performance accuracy of gep models have been increased in relation to the previous k fold testing strategies figur6 nonetheless the si values in bojnurd and hamedan have been reduced when the models tested by this strategy comparing these k fold testing strategies it might be stated that although the average performance accuracy of the models in terms of si and ns has been reduced by adopting strategy7 defining one month as fixed testing patterns this strategy has conducted a more detailed scan of the all available patterns further a breakdown of modeling performance accuracy of the models assessed by k fold testing strategies is presented in table 4 from the table it is seen that the gep models assessed by the strategy8 always give the most accurate results for all three input configurations and stations except ilam khorramabad for gep1 and gep2 and bojnurd only gep3 in bojnurd gep3 model gave the best results when assessed by strategy6 moreover gep1 and gep2 models gave the most accurate results in ilam and khorramabad when they were assessed through the same strategy this might be linked to the patterns excluded from the training matrix by strategy8 as mentioned this strategy considers each time a single growing season patterns between may september as test samples on the other hand as can be seen from fig 1 these three locations showed considerable differences between the maximum and minimum eto values during this period this difference occurred in may for ilam and khorramabad while in bojnurd it was observed during september end of the growing season with relatively lower radiation received compared to the start of the growing season as well as lower correlations between solar radiation and eto amounts not presented here 10 study limitations 1 the evaluation criteria are calculated on different evaluation periods for each strategy so it might be questionable if the results might be comparable across the strategies however this is a very common practice in the literature because the available patterns might be considerably reduced if they should be homogenized to a common data period a further study might compare both methodologies nonetheless similar data partitioning protocols might be adopted and validated for regional spatial eto modeling issues 2 monthly or at least weekly eto estimations are more accurate than daily ones because of the variability reduction derived from using averaged values see e g martí et al 2015 but this is not automatically translated into more accurate equivalent daily estimations irrigation scheduling requires the definition of daily doses therefore models relying on daily patterns are suitable the limitation of difficulties derived from this approach is that the learning algorithms have to face a higher variability in the patterns 3 the presented modeling techniques could be coupled with climate change scenarios despite it is beyond the scope of the present study in this way the split indicators of the k fold validation might contribute to define where new climatic trends might eventually begin the major point would be how to define the k partitions in order to detect new climate trends this type of studies would necessarily involve wider time periods which should demand larger testing sets in order to computationally afford the calculation times 11 conclusions various temporal data partitioning strategies were evaluated in the present research for estimating daily eto values in arid regions the evaluated strategies consisted of holdout and k fold validation scenarios of temporal data scanning the commonly used two block partitioning strategy with chronologic data selection for training and testing provided the most accurate results among the holdout procedures further focusing on either high or low eto values as training data sets in holdout procedures provided the least accurate results with considerable over underestimations of the eto values this might be anticipated because lower eto values are unlikely predictive of higher eto values and vice versa since the work dealt with time series analysis of the meteorological variables using 10 years daily data from the studied sites analysis of the models results on the basis of hold out approaches can be biased or partially valid depending on selection of the test data from the time series hence if the test patterns picked up from the first middle or the last parts of the time series of input target parameters depending on the general trend of the used meteorological variables during the study period different results and model selection conditions would be achieved nevertheless even if the assessment of the models based on hold out strategies gave acceptable results in the presented research they might fail to give a thorough judgment about the models under other time series conditions where the utilized input target parameters show a clear severe ascending descending trend seasonality which can cause over fitting by the applied models also considering monthly patterns as minimum affordable test size produced higher error magnitudes among k fold validation strategies considering the complete patterns of one growing season as test data set always provided more accurate

5174,recently data driven machine learning techniques has been widely applied for modeling reference evapotranspiration eto values under various climatic conditions taking into account the different number of sites and available data length a major issue with applying those models is the proper selection of training testing data sets although some spatial generalization approaches have been recommended for this purpose there are no specified recommended local temporal data partitioning strategies for machine learning based eto estimation the present study evaluates different hold out and k fold validation temporal data partitioning strategies when using gene expression programming gep technique to estimate daily eto in arid regions the k fold validation strategies considered annual monthly and growing season period patterns as test data sets although commonly used partitioning of the available patterns into training and testing sets gave accurate results statistical analysis showed that the results obtained through k fold validation assessment were more reliable a two block partitioning strategy with chronologic data selection for training and testing provided the most accurate results among the hold out procedures mean scatter index si value of 0 162 fixing the extreme eto values as training data set in hold out procedures provided the less accurate results with considerable over underestimation of the eto values mean si value was 0 506 results on the basis of hold out approaches can be biased or only partially valid depending on selection of the test data from the time series k fold validation yielded the lowest over underestimations of eto values further considering monthly patterns as minimum affordable test size produced higher error magnitudes among k fold validation strategies while considering the complete patterns of one growing season provided more accurate results among k fold validation strategies keywords evapotranspiration gene expression programming hold out k fold validation 1 introduction accurate simulation of reference evapotranspiration eto is very important in many disciplines including hydrology and water resources management agricultural activities irrigation scheduling environmental assessment and land drainage and reclamation issues although lysimeters can provide in situ measurements of this parameter their construction necessities should be precisely followed to get reliable eto values which is very difficult in many situations on the other hand physically based or empirical eto models relying on meteorological input variables are good alternatives to experimental measurements among the large diversity of the existing empirical physical models the penman monteith model adopted by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao pmf is commonly used as the standard model for calculating eto values in a wide range of climatologic contexts allen et al 1998 however a major downside of this model is the necessity to use lots of meteorological data that are not easily measured in most regions meanwhile empirical models that consider fewer meteorological inputs can be applied for calculating eto but they tend to be site specific and have not been verified universally under all different climatic conditions trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 even if they have been evaluated under different climatic conditions at regional scales e g tabari 2010 on the other hand the application of machine learning approaches has been widely reported in the literature as a valid and even preferable substitute to the empirical models adnan et al 2019 there are many such applications that have demonstrated promising outcomes of machine learning models for eto simulation under various climatic contexts and data availability conditions e g kisi 2016 kiafar et al 2017 granata 2019 wu et al 2019 a crucial task in machine learning based eto simulation beside defining their proper input variables is to carry out a suitable partition of the data set into training testing and validation sets for making a thorough assessment of these models although analysis of residuals errors in the training period can give some relative information to judge among different models it is not necessarily representative of performance with the unseen data data not used by the models in training phase so it is a commonly accepted approach in literature that a type of cross validation approach should be adopted in developing the machine learning methods in simulation prediction issues to divide the available patterns into training for model selection and validation testing for model assessment periods however there is no fixed rule for defining such partitions as it generally depends on the signal to noise ratio in the patterns as well as the training sample size hastie et al 2017 typically cross validation might be categorized into exhaustive and non exhaustive groups among the first group the leave p out and leave one out methods can be considered these approaches usually evaluate all possible ways for partitioning the available data into training and testing portions given the high computational cost involved in the exhaustive cross validation methods their practical applications are limited but instead theoretical background of these methods has informed development of simpler cross validation methods e g non exhaustive validation methods as hold out k fold validation and repeated random sub sampling validation in the eto simulation context most studies have dealt with this issue using a single partitioning of the data or hold out where a part of available patterns usually around 70 75 are used for training the applied models while the models are tested using the remaining patterns the error values of the models are computed evaluated on the basis of the testing results this approach is exclusively suitable for data rich situations other studies include an additional validation set used before testing to avoid overtraining pour alibaba et al 2012 with these hold out methods the testing validation data are usually selected from the end of the time series although these are straightforward methods of data partitioning for data driven models applications a major drawback rises from the absence of a complete testing scan of the dataset that eliminates the temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies among the used data bergmeir and benitez 2012 therefore the obtained results may be biased or only partially valid with relatively higher variances as the model does not experience all possible events encountered in the applied patterns shiri et al 2019a this reduces the model generalization ability for future unseen data nonetheless when the utilized time series is non stationary a major difficulty would be the choice of testing patterns because this will obviously affect the models assessment from both the bias and variance viewpoints further information on over underestimation trends of the models is incomplete since the test patterns belongs to a specified time period rather than examining all the events potentially with atypical extreme values this can cause issues with eto estimation and irrigation scheduling during a growing season which depends on accurate estimation of crop water requirements digging deeper into k fold validation the available patterns are divided into k equal blocks and then the models are trained each time using the patterns from k 1 blocks and tested using the pattern from the remaining k th block the model error is computed based on the observed simulated pairs of all k stages the higher the number of blocks k the lower the variance magnitudes and the risk of over fitting shao 1993 the accuracy of the simulations obtained through k fold assessment is mainly dependent on the fold numbers the number of patterns per each fold the level of averaging and the repetition of k fold validation wong 2015 to assess the local temporal performance at one station k in eto studies is commonly defined as the number of available years accordingly the data of a single year are reserved as testing patterns each time and the models are trained using the data for the remaining years the procedure is repeated until all the available patterns participate in both training and testing stages averaging level might be set as both fold based and data set based calculating the bias for all available patterns marti et al 2011 suggested a complete local data scanning procedure for neural networks based eto estimation later other researchers e g shiri et al 2014 2015 feng et al 2017 adopted temporal and spatial data scanning procedures k fold testing to assess eto estimation under various climatic contexts using different data lengths recently antonopolous and antonopolous 2017 applied neural networks technique for simulating daily eto using five years weather data from a single station in greece they introduced the patterns of a single year each time as training matrix and tested the models in remaining four years separately their outcomes revealed that the way the training data length is defined seriously affects the neural networks results however no specific recommendation could be given for properly defining the training testing data lengths when dealing with local eto simulations nevertheless defining such fixed length data sub set as testing data through k fold validation of local temporal assessment might be misleading and inconsistent when the applied input target pairs have chronologic dependency as in eto data defining a rough fixed block e g a single year data as testing patterns would be inappropriate due to the inherent stochastic structure of the models in chronologic data racine 2000 one way of tackling this issue includes generalizations of data driven models proposed for spatial interpolations of eto using ancillary data supply strategies e g kumar et al 2009 marti and gasque 2010 kisi et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 shiri et al 2019b proposed new spatial data splitting strategies for enhancing the performance accuracy of the machine learning techniques through supply of ancillary data in sum the literature review by the authors showed that most of the existing studies in temporal local eto simulation context have been carried out using limited station numbers data periods through simple data assignment strategies hold out strategy on the other hand most of the works dealing with k fold validation have considered one year patterns as the minimum affordable test size defining this time spell as test size invalidates the fundamental theoretical problems of time series dependency e g auto correlation further no general conclusions have been obtained for precisely defining the most suitable temporal test size when applying data driven models for eto estimation the assessment of supervised machine learning approaches is very sensitive to the data partitioning adopted therefore the aim of this work is to propose new methodological criteria for partitioning the data set when dealing with data driven machine learning approaches in particular this work will focus on a local assessment of gene expression programming gep models in arid regions a similar analysis has been performed for the temperature based hargreaves samani equation too the methodologies developed here for assessing soft computing models can be translated into other regions with the same data domain further the procedures involved require high computational costs so a higher number of stations are not affordable a further step might revise the most promising strategies with a higher number of stations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data set daily meteorological records of seven weather stations in iran covering a period of 10 years 2008 2017 were utilized in the present research the available variables included maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin respectively rainfall amount p solar radiation rs relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface ws table1 summarizes general information about the studied locations and used data sets according to unep 1997 climatic context can be assessed using the aridity index the ratio between the annual eto and precipitation values eto p based on the aridity index ia values all the stations are arid except ilam ia 0 25 which is semi arid other aridity indices e g de martonne and willmott feddema may give different classifications e g tabari and hosseinzadehtalaee 2013 tabari et al 2014 analysis of the statistical parameters of the used data set table1 shows that the used meteorological variables presented considerable variations in their time series in terms of standard deviation sx and coefficient of variation cv values the maximum and minimum cv values of eto are observed in bojnurd 0 64 and birjand 0 51 respectively further except khorramabad the air temperature and solar radiation records showed left skewed negative skewness distributions the maximum skewness coefficient values are observed for ws and rh parameters both right skewed distribution hence the statistical distributions of the utilized meteorological records beside high cv values differ from the normal distribution fig 1 shows the whisker range plot of the monthly eto amounts for the stations the plots clearly present considerable eto variation during each month and through the year with larger variations for birjand station the presented variations distances between the minimum and maximum eto values are relatively larger during the warm periods than the cold seasons temporal analysis of the rainfall amount in all the stations showed that the maximum rainfall occurred during december and january while the minimum rainfall amounts correspond to the hot seasons between may and september the diversity of stations provides a reasonable initial test of partitioning methods in an arid region further dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss kwiatkowski et al 1992 tests were performed at the significance level of 0 05 to check if the eto time series are stationary by using adf test the null hypothesis h0 is that the time series has unit root while the alternative hypothesis h1 is that there is no root for the series series is stationary on the other hand the null hypothesis h0 by the kpss test is that the series is stationary while the alternative hypothesis h1 considers the series as non stationary both the tests revealed that the eto series of the studied stations have unit root that means the series are not stationary and their statistical parameters e g mean or variance change over the time this would be exclusively important here as the testing patterns are different for the adopted strategies a major step when applying machine learning models is the proper selection of the input variables here in accordance to the most commonly used empirical equations three input configurations were defined as can be seen in table2 regarding the partition of the data set different temporal train test definition strategies were defined table2 the first and second strategies are commonly used methods of data splitting in most of the machine learning applications in eto modeling they differ in the way the testing patterns were selected from all available patterns while the first strategy works chronologically the second selects the testing data randomly from the available data matrix the third and fourth strategies are similar to strategies1 2 but the sizes of the training testing data are not predefined fixed values e g 30 for testing etc by using these strategies the extreme eto values and their corresponding meteorological events are divided by lower or higher than mean eto criterion and the models trained and tested accordingly these strategies have been developed on a hypothesis that the higher the numbers of extreme values both minima and maxima domains in training matrix the lower the modeling error and higher the performance accuracy shiri and kisi 2012 in the fifth strategy strategy5 a stratified sample was defined based on using both high and low eto values in training phase randomly where 30 of patterns selected from lower and higher quartiles were reserved for testing and the models were trained with the rest of the patterns so strategies 1 to 5 correspond to different hold out validations another possibility with these strategies 1 5 might be repeating the procedure with different random splits i e repetitive hold out monte carlo cross validation dudoit and van der laan 2005 however the computational costs were considered prohibitive given the data length ten years daily patterns at each location the strategies 6 8 are based on k fold cross validation as mentioned previously this data partitioning method involves dividing all available patterns observations into k blocks and the training testing stages will be repeated k times until all available blocks k blocks participate in both of these phases let s assume we have a data matrix with total n observations rows and numerous predictors if these events rows were divided by k then nc will be the number of events per block then we assume that z y x is the matrix of these observations one may assume here that these observations are stationary time series where the covariance of successive observations events tends to be zero when the distance time steps between the events approaches infinity racine 2000 with a total of n observations rows the model will be fitted using n nc events each time while it is tested using the remaining nc observations and this will be performed for all ncnc possible test sets hence the k fold cross validation function cvc can be given as shao 1993 racine 2000 1 c v c 1 n c nc n c allc k y c y c c 2 since the values of k might be defined in different ways three possible alternatives are defined namely considering respectively a single year a single month and a complete growing season as mentioned since the utilized variables have time series nature defining one year strategy6 would carry the problems of data dependency because the eto and related meteorological variables show significant time series variation dependency during a year racine 2000 and bergmeir and benitez 2012 stated that when dealing with time series issues rather than selecting a fixed block of available patterns as testing data all the related patterns that show dependency with test patterns should be moved to the training matrix therefore to avoid such dependencies a data partitioning approach based on leave one out might be the proper case for data management in this study boora and ciaccio 2010 however reported that when using leave one out strategy for large data the probability of selecting a model with the most accurate simulation ability does not converge to unity while incurring substantial computational costs here by adopting strategies 7 8 the dependency between time series events is reduced to some extent 3 penman fao monteith model pfm due to the lack of measured eto records the pfm model was applied to provide the

gene expression programming gep genetic programming gp koza 1992 applies the fundamentals of the genetic algorithm ga goldberg 1989 by employing a parse tree structure to search for solutions gene expression programming gep is similar to gas and gp in that it selects the parse trees based on fitness values and introduces genetic variation by utilizing one or more genetic operators ferreira 2006 two major advantages of gep when compared to gp are simplicity of the chromosomes they are linear compact small size and easy to manipulate genetically and the ability of the expression trees to be modified according to fitness values ferreira 2001 this is because the expression trees are the representations of their related chromosomes five major steps for implementation of gep are as follows 1 selection of fitness function based on previous sensitivity analysis e g shiri et al 2012 in this field root mean square error rmse is the best fitness function for gep based modeling of eto values 2 selection of terminal and function set meteorological variables e g tmax tmin rh etc formed the terminal set input variables the function set usually consists of four basic operators as well as other basic functions based on previous studies 3 ln x e x x 2 x 3 were added to the four basic functions as suggested by shiri 2019 3 defining the chromosomal architecture based on the suggestions of ferreira 2001 length of head that determines the complexity of each term in the model was 8 and three genes were used per chromosome 4 application of linking function addition linking function was used to link sub trees as it has been often used in practical algebraic problems 5 defining gep based operators the parameters utilized with each run were those recommended in literature for these kinds of studies number of chromosomes 30 one point recombination rate 0 3 two point recombination rate 0 3 gene recombination rate 0 1 gene transposition rate 0 1 fitness function error type rmse mutation rate 0 044 and root insertion sequence transposition 0 1 the genexpro program was applied for simulation of eto in the present research ferreira 2006 more details about gep application in eto modeling can be found e g in shiri et al 2012 5 hargreaves samani equation the gep models were compared with the widely used hargreaves samani hs equation the hs equation for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration eto hs mm day is according to hargreaves and samani 1982 3 e t o hs a h c r a t mean 17 8 δ t where r a is the water equivalent of extraterrestrial radiation mm day δt is the daily temperature range c tmean is the mean daily air temperature c ahc is the adjusted hargreaves coefficient equal to 0 0023 in the original hs equation allen et al 1998 6 evaluation criteria hyndman and koehler 2006 and bergmeir and benitez 2012 argued that a set of statistical performance evaluation criteria should be used for assessing the performance of statistical machine learning techniques used for estimating different variables established through different cross validation methods those indices included scale based i e rmse percentage error based i e si mape and relative error i e ns indices here four statistical evaluation criteria viz determination coefficient r 2 the scatter index si the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and the coefficient of residual mass crm were applied 4 si rmse e t o pfm 1 n i 1 n e t io pfm e t io gep 2 e t o pfm 5 ns 1 i 1 n e t io pfm e t io gep 2 i 1 n e t io pfm e t o pfm 2 6 crm i 1 n e t io pfm i 1 n e t io gep i 1 n e t io pfm here e t io pfm and e t io gep stand for the target calculated by pfm model and simulated obtained by gep eto values at the i th time step respectively e t 0 pfm shows the corresponding mean pfmeto values n denotes the number of time steps available patterns for the hs model the gep superscript will be replaced by hs in these equations the scatter index is the normalized rmse value assigning more weight to larger errors this is a good measure of modeling performance accuracy especially when the variation domains of the target parameters of available cases here stations are different therefore si can be successfully applied for comparative analysis of the models accuracy among different locations time periods with different eto variations the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns assesses the residual variance in term of the observed patterns variance its optimal value is unity presenting the perfect fit legates and mccabe 1999 finally crm is a measure for assessing the models over underestimation trends positive crm values indicate underestimation of the target values by the model and vice versa for the traditional common strategies strategies 1 5 these indices were simply computed for the evaluation periods in the case of the k fold testing strategies however these were computed individually per test stage as well as for the all available patterns per test year per test month and per test season for strategies 6 7 and 8 respectively when calculated for the entire period instead of averaging these indices for calculating the averaged indicators of 10 years a global estimation matrix was build comprising the patterns target simulated of complete period and was used to calculate the indicators of each model it should be noted that the si and ns are weighted statistical indices where the magnitudes of the target parameter eto is used to make these indices dimensionless so the effect of eto values variations in any test stage is eliminated and they can be used for comparing the performance of data partitioning strategies 7 results and discussions 7 1 general statements table3 provides global performance indicators of the applied strategies averaging the results of the seven sites from the table the third input configuration gep3 provides the most accurate results except for strategies 1 2 and 8 where gep2 and gep1 showed better performance respectively from the crm indicator viewpoint the lowest over underestimations were observed for strategies 2 5 and 6 correlation analysis per station values not shown showed that both rs and rh have considerable positive and negative correlations with eto respectively so their impact on evapotranspiration phenomenon is significant but leads to small differences in the performance accuracy of gep2 and gep3 models for both the strategies hs equation gave less accurate results than the gep models next the strategies 3 4 presented higher si error and negative ns values for gep models that made their outcomes unacceptable this clearly shows that the effect of including extreme values in this way in training testing phases is negligible in eto estimation by using gep did not improve modeling performance this highlights the importance of developing further data scanning tools too this partial conclusion might be extended to other locations because the stations used in this study showed higher variations of eto values in terms of standard deviation or cv and skewness kurtosis values as well as differences between the maximum and minimum eto so the differences between the eto events and their mean values at each location are considerable and provided sufficient variations of this parameter in the training and testing stages hence simulating eto in other locations with considerable variations of this parameter might show the same trend of performance accuracy even though using two block partitioning with random data selection strategy2 might not be suitable for eto time series modeling due to chronologic trend of this parameter as well as significant auto correlation values as mentioned before it presented higher performance accuracy than the third and fourth strategies which are supposed to provide acceptable results due to including extreme events in their training matrix further stratgey5 could improve the performance accuracy of these strategies to some extent that might be linked to inclusion of both low and high values in its training matrix although it couldn t outperformed the commonly used strategies 1 2 the outcomes for the third and fourth strategies might be anticipated on the other hand because the lower eto values might not be good predictive of higher eto values and vice versa the fifth strategy including both low and high values in training matrix also couldn t surpass the commonly used hold out procedures strategies 1 2 however previous studies has shown that supervised machine learning techniques are capable of simulating eto values in target stations using data from completely different locations from climatic context viewpoint with considerable eto differences between the training and testing sites e g shiri et al 2013 kiafar et al 2017 hence as the eto time series are highly auto correlated a possible reason for lower performance accuracy of the strategies 3 5 would be the interruption disturbance of their time series in both the training and testing stages another possibility with strategies 3 4 would be to include extreme values of the input parameters e g rs rh etc in training testing matrix however this might provide similar results because the extreme values of input variables have affected the eto magnitudes directly adversely e g the higher the rh the lower the eto negative correlation etc in case of the hs equation performance although it presented more accurate results by strategies 1 2 its general performance when assessed by strategies 3 5 was better than the gep models this performance improvement might be explained through analyzing the training matrix of strategies3 5 where the time dependency has been disturbed and gep couldn t learn such series well to discover the relations between the input meteorological variables and target eto parameters instead the results presented for hs belonged to its calibrated version that fits a linear relation between the pfm and hs eto values which is actually simpler than the previous case nevertheless the total performance of hs in spite of its ranking with respect to gep models was poor as can be seen from statistical indicators values finally an overall evaluation of the strategies in table 3 revealed that the first strategy surpassed the others except for gep1 where strategy8 showed promising results however it should be noted that this strategy used two blocks for training and testing patterns assigned chronologically so the model does not learn all available events it is not clear whether the models performances will be further improved if the other three years of data were used for training so a hold out validation might provide only partially valid conclusions in comparison to a k fold validation e g marti et al 2011 8 evaluation per station fig 2 displays the global si values of the gep models evaluated by all adopted strategies for each station strategies 3 and 4 showed the least accurate outcomes in all the stations for all applied input configurations while strategy8 presented the lowest si in most of the studied cases general assessment of the applied input configurations showed that gep3 comprising temperature and radiation variables outperformed both the gep1 and gep2 models in all cases next the differences between performance accuracy of the models assessed by the adopted strategies are different among the stations for instance while si difference between the most accurate and less accurate strategies of temperature based models δsi of gep1 for birjand was very high 1 249 such difference cannot be observed for the rest of the locations for gep1 model in bojnurd and shahrekord this difference was smaller δsi of gep1 0 511 and 0 454 respectively regarding the gep2 and gep3 models the highest si differences were observed in bojnurd δsi 1 264 and 1 584 for gep2 and gep3 respectively fig 3 shows the cumulative eto ratios of the gep models during the test periods of each adopted strategy cumulative eto amount is an essential factor for optimal planning of water allocation and irrigation scheduling obvious over and under estimations of the gep models assessed using strategies 3 4 occur in all locations so the inclusion of lower eto values lower than mean as training patterns might have led to large overestimations during the test period strategy3 while introducing higher eto values than the mean as training patterns strategy4 might have led to underestimations for the test stage with some exceptions other strategies yielded values of this ratio around unity with the minimum values corresponding to strategies 6 7 moreover the average values of this ratio were respectively 1 0009 1 002 and 0 999 for gep1 gep2 and gep3 models when assessed by strategy6 similarities between the si and ns values of the models assessed by commonly used strategies 1 2 and the k fold cross validation might be due to global performance accuracy calculation for k fold cross validation using all available patterns so it might be stated that even by using traditional two block partitioning method the outcomes would be promising in terms of bias lower errors would be achieved although it is highly affected by the portion of data selected for training and or testing blocks this is mainly due to the non stationarity of the eto values applied the key point would be assessing the models performance stability as well as analyzing the variance of the simulated values across the entire patterns that cannot be fulfilled through hold out approaches the values of variances for the simulated values of the models have been illustrated in fig 2 the variance values of strategies 3 4 are always low but instead their bias error values are high for the rest of the strategies it is obviously seen that the variance of k fold validation are lower than hold out meanwhile the variance obtained by strategy8 is the lowest among all adopted strategies that accompanied by its lower error values and confirms the stability of the results obtained through assessing the models by this strategy it should be however noted that the performances of k fold testing cross validation in these sections have been set at data set where the variance of point estimators might be dependent on the sample proportion wong 2015 argued that the performance accuracy of the models assessed by k fold cross validation should be calculated fold by fold so such evaluations are made and discussed in the next sections for better assessing the results stability 9 temporal analysis of k fold test figs 4 6 display the temporal variations of the error index si of the applied models for the defined test stages of the last three strategies using k fold testing methods from fig 4 it is clear that there are minor variations of si values among the test years for all stations and gep models but the variations are generally low with δsi difference between maximum and minimum si values around 0 1 except in khorramabad where δsi 0 17 for gep3 model similar trends were also observed for ns variations in all stations not presented here regarding strategy 7 fig 5 however the si variations are considerable among different months with relatively higher si values for winter autumn seasons cold period of the year for the warm periods differences between the si and ns values of the gep models are negligible and all temperature temperature humidity and radiation based gep models gep1 gep2 and gep3 respectively presented similar si and ns values this shows that the effect of inclusion of additional meteorological parameters in the temperature based models i e rh and rs was not significant during warm periods comparing with strategy6 the values of both si and δsi are higher for this strategy finally in case of the strategy8 δsi values are lower than strategy7 using this strategy all gep models provided similar si and ns values in birjand and shahrekord for all test stages while in khorramabad differences between the performance accuracy of gep models have been increased in relation to the previous k fold testing strategies figur6 nonetheless the si values in bojnurd and hamedan have been reduced when the models tested by this strategy comparing these k fold testing strategies it might be stated that although the average performance accuracy of the models in terms of si and ns has been reduced by adopting strategy7 defining one month as fixed testing patterns this strategy has conducted a more detailed scan of the all available patterns further a breakdown of modeling performance accuracy of the models assessed by k fold testing strategies is presented in table 4 from the table it is seen that the gep models assessed by the strategy8 always give the most accurate results for all three input configurations and stations except ilam khorramabad for gep1 and gep2 and bojnurd only gep3 in bojnurd gep3 model gave the best results when assessed by strategy6 moreover gep1 and gep2 models gave the most accurate results in ilam and khorramabad when they were assessed through the same strategy this might be linked to the patterns excluded from the training matrix by strategy8 as mentioned this strategy considers each time a single growing season patterns between may september as test samples on the other hand as can be seen from fig 1 these three locations showed considerable differences between the maximum and minimum eto values during this period this difference occurred in may for ilam and khorramabad while in bojnurd it was observed during september end of the growing season with relatively lower radiation received compared to the start of the growing season as well as lower correlations between solar radiation and eto amounts not presented here 10 study limitations 1 the evaluation criteria are calculated on different evaluation periods for each strategy so it might be questionable if the results might be comparable across the strategies however this is a very common practice in the literature because the available patterns might be considerably reduced if they should be homogenized to a common data period a further study might compare both methodologies nonetheless similar data partitioning protocols might be adopted and validated for regional spatial eto modeling issues 2 monthly or at least weekly eto estimations are more accurate than daily ones because of the variability reduction derived from using averaged values see e g martí et al 2015 but this is not automatically translated into more accurate equivalent daily estimations irrigation scheduling requires the definition of daily doses therefore models relying on daily patterns are suitable the limitation of difficulties derived from this approach is that the learning algorithms have to face a higher variability in the patterns 3 the presented modeling techniques could be coupled with climate change scenarios despite it is beyond the scope of the present study in this way the split indicators of the k fold validation might contribute to define where new climatic trends might eventually begin the major point would be how to define the k partitions in order to detect new climate trends this type of studies would necessarily involve wider time periods which should demand larger testing sets in order to computationally afford the calculation times 11 conclusions various temporal data partitioning strategies were evaluated in the present research for estimating daily eto values in arid regions the evaluated strategies consisted of holdout and k fold validation scenarios of temporal data scanning the commonly used two block partitioning strategy with chronologic data selection for training and testing provided the most accurate results among the holdout procedures further focusing on either high or low eto values as training data sets in holdout procedures provided the least accurate results with considerable over underestimations of the eto values this might be anticipated because lower eto values are unlikely predictive of higher eto values and vice versa since the work dealt with time series analysis of the meteorological variables using 10 years daily data from the studied sites analysis of the models results on the basis of hold out approaches can be biased or partially valid depending on selection of the test data from the time series hence if the test patterns picked up from the first middle or the last parts of the time series of input target parameters depending on the general trend of the used meteorological variables during the study period different results and model selection conditions would be achieved nevertheless even if the assessment of the models based on hold out strategies gave acceptable results in the presented research they might fail to give a thorough judgment about the models under other time series conditions where the utilized input target parameters show a clear severe ascending descending trend seasonality which can cause over fitting by the applied models also considering monthly patterns as minimum affordable test size produced higher error magnitudes among k fold validation strategies considering the complete patterns of one growing season as test data set always provided more accurate and stable results among others credit authorship contribution statement mohammad hossein kazemi investigation validation jalal shiri conceptualization methodology formal analysis pau marti
